Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (10:01):  Today I present the 23rd report of the Petitions Committee for the 45th Parliament, together with 31 petitions and 57 ministerial responses to petitions previously presented. 


I'd like to draw to the attention of the House a correction to the signature count for a petition tabled by the member for Watson on 27 March 2018. The petition, lodged by Sister Susan Connelly, concerned the maritime boundary between Australia and Timor-Leste. The correct number of signatures obtained for the paper petition is 16,522 signatures. This petition was presented alongside an e-petition in identical terms with 369 signatures. We regret that this administrative error occurred and convey our sincere apologies to both Sister Connelly and the member for Watson. On behalf of the Petitions Committee, I congratulate Sister Connelly for her efforts in petitioning the House on a cause dear to her and to the thousands of people who signed her petition. 


Indeed, these petitions, along with the petitions I present to the House today, assure us of the continuing relevance and importance of the petitioning process in the House of Representatives. The group of petitions I present today includes a number of e-petitions that have each obtained thousands of signatures. One of these is an e-petition requesting the removal of GST from women's sanitary products, which obtained 104,185 signatures. The committee has now certified over 300 electronic petitions and over 230 paper petitions during the 45th Parliament. On behalf of the committee, I thank the individuals who petitioned the House on issues that matter to them, and the individuals who took the time to sign those petitions.


Thank you. The committee looks forward to presenting its report into e-petitioning in the coming weeks and continuing to update the House on the work of the Petitions Committee.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (10:04):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill amends the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 to insert a new section 16A which states that:


A livestock export licence is subject to a condition:


that livestock that are sheep or lambs must not be exported from Australia, by ship, to:


A place in the Persian Gulf or the Red Sea—or any other place if the route is through the Persian Gulf or Red Sea


in a July, August or September, in the transitional period, or at any time after the end of that period, if the duration of that voyage is 10 days or more.


The transition period is five years.


From a childhood in the deserts of the United Arab Emirates to an early life as a mustering pilot then worker in the shearing sheds of western Queensland, 17 years as a sheep farmer myself and a representative of sheep and wool producers for my entire time in parliament, I have spent more than half my life close to Australia's rural and pastoral industries.


I know all the arguments that are used to support the live sheep trade because I ran them myself for 15 years.


Recently I found cause to look at the industry with fresh eyes. I have been shocked, angered, bewildered and disappointed.


I have researched the science, the facts, the economics and the opinions. I have not allowed emotions to overcome reason.


The case for continuing long-haul live sheep exports fails on both economic and animal welfare grounds.


Only six per cent of our sheep and lamb offtake are exported live.


Most of these are sourced in Western Australia, and I acknowledge that some farmers in this state will be affected and will move to alternative markets and/or production models.


We export sheep and lamb to 100 countries.


In WA the mutton price is 20 times greater than it was 20 years ago. Processing has built these markets.


We can identify and fast-track new development in WA abattoirs and create more jobs and greater value-adding.


If we set a five-year end date, investors can have the certainty and confidence to build new processing capacity.


The live sheep trade is in terminal decline, dropping by two-thirds in the last five years.


It is based on just two customers in two countries, Kuwait and Qatar who account for 70 per cent of exported sheep.


The demand for live sheep comes from its cheap retail price due to government subsidies, not cultural or refrigeration reasons.


Ninety-nine per cent of consumers in the Gulf have refrigeration.


Every Middle Eastern country accepts Australian halal slaughter.


The subsidies are phasing out. Bahrain ended theirs in 2015 and went from 325,000 live sheep from Australia to zero.


The transition was not to live sheep from another country, but to the same number of carcasses, shipped by air, from Australia.


These countries are demanding more and more fresh bagged lamb and mutton; value-added in Australia and flown over in Middle Eastern airlines, growing from 260,000 head in 2004 to 2.7 million head in 2016.


Our live sheep are discharged into a feedlot, slaughtered and end up under cellophane in a refrigerated shopping mall, next to the chilled product air-freighted from Australia 24 hours earlier.


The litany of animal cruelty in the live sheep trade makes a mockery of the industry's 'No fear, no pain' mantra.


If the rules were actually enforced—access to feed, water and rest, avoiding high heat stress, no commercial operator would undertake the trade.


Exporters have explained to me that it would not be viable. Unfortunately this is an industry with an operating model built on animal suffering.


As live export vet Lynn Simpson remarked:


I watched animals suffer and die for 57 voyages. The spectrum of their suffering differed but the true death count has never been declared. It will likely never see the light of day. Like so many animals who died below the water line on a ship in the middle of the ocean.


I applaud the agriculture minister's strong response to recent footage but I'm not confident that the McCarthy review recommendations will go far enough.


A 60-kilo sheep will be allocated extra space equivalent to just under two A4 pieces of paper.


We're told we need more research on an already questionable heat-stress model to work out where to draw the line. Perhaps we should accept the existing, overwhelming evidence of poor animal welfare associated with these voyages.


It is farmers who have been deceived by an export industry that has for 33 years and countless second chances been very good at talking the talk and downright culpable when it comes to walking the walk.


Exporters do not comply with the rules. Much of the live export chain lies outside Australia's legal jurisdiction in international waters and overseas countries.


As one WA consultant to the trade told me, regulations written on paper in Australia cease to mean anything once the ship departs.


In the modern world ethics and sustainability in the production of food and fibre are vital. Sanctioning further voyages on these ships of shame, particularly into a Middle Eastern summer, damages our brand.


Australians will no longer accept rural export industries with animal welfare practices that are inferior to those our farmers willingly comply with every day.


Nor will they understand the logic of putting our clean green sheep meat industry at risk for a sector that is one-tenth the size, in decline and actually competes with our domestic production.


Parliamentarians are certainly noting high levels of community outrage, and I give the last word to Mrs Shirley Dale from rural NSW who wrote to me saying:


""I am 82 years and in this the last chapter of my life I did not think I would be so moved to want to stand up for any causes—but the plight of these suffering animals cannot be ignored.


This is not an issue of economics—it is so much greater than that. It is a test of our humanity—as individuals and as a nation.""


I will give the rest of my allotted time to my excellent seconder, the member for Corangamite.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,4,1,speech
"Henderson, Sarah, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (10:11):  It is my pleasure to second the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018, which has been introduced by the member for Farrer. I also want to acknowledge the support of the member for La Trobe. I congratulate the member for Farrer on the stand she has taken, which takes courage, and I'm proud to join with her in our proposal to end the export of live sheep to the Middle East.


It is significant that we both, as Liberal members of parliament representing large regional electorates including many farmers and agribusinesses, have taken this stand. Overwhelmingly, the people of Corangamite are saying, 'Enough is enough.' After decades of noncompliance, after decades of inhumane treatment of sheep, after decades of tolerating a trade which continues to tarnish our international reputation, Australians are saying, 'Enough is enough'. The scenes on the Awassi Express, where more than 2,000 sheep died—many literally cooking to death—were utterly horrific. The government response has been swift and strong, and I commend the agriculture minister on his efforts to fix this trade and hold rogue exporters to account, but we need to do more. The bill proposes an end to long-haul live sheep exports only—not cattle or short-haul exports—over five years. This is a measured and responsible lead time, in stark contrast to Labor's overnight shutdown of the cattle trade, which had dramatic consequences.


The interests of farmers and rural communities on this issue are paramount. If the bill is passed, it will provide our farmers, processors and the extended supply chain with the appropriate time to transition completely to chilled lamb and mutton exports to the Middle East, to grow our sheepmeat processing capacity, to invest with certainty, to protect and enhance our reputation as a nation of agricultural excellence and to invest in more Australian jobs. There must be proper consultation with farmers and industry. This transition is, in fact, already underway. Where the live sheep trade is in rapid decline, we are seeing a dramatic increase in the export of Australian chilled lamb and mutton by air to the Middle East. This can, of course, only continue. Western Australia has the processing facilities to make this transition. The challenge is in securing and training the workforce, and that's where governments can play a major role.


The bill also proposes that from 2019 there will be no export of live sheep to the Middle East during the hottest summer months: July, August and September. The highly credible scientific evidence from the Australian Veterinary Association is that sheep deaths and heat stress cannot be avoided during the extreme temperatures and humidity of a Middle Eastern summer, even with improved ventilation and lower stocking rates. It is incredibly disappointing that the McCarthy review has not followed the science and recommended the prohibition of live sheep export during the summer. If any person in Australia crammed sheep into a transport vehicle to stand in their own excrement for 25 days in the searing heat with limited access to food and water, that person would be charged with animal cruelty. The time has come. Backed by the science, the facts and the economics, this is a trade which must come to an end. I commend this bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-05-21,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:15):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Whether we like it or not, technology is fundamentally reshaping the nature of work. Our fingertips have never been so powerful. It's never been easier to get food delivered to your door and to find people on the internet to do the jobs that people don't have the time, the patience or the expertise to do.


And the combination of technology and neo-liberalism, or trickle-down economics, is extraordinarily powerful because, left unregulated, technological advancements can enhance and intensify the worst aspects of a market economy.


If we don't change the rules, if we don't update them, every advancement made in the name of convenience could be a setback for decent pay and conditions for those who help make our lives more convenient.


Because this technology that is enabling the new economy has no regard for minimum standards and practices, without new laws we may end up with 21st-century technology but 19th-century work practices. A fundamental Greens principle is that all workers are entitled to have a fair and equitable industrial relations system and receive fair and equitable remuneration for their work. It's not our job in here to hold back technological advancements but it is our job to make sure that society keeps up and that the new economy doesn't come at the cost of being able to live a good life, of which decent wages and conditions are a core part.


That's why today I'm introducing the Fair Work Amendment (Making Australia More Equal) Bill 2018, a bill that will give the Fair Work Commission the power to extend provisions of the Fair Work Act, or awards or enterprise agreements, to gig economy workers and others in non-standard forms of work.


Currently, many workers in the gig economy or non-standard work are engaged as independent contractors, which means they're not given the rights of employees under the Fair Work Act 2009. Workers may also be engaged through intermediary companies or agencies, meaning they are not treated as employees of the corporation they're effectively working for. This gives corporations the power to avoid extending certain rights to workers, including, but not limited to, paying minimum wages, leave entitlements and superannuation as well as protection from laws governing unfair dismissal.


This bill will change the law to introduce a presumption that all workers, however classified, are entitled to at least the same minimum standards as employees. And the Fair Work Commission will be able to issue a minimum entitlements order, which will apply sections of the Fair Work Act or modern award or applicable enterprise agreements to those workers as if they were employees.


A minimum entitlements order under this bill would have the effect of extending minimum pay and conditions to workers, rights which otherwise may not be afforded to them due to the way they have been labelled by the corporation in question. This could apply to workers such as Uber drivers, for example, and will deter corporations from using legal devices such as independent contract arrangements as a way of avoiding minimum pay and condition obligations. Corporations would still be free to use whatever legal arrangement they wish, but they would not be able to use it to undercut the legal minimum that applies to employees. That is why the bill is called the Making Australia More Equal Bill—because we will be saying there will be an equal floor that applies across all workers and that you would not be able to use clever lawyers, or different ways of labelling people, as a way of paying someone less than if they were engaged as an employee. You can still have whatever arrangement you like, but there is now a legal minimum that stops you using cuts to wages and conditions as a way of making profits. Because the truth is, after three decades of Labor and Liberal neo-liberalism, life is getting worse and more insecure for many people in this country. Wage growth is stagnating while company profits are increasing. Penalty rates have been cut, inequality is at a record high, underemployment is rife in the economy, and casualisation is up. Wage theft is commonplace. And while union and union officials are under attack, big corporations are jockeying for billions of dollars in tax cuts. 


This year it was reported that some bicycle deliverers for Uber Eats, Foodora and Deliveroo, who are calling for better conditions and government regulation, are paid as little as $6 an hour—and sometimes it looks like even less than $6 an hour. Thanks to Anna Patty at Fairfax, you can read about people like Matthew, a counselling and psychotherapy student and food delivery driver, who calls the days when he made $14 and hour and $5 for each delivery the 'golden days' because now Matthew is working 25 per cent more for 33 per cent less pay. Anna Patty wrote:


Now riders get as little as $7 a delivery, without any additional hourly payment. And some can wait up to two hours between delivery jobs.


Matthew says:


These guys are making $14, $7 or zero dollars per hour.


No delivery for two hours? Zero dollars an hour in Australia? That is not a sentence that we should have to utter. It's not just Matthew.


The Transport Workers' Union conducted a survey of food delivery riders and found that three in four were paid below the minimum wage. The survey found riders were underpaid; had been injured on the job without insurance, cover or sick pay; and one had worked more than 40 hours a week. And that's not all. On 17 May, four days ago, Anna Patty from Fairfax again reported that Deliveroo was offering $18 million worth of shares to its 2,000 permanent employees globally so that all its employees have skin in the game. The Australian manager said this was exciting for new people coming into the business. But this does not apply to the food delivery drivers because they are not classed as employees. As the manager repeated, those drivers are able to choose themselves when and how they work and, apparently, they value their flexibility. So under the current rules, people like Matthew work 25 per cent more for 33 per cent less pay, Deliveroo's senior executives get a nice little injection into their share portfolio, but we're led to believe that these people, who are crying out for more secure arrangements and decent pay, apparently want it that way—rubbish! 


All of us enjoy the convenience of the new economy but we would hope, when someone delivers food to our door from our favourite restaurant, that the person doing the delivering is getting paid properly and that's what this bill will do; it will allow that to happen. I don't think anyone would quibble with that. But at the moment, because Deliveroo riders are independent contractors with an ABN and, similarly, Uber recently argued successfully to the Fair Work Commission that its drivers are not employees but independent contractors, we are left with a gap in the law. In his ruling on the issue in the Fair Work Commission, Val Gostencnikin the Australian Financial Review said:


Perhaps the law of employment will evolve to catch pace with the evolving nature of the digital economy.


Perhaps the legislature will develop laws to refine traditional notions of employment or broaden protection to participants in the digital economy.


That's exactly what this bill attempts to do; it attempts to provide for that update so that all the people that we see riding around on bikes or motorbikes or cars with big companies' logos on their side can get the minimum wages and conditions that we would all think are fair minimum wages and conditions. We're not even talking in this bill about lifting minimum wages and conditions, even though we desperately need to do that. We're just saying: give the Fair Work Commission the power to extend on a case-by-case basis the minimum protections that apply to employees to all of these other kinds of workers across the board.


I say to everyone who at the moment is in the gig economy, who is busting their gut for no money and no conditions, the legislation to give you minimum wages and entitlements is now sitting before this parliament. The words that will broaden protection for workers in the gig economy are on this piece of paper, in this bill. And the only thing that needs to happen now is for people—on all sides of parliament—to put aside politics and to vote for this important, timely bill.


I would hope it gets the support from members of the government, because they hear from small businesses who say that, because they don't have the resources to enter into clever arrangements, they're getting undercut by the big corporations who use these devices. And I hope it gets support from the opposition, because they have said people need to be looked after and their rights at work protected. So there's no reason that this bill could not proceed through this parliament now.


And, every day, things are becoming more urgent. The gap between the very well off and everyone else is growing, and one of the biggest gaps in this country, the biggest divisions, is between the secure and the insecure. This bill will go a long way to making people's life more secure and to relieving their anxiety. I commend this bill to the House.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (10:37):  I move:


That this House:


(1) acknowledges the role of Government leadership in ensuring the productivity and liveability of Australian cities; and


(2) notes:


(a) the importance of public transport infrastructure in shaping cities and regions;


(b) the record funding commitments for urban public transport infrastructure made under the previous Labor government, including $3.2 billion for the Regional Rail Link project and a further $3 billion committed to the Melbourne Metro rail project (Metro Tunnel);


(c) the recent Infrastructure Australia report Future Cities: Planning for our growing population, which highlights the need for Australian governments to increase investment in public transport in areas experiencing rapid population growth, including in Melbourne's west;


(d) that if an appropriate route is selected, the construction of an airport rail link to Melbourne Airport through Melbourne's west has the potential to create social and economic benefits across the region; and


(e) that further public transport infrastructure projects for fast growing regions like Melbourne's west will be needed in the near future to meet the challenge of population growth.


Australia's major cities are now the engines of the Australian economy. Australia's five largest cities contribute two-thirds of Australia's GDP and, given this, ensuring that our cities remaining productive, livable and free from structural disadvantage should be a core policy priority for all levels of government in this nation. The enormous population growth that has been experienced by our cities in recent decades and its projected continuation into the future raise major challenges for governments in the regard.


Melbourne's west, in my electorate, is on the front line of this challenge. Melbourne's west is booming. Its population is growing at twice the state average. Between the last two censuses we welcomed more than a grand final crowd at the MCG's worth of people to our community. Now, nearly, one-in-five Melburnians call Melbourne's west home. If Melbourne's west continues to grow at this rate, its population will double in just under 20 years. Anyone who lives in Melbourne's west who catches the Sunbury, Williamstown or Werribee lines into the city or who drives a car over the West Gate Bridge to get to work knows that our transport networks are straining under this growth. Traffic congestion could cost our economy up to $20 billion a year in lost time by 2020 if not addressed.


In this high-growth era, the transport infrastructure decisions that governments make or do not make now will shape our cities for decades. The record investments of federal and state Labor governments in public transport in Melbourne's west show this. The previous federal Labor government committed more funding for urban public transport infrastructure than every other government back to Federation combined. These investments shaped our region. The $3.225 billion invested in the Regional Rail Link project separated regional trains from urban commuter trains and increased capacity on urban commuter routes by laying 90 kilometres of new track. New train stations were added by this project to connect new residential communities in Wyndham Vale and Tarneit. We also committed $3 billion for the Melbourne metro rail tunnel, increasing capacity on the Sunbury line by 60 per cent and connecting Melbourne's west to the rail, health, higher education and employment hub at Parkville for the first time.


Investments of this kind stopped in 2013. The Abbott government was open about its contempt for urban public transport infrastructure, going so far as to withdraw the Commonwealth funding for the Melbourne metro rail tunnel that Labor had committed. The Turnbull government is less transparent about its actions and its intents. The Melbourne metro rail link is a case in point. As the state government was already well advanced in planning for the Melbourne airport rail link, the Prime Minister clearly thought that this project might offer him a political fig leaf for his neglect of Victoria on infrastructure investment. I was intrigued by the PM's interest. The Sunshine-Albion corridor route, long investigated by state governments, has the potential to follow the city-shaping legacy of the regional rail link and the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel for my electorate. Melbourne airport has 35 million passengers a year and that is forecast to grow to 60 million passengers by 2033. A Melbourne airport rail link that connects the city to Sunshine and then uses the Albion rail corridor to the airport would allow this area to become a major hub to connect the city and the regional train networks, becoming a major new hub for travellers from Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. Sunshine is an ideal location for a health and education services hub that could bring jobs closer to where people live in Melbourne's west, easing the strain on our transport network and commuters.


When the budget was released, however, the Prime Minister's $5 billion wasn't there. He wants to fund this project off-budget, meaning that our investment banker Prime Minister is expecting to make a financial return for the Commonwealth on this investment. This risks putting competing priorities, like securing private sector contributions, or so-called 'value capture arrangements', above the city-shaping potential of this infrastructure for Melbourne's west. It risks this Prime Minister putting the commercial interests of property developers circling the Maribyrnong defence site above those of regional Victorians wanting fast train connections to the CBD and above those of the residents of Melbourne's west who need an employment and services cluster in their community that would create jobs in their community, not the CBD, easing the transport commuter pressure running through our community.


We need a Prime Minister with the right priorities on urban public transport infrastructure, a Prime Minister whose first priority is everyday Australians trying to get to work, trying to get to school, trying to get to the shops or where they need to go. We need a Prime Minister who will fight for jobs in regional areas in Australia and in the outer suburbs of our CBDs, not the top end of town. We don't need a Prime Minister who's trying to make a deal with the big end of town at the cost of these people. The decision about the route for the Melbourne airport rail link is a decision that will shape Melbourne for decades to come. Given the population growth we're experiencing in Melbourne and Melbourne's west, it is crucial that we get this decision right, and to get it right we need a government with the right priorities.

"Drum, Damian, MP",Nats,2018-05-21,"



Mr DRUM
 (Murray) (10:42):  This bill gives me a great opportunity to speak in relation to infrastructure, certainly in Victoria, but also to the lack of spending on infrastructure in regional Victoria. This bill, this motion, has been worded so heavily towards western Melbourne. It goes to show, again, where everybody's thoughts are in relation to trying to appease the congestion associated with two of our biggest cities in Australia—having 40 per cent of this nation's population existing in Sydney and Melbourne and thinking that the answer to this congestion is to spend more money in the cities, put more lanes on the freeways and put more rail services in place as opposed to investing in the regions as a potential option for population growth.


The previous member spoke about the regional rail project in Victoria. It was a good project, but he forgot to mention that it was built by the coalition government. I know because I was in the coalition government that built it. Don't let the facts get in the way here! The fact is that we were the ones who put six different companies in charge of that project. We built the new rail systems—new rail lines at Wyndham and Tarneit. We built them. I was in the government that built them. So the conversation has to be: 'When that project was first designed by Labor, why did they just put it in the Labor based seats of Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong?' It was a project of $3.5 billion. Why would you exclude northern Victoria? Why would you exclude the Shepparton line? Why would you exclude the Latrobe Valley line? Why would you exclude Wangaratta and Wodonga?


Why would you make those lines continue, every time they hit Melbourne, to have to work their way through the metropolitan sprawl? We all understand what that means: it slows down the lines by about an additional half an hour every time.


These are simply the facts that we have now. We have a two-tier system in Victoria because the Labor Party has put direct lines from Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong straight through to Southern Cross but, if you happen to be coming in from the Latrobe Valley, you'll get stuck behind the metropolitan system. If you're coming in from the north, you'll get stuck behind the metropolitan system. That's simply the way it is.


So we see a huge difference now between the Labor Party and the coalition looking for the answers to livability of our states. Certainly, as our major capital cities of Melbourne and Sydney continue to grow, we have to look elsewhere to try to find the answers for this growth. It's very difficult trying to partner with the Victorian state Labor government at the moment when you consider that they've been in government for 15 of the last 19 years. They own the congestion problems of Melbourne. They own the lack of rail services to most parts of northern Victoria. They own that because they've been in government for 15 of the last 19 years. As we have noticed, we have now announced $5 billion to put the airport rail link in place. I understand that this can, in fact, be done for about that amount of money. Again, we have a Victorian Labor Party, who are on the go-slow with that project.


We have here the member for Gellibrand, who has put this bill forward, suggesting that somehow or other they spent and committed more money when they were in government than is currently being spent. The fact is that from 2007-08 to 2012-13, under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd six years, they spent just over $6 billion per annum in total infrastructure spend. Under this government, from 2013-14 to 2021-22, the average infrastructure spend will be over $8 billion. Since 2012-13, the Australian government has provided $24.7 billion in grants to state governments to support major infrastructure. So, every way you look at it, this government has invested in infrastructure. We need it to be done in an equitable fashion, and we need to look after regional Victoria.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Murray and remind him it's a motion, not a bill, that's before the House.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (10:47):  I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Gellibrand and thank him for bringing on this important issue. I'd just note, after listening to the member for Murray, that there was a little bit of confusion there about infrastructure spending. The first point would be that he certainly was in a state government while the Regional Rail Link was being built, but he forgot to mention that they failed to order the trains, which set back the Regional Rail Link's opening for six months, if I remember correctly. I know that when I got here we were expecting that Regional Rail Link to be opened, and of course it was set back for six months because they failed to deliver the trains.


The member for Murray is also confused about something else: he wants to talk about the national spend from this government on infrastructure, and of course this motion is specifically about the fact that that national spend on infrastructure has sorely missed the very important state of Victoria. We're talking today about the fact that we are in an absolutely critical moment in time around Melbourne's population—around the population of Melbourne's west and around the long-term, dramatic and sustained growth that we've seen in the city of Melbourne, not least in the electorate of Lalor, which encompasses the city of Wyndham, which of course has seen extraordinary growth. This federal budget has again neglected Melbourne and the outer western suburbs on infrastructure investment.


Unlike this government, Labor understands the importance of investment in transport and infrastructure, and our record at both federal and state level reflects this. Under the previous federal Labor government, of course, $3.2 billion was invested in the Regional Rail Link, $3 billion was committed to the Melbourne metro tunnel, and the Princes Highway and East West were funded. However, since this Liberal federal government came to office, a mere 9.7 per cent of the federal infrastructure budget has been allocated to Victoria, even though Victoria comprises 25 per cent of the nation's population.


This lack of investment by the current government is having real effects in my community, which is experiencing population increases of an additional 12,000 residents per year. In Wyndham, we are in desperate need of rail funding. Passenger numbers on the Wyndham line alone are at an 11-year high. Thirteen of the 60 weekday morning train services on the Geelong line to Melbourne's CBD—that is, the regional rail link—reach maximum capacity by the time they reach the Wyndham stations. This congestion is only going to increase. Forward projections demonstrate that Wyndham's population will increase by 74 per cent to reach 435,000 residents by 2036, an increase of 185,000 people in 18 years.


People are using public transport. The regional rail link, funded by the Gillard government, demonstrates the power of investment in this space. With the regional rail link open, the Tarneit station is now the second busiest station to the Southern Cross station on V/Line. We have shown that the people moving into our communities will use public transport when and where it is provided. That is a critical point.


The recent Infrastructure Australia report Future Cities: Planning for our Growing Population demonstrates that we need to be looking holistically at where people live, where jobs are located and the transport networks which connect them. That is why the $5 billion commitment the Prime Minister suggested he was making to Victoria—although we saw in the budget that only $255 million was committed for the next four years—is really critical. The Prime Minister came to Victoria and announced that he was going to partner with the state government to do a $5.1 billion spend on a rail link between the airport and the city. That link needs to go to Sunshine. It needs to go to Sunshine to fit with Victoria's plans for the future. It needs to go to Sunshine so that it links with the regional rail link and opens up the possibility for a 20-minute train trip in the future. It is imperative that it does.


This Prime Minister likes to travel on the regional rail link when he goes down to Geelong to see the member for Corangamite. I would suggest to him that, next time he wants a photo op in Corangamite, he opens his eyes out the window as he travels and sees Melbourne's west growing—because between one month and the next there are thousands of people moving into our area and they need public transport. There are people moving to Ballarat and Bendigo and they need access to the city by public transport as well. There are people moving to Geelong. The whole of the west of Victoria is growing at a rapid rate, and this Prime Minister needs to get serious about supporting infrastructure for us.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (10:52):  I am grateful to the member for Gellibrand for his motion and for giving us the opportunity to talk about the innovative leadership and unprecedented investment the Turnbull government is making in our urban infrastructure. The member for Gellibrand's motion rightly points out that the government has a leadership role to play in ensuring the productivity and livability of Australian cities. He is absolutely right. That's why this government introduced the concept of City Deals to this country and it is why it is rigorously pursuing them from Tasmania to Townsville. These deals are already making a difference to cities all over Australia and their impact will only grow as more come online.


The member for Gellibrand also draws attention to what he calls record funding commitments made by the previous Labor government. But the difference between the Turnbull government's record $75 billion infrastructure investment and the record commitments he refers to is that we can pay for ours. The Turnbull government's investment is fully funded as part of a responsible budget with a robust path back to surplus. The previous Labor government made a lot of so-called record funding commitments. But they also left a lot of record budget black holes. It is hard to imagine how Labor would have paid for public transport infrastructure in Victoria, or anywhere else, when it was short of $57 billion to pay for the NDIS. Sadly, on the evidence of the shadow Treasurer's budget reply, they are still at it. The simple truth is that you can't trust any funding commitment made by this shifty Leader of the Opposition and his Labor colleagues. You couldn't trust their fantasy double accounting then and you can't trust it now.


On the Sunshine Coast we have recently seen what the Turnbull government's genuine leadership on public transport infrastructure can achieve. The Sunshine Coast is a rapidly growing and dynamic region, with more than 200,000 people set to join us in the decades to come. However, when it comes to intercity public transport, we currently rely on a single-track rail line capable of supporting trains travelling at less than 60 kilometres an hour and situated many kilometres inland from our major population centres. Faster and more reliable rail transport between the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane would get more freight trucks and cars off our roads, free up capacity, improve safety on the Bruce Highway and give thousands of commuters more time with their families. In short, it would get commuters home more safely and sooner. That's why it has been one of my top priorities since before my election as the member for Fisher.


The 2018 federal budget included a new commitment of $390 million to duplicate the existing railway line between Beerburrum and Landsborough and to make further improvements up to Nambour. We've been calling for this duplication on the Sunshine Coast for decades. It is long overdue. When completed, it will allow for more regular trains for both passengers and freight and for a far more reliable service. However, the Turnbull government has gone far beyond simply delivering on the infrastructure we need now. The government has shown the leadership the member for Gellibrand looks for in vain from his own party and is planning for the future. In March, we announced that the North Coast Connect high-speed rail project was one of only three in the country selected by the government to receive millions of dollars in federal funding for a detailed business case. By upgrading the existing rail for high-speed trains and building a new line from Beerwah up the coast through Caloundra to Maroochydore, this project would offer travel times of as low as 45 minutes from our region to Brisbane.


The business case is expected to take a little more than a year to produce, and when it is published the project will become a prime candidate for funding under the Turnbull government's $10 billion National Rail Program. While we await publication of the business case, I'll be working hard with my friend the member for Fairfax and all my LNP team Queensland colleagues to lay the groundwork to ensure this project is a priority for federal and state government funding. With city deals being agreed all over the country and with a fully funded and unmatched investment of $75 billion in infrastructure nationwide, truly, no government could be said to have achieved greater leadership in promoting the productivity and livability of cities than the Turnbull government.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (10:57):  I'll start by thanking the member for Gellibrand for putting this motion before the House. It gives an opportunity to a number of members of the House to talk about the critical issue of infrastructure, particularly in Melbourne's south-west and through to Geelong. The livability of Geelong is increasingly becoming one of the most important economic pillars of our region. Our north-facing bay, our raised peninsula and our proximity to the Surf Coast, all within a manageable distance of the Melbourne CBD, make Geelong a fantastic place to live. Thousands of people who currently live in Melbourne are making the decision to live in Geelong while still pursuing their employment in the greater Port Phillip Bay area. But, to make that proposition work, the link—the rail link and the transport links—between Geelong and Melbourne must be first-rate.


I was very pleased to be a part of the former Rudd-Gillard government which put in place the Regional Rail Link, and we were joined earlier by the member for Grayndler, who championed that. It was a $3.2 billion infrastructure development which preceded rather than followed urban development. In terms of the link between Geelong and Melbourne, it has been a game changer that has seen much greater frequency of travel and trains on that route.


In the last few weeks the Andrews state Labor government has put forward $50 million to look at the development of a fast rail link between Geelong and Melbourne. This would be utilising trains which would travel between 250 and 300 kilometres an hour. That would be transformative. It would see a trip from Geelong to Melbourne being done in under 40 minutes—faster, it turns out, than a helicopter. This would be a great moment in the history of Geelong's relationship with Melbourne, and it would be a critical boost to our economic growth.


Last month was a significant moment in the Turnbull government's governing of our nation. In announcing a $5 billion commitment—albeit off the books—to a rail link between the city and Tullamarine, it appeared that for the first time they had discovered that there was human habitation south of the Murray. Up until that point in time, the Turnbull government had committed just nine per cent of Australia's infrastructure funding to the state of Victoria, which was an absolute disgrace.


What is now being proposed is four options for a rail link between the city of Melbourne and Tullamarine. The decision that is made in respect of which of those routes is taken is absolutely critical. There is the very expensive tunnel route, which seems to be preferred by the government, based, it would appear, in part on their desire to have this funding off the budget, meaning they imagine there will be a revenue stream associated with this infrastructure build which will be worth more than the infrastructure build itself. It would seem that profits are driving this decision rather than community infrastructure.


The alternative is the route through Sunshine. The route through Sunshine is a cheaper route but will connect the link between the city and Tullamarine with the existing rail links that are being developed around Victoria, including the Regional Rail Link from Geelong to Melbourne and what in the future would be the fast rail link between Geelong and Melbourne. In other words, if we are to see a fast rail link between Geelong and Melbourne, the Sunshine route must be chosen as the preferred option for the development of the rail link between the city and Tullamarine airport. It will also then enable a much faster link between Geelong and Tullamarine.


There is a clear choice in terms of what is best for Geelong in those routes. The state government have made that choice very clear. They are saying their preferred option is the Sunshine route. Right now, we actually need to see a decision made and a preference expressed by this government. The member for Corangamite, who has just joined us, is a key player in that, as she represents, as a member of the government in this place, the interests of Geelong within the government. It is absolutely critical for the member for Corangamite to make it completely clear that she supports the Sunshine route as distinct from any of the other routes that are possible, because if the member for Corangamite does not make that clear then she will have sold Geelong out, and it's absolutely essential that the Turnbull government make that clear in this build.

"O'Brien, Ted, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (11:02):  I am delighted to stand and speak about this motion today, the threshold theme of which I don't disagree with: the importance of ensuring we have productive and livable cities in Australia. I think both sides of the House certainly share that broader vision. It is extraordinary when you think about how quickly Australia's population is growing and how quickly Australia is ageing. When I first read this motion, it made me think of that Peter Allen song from about 1980, I Still Call Australia Home and those lines—and I'm sure I'll misquote them:


I've been to cities that never close down


From New York to Rio and old London town.


To think that the likes of London at the stage when Peter Allen wrote that song were barely larger than Sydney is today, with over five million people! Australia indeed is growing quickly, with large cities.


Where this motion falls down drastically, though, is the typical politicisation and a baseless argument when it comes to fact, suggesting that the Labor Party actually has a good track record on infrastructure. If you look at the spend, you see that through the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era there was an average of $6 billion a year spent on infrastructure. The coalition government has spent $7.6 billion a year on infrastructure. I understand that those opposite aren't very good at economics. I get that, and I want to cut them some slack, but $7.6 billion is, in fact, more money than $6 billion. There is $1.6 billion more, on average, spent on infrastructure. What is extraordinary about this is I'm comparing this to a Labor era of an absolute spendathon. It was an era where they overreached with their stimulus post-GFC and still they underspent on critical infrastructure for our cities.


In contrast, look at what this government has done and also what it forecasts to do. It has a $75 billion infrastructure plan for the years ahead. This motion was based on Victoria, where $7.8 billion of major projects for Victoria were announced in this year's budget. If you go up towards Queensland, my home state, and you look at the region for the Sunshine Coast, we scored big time in this budget with a trifecta of $800 million for section D on the Bruce Highway, $880 million between Pine Rivers and the Sunshine Coast on the Bruce Highway, and, of course, that beautiful $390 million for the North Coast line for upgrades between Beerburrum and Nambour. That's $2 billion just for the broader region of the Sunshine Coast because the coalition government understands the importance of investing.


There is another point here, and you can see it through the motion. When it comes to ensuring that our cities have the vital infrastructure they need, it isn't just about 'show us the money'. Even though, yes, we have spent more and invested more than Labor, this motion is just another example of a long wish list—show us the money, the money, the money, the money. Such is the complexity around managing the growth of our population, amidst a time when we have a knowledge based economy that is integrated with the global economy, that we can't just throw money at it. That is why we have crafted a Smart Cities Plan. It is one plan that ensures that we have smart investment, smart policy and smart technology. Smart investment prioritises projects, takes long-term investments that also take into account value capture and leverages the strength of the federal balance sheet. Smart policies ensure we have not just three tiers of government working in concert in our major cities—whether they be metro or regional—but also three sectors, being business, government and community. It is through this smart approach that we can continue to be ahead of the curve and invest in infrastructure to ensure population growth does not overtake it.

Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (11:08):  I rise to support the motion put forward by the member for Gellibrand, and I commend him for bringing this motion forward in this place. The motion before us seeks to do two things. It acknowledges the key role of government in ensuring the productivity and liveability not just of our cities but of our regions as well. It notes the need for further investment in rail infrastructure in Melbourne's west, particularly as the proposed airport rail link holds great potential to improve the quality of life for many in the west of Melbourne but also in our regions.


We've heard from the member for Corio about the impact on Geelong. I want to talk about the impact on my electorate of Ballarat. It's really important that our regions aren't forgotten when it comes to infrastructure funding. That's particularly vital as the Victorian and federal governments start work towards the Melbourne airport railway link. Like regional centres all around Australia, residents of Ballarat rely on our transport links with major cities so that we can travel for work, for play and for study. It's these strong transport connections that make our regional centres such a terrific place to live. It is regions like Ballarat where you can enjoy the peace and pace of a regional lifestyle while still enjoying fantastic schools and health services and living a comfortable distance from Melbourne, if you are able to find work there as well. However, if we're able to continue to reduce the commuting distance between cities like mine—that is, Ballarat—we need to keep ahead of the growth. When you consider growth in Melbourne's west in particular, which has been highlighted in the recent infrastructure Australia report Future Cities: planning for our growing population, we see that we are beginning to run out of time.


Projects such as the Regional Rail Link have shown what a committed government can do for regional Australians. The previous Labor government put $3.2 billion into this project, helping untangle the regional trains as they came into Melbourne. Projects like this meant that we could rely on the trains to get us to work and home and improve the commute.


Regional Victorians do need more projects like this. There is an opportunity with the Melbourne Airport link to do more than just connect the CBD to the airport. Through proper planning we can connect the city with the airport, but we can also connect Ballarat and our other regional centres with the airport as well and we can better connect Ballarat with the CBD.


An alignment through Sunshine is certainly my preferred route. It's the preferred route of the Victorian government and, I think, pretty clearly anyone listening to this message will hear it's the preferred route of all of the Labor MPs here who represent those areas. The alignment through Sunshine will allow the new tracks to take strain off the existing western suburbs train network, already struggling to meet demand, and this will result in a superior service for residents in and through Melbourne's west and for those further beyond along the Ballarat line who come through that way. Commuters boarding trains in Wendouree, Ballarat, Ballan, Bacchus Marsh and, hopefully, eventually a new station at Warrenheip, will be able to reach their workplaces in Melbourne with far greater ease. Similarly, residents from the regions will also be able to change at Sunshine for airport services, better linking these towns with the nation's wider economy. That's a route in itself. Mostly now people have to either drive or catch the terrific shuttle bus service, but it takes between two and 2½ hours just to get to the airport, where a train service would be a much shorter and much easier commute for people to get out to the airport. The traffic congestion around Melbourne Airport is increasingly difficult for many of us to navigate, let alone the cost of long-term parking of cars at Melbourne airport. A train service would be hugely beneficial to the economy of my region.


It's not often that such a possibility arises from a single rail project, and, when it does, government needs to act to make the most of it. Sadly, unfortunately, this government, despite what it has said in many press releases, has not actually acted. In the days before the budget the government told the Victorian media it would invest $5 billion in the rail line to the airport, and the first the Victorian state government heard about it was through a letter from the Prime Minister's office that had arrived only after the plan had already been released to the media, so it didn't actually talk to the Victorian government about the preferred route. But what the budget papers clearly show is that this looks like it's going to be an equity contribution, which, frankly, is not going to stack up with this project. We know that public transport projects don't usually make money. Neither the cost of the construction nor the capital investment can be covered by operating revenue, and, frankly, I think the way in which the government has gone about putting this so-called project together has been selling the Victorian people short.


I want to reiterate my support for the Sunshine connection to the airport link, but we do actually need to see the money for this project.

"Falinski, Jason, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (11:13):  When I first saw this motion on the Notice Paper, I thought it might be that the Labor Party was coming in here to apologise for all their failures in infrastructure throughout Australia. After all, what the Labor Party could tell us about infrastructure the Babylonians could tell us about proper treatment of the Cretans. I come from a part of Sydney that has three out of the 10 most congested roads in Australia and the state Labor opposition has decided even before the project has begun that they will cancel the first piece of proper road infrastructure in my part of the area before it has even started. What do Luke Foley and the New South Wales Labor opposition have to say about the road tunnel Beaches Link? They call it a vanity project because that's what they think about infrastructure in New South Wales. They're so sick and tired of cancelling their own projects that they've started cancelling our projects instead.


This is a party that is wedded to cancellations. When you think about the previous state government in New South Wales, all you can think of is a history of incompetence, ineptitude and cancellations of infrastructure from one end of the state to the other. The one piece of infrastructure that they deigned to build was the Macquarie Park railway, which was a contract signed by the previous Fahey government. But they couldn't leave that alone; they decided to halve the length and double the cost of it. I mean, this is a party that cannot deliver on anything. The New South Wales Labor Party under Bob Carr, Morris Iemma, Kristina Keneally and, of course, Nathan Rees—let's not forget him—announced 28 infrastructure projects, but cancelled 32. In fact, they were so keen to cancel projects that sometimes they didn't have time to actually announce them.


What was Bob Carr's answer to all of this? 'Sydney's full. Everyone leave Sydney, because we can't be bothered actually building, much less funding, an infrastructure project in Sydney.' They cannot bring themselves to actually make the lives of people in cities better off. But there are some pieces of infrastructure that they'll build. They were very keen on starting coalmines in New South Wales as long as you happened to be a member of the New South Wales cabinet or a friend of someone in the New South Wales cabinet. This is the state branch that spawned Bob Carr, Mark Latham, Ian Macdonald, Joe Tripodi, Eddie Obeid, yet they have the gall to come in here and lecture Australia about how they need better infrastructure.


Compare that to the New South Wales state government at the moment. It's delivering $77 billion worth of state transport infrastructure, and has plans to deliver another $111 billion over the next four years. This includes Sydney Metro Northwest, which will be extended underneath the harbour all the way to Bankstown, which will move 45,000 people an hour on driverless, state-of-the-art trains run by the same company that runs the train system in Hong Kong, compared to what Sydney Trains currently does, which is 25,000 people an hour. They're building NorthConnex, a piece of infrastructure that was first planned for Sydney in the 1950s. They're building WestConnex, another piece of infrastructure that was first planned in the 1950s, but never, not once, did the state Labor Party in New South Wales get anywhere close to doing it. Beaches Link—which is now being planned for the Northern Beaches to alleviate the pain and suffering of tens of thousands of families on the Northern Beaches, families that Luke Foley and the New South Wales Labor Party don't care about—was initially planned in the 1950s, and what did Labor do? I'll tell what they did. Neville Wran sold off the road corridors so that it couldn't be built, and now it has to go underground.


When you think at a national level about what Labor delivered in terms of transport infrastructure, you think of pink batts and school halls. A lot of good that did to alleviate the suffering of people who could not get home to see their families and who could not get to work on time and the stress and anxiety that the congestion in our major cities is causing. And what's Mark Latham's answer? Mark Latham says we should tell foreigners to go away. He has no answer in terms of how to alleviate the problem of people who are actually living in our cities right now. The New South Wales Liberal Party is doing it and so are we at a federal level. We are investing a record $75 billion from 2019 to 2027 in air, rail and other transport infrastructure to improve the lives of all Australians.

Mr RICK WILSON
 (O'Connor) (12:01):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Water Resources, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled APVMA regulatory reforms: inquiry based on the Auditor-General report no. 56 (2016-17)—Pesticide and veterinary medicine regulatory reform, together with the minutes of proceedings.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr RICK WILSON:
  by leave—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Water Resources, I present the committee's report, as previously stated.


Australia's agricultural chemicals and veterinary medicines industry is vitally important to farmers, ag-vet producers and to the wider Australian public.


A well-regulated industry requires a strong regulator.


It is of paramount importance that ag-vet chemicals are adequately regulated to ensure that they are safe and effective.


The committee was concerned by evidence presented both in the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) report and by submitters and by witnesses to this inquiry which suggests that the APVMA has struggled to fully implement the 2014 legislative reforms.


The 2014 reforms were intended to increase the APVMA's efficiency and to reduce the regulatory burden on industry. However, evidence received during this inquiry suggests that those reforms to date have been minimal at best.


The committee heard concerns from industry that the registration process, particularly for new products, is fraught with delays, inconsistencies and a lack of transparency.


The committee heard from ag-vet manufacturers whose products, which were often quickly registered overseas, often met with extensive delays here in Australia.


That said, the committee was pleased to hear that the APVMA has made some progress in using international evidence as part of its assessment process.


However, it is apparent much more work needs to be done in this regard.


Furthermore, stakeholders noted that an increased use of electronic systems would assist in reducing the burden on ag-vet producers.


Several witnesses also pointed out that the registration framework is too inflexible, meaning that low-risk products, like a dog shampoo, and a more serious medication were subject to the same level of assessment.


The committee's report makes four recommendations based on the evidence we have received.


Firstly, the committee recommends that the Auditor-General undertake a further audit of the APVMA in 2019, to assess the APVMA's ongoing implementation of regulatory reforms and its management of the relocation program.


We note that the APVMA has made progress since the time of this audit and in particular has implemented some stronger governance practices.


However, the committee believes that the role of the APVMA is so important that a follow-up audit would be recommended to ensure that the APVMA continues to fully implement its reforms.


Recommendation 2 relates to the establishment of a board of directors for the APVMA.


The committee notes that the government is moving on this front, and supports this.


The committee recommends that if a board is to be established the minister for agriculture should be consulted in relation to the appointment of members to provide additional oversight and further links between the minister and the APVMA.


Recommendation 3: the committee received evidence, from both the APVMA and from industry, suggesting that the authority's current funding model may no longer be appropriate.


The APVMA is almost entirely funded through cost-recovery mechanisms, and for the last three years has run at a $3.5 million annual operational loss.


The committee agrees with Dr Chris Parker, Chief Executive Officer of the APVMA, that this is 'unsustainable'.


We therefore recommend that the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources actively consider different funding models for the APVMA to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities in a timely manner.


The committee's final recommendation is that the APVMA provides to the committee by the first quarter of the 2018-19 financial year the results of the staff survey undertaken in early 2018 and the APVMA's consequential action plan, and updated risk assessment matrix relating to its relocation to Armidale.


The APVMA acknowledges that its relocation will present risks to its ongoing operational efficiency. The committee is therefore interested in ensuring that these risks are accurately identified and managed.


On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all who have contributed to this inquiry by providing submissions or appearing at hearings.


I would specifically like to thank committee secretary Melanie Brocklehurst, inquiry secretary Joel Bateman and the secretariat staff for their hard work in preparing this important report to the parliament that I table in the House today.


I commend the report to the House.

The inquiry was primarily about the APVMA's progress in implementing the reforms, which began under a former Labor government. The ANAO, importantly, described the implementation performance as 'mixed', but it was always going to be impossible to look at that progress through anything but the lens of the forced relocation of the regulator from Canberra to Armidale, which has severely damaged the authority's capacity to do its important work. I won't dwell on the many adverse effects of that relocation here. Suffice it to say that the mass exodus of staff has caused the authority to struggle at every level of its performance measure. The key point, with respect to this inquiry, is that the ANAO found, for example, 'the absence of a robust set of performance measures'. You can fairly, I think, sheet home the failure to implement those robust performance measures to the distraction which has been caused by the relocation of the authority. When staff are distracted by such massive upheaval—and it is massive—one can't expect progress in implementing reform to be what we might expect as a parliament.


The work of the authority is critical for our farmers, consumers and exporters alike. It plays a critical role in farm productivity, the delivery of the latest drugs to farm stock and companion animals alike, keeping us as consumers safe from chemical and other residues, and, of course, helping us access and maintain export markets. It is not an entity for pork-barrelling and political gamesmanship or opportunity. It has a very important role to play.


Since the government's announcement that it would relocate the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, the entity has performed badly against legislated time frames for the approval and registration of agvet chemicals, particularly with respect to new products, when timeliness in the delivery of those products to the farm sector is absolutely critical. I fear that some of the manufacturers are simply going to walk away from the Australian market because this government is making it all too hard. Forget the claims that performance has begun to recover again. It's all lies, damned lies and statistics. It's all based on a lower number of applications and priority being given by direction to the less complex cases, which of course can be moved through the authority at a much quicker pace.


I was astounded by the testimony of the CEO of the APVMA, the member for New England's hand-picked boss. Asked about the falling performance at every level of the APVMA since the announcement of the forced relocation, he managed to speak for no less than five minutes in explanation of that decline in performance without once mentioning the elephant in the room, the relocation of the APVMA. He did himself no service in doing that before a serious committee, and he should reflect on his performance at that committee.


Labor member's agree with most of the committee's recommendations. However, they can only help make a very bad situation just a little better. But we do not agree with the associated comments from the majority of the committee contained in the report and, of course, we lament the fact that greater concentration hasn't been given to the impact of the relocation on the progress of those ag-vet reforms. We certainly don't agree that we need a board of directors, further adding to the regulatory burden for manufacturers who pay to have their products registered. As the chair said, the APVMA is a full cost recovery agency. The manufacturers of the products pay—the taxpayer does not pay—and they do not want a board of directors. If there is to be a board of directors, they certainly don't want to pay for it, which is the intention of this government—an additional $600,000 to $700,000 every year for the privilege of having another level of regulatory burden around the APVMA. I note that despite the fact that the implementation of that advisory board requires legislation in this place, amendments already proposed by the government, the government has already booked the revenue in its budget papers before this parliament has made a decision about the proposed amendments.


The industry will pay. At the same time, the member for New England, with the total approval and applause of the Prime Minister, is spending $28 million or thereabouts moving the agency to Armidale in his own electorate. He is unnecessarily spending $28 million of taxpayers' money just to give effect to disruption. And now he will spend millions more on a so-called digital strategy so that he can pretend people aren't moving to Armidale but will still be working here in Canberra. It is a farce. This government is taking the taxpayer for a ride. It's doing great damage among the professional and dedicated staff at the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. It's a great shame that all of those people, who have dedicated their working lives to this cause, are now being asked to uproot their families from schools and workplaces to move to far-flung Armidale. That, more than anything else, explains why the APVMA has not been able to implement these ag-vet chemicals reforms as quickly as we would like.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (12:29):  We on this side of the House support the appropriation bills in the same way that convention has dictated for nearly 40 years, now. Similarly, and consistent with the convention for these bills, we support the appropriations, but we take this opportunity to point out where we diverge substantially from the path that the government has taken us down with this budget.


It's very clear that those opposite are desperate for the Australian people to forget the cuts and the chaos of the last five years and the four budgets preceding this one. Having spent much of the last week on the central coast of New South Wales; in suburban Melbourne; in Sydney; and in my own community, including with the Leader of the Opposition and our candidate for Forde, Des Hardman, at Logan Hospital; I can assure those opposite that however they might kid themselves that the Australian people have somehow forgotten all of the cuts and chaos which began with that horror budget in 2014—whatever initiatives they come up with in a make-or-break election budget—they have another thing coming. This budget doesn't pass the fairness test. It's like all the other budgets from those opposite in that it fails the fairness test, because it puts big business ahead of battlers in this country. But the budget also fails the responsibility test. We have in this country record and growing debt, despite billions of dollars in new receipts—new taxes and charges—rolling through the door. We have record debt, twice what the government inherited in net debt from Labor, and gross debt that is over a trillion dollars for the first time in our history, despite all that new revenue, despite all these rosy forecasts around wages and despite the temporary spike in revenue which is being delivered to us by the upswing in the global economy.


What those opposite don't really understand when it comes to fairness and responsibility is that no budget which takes money from pensioners and gives it to the big four banks can be considered to be a fair one. No budget which collects an extra $40 billion in charges but still has debt twice what was inherited, including half a trillion dollars in gross debt, can be considered a responsible budget delivered by a responsible government. This budget was designed to be an election budget, and we're very happy. In fact, we on this side of the chamber welcome the opportunity to fight an election not just on the measures contained in this budget but on the dodgy values which underpin what has been proposed by those opposite.


Australians rejected the last four budgets, and I'm confident that they'll reject this one too. They will reject the cuts to hospitals, schools and TAFEs. They'll reject a budget which has a tax on pensioners, including taking away the energy supplement. They'll reject a budget which has record debt despite positive global conditions. They'll reject the budget of those opposite, because it still has these big tax concessions going to those who need them least, and they will still have this big $80 billion plus commitment to give handouts to big foreign multinationals and the big four banks.


But I think Australians will reject this budget and, ultimately, this government because the budget handed down two Tuesdays ago also could not be more out of whack with the nation's priorities. It bears absolutely no resemblance to the nation's values, the values of the people who make this nation strong. That's why I'm confident that Australians will reject what is being proposed by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. The defining difference in that budget was on tax. The government itself considers tax to be the centrepiece of the budget, and we do too. I think tax really is where the budget battle is joined, because tax is a really clear demonstration in budgets of the competing values of those opposite versus the values that we share with the majority of the Australian people.


What the government are proposing to do with their new income tax cuts is asking the Australian people to vote for tax cuts seven years down the track, after two more elections—tax cuts which overwhelmingly favour the wealthiest in our community. The ANU, NATSEM, the Grattan Institute and others have pointed out over and over again that those tax cuts are deliberately designed to deliver the biggest gains to people who need them least in our community. Obviously we take a dim view of tax cuts seven years down the track when we don't know what the economy will look like and we don't know what the budget will look like, and where those tax cuts will overwhelmingly favour the top end of town. We take a dim view of that.


We also think that the government are in real danger of repeating the mistakes made in the Howard-Costello period when big income tax cuts were built on the back of a temporary spike in revenue. One of the reasons we had 10 years of difficulty with the budget is that we had a structural problem in the budget. In the latter years of Howard and Costello, they gave big tax cuts assuming that the good times with the budget would roll on forever, and of course they didn't with the intervention of the global crisis and other things as well.


So we've seen this movie before and we didn't like how it ended. We don't want to see a sequel of big tax cuts to the top end of town being paid for by a temporary spike in revenue when we don't know how enduring that temporary spike may be. I think it says everything about the approach taken by those opposite. We have said on this side, 'If you split the bills, the income tax legislation, we are prepared to vote for the 1 July tax changes straightaway. If you split out the tax relief for the low- and middle-income earners from the tax relief for the top end of town, we'll pass the 1 July changes immediately.' We've said that repeatedly. The fact that the government are prepared to hold low-income earners hostage to the political games they want to play in here with their trickle-down economics speaks volumes about their real commitment to the workers of this country—people who work and struggle for a living and need and deserve some tax relief. Of course, they won't tell us how much each stage of the tax plan costs. They're asking us to vote for tax cuts seven years down the track—cuts which favour the top end of town—and they won't tell us what each stage of their tax plan costs.


What really rubs salt in the wound for a lot of working people in this country is that the government have taken this approach to their tax cuts at the same time as they are proposing an $80 billion tax cut for multinationals and the big banks. Again, $80 billion is an estimate. We think it might be more than that. We've asked the Treasurer and the Prime Minister in this place, from the dispatch box, repeatedly, 'How much does the company tax cut cost the Australian people? and they've been unwilling or unable to tell us how much that costs. That really rubs salt in the wound for a lot of working people. They know that there's a big tax cut being delivered to those who need it least at the same time as those opposite are holding them hostage to political games here and in the Senate. Of the $80 billion or so, it's estimated that something like $17 billion will go to just four companies in this country, the four big banks. When you consider the revelations about the rorts and rip-offs that are coming out of the royal commission, the idea that the Turnbull government want to give a $17 billion tax cut to those four big banks really beggars belief. It says it all, really, about the warped priorities of those opposite. The member for Barton and all of us on this side of the House want to see the victims of the rorts and rip-offs compensated. Bizarrely, those opposite want to see the perpetrators compensated for the dodgy behaviour being uncovered in the royal commission.


With them at every step of the way is the One Nation party, who have indicated that they will vote for a big tax cut for foreign multinationals and the big banks at the same time as our friends in the Greens have said that they won't support tax relief for low- and middle-income earners. What that tells us is that, right around the country, if the people of Australia, the workers of Australia, want their interests served by this parliament, they are going to need a Labor government, not One Nation or the Greens. Only Labor have the interests of working people at heart. That's where our bigger, fairer tax cut for 10 million Australian workers really comes from: our belief that the first port of call when it comes to tax relief should be the people who work and struggle in this country—the people on low- and middle-incomes. They should be the first port of all. That's why we've devoted a substantial amount of money to proper tax relief for 10 million Australian workers.


That's not our only alternative tax policy. We've also got the Australian investment guarantee, which doesn't spray $80 billion around overseas which goes to executive pay, share buybacks and puffed up dividends. Our tax plan for business ensures that the investment onshore, and that's obviously good for jobs and investment here in this country obviously.


So our tax reform plan has a bigger, fairer tax cut for 10 million workers, an Australian investment guarantee to ensure that companies invest onshore and we don't see the benefits flow overseas and, of course, the closing down of a lot of the loopholes which are costing the budget billions of dollars and flowing overwhelmingly to those who need them least. So we've got a substantial tax reform plan.


Our tax reform plan is really how we fund that which we truly value as a society. By making these difficult decisions elsewhere in the budget, we can give that tax relief for working people. We can restore cuts to hospitals. We can found MRIs in places right around Australia so that people can get the scans that they need to get their treatment on track. We can restore the cuts to schools. We can invest in TAFEs after years of the hollowing out of TAFEs and apprenticeships. We can get the VET system back on track as well.


This budget was framed in the best global economic conditions for a decade. A hundred and twenty economies were growing around the world. The IMF and others, including our own Reserve Bank, were pointing to the fact that the global economy really was in remarkable nick compared to where it was over the last little while. Because of that, the Treasurer had $40 billion of extra taxes and charges show up on his doorstep. He would like credit for that, but I don't think he can take credit for growth in 120 economies around the world. All of this extra money has just shown up. It's been a long time since we've had these sorts of revenue upgrades. But still, despite that, we've got those cuts to hospitals, schools and TAFEs. We've still got record debt. We've still got a deficit this year which is more than six times bigger than it was in Joe Hockey's budget in 2014. We've still got a tiny surplus in 2019-20 which relies on one thing only, and that's the bringing forward of tobacco tax. We've still got all of these things going on. The budget is not in the condition it should be in when you consider these global economic conditions. And why is that? It is because we've got these big tax concessions which are eating up and a bigger and bigger share of the budget and going to those who need them least, and we've got a government which proposes to shovel another $80 billion in the direction of multinationals and the big banks.


On this side of the House we take our responsibilities as the alternative government very seriously. We don't just point out the substantial and obvious flaws in the budget of those opposite. We propose an alternative. We put forwarded costed alternatives. We take courageous decisions in tax. We set out what we'll do if the Australian people hand us the keys to the government. We will be fairer than those opposite—that's not hard—but we'll be more responsible as well. We will make room for different choices. We will put the budget on a more sustainable footing. As Chris Bowen, the shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, said last week at the National Press Club, we've got a set of fiscal objective and fiscal principles which indicate to the Australian people just how responsible we are prepared to be with their money, whether it be tax reform or the paying down of debt right across the budget. We take our responsibilities very seriously. We do want to make room not just for our priorities as a Labor Party and as a Labor government; more importantly than that, we want to make room for the nation's priorities, which are to give ourselves the best chance to properly care after our sick, our frail and our aged; to give this country a proper opportunity to educate our young people; and to make sure that our taxes are as fair as possible.


Instead of this warped version of trickle-down economics that we've had for five budgets now in five years, we can satisfy the three objectives that really matter when it comes to managing the economy: economic growth which is inclusive, work that is rewarded and a decent social safety net for those left behind or those at risk of being left behind. That's how we realign economic policy in this country with the values and aspirations of the people. That's how we exercise power on their behalf and not on behalf of the millionaires and multinationals which those opposite prioritise again and again and again in their budgets.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Personnel, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Deputy Leader of the House) (12:44):  I rise to make some comments in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and highlight that the budget released only a matter of weeks ago provides this government's positive plans for the future. It gives a clear choice as well between our approach of investing in small and medium-sized businesses, investing in jobs for the future and relieving some of the tax burden on Australians, and the Australian Labor Party's approach, which is to tax people higher and put a handbrake on the economy.


This is our plan. It's our plan for the future, and it also provides a great level of investment in the regions. In the budget, we outlined how we would encourage hardworking Australians and reward them through tax relief; how we'd work with the business community to help them to invest and create more jobs, providing that certainty and confidence they need; how we'd also guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on, particularly in health and education; how we'd keep Australians safe with our strong border protection policies and defence policies; and how we'd ensure that the government continues to live within its means.


In Gippsland, I must say the budget has been well received—in particular the welcome announcement of $132 million for the final stage of the Princes Highway duplication project. This is a project that has enjoyed bipartisan support over many years now at both state and federal level, and I'm appealing to the Victorian state government to continue that level of bipartisan support by finding its 20 per cent of the final funding which will be required to finish the job. There's $132 million now on the table from the Commonwealth and $33 million required from the state government to finalise this project. I must say the state government would have to be bonkers not to stump up $33 million to finish the work. We're all committed to having a better and safer Princes Highway, and it's been one of those great projects which have seen local jobs created—so a benefit there—and have seen benefits from improving road safety and reducing road trauma, a strong benefit in the community, but also a longer term benefit of improving productivity, allowing us to get our products to market more readily, and obviously the longer term safety implications for the people of Gippsland—but not only the people of Gippsland but also the people who choose to travel to our region. We're passionate about increasing our visitor economy in Gippsland, and the more work we can do to improve our road and rail connectivity the more likely it is that we'll see jobs flow through the tourism sector.


The budget also included an important program, the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative. As a former minister in the Infrastructure and Transport portfolio, I was working with my department and state governments on such a program, and I want to congratulate the current minister for delivering on that promise. It will complement the existing programs around Roads to Recovery, the road Black Spot Program and the Bridges Renewal Program, along with the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. All those programs provide opportunities for investment in better and safer roads around Australia but particularly in regional Australia, where a disproportionate number of people are killed and injured on our roads on an annual and a daily basis. So I'm very pleased to see the investments in road and rail infrastructure in the budget and am looking forward to working with my constituents to make sure that Gippsland receives a fair share of those funding commitments.


In my current portfolio, I must say the veterans' affairs budget has been well received, largely, across the sector. I believe that in the veteran community there's an assessment that in the reforms that have been started by my predecessor, Dan Tehan, and after him Michael McCormack for a brief period of time, we're heading in the right direction but there's more to be done. The announcement in the budget of an additional $100 million, on top of the reform agenda which was already underway, has been well received.


I'm determined as a new minister to make sure that we're putting veterans first but, perhaps just as important, to make sure that we're putting veterans' families first as well. The families are a critical part of the defence story and the veterans' story in our nation. We need families to support our veterans once they've finished their service. Obviously, once they're in the armed forces, whether it's the Navy, the Army or the Air Force, having the support of families and friends is so critical. So I'm very pleased with the investment in veterans and their families announced in this year's budget, in excess of $11 billion, which is a sizeable investment in the families and in the veterans themselves, who have served our nation with great distinction. There's a large range of activities that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is undertaking in consultation and partnership with our stakeholder organisations.


I must say, given the opportunity today, that I'm very pleased with the appointment of our new secretary, Liz Cosson. Liz comes to the job with perhaps the most extraordinary credentials of any person to apply for a senior Public Service role, in the sense that she has many generations of family history of service in the military. She has served with great distinction herself. She has worked in the Public Service for several years and has been right at the centre of the reform program that's been underway at the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I wish her well in that role and look forward to working with her.


As I indicated, there are some challenges still. While we are heading in the right direction, there are also challenges for us in the veterans' space. Two of the key areas I'm particularly keen to see us progress in the weeks, months and years ahead relate to the transition of military personnel out of the armed forces and the mental health of our veterans. The best support we can provide our service men and women is the economic independence that comes with securing a job. Making the transition from a military career into civilian life can be difficult for some. In the order of 5,000 to 6,000 Australians do it every year. The majority do it quite successfully, but there are others who require additional support. That is something we must continue to work on as a nation.


We are continuing to provide job opportunities for veterans by contributing more than $8 million to the Prime Minister's veterans program and ensuring the business community recognises the benefits of employing a veteran. When it comes to employing a veteran, I make this very important point: this is not about charity or giving to a good cause; hiring a veteran will be good for your business. These are people who have a proven record of hard work, discipline and patriotism. They have learnt skills in the military which are easily transferable to a range of civilian careers. As people who respect their service and have some level of understanding of that service, we should do everything we can to help them transition successfully from a military career to a civilian life. We want to encourage our veterans to make that transition well, and support those who may be struggling.


One area I mentioned a moment ago which has been brought to the attention of many members in this place is the mental health of our veterans. I thank members on both sides who have reached out to me since I've taken over this role to present to me case studies in their own communities of individuals they're concerned about. I also thank the shadow minister for bringing to my attention the feedback she receives from her consultation with ex-service organisations. This is one area of public policy where I have no doubt that we can have complete bipartisanship. We can work together to provide the best possible services and treatment outcomes and support for our veterans struggling with mental health issues.


We currently provide free mental health care to anyone who has served one full day in the Australian Defence Force. But that's not well understood. I would suggest that some people who would benefit from that free mental health care may not be aware that they're entitled to it. It is as a challenge for us as members to promote that within our communities, to work with ex-service organisations to reach out to our communities and ensure that all veterans are aware they can get support when they need it. We'll also be extending this to all reservists who have rendered disaster relief or border protection services or been seriously injured during a training exercise. I think this is a positive step. I again thank those opposite and members on my own side of this chamber who have reached out to me to provide more insights into the way that we could do additional work, particularly in our regional areas, to make sure those services are getting to people when they need it the most.


In the time that I have left I would like to make a few comments in relation to some health matters—some in relation to the budget and some more generally in relation to how we train the health workforce in our regional areas. Despite the claims of those opposite, the health budget under this government is at record levels. It's growing and it is at record levels. There was an important announcement in the budget of a $95 million investment in relation to the Murray-Darling Medical School. This is great news. It has been very well received in those communities and certainly by the local members who are directly impacted by it. It is part of the government's plan to attract and retain a rural health workforce and give younger people in regional areas the opportunity to train for their health careers in their own communities.


For families in regional areas, it is an incredible cost when a student has to leave to study in the city. There are significant costs associated with living away from home to undertake tertiary studies. The Murray-Darling Medical School is a good step in the right direction to help alleviate some of those costs and encourage more young people to practice medicine in regional areas. If you can attract a regional person into a medical career, they are more likely to go back and practice in a regional location. And if they have had some training in a regional area, they are more likely to go back and practice in a regional location.


But I would raise a cautionary note. It relates to Monash University and its behaviour in Gippsland over the last decade. I am concerned about the direction Monash University has taken in Gippsland. I have a question about how committed Monash University is to the Gippsland area and to regional Victoria more generally. I have raised these concerns directly with Monash over the last couple of years but I would pose this question: is Monash University fair dinkum about Gippsland and about the hopes and aspirations of regional students? The recent history would say suggest that it is not fair dinkum about the future of its services in the Gippsland region.


I want to refer to correspondence from Dr Andrew Greenhill, a highly regarded educator in my electorate, to provide a bit of background to these comments regarding Monash. Funding was provided by the Howard government to promote a pathway for regional students to study medicine in a regional location, at the Gippsland Medical School. I fear that Monash, through its behaviour in recent years, has effectively blocked that pathway for many Gippslanders. Comments from Dr Green support me in my concerns. He wrote:


Until recently, young people in Gippsland had a pathway to medicine which seemingly offered the great benefits that the Murray-Darling Medical School's network is expected to deliver.


He went on to say:


When Monash University withdrew from tertiary education in Gippsland, they retained the medical school. Monash University has since changed the eligibility criteria for entry into the medical degree, stipulating that students must do an undergraduate degree at a Melbourne campus of Monash University. It should be noted that Federation University, since its inception, has offered a degree in biomedical sciences at the Gippsland campus. The single major impediment to having a successful pathway for regional students to enter medical school in our region is an unjust and unjustifiable policy put in place by Monash University that states that students must study an undergraduate Monash degree, and thus live in metropolitan Melbourne for three years, to gain entry into a rural medical school.


As I said, I have raised these concerns with senior levels of Monash University in the past. What it means for a Gippsland student who is very successful at secondary school level and achieves the marks required to undertake a potential career in medicine must do their medical science degree with Monash at Clayton and cannot access their local campus of Federation University. And only then, after they've had that three years away from their hometown and that support that's provided to them, can they apply to go to Gippsland Medical School in Churchill.


I don't think it's good enough. In 2018, surely Monash could work with Federation University or other regional based universities and establish a pathway which doesn't require students from Gippsland to pack up their whole lives and move to Clayton whether they want to or not. I am completely relaxed if that's their choice but, under the current model that Monash has implemented in Gippsland, they have no choice. There is no pathway for a Gippsland student to remain in Gippsland or Latrobe Valley, perhaps study at the Churchill campus and move on to the Gippsland Medical School—also at the Churchill campus.


So I appeal to Monash to think very seriously about the direction in which it is taking its medical training services in the Gippsland region. With that in mind, I'm keeping a very watchful eye on the Monash University review of the School of Rural Health which has been announced. I'm not optimistic, given Monash's previous decision and the negative view they've had on Gippsland, that this review is going to be positive for our region. Health professionals in Gippsland are very concerned that any change in the delivery of the School of Rural Health will impact on the development of staff and students in our community. So I would appeal to the Monash University executive team to think very seriously about the question I asked before: are you fair dinkum about providing professional services to the people of Gippsland? Are you fair dinkum about supporting the hopes and aspirations of Gippsland students who wants to pursue a medical career?


In conclusion, this budget has been well received in Gippsland. From an infrastructure perspective, it has been extraordinarily popular, particularly around the Princes Highway investment. I would encourage the state government to find its 20 per cent funding to finish the project.

 (Grayndler) (12:59):  When it comes to infrastructure investment, budget 2018 is just a con. In the weeks leading up to the budget, the government busied itself by leaking budget plans to newspapers. It attracted front-page coverage of its promises to build Melbourne Airport rail, Western Sydney rail, and the next stage of the Adelaide South Road upgrade. Australians must have been surprised by this. It seemed that finally, after years of cuts, the government had realised the value of nation-building investment. The fact though is that this budget shows that the government has not overcome its irrational and ill-advised rejection of investment in public transport to tackle traffic congestion in our cities.


This is a government where the spin is so different from the facts. There was not a dollar of new infrastructure investment in last week's budget. Nothing for Melbourne Airport rail. Nothing for Western Sydney rail. Nothing for Brisbane's Cross River Rail project. Any new investment commitment announced in the budget does not involve new money; it's drawn from previously budgeted funds. That's all there for everyone to see on pages 137 to 144 of Budget Paper No. 2. On program after program, for state after state, there are lines of zeros in the forward estimates.


The fact is that most of the infrastructure investment won't be delivered for many years to come. This budget is a triumph of spin over substance. As the second president of the United States, John Adams, once said:


Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.


Let's have a look at their new announcements in the budget drawn from money that was already there—all on the never-never. A paltry one per cent to be invested over the next 12 months. Four dollars out of every $5 invested not this year, not the year after, not the year after that and not the year after that, but some time into the never-never beyond the forward estimates—more than 80 per cent. This is the never-never budget. In the meantime, actual investment is due to fall off a cliff. There's $8 billion in infrastructure grants to the states in the current financial year. That falls each and every year to $4.5 billion by 2021-22. From $8 billion down to $4.5 billion; almost cut in half.


After last year's budget, the independent Parliamentary Budget Office said that, over the next decade, infrastructure investment as a proportion of GDP will fall again by half—from 0.4 per cent to 0.2 per cent. It's a bit like Mr Wimpy in the Popeye cartoons, who used to wander around saying, 'I will gladly pay you on Tuesday for a hamburger today.' In this case, Malcolm Turnbull tells Australians, 'I'll gladly build you a rail line or a new road, but just vote for me some time in the next year and then vote for me again, and then sometime after that into the never-never I might actually do something.' This government not only is cutting investment but can't even deliver its reduced budgets, and the budget papers show that. Over its first four budgets, the difference between what the government has announced and allocated on budget nights from 2014 through 2015, 2016 and 2017—if you look at what has actually been expended over that period of time—is $4.7 billion.


Underspending is everywhere. There has been $2.7 billion underspent on roads. The Northern Australia Roads Program is $190 million underspent. The Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan is $700 million underspent. The Northern Australia Beef Roads Program is $74 million underspent. Even essential road safety, through the Black Spot Program, is underspent. We know that there are black spots across every one of the electorates of the representatives in this chamber—every single one—and yet $100 million is underspent. The Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program, established by the former Labor government, was maintained after pressure by this government. But what they've done is just not spent the money—$134 million. Every time you're driving on a highway and you think, 'That is somewhere where, in the interests of road safety, there should be a heavy vehicle rest stop,' know this: this government has had the funds but hasn't had the competence or the capacity to actually deliver that project. The fact is that it's happened almost every year across almost every program. It is a rolling parade of failure. Either the government is hopeless—and we know that it is—or it seriously misleads the nation about its real investment intentions.


There's an old saying: if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. So it is with the government's continuing attempt to move away from direct infrastructure grants to the states for major projects and towards off-budget funding. Three years ago it created the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. It spent very little besides flying board members around the southern capitals to have board meetings. This has become the 'no actual infrastructure fund' when it comes to actually delivering. They also cut real infrastructure investment to establish an infrastructure financing unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It was given the task, which Infrastructure Australia has under legislation, of attracting private investment in public infrastructure. A year later, the IFU has not produced a single project—not one. It's a failed experiment.


The fact is that off-budget funding can work in appropriate circumstances. An example is the Moorebank project in Sydney. I support the off-budget funding of the second Sydney airport because that will produce a return when it is leased, as other airports have been. But, in order to be off budget, a project must achieve two things. Firstly, it has to have revenue that is greater than operating and maintenance costs. Now we know that public transport projects in Australia and, indeed, around the world don't do that. That doesn't mean they're not worthwhile, because they contribute to the national economy by boosting productivity, taking pressure off the road network, making a contribution to economic growth and improving road safety by having less cars and heavy freight vehicles on our roads. But that does not mean that they produce a return.


Secondly, they have to produce a return on capital on the original investment. For example, in order for the Melbourne Airport rail link to be funded off budget to produce a commercial return, it would have to produce more revenue day to day than it has operating and maintenance costs and produce a return on the capital, which is likely to exceed $10 billion. It won't do that. So this grand announcement on page 1 of the newspaper is worth precisely zero, zip, no dollars, no investment.


The criteria for those opposite, who regard themselves as mini capitalists, would ask if, to have off-budget funding, you would invest your own dollars in this business which would produce a return on your investment as well as an ongoing income stream. The answer to that is simply no. And Mathias Cormann knew that. That's why the Minister for Finance argued against this in the cabinet processes. Everyone knows this to be the case except, perhaps, this foolhardy Prime Minister who imagines himself not as leading the nation but as the merchant banker for the nation who can somehow put together projects like this for free.


The fact is that this is sham funding. This fantasy follows last year's $8 billion for the Inland Rail after the former Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, in his 2015 study for this government said:


… the expected operating revenue over 50 years will not cover the initial capital investment required to build the railway.


And the CEO of the ARTC, John Fullerton, said to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit earlier this year:


From a strict ARTC point of view, no, the revenues that flow to us wouldn't cover the full capital cost and provide a return.


Now, I support the inland rail project, but it's got to be funded properly. I support Melbourne Airport rail, but it's got to be done properly. I certainly support western Sydney rail through Badgerys Creek airport, but it also will require real dollars and real investment. And the experts all say that that's the case.


Here's what someone from the Grattan Institute said:


So there's a real risk that these equity investments will end up not even making a positive rate of return, never mind a commercial rate.


…   …   …


If infrastructure projects are never going to make a commercial return, the government should stop pretending they will.


The chief economist for Industry Super Australia, Stephen Anthony, said:


We're opening up the potential for more unfunded liabilities but we don't need more time bombs.


Adrian Dwyer, the CEO of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia says the budgets cuts infrastructure investment by $2 billion over four years. He said:


… the warm infrastructure narrative pre-budget has not been met with cold hard cash in the budget papers.


…   …   …


At a time when our population is growing and our cities are more congested than ever, we need to see infrastructure dollars trending up not down.


The 2018 budget is not an infrastructure budget. It's an infrastructure mirage that calls us to look years ahead to an investment horizon that might never be reached. Meanwhile, average Australians looking for better roads and public transport are stuck in an infrastructure desert. This self-delusion will increase our national infrastructure deficit and at this very time refuses to fund, for example, Cross River Rail, which is a necessary prerequisite for funding Sunshine Coast rail. Unless you fix the second crossing, you can't do anything in terms of expanding the rail network in Brisbane, the Gold Coast or the Sunshine Coast. And that's why the sidelining of infrastructure Australia is such a major issue reflected in this budget.


In that announcement, with the north-south road project from Torrens to Torrens and the South Road Superway, which we have been calling for repeatedly at press conference after press conference on site to be built, finally Infrastructure Australia says it's on the priority list on the day that it's leaked to The Adelaide Advertiser when they've had the business case since 22 June last year. Such an undermining of infrastructure autonomy and credibility should not have been allowed by the government, because it's embarrassing for IA that that occurred.


Spin doesn't build infrastructure. Investment is required. It doesn't build itself. Investment is required. Only a Labor government will provide that investment. We've done it before and we'll do it again.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities) (13:14):  I rise to speak today on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-19, and I welcome the opportunity to speak, yet again, about the Turnbull government's commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment in nation-building infrastructure. I want to make three points. We are seeing an unprecedented level of infrastructure investment led by the Commonwealth government, which is driving economic growth, investment and employment outcomes. Our infrastructure spend reflects key policy priorities of the Turnbull government. I also want to use the opportunity to correct some misleading claims by the shadow minister—misleading claims by the shadow minister are a resource which is not in scarce supply.


The government is maintaining a historically high spend on transport infrastructure of over $8 billion per year over the forward estimates—and more than $75 billion over the next 10 years—and it is doing that in a wide range of ways. If you include payments to support state infrastructure services, if you also include untied local road grants through the financial assistance grants, if you include payments to non-state equities, if you include investments through equity injections and other financing options, and if you include the various commitments the Commonwealth has made, then what we are providing is $8.6 billion in 2018-19, $33.9 billion between 2018-19 and 2021-22, and over $75 billion over the next decade for publicly announced projects, initiatives and commitments and ongoing subprograms including financial assistance grants and maintenance.


Let me remind the House of the extraordinary sweep and scale of the commitments made in the 2018 budget in relation to infrastructure. They include the $3.5 billion Roads of Strategic Importance initiative to lift the productivity of our regional freight and passenger routes, the $1 billion Urban Congestion Initiative, up to $250 million for major project business case development and up to $160 million in additional investment on the Outback Way.


Let's look at the great state of Queensland, where over $5 billion will be invested, including an additional $3.3 billion for Bruce Highway projects, taking our total commitment on the Bruce Highway to $10 billion; and $1 billion for upgrades to the M1 Pacific Motorway between the Gold Coast and Brisbane, on top of the existing projects already underway between Mudgeeraba and Varsity Lakes and, of course, the Gateway merge. We also announced funding for the Beerburrum to Nambour rail upgrade, we announced $300 million for the Brisbane Metro public transport project and we announced funding for the Cunningham Highway from Yamanto to Ebenezer. In New South Wales, there is $1.6 billion for the Coffs Harbour bypass on the Pacific Highway, for Port Botany rail and the new Nowra bridge. In Victoria, we've committed up to $5 billion for the long-awaited Melbourne Airport rail link. Other projects, such as the North East Link, Rowville rail, the duplication and electrification of the Frankston line to Baxter, a Victorian congestion package, regional rail for Geelong and other projects, total some $2.8 billion.


In Western Australia, there is $1.1 billion for further METRONET projects, $944 million for a Perth congestion package and $560 million for the Bunbury Outer Ring Road. In South Australia, there is up to $1.4 billion for future priorities on the North-South Corridor, inclusive of the $177 million we announced for Pym Street to Regency Road. Money for the Gawler rail line electrification and the Joy Baluch Bridge was also included in this year's budget. In Tasmania, there is $461 million for the replacement of the Bridgewater Bridge and $400 million for a Tasmanian roads package under the Roads of Strategic Importance program. In the Northern Territory, there is funding for the Central Arnhem Road upgrade and the Buntine Highway upgrade. In the ACT, there is a Monaro Highway package. So there is a sweeping and impressive range of infrastructure commitments in the 2018 Turnbull government budget.


This forms part of a pattern in which we are seeing strong activity in infrastructure and in construction around Australia. In the December quarter in 2017 the value of public sector engineering work increased by 5.7 per cent to $8.67 billion. We're seeing this being reflected in the aggregate economic outcomes, as the International Monetary Fund observed a couple of months ago in its annual assessment of the Australian economy. Despite, in its words, the economic shocks of the commodity price boom and the mining investment boom ending, infrastructure investment has helped keep the economy performing. It says:


The recovery from these shocks has advanced further in 2017. Aggregate demand has been led by strong public investment growth amid a boost in infrastructure spending …


Recently the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, had this to say about government spending on transport infrastructure:


Another important part of the investment story recently is strong growth in investment in public infrastructure. The pick-up has been particularly noticeable in spending on transport infrastructure in the eastern states and the pipeline of work to be completed is large. The extra investment is directly creating demand in the economy today and adding to tomorrow's productive capacity.


Deloitte Access Economics in its recent investment monitor assessed the outlook for business investment in Australia as being healthier than it has been for some time and noted that this comes at the same time as 'state and federal governments are spending large amounts of money on project projects'.


The commitments in this budget build on the Turnbull government's existing record levels of investment in infrastructure, recognising that in order for the Australian economy to continue to grow and be competitive infrastructure investment must remain a core focus for the government. The commitments in this budget form a coherent plan for the future of Australia's transport infrastructure. They represent the projects and upgrades that will help shape our cities and define our regions. Let me point, for example, to Western Sydney Airport as an infrastructure project that will have a transformative economic impact. We are delivering infrastructure that communities in Western Sydney and around the nation will benefit from. We've committed to a $5.3 billion equity injection into WSA Co., the government owned company established to build and own Western Sydney Airport. This project will provide much-needed additional aviation capacity for Sydney and for the nation. It will give the people of the rapidly growing Western Sydney area much better and fairer access to air travel, and it will attract businesses and jobs to Western Sydney, where another one million people are expected to be living in 20 years time. During the construction phase it will support tens of thousands of jobs, including over 11,000 anticipated direct and indirect jobs throughout the construction phase, and by 2031 there will be around 28,000 direct and indirect jobs generated by the airport in its operational phase.


Western Sydney Airport forms part of a much broader list of projects being funded around the country, transformational projects like the $16.8 billion WestConnex motorway project in Sydney, which is being supported with a grant of $1.5 billion from the Commonwealth and a concessional loan of $2 billion, and major rail projects like METRONET in Perth and the Melbourne Airport rail link. We have committed $1 billion for projects on the M1 between the Gold Coast and Brisbane. On the Monash freeway and the M80 ring road in Melbourne the combined investment from the Commonwealth is some $1 billion. I've spoken about the funding we've committed for the future on the north-south corridor in Adelaide, but there are three projects underway benefitting from $1.6 billion of funding from the Turnbull government. Our approach to infrastructure reflects and gives effect to key policy priorities of the Turnbull government: driving productivity and efficiency in the Australian economy, maximising the role for investment and capital, and planning for the growth and effective functioning of our cities.


Let me turn, in the time that remains to me, to addressing a number of highly misleading claims that have been made by the shadow minister. We've had the repeated claim that there's no new money for infrastructure. It is a claim he made in his budget night media release and has made subsequently. It is absolutely incorrect. Let me explain once again the accounting treatment here. The Turnbull government made a commitment in last year's budget to invest $75 billion for infrastructure, and we backed up that commitment with the appropriate accounting treatment, in which we provisioned the required amount of money—several billion dollars a year, every year, over 10 years. That's why we call it a 10-year program. What we will then do every year is allocate specific projects against that rolling program, with the expense allocated to specific years. That's why there's no need for individual dollar amounts to be set out in Budget Paper No. 2, because we've already provisioned a total amount for infrastructure in advance. We've committed to investing over $75 billion over 10 years in transport infrastructure investment, including over $33 billion in the forward estimates, 2018-19 to 2021-22.


The shadow minister is evidently so shocked by this prudent and responsible accounting treatment that he resorts to what he knows to be deliberately false and misleading claims that there's no new money. Tell that to the people who will benefit from Bridgewater Bridge in Tasmania, because they now know there's $461 million allocated out of that infrastructure program for the bridge. They also know that Labor, by contrast, is promising a derisory $100 million. Try telling the people of Bunbury that there's no new money when in fact they've been told, quite correctly, that there's $560 million for the Bunbury Outer Ring Road. Try telling the people of Nowra that there's no new money when they've received the news that there's $155 million committed for the Nowra Bridge. Try telling the people of the Gold Coast that there's no new money when they have been pleased to hear that there's $1 billion allocated by the Turnbull government for two projects on the M1: the upgrade from Varsity Lakes to Tugun and the upgrade between Eight Mile Plains and Daisy Hill. This is all part of the Turnbull government's 10-year plan, with our commitments being fully funded and sequenced within the plan. The Australian government has committed to a decade-long pipeline of infrastructure projects focused on driving economic growth, increasing productivity and connectivity and creating new employment opportunities.


Of course, we hear the ludicrous claim from the shadow minister that infrastructure investment is falling. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. In his budget night media release, he misleadingly quoted just one line of the multiple lines of funding for infrastructure—Commonwealth infrastructure grants to the states. In other words, he completely ignored the substantial amounts of money the Turnbull government is spending in equity and loan investments: $5.3 billion for Western Sydney Airport and $8.4 billion for the Australian Rail Track Corporation for inland rail, a $2 billion concessional loan. There is even the equity injection into the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal, which he should well remember from his own time as minister.


The total amount of investment provided in equity and loans in the budget over the four years of the forward estimates is over $9 billion, which Mr Albanese simply assumes away in a wholly inaccurate and wholly misleading characterisation of the true numbers of infrastructure investment over the next four years. I remind the House of those numbers: 8.6 billion in 2018-19, $8.7 billion in 2019-20, $8.2 billion in 2020-21 and $8.5 billion in 2021-22. I also remind the House of the average spending when the shadow minister was the responsible minister. It wasn't $8 billion; it was just over $6 billion. So the shadow minister is absolutely wrong when he claims that infrastructure investment is falling.


Let me focus just for a moment on the ludicrous claim we heard repeated just a few moments ago that the funding for the Melbourne airport rail link is a sham. The shadow minister criticises us for indicating an interest in providing equity investment in the Melbourne airport rail link. We make no apology for doing that. We are absolutely interested in looking at innovative ways of funding and financing infrastructure and, if there's the prospect of an equity investment, we are certainly interested in looking at that, just as we have funded Western Sydney Airport through an equity investment. We are absolutely interested in looking at innovative ways to approach infrastructure investment, but I just make the point that the shadow minister, in his comments, seems to have missed Budget Paper No. 3, at page 48, which says:


The Commonwealth's $5 billion investment in the Melbourne Airport Rail Link will be provided as equity or otherwise as agreed—


that's to say 'as agreed with the Victorian state government'—


but consistent with the principles of conservative Budget management, this investment has initially been reported as grant funding.


So his basic premise is completely wrong—the claim that the money is a sham. It's in the budget as a grant.


Of course we are interested in looking at having a partnership with the Victorian government. We've made that very clear. Of course we're interested in looking at equity. But the fundamental proposition from the shadow minister on this point, as on so many others, is fundamentally wrong. The truth is there are unprecedented levels of infrastructure investment to support economic growth and deliver lifestyle benefits and productivity benefits all around Australia.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (12:29):  We on this side of the House support the appropriation bills in the same way that convention has dictated for nearly 40 years, now. Similarly, and consistent with the convention for these bills, we support the appropriations, but we take this opportunity to point out where we diverge substantially from the path that the government has taken us down with this budget.


It's very clear that those opposite are desperate for the Australian people to forget the cuts and the chaos of the last five years and the four budgets preceding this one. Having spent much of the last week on the central coast of New South Wales; in suburban Melbourne; in Sydney; and in my own community, including with the Leader of the Opposition and our candidate for Forde, Des Hardman, at Logan Hospital; I can assure those opposite that however they might kid themselves that the Australian people have somehow forgotten all of the cuts and chaos which began with that horror budget in 2014—whatever initiatives they come up with in a make-or-break election budget—they have another thing coming. This budget doesn't pass the fairness test. It's like all the other budgets from those opposite in that it fails the fairness test, because it puts big business ahead of battlers in this country. But the budget also fails the responsibility test. We have in this country record and growing debt, despite billions of dollars in new receipts—new taxes and charges—rolling through the door. We have record debt, twice what the government inherited in net debt from Labor, and gross debt that is over a trillion dollars for the first time in our history, despite all that new revenue, despite all these rosy forecasts around wages and despite the temporary spike in revenue which is being delivered to us by the upswing in the global economy.


What those opposite don't really understand when it comes to fairness and responsibility is that no budget which takes money from pensioners and gives it to the big four banks can be considered to be a fair one. No budget which collects an extra $40 billion in charges but still has debt twice what was inherited, including half a trillion dollars in gross debt, can be considered a responsible budget delivered by a responsible government. This budget was designed to be an election budget, and we're very happy. In fact, we on this side of the chamber welcome the opportunity to fight an election not just on the measures contained in this budget but on the dodgy values which underpin what has been proposed by those opposite.


Australians rejected the last four budgets, and I'm confident that they'll reject this one too. They will reject the cuts to hospitals, schools and TAFEs. They'll reject a budget which has a tax on pensioners, including taking away the energy supplement. They'll reject a budget which has record debt despite positive global conditions. They'll reject the budget of those opposite, because it still has these big tax concessions going to those who need them least, and they will still have this big $80 billion plus commitment to give handouts to big foreign multinationals and the big four banks.


But I think Australians will reject this budget and, ultimately, this government because the budget handed down two Tuesdays ago also could not be more out of whack with the nation's priorities. It bears absolutely no resemblance to the nation's values, the values of the people who make this nation strong. That's why I'm confident that Australians will reject what is being proposed by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. The defining difference in that budget was on tax. The government itself considers tax to be the centrepiece of the budget, and we do too. I think tax really is where the budget battle is joined, because tax is a really clear demonstration in budgets of the competing values of those opposite versus the values that we share with the majority of the Australian people.


What the government are proposing to do with their new income tax cuts is asking the Australian people to vote for tax cuts seven years down the track, after two more elections—tax cuts which overwhelmingly favour the wealthiest in our community. The ANU, NATSEM, the Grattan Institute and others have pointed out over and over again that those tax cuts are deliberately designed to deliver the biggest gains to people who need them least in our community. Obviously we take a dim view of tax cuts seven years down the track when we don't know what the economy will look like and we don't know what the budget will look like, and where those tax cuts will overwhelmingly favour the top end of town. We take a dim view of that.


We also think that the government are in real danger of repeating the mistakes made in the Howard-Costello period when big income tax cuts were built on the back of a temporary spike in revenue. One of the reasons we had 10 years of difficulty with the budget is that we had a structural problem in the budget. In the latter years of Howard and Costello, they gave big tax cuts assuming that the good times with the budget would roll on forever, and of course they didn't with the intervention of the global crisis and other things as well.


So we've seen this movie before and we didn't like how it ended. We don't want to see a sequel of big tax cuts to the top end of town being paid for by a temporary spike in revenue when we don't know how enduring that temporary spike may be. I think it says everything about the approach taken by those opposite. We have said on this side, 'If you split the bills, the income tax legislation, we are prepared to vote for the 1 July tax changes straightaway. If you split out the tax relief for the low- and middle-income earners from the tax relief for the top end of town, we'll pass the 1 July changes immediately.' We've said that repeatedly. The fact that the government are prepared to hold low-income earners hostage to the political games they want to play in here with their trickle-down economics speaks volumes about their real commitment to the workers of this country—people who work and struggle for a living and need and deserve some tax relief. Of course, they won't tell us how much each stage of the tax plan costs. They're asking us to vote for tax cuts seven years down the track—cuts which favour the top end of town—and they won't tell us what each stage of their tax plan costs.


What really rubs salt in the wound for a lot of working people in this country is that the government have taken this approach to their tax cuts at the same time as they are proposing an $80 billion tax cut for multinationals and the big banks. Again, $80 billion is an estimate. We think it might be more than that. We've asked the Treasurer and the Prime Minister in this place, from the dispatch box, repeatedly, 'How much does the company tax cut cost the Australian people? and they've been unwilling or unable to tell us how much that costs. That really rubs salt in the wound for a lot of working people. They know that there's a big tax cut being delivered to those who need it least at the same time as those opposite are holding them hostage to political games here and in the Senate. Of the $80 billion or so, it's estimated that something like $17 billion will go to just four companies in this country, the four big banks. When you consider the revelations about the rorts and rip-offs that are coming out of the royal commission, the idea that the Turnbull government want to give a $17 billion tax cut to those four big banks really beggars belief. It says it all, really, about the warped priorities of those opposite. The member for Barton and all of us on this side of the House want to see the victims of the rorts and rip-offs compensated. Bizarrely, those opposite want to see the perpetrators compensated for the dodgy behaviour being uncovered in the royal commission.


With them at every step of the way is the One Nation party, who have indicated that they will vote for a big tax cut for foreign multinationals and the big banks at the same time as our friends in the Greens have said that they won't support tax relief for low- and middle-income earners. What that tells us is that, right around the country, if the people of Australia, the workers of Australia, want their interests served by this parliament, they are going to need a Labor government, not One Nation or the Greens. Only Labor have the interests of working people at heart. That's where our bigger, fairer tax cut for 10 million Australian workers really comes from: our belief that the first port of call when it comes to tax relief should be the people who work and struggle in this country—the people on low- and middle-incomes. They should be the first port of all. That's why we've devoted a substantial amount of money to proper tax relief for 10 million Australian workers.


That's not our only alternative tax policy. We've also got the Australian investment guarantee, which doesn't spray $80 billion around overseas which goes to executive pay, share buybacks and puffed up dividends. Our tax plan for business ensures that the investment onshore, and that's obviously good for jobs and investment here in this country obviously.


So our tax reform plan has a bigger, fairer tax cut for 10 million workers, an Australian investment guarantee to ensure that companies invest onshore and we don't see the benefits flow overseas and, of course, the closing down of a lot of the loopholes which are costing the budget billions of dollars and flowing overwhelmingly to those who need them least. So we've got a substantial tax reform plan.


Our tax reform plan is really how we fund that which we truly value as a society. By making these difficult decisions elsewhere in the budget, we can give that tax relief for working people. We can restore cuts to hospitals. We can found MRIs in places right around Australia so that people can get the scans that they need to get their treatment on track. We can restore the cuts to schools. We can invest in TAFEs after years of the hollowing out of TAFEs and apprenticeships. We can get the VET system back on track as well.


This budget was framed in the best global economic conditions for a decade. A hundred and twenty economies were growing around the world. The IMF and others, including our own Reserve Bank, were pointing to the fact that the global economy really was in remarkable nick compared to where it was over the last little while. Because of that, the Treasurer had $40 billion of extra taxes and charges show up on his doorstep. He would like credit for that, but I don't think he can take credit for growth in 120 economies around the world. All of this extra money has just shown up. It's been a long time since we've had these sorts of revenue upgrades. But still, despite that, we've got those cuts to hospitals, schools and TAFEs. We've still got record debt. We've still got a deficit this year which is more than six times bigger than it was in Joe Hockey's budget in 2014. We've still got a tiny surplus in 2019-20 which relies on one thing only, and that's the bringing forward of tobacco tax. We've still got all of these things going on. The budget is not in the condition it should be in when you consider these global economic conditions. And why is that? It is because we've got these big tax concessions which are eating up and a bigger and bigger share of the budget and going to those who need them least, and we've got a government which proposes to shovel another $80 billion in the direction of multinationals and the big banks.


On this side of the House we take our responsibilities as the alternative government very seriously. We don't just point out the substantial and obvious flaws in the budget of those opposite. We propose an alternative. We put forwarded costed alternatives. We take courageous decisions in tax. We set out what we'll do if the Australian people hand us the keys to the government. We will be fairer than those opposite—that's not hard—but we'll be more responsible as well. We will make room for different choices. We will put the budget on a more sustainable footing. As Chris Bowen, the shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, said last week at the National Press Club, we've got a set of fiscal objective and fiscal principles which indicate to the Australian people just how responsible we are prepared to be with their money, whether it be tax reform or the paying down of debt right across the budget. We take our responsibilities very seriously. We do want to make room not just for our priorities as a Labor Party and as a Labor government; more importantly than that, we want to make room for the nation's priorities, which are to give ourselves the best chance to properly care after our sick, our frail and our aged; to give this country a proper opportunity to educate our young people; and to make sure that our taxes are as fair as possible.


Instead of this warped version of trickle-down economics that we've had for five budgets now in five years, we can satisfy the three objectives that really matter when it comes to managing the economy: economic growth which is inclusive, work that is rewarded and a decent social safety net for those left behind or those at risk of being left behind. That's how we realign economic policy in this country with the values and aspirations of the people. That's how we exercise power on their behalf and not on behalf of the millionaires and multinationals which those opposite prioritise again and again and again in their budgets.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Personnel, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Deputy Leader of the House) (12:44):  I rise to make some comments in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and highlight that the budget released only a matter of weeks ago provides this government's positive plans for the future. It gives a clear choice as well between our approach of investing in small and medium-sized businesses, investing in jobs for the future and relieving some of the tax burden on Australians, and the Australian Labor Party's approach, which is to tax people higher and put a handbrake on the economy.


This is our plan. It's our plan for the future, and it also provides a great level of investment in the regions. In the budget, we outlined how we would encourage hardworking Australians and reward them through tax relief; how we'd work with the business community to help them to invest and create more jobs, providing that certainty and confidence they need; how we'd also guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on, particularly in health and education; how we'd keep Australians safe with our strong border protection policies and defence policies; and how we'd ensure that the government continues to live within its means.


In Gippsland, I must say the budget has been well received—in particular the welcome announcement of $132 million for the final stage of the Princes Highway duplication project. This is a project that has enjoyed bipartisan support over many years now at both state and federal level, and I'm appealing to the Victorian state government to continue that level of bipartisan support by finding its 20 per cent of the final funding which will be required to finish the job. There's $132 million now on the table from the Commonwealth and $33 million required from the state government to finalise this project. I must say the state government would have to be bonkers not to stump up $33 million to finish the work. We're all committed to having a better and safer Princes Highway, and it's been one of those great projects which have seen local jobs created—so a benefit there—and have seen benefits from improving road safety and reducing road trauma, a strong benefit in the community, but also a longer term benefit of improving productivity, allowing us to get our products to market more readily, and obviously the longer term safety implications for the people of Gippsland—but not only the people of Gippsland but also the people who choose to travel to our region. We're passionate about increasing our visitor economy in Gippsland, and the more work we can do to improve our road and rail connectivity the more likely it is that we'll see jobs flow through the tourism sector.


The budget also included an important program, the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative. As a former minister in the Infrastructure and Transport portfolio, I was working with my department and state governments on such a program, and I want to congratulate the current minister for delivering on that promise. It will complement the existing programs around Roads to Recovery, the road Black Spot Program and the Bridges Renewal Program, along with the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program. All those programs provide opportunities for investment in better and safer roads around Australia but particularly in regional Australia, where a disproportionate number of people are killed and injured on our roads on an annual and a daily basis. So I'm very pleased to see the investments in road and rail infrastructure in the budget and am looking forward to working with my constituents to make sure that Gippsland receives a fair share of those funding commitments.


In my current portfolio, I must say the veterans' affairs budget has been well received, largely, across the sector. I believe that in the veteran community there's an assessment that in the reforms that have been started by my predecessor, Dan Tehan, and after him Michael McCormack for a brief period of time, we're heading in the right direction but there's more to be done. The announcement in the budget of an additional $100 million, on top of the reform agenda which was already underway, has been well received.


I'm determined as a new minister to make sure that we're putting veterans first but, perhaps just as important, to make sure that we're putting veterans' families first as well. The families are a critical part of the defence story and the veterans' story in our nation. We need families to support our veterans once they've finished their service. Obviously, once they're in the armed forces, whether it's the Navy, the Army or the Air Force, having the support of families and friends is so critical. So I'm very pleased with the investment in veterans and their families announced in this year's budget, in excess of $11 billion, which is a sizeable investment in the families and in the veterans themselves, who have served our nation with great distinction. There's a large range of activities that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is undertaking in consultation and partnership with our stakeholder organisations.


I must say, given the opportunity today, that I'm very pleased with the appointment of our new secretary, Liz Cosson. Liz comes to the job with perhaps the most extraordinary credentials of any person to apply for a senior Public Service role, in the sense that she has many generations of family history of service in the military. She has served with great distinction herself. She has worked in the Public Service for several years and has been right at the centre of the reform program that's been underway at the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I wish her well in that role and look forward to working with her.


As I indicated, there are some challenges still. While we are heading in the right direction, there are also challenges for us in the veterans' space. Two of the key areas I'm particularly keen to see us progress in the weeks, months and years ahead relate to the transition of military personnel out of the armed forces and the mental health of our veterans. The best support we can provide our service men and women is the economic independence that comes with securing a job. Making the transition from a military career into civilian life can be difficult for some. In the order of 5,000 to 6,000 Australians do it every year. The majority do it quite successfully, but there are others who require additional support. That is something we must continue to work on as a nation.


We are continuing to provide job opportunities for veterans by contributing more than $8 million to the Prime Minister's veterans program and ensuring the business community recognises the benefits of employing a veteran. When it comes to employing a veteran, I make this very important point: this is not about charity or giving to a good cause; hiring a veteran will be good for your business. These are people who have a proven record of hard work, discipline and patriotism. They have learnt skills in the military which are easily transferable to a range of civilian careers. As people who respect their service and have some level of understanding of that service, we should do everything we can to help them transition successfully from a military career to a civilian life. We want to encourage our veterans to make that transition well, and support those who may be struggling.


One area I mentioned a moment ago which has been brought to the attention of many members in this place is the mental health of our veterans. I thank members on both sides who have reached out to me since I've taken over this role to present to me case studies in their own communities of individuals they're concerned about. I also thank the shadow minister for bringing to my attention the feedback she receives from her consultation with ex-service organisations. This is one area of public policy where I have no doubt that we can have complete bipartisanship. We can work together to provide the best possible services and treatment outcomes and support for our veterans struggling with mental health issues.


We currently provide free mental health care to anyone who has served one full day in the Australian Defence Force. But that's not well understood. I would suggest that some people who would benefit from that free mental health care may not be aware that they're entitled to it. It is as a challenge for us as members to promote that within our communities, to work with ex-service organisations to reach out to our communities and ensure that all veterans are aware they can get support when they need it. We'll also be extending this to all reservists who have rendered disaster relief or border protection services or been seriously injured during a training exercise. I think this is a positive step. I again thank those opposite and members on my own side of this chamber who have reached out to me to provide more insights into the way that we could do additional work, particularly in our regional areas, to make sure those services are getting to people when they need it the most.


In the time that I have left I would like to make a few comments in relation to some health matters—some in relation to the budget and some more generally in relation to how we train the health workforce in our regional areas. Despite the claims of those opposite, the health budget under this government is at record levels. It's growing and it is at record levels. There was an important announcement in the budget of a $95 million investment in relation to the Murray-Darling Medical School. This is great news. It has been very well received in those communities and certainly by the local members who are directly impacted by it. It is part of the government's plan to attract and retain a rural health workforce and give younger people in regional areas the opportunity to train for their health careers in their own communities.


For families in regional areas, it is an incredible cost when a student has to leave to study in the city. There are significant costs associated with living away from home to undertake tertiary studies. The Murray-Darling Medical School is a good step in the right direction to help alleviate some of those costs and encourage more young people to practice medicine in regional areas. If you can attract a regional person into a medical career, they are more likely to go back and practice in a regional location. And if they have had some training in a regional area, they are more likely to go back and practice in a regional location.


But I would raise a cautionary note. It relates to Monash University and its behaviour in Gippsland over the last decade. I am concerned about the direction Monash University has taken in Gippsland. I have a question about how committed Monash University is to the Gippsland area and to regional Victoria more generally. I have raised these concerns directly with Monash over the last couple of years but I would pose this question: is Monash University fair dinkum about Gippsland and about the hopes and aspirations of regional students? The recent history would say suggest that it is not fair dinkum about the future of its services in the Gippsland region.


I want to refer to correspondence from Dr Andrew Greenhill, a highly regarded educator in my electorate, to provide a bit of background to these comments regarding Monash. Funding was provided by the Howard government to promote a pathway for regional students to study medicine in a regional location, at the Gippsland Medical School. I fear that Monash, through its behaviour in recent years, has effectively blocked that pathway for many Gippslanders. Comments from Dr Green support me in my concerns. He wrote:


Until recently, young people in Gippsland had a pathway to medicine which seemingly offered the great benefits that the Murray-Darling Medical School's network is expected to deliver.


He went on to say:


When Monash University withdrew from tertiary education in Gippsland, they retained the medical school. Monash University has since changed the eligibility criteria for entry into the medical degree, stipulating that students must do an undergraduate degree at a Melbourne campus of Monash University. It should be noted that Federation University, since its inception, has offered a degree in biomedical sciences at the Gippsland campus. The single major impediment to having a successful pathway for regional students to enter medical school in our region is an unjust and unjustifiable policy put in place by Monash University that states that students must study an undergraduate Monash degree, and thus live in metropolitan Melbourne for three years, to gain entry into a rural medical school.


As I said, I have raised these concerns with senior levels of Monash University in the past. What it means for a Gippsland student who is very successful at secondary school level and achieves the marks required to undertake a potential career in medicine must do their medical science degree with Monash at Clayton and cannot access their local campus of Federation University. And only then, after they've had that three years away from their hometown and that support that's provided to them, can they apply to go to Gippsland Medical School in Churchill.


I don't think it's good enough. In 2018, surely Monash could work with Federation University or other regional based universities and establish a pathway which doesn't require students from Gippsland to pack up their whole lives and move to Clayton whether they want to or not. I am completely relaxed if that's their choice but, under the current model that Monash has implemented in Gippsland, they have no choice. There is no pathway for a Gippsland student to remain in Gippsland or Latrobe Valley, perhaps study at the Churchill campus and move on to the Gippsland Medical School—also at the Churchill campus.


So I appeal to Monash to think very seriously about the direction in which it is taking its medical training services in the Gippsland region. With that in mind, I'm keeping a very watchful eye on the Monash University review of the School of Rural Health which has been announced. I'm not optimistic, given Monash's previous decision and the negative view they've had on Gippsland, that this review is going to be positive for our region. Health professionals in Gippsland are very concerned that any change in the delivery of the School of Rural Health will impact on the development of staff and students in our community. So I would appeal to the Monash University executive team to think very seriously about the question I asked before: are you fair dinkum about providing professional services to the people of Gippsland? Are you fair dinkum about supporting the hopes and aspirations of Gippsland students who wants to pursue a medical career?


In conclusion, this budget has been well received in Gippsland. From an infrastructure perspective, it has been extraordinarily popular, particularly around the Princes Highway investment. I would encourage the state government to find its 20 per cent funding to finish the project.



Mr Albanese interjecting—




Mr CHESTER:
  I acknowledge the member for Grayndler's contribution. If he had been here earlier and listened to the whole speech, he would know how glowingly I spoke of his contribution to infrastructure investment in Gippsland and the Princes Highway. (Time expired)

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (12:59):  When it comes to infrastructure investment, budget 2018 is just a con. In the weeks leading up to the budget, the government busied itself by leaking budget plans to newspapers. It attracted front-page coverage of its promises to build Melbourne Airport rail, Western Sydney rail, and the next stage of the Adelaide South Road upgrade. Australians must have been surprised by this. It seemed that finally, after years of cuts, the government had realised the value of nation-building investment. The fact though is that this budget shows that the government has not overcome its irrational and ill-advised rejection of investment in public transport to tackle traffic congestion in our cities.


This is a government where the spin is so different from the facts. There was not a dollar of new infrastructure investment in last week's budget. Nothing for Melbourne Airport rail. Nothing for Western Sydney rail. Nothing for Brisbane's Cross River Rail project. Any new investment commitment announced in the budget does not involve new money; it's drawn from previously budgeted funds. That's all there for everyone to see on pages 137 to 144 of Budget Paper No. 2. On program after program, for state after state, there are lines of zeros in the forward estimates.


The fact is that most of the infrastructure investment won't be delivered for many years to come. This budget is a triumph of spin over substance. As the second president of the United States, John Adams, once said:


Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.


Let's have a look at their new announcements in the budget drawn from money that was already there—all on the never-never. A paltry one per cent to be invested over the next 12 months. Four dollars out of every $5 invested not this year, not the year after, not the year after that and not the year after that, but some time into the never-never beyond the forward estimates—more than 80 per cent. This is the never-never budget. In the meantime, actual investment is due to fall off a cliff. There's $8 billion in infrastructure grants to the states in the current financial year. That falls each and every year to $4.5 billion by 2021-22. From $8 billion down to $4.5 billion; almost cut in half.


After last year's budget, the independent Parliamentary Budget Office said that, over the next decade, infrastructure investment as a proportion of GDP will fall again by half—from 0.4 per cent to 0.2 per cent. It's a bit like Mr Wimpy in the Popeye cartoons, who used to wander around saying, 'I will gladly pay you on Tuesday for a hamburger today.' In this case, Malcolm Turnbull tells Australians, 'I'll gladly build you a rail line or a new road, but just vote for me some time in the next year and then vote for me again, and then sometime after that into the never-never I might actually do something.' This government not only is cutting investment but can't even deliver its reduced budgets, and the budget papers show that. Over its first four budgets, the difference between what the government has announced and allocated on budget nights from 2014 through 2015, 2016 and 2017—if you look at what has actually been expended over that period of time—is $4.7 billion.


Underspending is everywhere. There has been $2.7 billion underspent on roads. The Northern Australia Roads Program is $190 million underspent. The Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan is $700 million underspent. The Northern Australia Beef Roads Program is $74 million underspent. Even essential road safety, through the Black Spot Program, is underspent. We know that there are black spots across every one of the electorates of the representatives in this chamber—every single one—and yet $100 million is underspent. The Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program, established by the former Labor government, was maintained after pressure by this government. But what they've done is just not spent the money—$134 million. Every time you're driving on a highway and you think, 'That is somewhere where, in the interests of road safety, there should be a heavy vehicle rest stop,' know this: this government has had the funds but hasn't had the competence or the capacity to actually deliver that project. The fact is that it's happened almost every year across almost every program. It is a rolling parade of failure. Either the government is hopeless—and we know that it is—or it seriously misleads the nation about its real investment intentions.


There's an old saying: if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. So it is with the government's continuing attempt to move away from direct infrastructure grants to the states for major projects and towards off-budget funding. Three years ago it created the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. It spent very little besides flying board members around the southern capitals to have board meetings. This has become the 'no actual infrastructure fund' when it comes to actually delivering. They also cut real infrastructure investment to establish an infrastructure financing unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It was given the task, which Infrastructure Australia has under legislation, of attracting private investment in public infrastructure. A year later, the IFU has not produced a single project—not one. It's a failed experiment.


The fact is that off-budget funding can work in appropriate circumstances. An example is the Moorebank project in Sydney. I support the off-budget funding of the second Sydney airport because that will produce a return when it is leased, as other airports have been. But, in order to be off budget, a project must achieve two things. Firstly, it has to have revenue that is greater than operating and maintenance costs. Now we know that public transport projects in Australia and, indeed, around the world don't do that. That doesn't mean they're not worthwhile, because they contribute to the national economy by boosting productivity, taking pressure off the road network, making a contribution to economic growth and improving road safety by having less cars and heavy freight vehicles on our roads. But that does not mean that they produce a return.


Secondly, they have to produce a return on capital on the original investment. For example, in order for the Melbourne Airport rail link to be funded off budget to produce a commercial return, it would have to produce more revenue day to day than it has operating and maintenance costs and produce a return on the capital, which is likely to exceed $10 billion. It won't do that. So this grand announcement on page 1 of the newspaper is worth precisely zero, zip, no dollars, no investment.


The criteria for those opposite, who regard themselves as mini capitalists, would ask if, to have off-budget funding, you would invest your own dollars in this business which would produce a return on your investment as well as an ongoing income stream. The answer to that is simply no. And Mathias Cormann knew that. That's why the Minister for Finance argued against this in the cabinet processes. Everyone knows this to be the case except, perhaps, this foolhardy Prime Minister who imagines himself not as leading the nation but as the merchant banker for the nation who can somehow put together projects like this for free.


The fact is that this is sham funding. This fantasy follows last year's $8 billion for the Inland Rail after the former Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, in his 2015 study for this government said:


… the expected operating revenue over 50 years will not cover the initial capital investment required to build the railway.


And the CEO of the ARTC, John Fullerton, said to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit earlier this year:


From a strict ARTC point of view, no, the revenues that flow to us wouldn't cover the full capital cost and provide a return.


Now, I support the inland rail project, but it's got to be funded properly. I support Melbourne Airport rail, but it's got to be done properly. I certainly support western Sydney rail through Badgerys Creek airport, but it also will require real dollars and real investment. And the experts all say that that's the case.


Here's what someone from the Grattan Institute said:


So there's a real risk that these equity investments will end up not even making a positive rate of return, never mind a commercial rate.


…   …   …


If infrastructure projects are never going to make a commercial return, the government should stop pretending they will.


The chief economist for Industry Super Australia, Stephen Anthony, said:


We're opening up the potential for more unfunded liabilities but we don't need more time bombs.


Adrian Dwyer, the CEO of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia says the budgets cuts infrastructure investment by $2 billion over four years. He said:


… the warm infrastructure narrative pre-budget has not been met with cold hard cash in the budget papers.


…   …   …


At a time when our population is growing and our cities are more congested than ever, we need to see infrastructure dollars trending up not down.


The 2018 budget is not an infrastructure budget. It's an infrastructure mirage that calls us to look years ahead to an investment horizon that might never be reached. Meanwhile, average Australians looking for better roads and public transport are stuck in an infrastructure desert. This self-delusion will increase our national infrastructure deficit and at this very time refuses to fund, for example, Cross River Rail, which is a necessary prerequisite for funding Sunshine Coast rail. Unless you fix the second crossing, you can't do anything in terms of expanding the rail network in Brisbane, the Gold Coast or the Sunshine Coast. And that's why the sidelining of infrastructure Australia is such a major issue reflected in this budget.


In that announcement, with the north-south road project from Torrens to Torrens and the South Road Superway, which we have been calling for repeatedly at press conference after press conference on site to be built, finally Infrastructure Australia says it's on the priority list on the day that it's leaked to The Adelaide Advertiser when they've had the business case since 22 June last year. Such an undermining of infrastructure autonomy and credibility should not have been allowed by the government, because it's embarrassing for IA that that occurred.


Spin doesn't build infrastructure. Investment is required. It doesn't build itself. Investment is required. Only a Labor government will provide that investment. We've done it before and we'll do it again.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities) (13:14):  I rise to speak today on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-19, and I welcome the opportunity to speak, yet again, about the Turnbull government's commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment in nation-building infrastructure. I want to make three points. We are seeing an unprecedented level of infrastructure investment led by the Commonwealth government, which is driving economic growth, investment and employment outcomes. Our infrastructure spend reflects key policy priorities of the Turnbull government. I also want to use the opportunity to correct some misleading claims by the shadow minister—misleading claims by the shadow minister are a resource which is not in scarce supply.


The government is maintaining a historically high spend on transport infrastructure of over $8 billion per year over the forward estimates—and more than $75 billion over the next 10 years—and it is doing that in a wide range of ways. If you include payments to support state infrastructure services, if you also include untied local road grants through the financial assistance grants, if you include payments to non-state equities, if you include investments through equity injections and other financing options, and if you include the various commitments the Commonwealth has made, then what we are providing is $8.6 billion in 2018-19, $33.9 billion between 2018-19 and 2021-22, and over $75 billion over the next decade for publicly announced projects, initiatives and commitments and ongoing subprograms including financial assistance grants and maintenance.


Let me remind the House of the extraordinary sweep and scale of the commitments made in the 2018 budget in relation to infrastructure. They include the $3.5 billion Roads of Strategic Importance initiative to lift the productivity of our regional freight and passenger routes, the $1 billion Urban Congestion Initiative, up to $250 million for major project business case development and up to $160 million in additional investment on the Outback Way.


Let's look at the great state of Queensland, where over $5 billion will be invested, including an additional $3.3 billion for Bruce Highway projects, taking our total commitment on the Bruce Highway to $10 billion; and $1 billion for upgrades to the M1 Pacific Motorway between the Gold Coast and Brisbane, on top of the existing projects already underway between Mudgeeraba and Varsity Lakes and, of course, the Gateway merge. We also announced funding for the Beerburrum to Nambour rail upgrade, we announced $300 million for the Brisbane Metro public transport project and we announced funding for the Cunningham Highway from Yamanto to Ebenezer. In New South Wales, there is $1.6 billion for the Coffs Harbour bypass on the Pacific Highway, for Port Botany rail and the new Nowra bridge. In Victoria, we've committed up to $5 billion for the long-awaited Melbourne Airport rail link. Other projects, such as the North East Link, Rowville rail, the duplication and electrification of the Frankston line to Baxter, a Victorian congestion package, regional rail for Geelong and other projects, total some $2.8 billion.


In Western Australia, there is $1.1 billion for further METRONET projects, $944 million for a Perth congestion package and $560 million for the Bunbury Outer Ring Road. In South Australia, there is up to $1.4 billion for future priorities on the North-South Corridor, inclusive of the $177 million we announced for Pym Street to Regency Road. Money for the Gawler rail line electrification and the Joy Baluch Bridge was also included in this year's budget. In Tasmania, there is $461 million for the replacement of the Bridgewater Bridge and $400 million for a Tasmanian roads package under the Roads of Strategic Importance program. In the Northern Territory, there is funding for the Central Arnhem Road upgrade and the Buntine Highway upgrade. In the ACT, there is a Monaro Highway package. So there is a sweeping and impressive range of infrastructure commitments in the 2018 Turnbull government budget.


This forms part of a pattern in which we are seeing strong activity in infrastructure and in construction around Australia. In the December quarter in 2017 the value of public sector engineering work increased by 5.7 per cent to $8.67 billion. We're seeing this being reflected in the aggregate economic outcomes, as the International Monetary Fund observed a couple of months ago in its annual assessment of the Australian economy. Despite, in its words, the economic shocks of the commodity price boom and the mining investment boom ending, infrastructure investment has helped keep the economy performing. It says:


The recovery from these shocks has advanced further in 2017. Aggregate demand has been led by strong public investment growth amid a boost in infrastructure spending …


Recently the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, had this to say about government spending on transport infrastructure:


Another important part of the investment story recently is strong growth in investment in public infrastructure. The pick-up has been particularly noticeable in spending on transport infrastructure in the eastern states and the pipeline of work to be completed is large. The extra investment is directly creating demand in the economy today and adding to tomorrow's productive capacity.


Deloitte Access Economics in its recent investment monitor assessed the outlook for business investment in Australia as being healthier than it has been for some time and noted that this comes at the same time as 'state and federal governments are spending large amounts of money on project projects'.


The commitments in this budget build on the Turnbull government's existing record levels of investment in infrastructure, recognising that in order for the Australian economy to continue to grow and be competitive infrastructure investment must remain a core focus for the government. The commitments in this budget form a coherent plan for the future of Australia's transport infrastructure. They represent the projects and upgrades that will help shape our cities and define our regions. Let me point, for example, to Western Sydney Airport as an infrastructure project that will have a transformative economic impact. We are delivering infrastructure that communities in Western Sydney and around the nation will benefit from. We've committed to a $5.3 billion equity injection into WSA Co., the government owned company established to build and own Western Sydney Airport. This project will provide much-needed additional aviation capacity for Sydney and for the nation. It will give the people of the rapidly growing Western Sydney area much better and fairer access to air travel, and it will attract businesses and jobs to Western Sydney, where another one million people are expected to be living in 20 years time. During the construction phase it will support tens of thousands of jobs, including over 11,000 anticipated direct and indirect jobs throughout the construction phase, and by 2031 there will be around 28,000 direct and indirect jobs generated by the airport in its operational phase.


Western Sydney Airport forms part of a much broader list of projects being funded around the country, transformational projects like the $16.8 billion WestConnex motorway project in Sydney, which is being supported with a grant of $1.5 billion from the Commonwealth and a concessional loan of $2 billion, and major rail projects like METRONET in Perth and the Melbourne Airport rail link. We have committed $1 billion for projects on the M1 between the Gold Coast and Brisbane. On the Monash freeway and the M80 ring road in Melbourne the combined investment from the Commonwealth is some $1 billion. I've spoken about the funding we've committed for the future on the north-south corridor in Adelaide, but there are three projects underway benefitting from $1.6 billion of funding from the Turnbull government. Our approach to infrastructure reflects and gives effect to key policy priorities of the Turnbull government: driving productivity and efficiency in the Australian economy, maximising the role for investment and capital, and planning for the growth and effective functioning of our cities.


Let me turn, in the time that remains to me, to addressing a number of highly misleading claims that have been made by the shadow minister. We've had the repeated claim that there's no new money for infrastructure. It is a claim he made in his budget night media release and has made subsequently. It is absolutely incorrect. Let me explain once again the accounting treatment here. The Turnbull government made a commitment in last year's budget to invest $75 billion for infrastructure, and we backed up that commitment with the appropriate accounting treatment, in which we provisioned the required amount of money—several billion dollars a year, every year, over 10 years. That's why we call it a 10-year program. What we will then do every year is allocate specific projects against that rolling program, with the expense allocated to specific years. That's why there's no need for individual dollar amounts to be set out in Budget Paper No. 2, because we've already provisioned a total amount for infrastructure in advance. We've committed to investing over $75 billion over 10 years in transport infrastructure investment, including over $33 billion in the forward estimates, 2018-19 to 2021-22.


The shadow minister is evidently so shocked by this prudent and responsible accounting treatment that he resorts to what he knows to be deliberately false and misleading claims that there's no new money. Tell that to the people who will benefit from Bridgewater Bridge in Tasmania, because they now know there's $461 million allocated out of that infrastructure program for the bridge. They also know that Labor, by contrast, is promising a derisory $100 million. Try telling the people of Bunbury that there's no new money when in fact they've been told, quite correctly, that there's $560 million for the Bunbury Outer Ring Road. Try telling the people of Nowra that there's no new money when they've received the news that there's $155 million committed for the Nowra Bridge. Try telling the people of the Gold Coast that there's no new money when they have been pleased to hear that there's $1 billion allocated by the Turnbull government for two projects on the M1: the upgrade from Varsity Lakes to Tugun and the upgrade between Eight Mile Plains and Daisy Hill. This is all part of the Turnbull government's 10-year plan, with our commitments being fully funded and sequenced within the plan. The Australian government has committed to a decade-long pipeline of infrastructure projects focused on driving economic growth, increasing productivity and connectivity and creating new employment opportunities.


Of course, we hear the ludicrous claim from the shadow minister that infrastructure investment is falling. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. In his budget night media release, he misleadingly quoted just one line of the multiple lines of funding for infrastructure—Commonwealth infrastructure grants to the states. In other words, he completely ignored the substantial amounts of money the Turnbull government is spending in equity and loan investments: $5.3 billion for Western Sydney Airport and $8.4 billion for the Australian Rail Track Corporation for inland rail, a $2 billion concessional loan. There is even the equity injection into the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal, which he should well remember from his own time as minister.


The total amount of investment provided in equity and loans in the budget over the four years of the forward estimates is over $9 billion, which Mr Albanese simply assumes away in a wholly inaccurate and wholly misleading characterisation of the true numbers of infrastructure investment over the next four years. I remind the House of those numbers: 8.6 billion in 2018-19, $8.7 billion in 2019-20, $8.2 billion in 2020-21 and $8.5 billion in 2021-22. I also remind the House of the average spending when the shadow minister was the responsible minister. It wasn't $8 billion; it was just over $6 billion. So the shadow minister is absolutely wrong when he claims that infrastructure investment is falling.


Let me focus just for a moment on the ludicrous claim we heard repeated just a few moments ago that the funding for the Melbourne airport rail link is a sham. The shadow minister criticises us for indicating an interest in providing equity investment in the Melbourne airport rail link. We make no apology for doing that. We are absolutely interested in looking at innovative ways of funding and financing infrastructure and, if there's the prospect of an equity investment, we are certainly interested in looking at that, just as we have funded Western Sydney Airport through an equity investment. We are absolutely interested in looking at innovative ways to approach infrastructure investment, but I just make the point that the shadow minister, in his comments, seems to have missed Budget Paper No. 3, at page 48, which says:


The Commonwealth's $5 billion investment in the Melbourne Airport Rail Link will be provided as equity or otherwise as agreed—


that's to say 'as agreed with the Victorian state government'—


but consistent with the principles of conservative Budget management, this investment has initially been reported as grant funding.


So his basic premise is completely wrong—the claim that the money is a sham. It's in the budget as a grant.


Of course we are interested in looking at having a partnership with the Victorian government. We've made that very clear. Of course we're interested in looking at equity. But the fundamental proposition from the shadow minister on this point, as on so many others, is fundamentally wrong. The truth is there are unprecedented levels of infrastructure investment to support economic growth and deliver lifestyle benefits and productivity benefits all around Australia.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (13:30):  Meddling with schoolchildren's savings accounts is the latest scandal to engulf our banks. On Saturday, Adele Ferguson reported that thousands of children's Commonwealth Bank accounts were fraudulently set up by branch staff as part of a scam to get bonuses and meet performance targets. The scam involves CBA staff illegitimately activating Youthsaver accounts with small sums of money for the financial gain of the staff.


Of the 150 branches investigated, Montmorency in my electorate of Jagajaga had the highest percentage of accounts with deposits of less than $1. The principal of Montmorency South Primary School, Leanne Sheean, said the bank had manipulated her school:


They bring in a cuddly bear, the kids get taken in and, in reality, it is fraudulent what they have done and they are using schools to do it.



The royal commission into our banks and financial system has heard evidence of alleged bribery, forged documents and financial planners charging fees to dead people. We have seen AMP admit to routinely lying to regulators, and now we have the Dollarmite scandal. The Commonwealth Bank posted a profit of $9.8 billion last year, and this is how they behave. The conduct of the CBA in Montmorency in exploiting innocent children is totally unacceptable. (Time expired)

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (14:01):  My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that there are reports today that up to six government MPs support the member for Farrer's private member's bill to phase out live sheep exports, does the Prime Minister support the bill? Will the Prime Minister support further debate on the bill and ensure that government members on the Selection Committee are aware of his view so that all members can have their say on this very important issue?



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House on a point of order?




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, matters to do with the Selection Committee and the schedule of the House are not within the responsibility of the Prime Minister. It was not a general question; it was a very specific question about when the bill will be dealt with and how the process will be unfolding. I'm happy to answer that question, but it's not within the responsibility of the Prime Minister.



The SPEAKER:  I will allow the Manager of Opposition Business to speak on the point of order.




Mr Burke:
  To the point of order, Mr Speaker: it's impossible I think to view the part of the question that says, 'Does the Prime Minister support the bill?' as being answered by anyone other than the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister pass on his—



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business might have just made the point there. That's the only part of the question that I think is in order.



An honourable member interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  No. It's probably best you don't. Certainly I'm going to allow the part of the question that asks whether he supports the bill. The Prime Minister has the call.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:02):  I thank the honourable member for his question. The government supports a live export trade that respects animal welfare and obviously respects community views on animal welfare. We are taking immediate action to ensure that animal welfare is maintained, the jobs of thousands of Australian farmers are preserved and our export markets are respected and maintained. As honourable members know, the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources commissioned a report from Dr Michael McCarthy. That has recommended a number of changes to the export regime. In summary, on live sheep voyages to the Middle East in the coming northern summer, sheep will get 39 per cent more space and stocking densities will be reduced by up to 28 per cent. The reportable mortality level will be halved from two per cent to one per cent. Independent observers on behalf of the government will be on the vessels to make sure that these standards are maintained. The observers will be reporting daily to the regulator.



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order?




Mr Burke:
  Mr Speaker, given that you ruled that the only part of the question that was in order was whether or not the Prime Minister supports the private member's bill, he should be relevant to that.



The SPEAKER:  I have been listening very closely. Manager of Opposition Business, when he's talking about the substance of the topic that is the subject of the bill, I really can't see how he's anything other than in order. The Prime Minister is in order.




Mr TURNBULL:
  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The government's objective is, as I said, to ensure that animal welfare is maintained, that animals are treated humanely in this transport, that the livings and viability of Australian farmers—particularly in Western Australia, where most of these shipments are derived—are respected and maintained, and that our export markets are maintained. We do not want to have a repetition of the debacle that we had under the Labor Party, where the entire live cattle export business was banned and, as a consequence, farming families across the nation were facing ruin and the price of cattle crashed, from the far north of the country all the way down to Tasmania. That's the sort of recklessness the government will not be a party to. What we have put in place—along with the minister, who is absent, as I said—is a careful and considered approach based on science, and that is why the government does not support the bill.

The SPEAKER
 (15:13):  Before members leave, I'd like to make a brief statement to update the House. I have advised the House that, following the receipt of five resignations, of the members for Braddon, Fremantle, Longman, Mayo and Perth, I would undertake the usual practice of consulting with the Australian Electoral Commissioner on possible dates for the by-elections and consulting with party leaders about my preferred date. The earliest possible date for the by-elections is 23 June, if the writs are issued today. However, the Electoral Commissioner has advised me that, in light of the issues to do with section 44 of the Constitution that have caused four of the five by-elections, the government is considering urgent changes through regulation to the nomination process to ensure that candidates are aware of their obligations under section 44 prior to the by-elections taking place.


The commissioner has advised me that he supports these changes. I note they have also been supported unanimously in the recent report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which has proposed that they should be in place for the forthcoming by-elections to improve public trust and confidence.


As this regulation is not yet in force, there would be no possibility of applying it if by-elections were held on 23 June, and consequently I consider that I should not proceed to issue the writs today for the by-elections to be held on 23 June. I will continue to consult with the commissioner and party leaders about the timing of the by-elections, and I hope to be able to update the House later this week.

 (Watson) (15:15):  I have a question to the Speaker.



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  If members could cease interjecting, I'm trying to give the Manager of Opposition Business the call.




Mr BURKE:
  Thanks, Mr Speaker. Thank you for making that statement to the House. I respect the procedure that you said you would follow in terms of who you would consult. The advice you just referred to from the Australian Electoral Commission creates a situation where government policy can hold up whether or not a seat is filled.


When the member for Bennelong resigned, a by-election was called two days later. For the seat of New England, it was called on the same day that the High Court handed down its decision. For Batman, it was six days after. Indeed, if a general election is called, once that is agreed with the Governor-General, everything can happen within 33 days, and it happens immediately.


That being the case, and respecting the independence of your role as Speaker—



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will cease interjecting.




Mr BURKE:
  I do have to raise the issue that it is now taking longer to fill five seats than it would take to fill 150, and we are currently in a situation where the government could delay a regulation for as long as they wanted, and that would determine when a by-election was held.

Let me also point out to the Manager of Opposition Business and all members the process that Speakers normally undertake. Their obligation is to advise the House of resignations and then to advise the House once writs have been issued. I've taken this course of action today because the events are unusual, given the circumstances, and as a courtesy to the House. That's why I've done that.


Can I also say, as frankly as I can, that my duty is to consult with the Australian Electoral Commissioner. I realise that lots of people have lots of opinions on this matter, but I would be very surprised if any members of the House thought that I should not consult with the Electoral Commissioner or indeed that I should ignore his advice. I'll update the House later in the week. That's my expectation. Out of courtesy to all members of the House, I wanted to give this update today.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (15:22):  This budget reminds me of something that was once said by the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw. He remarked, about the first night of a play that he had written—it had gone down very badly and the reviews were terrible—that the show was excellent but the audience was poor. The same could be said of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer; they think that their budget is excellent and that the Australian public can't see its brilliance. That's the trouble in relation to this budget.


We've got a situation where the budget is neither fair nor responsible. The unemployment rate has gone up to 5.6 per cent, and is much higher in parts of the country, particularly in working-class and middle-class communities. We've got a situation where the ABS data shows that wages are stagnant. We've got a situation where, according to the latest data, wages are only growing at a rate of about 2.1 per cent per annum. Profits are going up much higher and, indeed, the government wants to give big business massive tax cuts. It seems strange and inconsistent to the Australian public that that's the case. We've got a situation where wage rises for the Public Service in the December 2017 quarter were 2.3 per cent, compared to 3.2 per cent in the December 2016 quarter. So, wage rises are not going up, despite the fact that the budget is quite optimistic about wage rises. In fact, wage rises are diminishing.


The government is optimistic, thinking that the budget will deliver big revenue increases in terms of tax revenue to the budget, when in fact wage rises are abating. They're presiding over consistently low wages growth, but they've got no plans to seriously deal with the problem except support the taking away of penalty rates for 700,000 of the lowest-paid workers in the country. It's a government that doesn't understand dwindling bargaining power and doesn't understand the challenges that working-class people face each and every day in the country.


The government, when they were in opposition, said that they would deliver a surplus in their first year and every year thereafter. They talked about a one per cent surplus. They have failed to deliver that. Having not tackled effectively the challenge to the economy of illegal tobacco, they're optimistic that they are going to bring in more than $3 billion in revenue from a crackdown on illegal tobacco and that that's going to provide for a surplus in years to come. So from a start where they're bringing in virtually no revenue they say they're going to raise an enormous sum of money that way.


This government talked about a debt-and-deficit disaster, but that's not the case, according to them now. They never talk about it. Why not? It must be because they're embarrassed. They must be. We've got a new record for gross debt in this country, which is now $528.3 billion. That is an increase of $255.3 billion under this government from 2013 to 2018—that is, across their tenure on the treasury bench. Do those on the other side of the chamber ever talk about a debt-and-deficit disaster now? They do not—not at all. This is a government which has failed monumentally. Those opposite trumpet jobs and growth. They talk about a billion extra jobs, without actually acknowledging, like respected economist Stephen Koukoulas, that it is in fact population growth that has created this jobs growth. According to this budget, we will have to elect this Prime Minister and this government not just once, not just twice but perhaps three times before most of the tax cuts that they laud in the budget are delivered. This is a government which seems out of touch with the needs of working class Australians.


Those opposite talked about the net debt—not just the gross debt—plenty of times. Net debt for the coming year is double what it was when the government came to power. I will be interested to hear during this appropriations debate speeches from those on the treasury bench about debt-and-deficit disasters, or about debt and deficits at all. We will probably not hear anything from the government, because it has failed monumentally.


Like family budgets, government budgets show the priorities, values, ethics and choices that that government makes. What is the government doing? It is continuing the cuts it has made in the past. It has locked them in once again. What are we seeing? There is $17 billion in cuts to schools. We see the Catholic education system up in arms across the media today. We are seeing $2.2 billion in cuts to universities. I was at the Ipswich Show in my electorate on the weekend, doing a mobile office across three days. I thank the Labor Party campaign workers across Ipswich and the Somerset region who were there with me. I was with the state member for Ipswich, Jennifer Howard, and the member for Ipswich West, Jim Madden, and their staff. I talked to Geraldine Mackenzie, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Southern Queensland, which has a campus in my electorate in Springfield and one in Ipswich. I talked with her about the concerns that the University of Southern Queensland has in relation to that and the challenges it faces.


Then there are the cuts of a billion dollars to the health and hospital services system in this country: cuts to Medicare and the keeping for another year of the rebate freeze on specialists. In my electorate there is TAFE south-west, with its great campus at Bundamba. There has been $270 million in cuts to TAFE and apprentices. And, of course, $80 million has been cut from that beloved institution in Australia the ABC. There has been $1.5 billion in cuts to remote housing, ending a national partnership agreement. It's simply not good enough. As a local federal MP I've got to say that the cuts of $3 billion to aged care that have been locked in are part of the cruel hoax that has been perpetrated upon the aged care sector. Of course, they're onto it now. It took them 24 hours, but they're onto it—the fact that they have funding for 14,000 new in-home aged-care places over four years but all the money comes from within the aged-care budget. There's no new money at all. As in infrastructure, which falls off a cliff in the next few years, there are 3,500 places a year. Not even the government can keep pace with the demand. The waiting list grew by 20,000 in the last six months of last year. Of course, the government want older Australians to work until they're 70 years of age, and they cut the energy supplement of $14 from these older Australians, who should be respected and supported. The cuts to Queensland health, of $160 million, continue. Emergency department visits, cataract extractions, knee replacements and birth assistance are all at risk from this government. We see Medicare statistics showing it costs more to see specialists and GPs.


So this is a government which is out of touch with working-class and middle-class Australians. They should be looking to address these issues, reversing their cuts to public hospitals, reversing their cuts to schools, ending the Medicare rebate freeze and fixing the private health insurance affordability crisis which so many people acknowledge and recognise. Once and for all, they should scrap the tampon tax. It's critical that this government look after older Australians and the health of all Australians, but this government is not doing anything of the sort.


When it comes to income tax, the government are reducing the progressive nature of income tax in this country. The Grattan Institute makes it crystal clear that more than half of the tax cuts the government are proposing go to the top 20 per cent of income earners. Their tax cuts are not skewed, as the ones that Labor proposed in the budget-in-reply speech are, to middle- and working-class Australians.


In the portfolio that I represent as the shadow minister for immigration and border protection, we have seen cuts to the department: $256.3 million over five years. And guess what: it's really interesting because, having—as the secretary of the department said today—created this mega-department, this behemoth department, five months and one day ago, they have actually now decided to put $7 million towards a review of the department they created, which was about the security of the position of one man, the Prime Minister, and not the security of the country. No security agency has recommended to this government that it should create the Department of Home Affairs. So this strategic review of this mega-department was announced in the budget. We've seen inquiries and reports from the Auditor-General, and the department's own RAND Corporation report, criticise the establishment of the department in terms of their efficiencies and effectiveness.


There's no money, of course, in the budget for cybersecurity, despite the fact that the cyber-resilience of the department has failed again and again and we've seen audit report after audit report in relation to it. They've failed to maintain cybersecurity standards since 2014 in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and now the Department of Home Affairs, and there's no money in the budget in relation to that. It's beyond belief that they tolerate this monumental level of incompetence displayed by the minister and the department secretary on this critical national security issue. Cybersecurity should be at the absolute forefront.


On top of that, the government's been locked in an ongoing dispute with thousands and thousands of Immigration and Border Protection employees over pay and conditions for over four years. They praise the frontline workers, but they won't pay them fairly, and these people have suffered real wage cuts at the hands of this conservative government. We have seen at the same time that internal staff surveys have shown that ABF staff have a deep-seated dissatisfaction with senior management in the department. We are fundamentally concerned with the safety and security of the Australian community. Australia's security and intelligence agencies are amongst the best in the world. We acknowledge that, but we have a minister in the portfolio of Home Affairs who is failing, and the department is failing.


It is not just that. There is also skilled migration. In the member for Aston's answer to the last question to him, what he didn't talk about was the fact that in the budget they've cut $270 million from the Skilling Australians Fund, having got rid of the national partnership. That is all about the fact that they've seen a huge reduction, tens of thousands of apprentices fewer in this country. We have about 150,000 fewer apprentices than when this government came to power. How can you deal with the challenge of skilled migration? How can you deal with the challenge of employment by cutting yet again on top of billions of dollars of cuts to TAFE and tertiary education? On top of that, the government cut another $270 million in the budget. I mean, we actually had to force this government, and they backflipped, to agree to labour market testing. For the first time in my 11 years in this place, the government finally agreed with Labor on labour market testing. We had to drag them kicking and screaming to agree to that in the last week of parliament, but they failed on skilled migration.


What the government are doing here is creating the Skilling Australians Fund. Their primary source of funding for apprenticeships and traineeships is deeply, deeply flawed and insecure because of its reliance on visa levies from overseas workers. They are saying the number of overseas workers is going to reduce but, at the same time—like a magic pudding—they are going to increase the Skilling Australians Fund with the money, so the money goes up but the number of overseas workers goes down. They are increasing levies on business. This is an out-of-touch government when it comes to this issue, completely out of touch. They are not fighting for local workers. They have finally agreed to proper labour market testing but they have not cracked down on the rorts in the migration system. They have failed to invest in skills and training. They have to do so much better in this area.


This government have failed in the budget. I just want to tell people before I finish that, finally last week, we got them to agree to backtrack on their assurance of support to those persons in those communities who apply for visas, which is so important. They tried to surreptitiously get it in, but we put pressure on and they finally backtracked. They moved the goalposts in this. They made these changes without any warning. Labor stood up to them, and they backflipped on that last week. I am pleased about that. It is great to see they finally saw a bit of sense in that area.

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (15:37):  Australia, Victoria and the Goldstein community have much to celebrate in this year's federal budget. It's a budget that builds on our vision for Australia as a forward-looking modern liberal nation with unparalleled living standards. This budget can be encapsulated in three words: opportunity, security and responsibility—opportunity by delivering three stages of tax cuts by increasing the bracket from $80,000 to $87,000, lifting it to $90,000 next year and then to $200,000 from 2024 to 2025; security by increasing the number of home aged-care packages by 14,000 over four years to give Australians the freedom to choose how they retire and age at home with dignity and choice; and responsibility by introducing a 23.9 per cent tax cap on government spending and delivering a surplus next financial year to start paying back Labor's debt legacy.


Frankly, this has been the best budget since returning to government in 2013. It provides the framework to advance our values through legislative action. The end of the frustrating incremental return to surplus is now in sight. The deadline to start cutting debt has been brought forward a year. Next year, we will finally reverse Labor's debt legacy. We are talking tax relief, better childcare, increased home care for retirees, funding for schools and huge investment in infrastructure. First and foremost, the budget continues to tackle the rising costs of living for households, including in the Goldstein community. While maintaining fiscal discipline and fast tracking our national surplus, we are tackling major tax reform. The budget's bold reforms bring us closer to an ideal setting where taxes are lower, simpler and more consistent for the whole of the Australian community. Indeed, 60,799 taxpayers in the wonderful Goldstein electorate stand to benefit from low- and middle-income tax relief. That the means a hairdresser on 50 grand will have an extra $530 in their hip pocket, increasing to $3,740 over the seven years of this plan.


Cost-of-living pressures are also being relieved as the new childcare system comes into place on 2 July: 4,019 families in the Goldstein electorate will now benefit from more accessible and affordable child care. We know that child care hits the hip pockets of families, but that it also particularly aids and assists women and professional women in the electorate to be able to make choices themselves. And as the government's National Energy Guarantee is implemented, and decades of policy deadlock are finally put to rest, families can also start to benefit from more affordable electricity and gas prices.


But this budget is also backing the 22,112 local businesses in the Goldstein electorate. Business tax cuts will help them to invest, to employ and to pay their workers more. Over a thousand small businesses in Goldstein have previously benefited from the instant asset write-off, and that measure has now been extended for another 12 months.


When business conditions are optimal, the dividends speak volumes in employment, in profits, in opportunity and in investment in communities. The Turnbull government has now delivered more than one million jobs, nearly 1,100 per day. The most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows strong growth in full-time work, and that's particularly important for those returning to work or seeking out their first step on a rung on the ladder of opportunity. We're giving a fair go to those who may not have had one previously. We're giving people the chance to turn their human capital and intellectual capital into economic success and progress.


This budget also addresses the challenges we face as an ageing population. It gives retirees support to keep living in their own homes or helps them relieve financial stress by converting some of their housing equity into an income stream. There are an additional 14,000 places for in-home care, as well as new measures to enhance quality of care and transparency. The Goldstein electorate has 26,314 people over the age of 65; they all deserve dignity and security in their retirement, and as they age throughout their lives.


Australia's cities are developing at a rapid pace and it's the duty of the government to plan for the future. That's what's included in this budget. Investment in nation-building infrastructure is also at record levels. Our population growth rate is about 1.6 per cent a year, but to make sure that we meet the challenges of that growth rate and to make sure that it's sustainable it must be backed up by the investment and infrastructure needed to support a healthy, growing population. When growth is preceded by planning and investment it does wonders for economic prosperity, liveability and social mobility, and for the security of every resident.


Through the Infrastructure Investment Program, $9.7 billion is being rolled out in Victoria alone. It includes $5 billion for the Melbourne Airport Rail Link. Hundreds of constituents in the Goldstein electorate have regularly raised with me their concerns about the absence of an airport rail link and their capacity to be able to connect, whether for business or for pleasure, directly to Melbourne's major air route and hub, to reach not just the rest of the country but the world. This $5 billion investment in the Melbourne Airport Rail Link finally delivers a piece of infrastructure most Victorians believe should have already been delivered many decades ago. It's been in planning for decades and, ultimately, the state government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to support it by the federal government putting down this $5 billion in matching funding.


There has also been $1.8 billion committed to the North-East rail link, which will deliver benefits, of course, to large parts of Victoria—particularly the northern and eastern suburbs, and connecting out to other areas of the state as well. There is $475 million for the Monash rail project, which, critically, will connect parts of the CBD through to Monash University—the Caulfield campus and then to the Clayton campus as well. I say that with a bit of nostalgia, because many moons ago, when I was a younger gentleman, I served as the president of the Caulfield campus of Monash University. During that time, one of the projects that I actually implemented with university management was to build a bus route directly connecting the campuses. It's nice to see that after many years, that project has gone from an idea to something that was adopted, and from a bus project now to becoming, ultimately, a rail project as well. That's the consequence of legacy and the consequence of leadership, and full points should be given to the Turnbull government for recognising that opportunity.


As well, there is $225 million for the Frankston to Baxter link, which is critical, of course, to the member for Dunkley but also to the people who are part of the growing corridor across the south-east of Melbourne that goes to the different parts of the Mornington Peninsula. Frankston is one of the major hubs that connects to further inland parts as we progress down the peninsula. There is $50 million for the regional rail program and an additional commitment of $132 million for the completion of the duplication of Princess Highway East. There is $3 billion for the East West Link, if that could ever be delivered, because we have the intransigence and obstruction of the Andrews government who have consistently undermined the potential for the development of that important transport link. When you look at a map of Melbourne and see where the road networks are connected, the East West Link is the most critical part of our infrastructure and is completely absent. It stops freight movements and it clogs up roads, which undermines transportation by road across Victoria and particularly across the congested roads of Melbourne.


We pray we will one day see a state government that puts people first, Victorians first, and actually builds this needed road. But, instead, what we have seen consistently is a state government that would rather pay out big corporate interests to not build one. The $3 billion for the East West Link that was committed by the Turnbull government is a recommitment of an important piece of infrastructure that our state desperately needs. There was $295 million as part of the Victorian congestion package to help ease the bottlenecks that sit all across our state. Because the state government is not tackling the bigger challenges in big infrastructure and big roads, these congestion packages will help ease the burden so that parents can get their kids to school easier, they can get from school to work easier and people can go about their business on a day-to-day basis. The increasing burden of congestion along major arterial roads on weekends has now become so bad that the $295 million is absolutely essential.


Locally, the Roads to Recovery Program will assist the Bayside City Council with upgrades to Outer Crescent in Brighton. There have been some other significant capital investments in the Goldstein electorate under this budget, including the upgrade to the Glen Eira Adult Learning Centre, the Caulfield South Community House's hall renovation, upgraded training lights at the Jack Barker Oval, renovations to the Sandybeach community centre and an upgrade to the Alma Park toddler's playground as part of the Stronger Communities Program, which has invested more than $378,451 in the Goldstein electorate.


The budget shines light onto some shadows that are in desperate need of illumination, particularly in dealing with some of the great social challenges that undermine our cohesive society. One in five Australians experience a mental health condition in a given year. Anxiety and depression cause distress, impacting on functioning and relationships on a day-to-day basis and leading to poor physical health. The budget's $92.4 million investment in frontline mental health services includes $33.8 million for Lifeline, $10.5 million for beyondblue and $2.2 million for Defence Force reservists. There's also $125 million assigned for research through the government's Medical Research Future Fund. That's on top of our ongoing commitment to important youth mental health services, particularly the enduring contribution of headspace. We have a headspace centre in Moorabbin.


As Liberals, our vision is to maximise opportunity for every Australian. That means preparing our national accounts for any external economic shocks that threaten job security and opportunity. This budget recommits the majority of new revenue from a strengthening economy to paying down our national debt. That's it. It's the volcano of debt that could erupt unless we continue on our path to surplus, not in 2021, as has been stated in the past, but in 2019-20 and beyond. For the first time in a decade, the government is being very serious about making sure that we no longer borrow to pay back everyday expenses. With the budget back in the black, government services can continue to deliver better health care and education outcomes but, more critically, provide the economic security that every Australian needs. When we have global economic shocks that sometimes are outside of our control, it's the resilience that we build within our budgetary framework in making sure we have flexibility that provides us security into the future.


What we cannot afford to do is be complacent, as those on the opposition benches would have us do. They would have us sit and think it's okay to accumulate debt and the costs of simply financing it without anything to show for it—to borrow from tomorrow to live it up today. It's a form of intergenerational theft, where money is taken from the future to fund our lifestyles today. It's not just that it's unjust; it is immoral and is a position that we should never stand for.


The return to surplus by the Turnbull government is one of the most critical and significant achievements of this government, and it's the biggest gift that it can give to future generations. This budget is a forward-looking, responsible blueprint for a modern liberal Australia. The Goldstein community has consistently voiced concern over the rising costs of living, the lack of infrastructure investment, particularly by the state government, job security and the challenges of an ageing population. But, more critically, it has consistently raised concerns about the challenges facing our budget and wanting to make sure that a government—their government; the nation's government—is prudent and responsible, exercises spending with caution and seeks to minimise expenses that are unnecessary, to return to a position of surplus so we can start to pay back Labor's debt legacy. That is what this budget does: it delivers opportunity, security and responsibility for our great nation. As a government, we have listened and we have acted.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (15:51):  There are occasions in the government's life when a particular budget epitomises everything that they stand for and what their priorities are. We saw such a budget in 2014, when those opposite were first elected to government under former Prime Minister Abbott, and we well remember the legacy of that budget—and so we should because so much of it still exists in the budget we're confronted with in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-19 and the related appropriation bills today. The budget had at its heart unfairness and it did not pass the test not only of this parliament but of the general public's opinion of what it was trying to do. This budget is exactly the same as that previous budget. Plainly on display are the priorities of the government. I'm sure people will excuse me for borrowing the analogy of the member for Gilmore last week—and the member for Gilmore might be surprised to know that most members of the public probably consider that, if the horse is the government, the jockey would be considered to be the Prime Minister, not herself. You can change the jockey on the horse, but, if that horse is running the same race, you're not going to have any different outcome. That's exactly what is happening with the budget that is before us now. The priorities, the wrong values and the wrong approach to the challenges facing the nation that were encapsulated in that very unfair, discredited 2014 budget are still there in all their tarnished glory in the budget that was announced this month by the Prime Minister. It is both sneaky and unfair, and I want to address some of the most significant concerns that I have with the budget.


The first thing that it puts in headlights before the Australian people is the fact that the government are committed to an $80 billion tax cut for the big end of town. That is their immovable priority; that is what they are determined to have encapsulated in this budget as reflecting their values and their priorities. I would suggest that that is not shared by the vast majority of the Australian population, particularly when you consider that, within that $80 billion, is $17 billion that will go to the big banks, who have hardly covered themselves in glory in recent expositions coming out of the royal commission. It's particularly important to note, if you look at that $17 billion that the big banks will get as a tax cut under the priorities of the government, that that's exactly enough to put back on the table the $17 billion that the government have cut from our schools.


So here you have a contrast between those of us on this side of the House, who believe in investing in the things that make us a fairer, more dynamic country for the future that includes an opportunity for our children to be part of that story, and those on the other side of the House, whose priorities seem to be that big banks, who have been exposed as having not exactly exemplary behaviour and who are also, I have to say, making record profits, desperately need $17 billion in tax cuts, but our kids in our schools who actually need, as my colleague the member for Whitlam has outlined to this House, the investment in their schools, because they're working away in demandable classrooms across my region—they need investment in literacy and numeracy programs and work to be done in programs that ensure that young people in high school are well positioned for TAFE and university study when they leave their school.


All the programs that I've seen across my electorate and I know were happening across electorates around the country were built on the back of the original Gonski agreement, which was needs based and sector-blind funding. This government has rolled up a shonky version of that which is not needs based and sector blind and which cuts $17 billion from schools across the nation, and they have tried to claim that they are actually doing the right thing by kids in our schools. I don't think parents of those children, their families, their carers, the communities they live in or the teachers who spend so much time and energy working to make sure they position them well will agree that that is a reasonable priority for a government to have. And certainly I know that in my electorate many people would share that concern.


There are so many issues in this budget that I want to cover, and I'll take the opportunity to cover them in a number of contributions to the chamber, but, like many of my colleagues, I'm very excited to hear my new colleague's first speech, so I'm only going to take a few minutes to—



Ms Kearney interjecting—




Ms BIRD:
  Please don't apologise; I'm absolutely thrilled to have this dilemma. So I just want to make a few points about what my concerns are in particular. One I've already spoken to the House about is the pea-and-thimble trick that's been played in the aged-care sector. Indeed, I've had many locals in tears on the phone to me about access to home-care package places. There are 105,000 people across the country waiting for a home care package. We got 14,000 in the budget. That's not even going to keep up with increasing demand. That's not even going to manage the demand that grew in the six months since they last tried to do something to address this problem. Those families are under great stress and waiting up to 12 months. Somebody who's been assessed as needing support in their home is waiting 12 months. What does the government think the families are doing in the meantime? This is an enormous pressure and this is a particularly cruel trick—not to mention the fact that, as our shadow minister has highlighted, they also didn't actually put extra money in; they funded that by taking money out of residential aged care, which is also under a lot of pressure.


The second area I'm really angry about is TAFE. I'm very disappointed that the Prime Minister not only made an incorrect claim about the level of debt under the Labor government when they took control but also failed to engage and talk about TAFE. I think the government's record on vocational education, on skills, on providing apprenticeships and on filling the skills shortage which should be addressed by training our own people is that they have been cutting and cutting away at the heart of vocational education every single budget and midyear economic statement. Not a single one has passed where they have missed the opportunity to make another cut, and again and again they tout their Skilling Australia Fund, which they can't actually show has delivered anything in terms of apprentices. There is so much that's wrong. There's so much that goes to the heart of the priority for a government that is completely out of whack with where the community is, what their needs are and what we should be doing as a nation.


This budget, as I said at the beginning, puts their priorities the up in headlights, and I'll tell you what: if they were my priorities over my head, I would be ducking for cover, and I think many of those opposite should be doing the same. You can't prioritise $80 billion to big business with $17 billion to the banks while cutting away at the heart of school, TAFE and university, making sure we won't have the investments that we need. I'll continue to fight, as I know all of my colleagues on this side will, against what are very unfair and poor budget decisions by this government.


Debate adjourned.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (15:22):  This budget reminds me of something that was once said by the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw. He remarked, about the first night of a play that he had written—it had gone down very badly and the reviews were terrible—that the show was excellent but the audience was poor. The same could be said of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer; they think that their budget is excellent and that the Australian public can't see its brilliance. That's the trouble in relation to this budget.


We've got a situation where the budget is neither fair nor responsible. The unemployment rate has gone up to 5.6 per cent, and is much higher in parts of the country, particularly in working-class and middle-class communities. We've got a situation where the ABS data shows that wages are stagnant. We've got a situation where, according to the latest data, wages are only growing at a rate of about 2.1 per cent per annum. Profits are going up much higher and, indeed, the government wants to give big business massive tax cuts. It seems strange and inconsistent to the Australian public that that's the case. We've got a situation where wage rises for the Public Service in the December 2017 quarter were 2.3 per cent, compared to 3.2 per cent in the December 2016 quarter. So, wage rises are not going up, despite the fact that the budget is quite optimistic about wage rises. In fact, wage rises are diminishing.


The government is optimistic, thinking that the budget will deliver big revenue increases in terms of tax revenue to the budget, when in fact wage rises are abating. They're presiding over consistently low wages growth, but they've got no plans to seriously deal with the problem except support the taking away of penalty rates for 700,000 of the lowest-paid workers in the country. It's a government that doesn't understand dwindling bargaining power and doesn't understand the challenges that working-class people face each and every day in the country.


The government, when they were in opposition, said that they would deliver a surplus in their first year and every year thereafter. They talked about a one per cent surplus. They have failed to deliver that. Having not tackled effectively the challenge to the economy of illegal tobacco, they're optimistic that they are going to bring in more than $3 billion in revenue from a crackdown on illegal tobacco and that that's going to provide for a surplus in years to come. So from a start where they're bringing in virtually no revenue they say they're going to raise an enormous sum of money that way.


This government talked about a debt-and-deficit disaster, but that's not the case, according to them now. They never talk about it. Why not? It must be because they're embarrassed. They must be. We've got a new record for gross debt in this country, which is now $528.3 billion. That is an increase of $255.3 billion under this government from 2013 to 2018—that is, across their tenure on the treasury bench. Do those on the other side of the chamber ever talk about a debt-and-deficit disaster now? They do not—not at all. This is a government which has failed monumentally. Those opposite trumpet jobs and growth. They talk about a billion extra jobs, without actually acknowledging, like respected economist Stephen Koukoulas, that it is in fact population growth that has created this jobs growth. According to this budget, we will have to elect this Prime Minister and this government not just once, not just twice but perhaps three times before most of the tax cuts that they laud in the budget are delivered. This is a government which seems out of touch with the needs of working class Australians.


Those opposite talked about the net debt—not just the gross debt—plenty of times. Net debt for the coming year is double what it was when the government came to power. I will be interested to hear during this appropriations debate speeches from those on the treasury bench about debt-and-deficit disasters, or about debt and deficits at all. We will probably not hear anything from the government, because it has failed monumentally.


Like family budgets, government budgets show the priorities, values, ethics and choices that that government makes. What is the government doing? It is continuing the cuts it has made in the past. It has locked them in once again. What are we seeing? There is $17 billion in cuts to schools. We see the Catholic education system up in arms across the media today. We are seeing $2.2 billion in cuts to universities. I was at the Ipswich Show in my electorate on the weekend, doing a mobile office across three days. I thank the Labor Party campaign workers across Ipswich and the Somerset region who were there with me. I was with the state member for Ipswich, Jennifer Howard, and the member for Ipswich West, Jim Madden, and their staff. I talked to Geraldine Mackenzie, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Southern Queensland, which has a campus in my electorate in Springfield and one in Ipswich. I talked with her about the concerns that the University of Southern Queensland has in relation to that and the challenges it faces.


Then there are the cuts of a billion dollars to the health and hospital services system in this country: cuts to Medicare and the keeping for another year of the rebate freeze on specialists. In my electorate there is TAFE south-west, with its great campus at Bundamba. There has been $270 million in cuts to TAFE and apprentices. And, of course, $80 million has been cut from that beloved institution in Australia the ABC. There has been $1.5 billion in cuts to remote housing, ending a national partnership agreement. It's simply not good enough. As a local federal MP I've got to say that the cuts of $3 billion to aged care that have been locked in are part of the cruel hoax that has been perpetrated upon the aged care sector. Of course, they're onto it now. It took them 24 hours, but they're onto it—the fact that they have funding for 14,000 new in-home aged-care places over four years but all the money comes from within the aged-care budget. There's no new money at all. As in infrastructure, which falls off a cliff in the next few years, there are 3,500 places a year. Not even the government can keep pace with the demand. The waiting list grew by 20,000 in the last six months of last year. Of course, the government want older Australians to work until they're 70 years of age, and they cut the energy supplement of $14 from these older Australians, who should be respected and supported. The cuts to Queensland health, of $160 million, continue. Emergency department visits, cataract extractions, knee replacements and birth assistance are all at risk from this government. We see Medicare statistics showing it costs more to see specialists and GPs.


So this is a government which is out of touch with working-class and middle-class Australians. They should be looking to address these issues, reversing their cuts to public hospitals, reversing their cuts to schools, ending the Medicare rebate freeze and fixing the private health insurance affordability crisis which so many people acknowledge and recognise. Once and for all, they should scrap the tampon tax. It's critical that this government look after older Australians and the health of all Australians, but this government is not doing anything of the sort.


When it comes to income tax, the government are reducing the progressive nature of income tax in this country. The Grattan Institute makes it crystal clear that more than half of the tax cuts the government are proposing go to the top 20 per cent of income earners. Their tax cuts are not skewed, as the ones that Labor proposed in the budget-in-reply speech are, to middle- and working-class Australians.


In the portfolio that I represent as the shadow minister for immigration and border protection, we have seen cuts to the department: $256.3 million over five years. And guess what: it's really interesting because, having—as the secretary of the department said today—created this mega-department, this behemoth department, five months and one day ago, they have actually now decided to put $7 million towards a review of the department they created, which was about the security of the position of one man, the Prime Minister, and not the security of the country. No security agency has recommended to this government that it should create the Department of Home Affairs. So this strategic review of this mega-department was announced in the budget. We've seen inquiries and reports from the Auditor-General, and the department's own RAND Corporation report, criticise the establishment of the department in terms of their efficiencies and effectiveness.


There's no money, of course, in the budget for cybersecurity, despite the fact that the cyber-resilience of the department has failed again and again and we've seen audit report after audit report in relation to it. They've failed to maintain cybersecurity standards since 2014 in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and now the Department of Home Affairs, and there's no money in the budget in relation to that. It's beyond belief that they tolerate this monumental level of incompetence displayed by the minister and the department secretary on this critical national security issue. Cybersecurity should be at the absolute forefront.


On top of that, the government's been locked in an ongoing dispute with thousands and thousands of Immigration and Border Protection employees over pay and conditions for over four years. They praise the frontline workers, but they won't pay them fairly, and these people have suffered real wage cuts at the hands of this conservative government. We have seen at the same time that internal staff surveys have shown that ABF staff have a deep-seated dissatisfaction with senior management in the department. We are fundamentally concerned with the safety and security of the Australian community. Australia's security and intelligence agencies are amongst the best in the world. We acknowledge that, but we have a minister in the portfolio of Home Affairs who is failing, and the department is failing.


It is not just that. There is also skilled migration. In the member for Aston's answer to the last question to him, what he didn't talk about was the fact that in the budget they've cut $270 million from the Skilling Australians Fund, having got rid of the national partnership. That is all about the fact that they've seen a huge reduction, tens of thousands of apprentices fewer in this country. We have about 150,000 fewer apprentices than when this government came to power. How can you deal with the challenge of skilled migration? How can you deal with the challenge of employment by cutting yet again on top of billions of dollars of cuts to TAFE and tertiary education? On top of that, the government cut another $270 million in the budget. I mean, we actually had to force this government, and they backflipped, to agree to labour market testing. For the first time in my 11 years in this place, the government finally agreed with Labor on labour market testing. We had to drag them kicking and screaming to agree to that in the last week of parliament, but they failed on skilled migration.


What the government are doing here is creating the Skilling Australians Fund. Their primary source of funding for apprenticeships and traineeships is deeply, deeply flawed and insecure because of its reliance on visa levies from overseas workers. They are saying the number of overseas workers is going to reduce but, at the same time—like a magic pudding—they are going to increase the Skilling Australians Fund with the money, so the money goes up but the number of overseas workers goes down. They are increasing levies on business. This is an out-of-touch government when it comes to this issue, completely out of touch. They are not fighting for local workers. They have finally agreed to proper labour market testing but they have not cracked down on the rorts in the migration system. They have failed to invest in skills and training. They have to do so much better in this area.


This government have failed in the budget. I just want to tell people before I finish that, finally last week, we got them to agree to backtrack on their assurance of support to those persons in those communities who apply for visas, which is so important. They tried to surreptitiously get it in, but we put pressure on and they finally backtracked. They moved the goalposts in this. They made these changes without any warning. Labor stood up to them, and they backflipped on that last week. I am pleased about that. It is great to see they finally saw a bit of sense in that area.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (15:37):  Australia, Victoria and the Goldstein community have much to celebrate in this year's federal budget. It's a budget that builds on our vision for Australia as a forward-looking modern liberal nation with unparalleled living standards. This budget can be encapsulated in three words: opportunity, security and responsibility—opportunity by delivering three stages of tax cuts by increasing the bracket from $80,000 to $87,000, lifting it to $90,000 next year and then to $200,000 from 2024 to 2025; security by increasing the number of home aged-care packages by 14,000 over four years to give Australians the freedom to choose how they retire and age at home with dignity and choice; and responsibility by introducing a 23.9 per cent tax cap on government spending and delivering a surplus next financial year to start paying back Labor's debt legacy.


Frankly, this has been the best budget since returning to government in 2013. It provides the framework to advance our values through legislative action. The end of the frustrating incremental return to surplus is now in sight. The deadline to start cutting debt has been brought forward a year. Next year, we will finally reverse Labor's debt legacy. We are talking tax relief, better childcare, increased home care for retirees, funding for schools and huge investment in infrastructure. First and foremost, the budget continues to tackle the rising costs of living for households, including in the Goldstein community. While maintaining fiscal discipline and fast tracking our national surplus, we are tackling major tax reform. The budget's bold reforms bring us closer to an ideal setting where taxes are lower, simpler and more consistent for the whole of the Australian community. Indeed, 60,799 taxpayers in the wonderful Goldstein electorate stand to benefit from low- and middle-income tax relief. That the means a hairdresser on 50 grand will have an extra $530 in their hip pocket, increasing to $3,740 over the seven years of this plan.


Cost-of-living pressures are also being relieved as the new childcare system comes into place on 2 July: 4,019 families in the Goldstein electorate will now benefit from more accessible and affordable child care. We know that child care hits the hip pockets of families, but that it also particularly aids and assists women and professional women in the electorate to be able to make choices themselves. And as the government's National Energy Guarantee is implemented, and decades of policy deadlock are finally put to rest, families can also start to benefit from more affordable electricity and gas prices.


But this budget is also backing the 22,112 local businesses in the Goldstein electorate. Business tax cuts will help them to invest, to employ and to pay their workers more. Over a thousand small businesses in Goldstein have previously benefited from the instant asset write-off, and that measure has now been extended for another 12 months.


When business conditions are optimal, the dividends speak volumes in employment, in profits, in opportunity and in investment in communities. The Turnbull government has now delivered more than one million jobs, nearly 1,100 per day. The most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows strong growth in full-time work, and that's particularly important for those returning to work or seeking out their first step on a rung on the ladder of opportunity. We're giving a fair go to those who may not have had one previously. We're giving people the chance to turn their human capital and intellectual capital into economic success and progress.


This budget also addresses the challenges we face as an ageing population. It gives retirees support to keep living in their own homes or helps them relieve financial stress by converting some of their housing equity into an income stream. There are an additional 14,000 places for in-home care, as well as new measures to enhance quality of care and transparency. The Goldstein electorate has 26,314 people over the age of 65; they all deserve dignity and security in their retirement, and as they age throughout their lives.


Australia's cities are developing at a rapid pace and it's the duty of the government to plan for the future. That's what's included in this budget. Investment in nation-building infrastructure is also at record levels. Our population growth rate is about 1.6 per cent a year, but to make sure that we meet the challenges of that growth rate and to make sure that it's sustainable it must be backed up by the investment and infrastructure needed to support a healthy, growing population. When growth is preceded by planning and investment it does wonders for economic prosperity, liveability and social mobility, and for the security of every resident.


Through the Infrastructure Investment Program, $9.7 billion is being rolled out in Victoria alone. It includes $5 billion for the Melbourne Airport Rail Link. Hundreds of constituents in the Goldstein electorate have regularly raised with me their concerns about the absence of an airport rail link and their capacity to be able to connect, whether for business or for pleasure, directly to Melbourne's major air route and hub, to reach not just the rest of the country but the world. This $5 billion investment in the Melbourne Airport Rail Link finally delivers a piece of infrastructure most Victorians believe should have already been delivered many decades ago. It's been in planning for decades and, ultimately, the state government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to support it by the federal government putting down this $5 billion in matching funding.


There has also been $1.8 billion committed to the North-East rail link, which will deliver benefits, of course, to large parts of Victoria—particularly the northern and eastern suburbs, and connecting out to other areas of the state as well. There is $475 million for the Monash rail project, which, critically, will connect parts of the CBD through to Monash University—the Caulfield campus and then to the Clayton campus as well. I say that with a bit of nostalgia, because many moons ago, when I was a younger gentleman, I served as the president of the Caulfield campus of Monash University. During that time, one of the projects that I actually implemented with university management was to build a bus route directly connecting the campuses. It's nice to see that after many years, that project has gone from an idea to something that was adopted, and from a bus project now to becoming, ultimately, a rail project as well. That's the consequence of legacy and the consequence of leadership, and full points should be given to the Turnbull government for recognising that opportunity.


As well, there is $225 million for the Frankston to Baxter link, which is critical, of course, to the member for Dunkley but also to the people who are part of the growing corridor across the south-east of Melbourne that goes to the different parts of the Mornington Peninsula. Frankston is one of the major hubs that connects to further inland parts as we progress down the peninsula. There is $50 million for the regional rail program and an additional commitment of $132 million for the completion of the duplication of Princess Highway East. There is $3 billion for the East West Link, if that could ever be delivered, because we have the intransigence and obstruction of the Andrews government who have consistently undermined the potential for the development of that important transport link. When you look at a map of Melbourne and see where the road networks are connected, the East West Link is the most critical part of our infrastructure and is completely absent. It stops freight movements and it clogs up roads, which undermines transportation by road across Victoria and particularly across the congested roads of Melbourne.


We pray we will one day see a state government that puts people first, Victorians first, and actually builds this needed road. But, instead, what we have seen consistently is a state government that would rather pay out big corporate interests to not build one. The $3 billion for the East West Link that was committed by the Turnbull government is a recommitment of an important piece of infrastructure that our state desperately needs. There was $295 million as part of the Victorian congestion package to help ease the bottlenecks that sit all across our state. Because the state government is not tackling the bigger challenges in big infrastructure and big roads, these congestion packages will help ease the burden so that parents can get their kids to school easier, they can get from school to work easier and people can go about their business on a day-to-day basis. The increasing burden of congestion along major arterial roads on weekends has now become so bad that the $295 million is absolutely essential.


Locally, the Roads to Recovery Program will assist the Bayside City Council with upgrades to Outer Crescent in Brighton. There have been some other significant capital investments in the Goldstein electorate under this budget, including the upgrade to the Glen Eira Adult Learning Centre, the Caulfield South Community House's hall renovation, upgraded training lights at the Jack Barker Oval, renovations to the Sandybeach community centre and an upgrade to the Alma Park toddler's playground as part of the Stronger Communities Program, which has invested more than $378,451 in the Goldstein electorate.


The budget shines light onto some shadows that are in desperate need of illumination, particularly in dealing with some of the great social challenges that undermine our cohesive society. One in five Australians experience a mental health condition in a given year. Anxiety and depression cause distress, impacting on functioning and relationships on a day-to-day basis and leading to poor physical health. The budget's $92.4 million investment in frontline mental health services includes $33.8 million for Lifeline, $10.5 million for beyondblue and $2.2 million for Defence Force reservists. There's also $125 million assigned for research through the government's Medical Research Future Fund. That's on top of our ongoing commitment to important youth mental health services, particularly the enduring contribution of headspace. We have a headspace centre in Moorabbin.


As Liberals, our vision is to maximise opportunity for every Australian. That means preparing our national accounts for any external economic shocks that threaten job security and opportunity. This budget recommits the majority of new revenue from a strengthening economy to paying down our national debt. That's it. It's the volcano of debt that could erupt unless we continue on our path to surplus, not in 2021, as has been stated in the past, but in 2019-20 and beyond. For the first time in a decade, the government is being very serious about making sure that we no longer borrow to pay back everyday expenses. With the budget back in the black, government services can continue to deliver better health care and education outcomes but, more critically, provide the economic security that every Australian needs. When we have global economic shocks that sometimes are outside of our control, it's the resilience that we build within our budgetary framework in making sure we have flexibility that provides us security into the future.


What we cannot afford to do is be complacent, as those on the opposition benches would have us do. They would have us sit and think it's okay to accumulate debt and the costs of simply financing it without anything to show for it—to borrow from tomorrow to live it up today. It's a form of intergenerational theft, where money is taken from the future to fund our lifestyles today. It's not just that it's unjust; it is immoral and is a position that we should never stand for.


The return to surplus by the Turnbull government is one of the most critical and significant achievements of this government, and it's the biggest gift that it can give to future generations. This budget is a forward-looking, responsible blueprint for a modern liberal Australia. The Goldstein community has consistently voiced concern over the rising costs of living, the lack of infrastructure investment, particularly by the state government, job security and the challenges of an ageing population. But, more critically, it has consistently raised concerns about the challenges facing our budget and wanting to make sure that a government—their government; the nation's government—is prudent and responsible, exercises spending with caution and seeks to minimise expenses that are unnecessary, to return to a position of surplus so we can start to pay back Labor's debt legacy. That is what this budget does: it delivers opportunity, security and responsibility for our great nation. As a government, we have listened and we have acted.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (15:51):  There are occasions in the government's life when a particular budget epitomises everything that they stand for and what their priorities are. We saw such a budget in 2014, when those opposite were first elected to government under former Prime Minister Abbott, and we well remember the legacy of that budget—and so we should because so much of it still exists in the budget we're confronted with in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-19 and the related appropriation bills today. The budget had at its heart unfairness and it did not pass the test not only of this parliament but of the general public's opinion of what it was trying to do. This budget is exactly the same as that previous budget. Plainly on display are the priorities of the government. I'm sure people will excuse me for borrowing the analogy of the member for Gilmore last week—and the member for Gilmore might be surprised to know that most members of the public probably consider that, if the horse is the government, the jockey would be considered to be the Prime Minister, not herself. You can change the jockey on the horse, but, if that horse is running the same race, you're not going to have any different outcome. That's exactly what is happening with the budget that is before us now. The priorities, the wrong values and the wrong approach to the challenges facing the nation that were encapsulated in that very unfair, discredited 2014 budget are still there in all their tarnished glory in the budget that was announced this month by the Prime Minister. It is both sneaky and unfair, and I want to address some of the most significant concerns that I have with the budget.


The first thing that it puts in headlights before the Australian people is the fact that the government are committed to an $80 billion tax cut for the big end of town. That is their immovable priority; that is what they are determined to have encapsulated in this budget as reflecting their values and their priorities. I would suggest that that is not shared by the vast majority of the Australian population, particularly when you consider that, within that $80 billion, is $17 billion that will go to the big banks, who have hardly covered themselves in glory in recent expositions coming out of the royal commission. It's particularly important to note, if you look at that $17 billion that the big banks will get as a tax cut under the priorities of the government, that that's exactly enough to put back on the table the $17 billion that the government have cut from our schools.


So here you have a contrast between those of us on this side of the House, who believe in investing in the things that make us a fairer, more dynamic country for the future that includes an opportunity for our children to be part of that story, and those on the other side of the House, whose priorities seem to be that big banks, who have been exposed as having not exactly exemplary behaviour and who are also, I have to say, making record profits, desperately need $17 billion in tax cuts, but our kids in our schools who actually need, as my colleague the member for Whitlam has outlined to this House, the investment in their schools, because they're working away in demandable classrooms across my region—they need investment in literacy and numeracy programs and work to be done in programs that ensure that young people in high school are well positioned for TAFE and university study when they leave their school.


All the programs that I've seen across my electorate and I know were happening across electorates around the country were built on the back of the original Gonski agreement, which was needs based and sector-blind funding. This government has rolled up a shonky version of that which is not needs based and sector blind and which cuts $17 billion from schools across the nation, and they have tried to claim that they are actually doing the right thing by kids in our schools. I don't think parents of those children, their families, their carers, the communities they live in or the teachers who spend so much time and energy working to make sure they position them well will agree that that is a reasonable priority for a government to have. And certainly I know that in my electorate many people would share that concern.


There are so many issues in this budget that I want to cover, and I'll take the opportunity to cover them in a number of contributions to the chamber, but, like many of my colleagues, I'm very excited to hear my new colleague's first speech, so I'm only going to take a few minutes to—



Ms Kearney interjecting—




Ms BIRD:
  Please don't apologise; I'm absolutely thrilled to have this dilemma. So I just want to make a few points about what my concerns are in particular. One I've already spoken to the House about is the pea-and-thimble trick that's been played in the aged-care sector. Indeed, I've had many locals in tears on the phone to me about access to home-care package places. There are 105,000 people across the country waiting for a home care package. We got 14,000 in the budget. That's not even going to keep up with increasing demand. That's not even going to manage the demand that grew in the six months since they last tried to do something to address this problem. Those families are under great stress and waiting up to 12 months. Somebody who's been assessed as needing support in their home is waiting 12 months. What does the government think the families are doing in the meantime? This is an enormous pressure and this is a particularly cruel trick—not to mention the fact that, as our shadow minister has highlighted, they also didn't actually put extra money in; they funded that by taking money out of residential aged care, which is also under a lot of pressure.


The second area I'm really angry about is TAFE. I'm very disappointed that the Prime Minister not only made an incorrect claim about the level of debt under the Labor government when they took control but also failed to engage and talk about TAFE. I think the government's record on vocational education, on skills, on providing apprenticeships and on filling the skills shortage which should be addressed by training our own people is that they have been cutting and cutting away at the heart of vocational education every single budget and midyear economic statement. Not a single one has passed where they have missed the opportunity to make another cut, and again and again they tout their Skilling Australia Fund, which they can't actually show has delivered anything in terms of apprentices. There is so much that's wrong. There's so much that goes to the heart of the priority for a government that is completely out of whack with where the community is, what their needs are and what we should be doing as a nation.


This budget, as I said at the beginning, puts their priorities the up in headlights, and I'll tell you what: if they were my priorities over my head, I would be ducking for cover, and I think many of those opposite should be doing the same. You can't prioritise $80 billion to big business with $17 billion to the banks while cutting away at the heart of school, TAFE and university, making sure we won't have the investments that we need. I'll continue to fight, as I know all of my colleagues on this side will, against what are very unfair and poor budget decisions by this government.


Debate adjourned.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:29):  It gives me great pleasure this evening to rise to speak on the appropriation bills for 2018 and 2019. I'd like to start off on the subject of university funding and the recent case of Professor—or now Doctor—Ridd. I'll start with the comments about what John Stuart Mill wrote back in the year 1869 in On Liberty:


The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.


It is that belief that is the reason why we fund our universities with taxpayers' dollars so that they are the bastions of free speech, places where free and open debate are welcome. They become places where dissenting opinions are welcomed, not frowned upon, where alternative views and theories are listened to and tested. The idea of gagging scientists, of silencing academics criticising their university, of having intolerance for different views, where dissent must be crushed rather than encouraged, is a perversion of those words of Mill. It is a perversion of the legacy of the Enlightenment. That is how totalitarian regimes develop and work.


And yet we have the treatment by James Cook University of Professor Ridd. First they tried to punish the professor for simply daring to question the sacred peer review. And these are the words they objected to which Professor Ridd said:


… we can no longer trust the scientific organisations like the Australian Institute of Marine Science, even things like the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies – a lot of this is stuff is coming out, the science is coming out not properly checked, tested or replicated and this is a great shame because we really need to be able to trust our scientific institutions and the fact is I do not think we can any more …


Professor Ridd is merely voicing an alternative opinion. His opinion should be tested against the facts with different hypotheses tested over and over. That is how the scientific method works. But yet, because of those words, there was not only the campaign to curtail Professor Ridd's academic freedom; James Cook University actually made an order that he should not even discuss their campaign to silence and censor him.


And this has gone to the length of absurdities. He was even told not to contact or speak with his wife about the case. He was told that he could not trivialise, satirise or parody James Cook University, and that is what they've accused him of. They've actually accused him of trivialising, satirising and parodying, because he sent a newspaper article about his case to an old friend—merely copied the article—and wrote the words 'for your amusement'. For that, we have a university trying to censor a professor.


But we know what Professor Ridd's real crime was. His real crime was that he dared to question leftist groupthink ideology—an ideology that has a totalitarian mindset that dissenters must be crushed. So I say to those running James Cook University: 'Your targeting and your seeking to silence Professor Ridd are an affront to everything our universities stand for. They are an affront to the very principles of Western civilisation, to the legacy of enlightenment and to our democracy.' When John Stuart Mill used the word 'evil', he said that the particular evil of silencing the expression of opinion is something that we should avoid. I ask those running James Cook University to look at themselves closely, look at the history of the enlightenment and allow Professor Ridd to continue his work. And, if his work is wrong, prove it with science and evidence.


I'd like to address a few other issues during this debate. Firstly, there is the contrast between the coalition and the Labor Party during the budget speech and budget-in-reply speech. We heard the opposition leader, on the night of the budget-in-reply speech, say that he would commit the Labor Party to copying the South Australian experiment—the failed South Australian experiment of a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target which was inflicted upon the poor, long-suffering residents of South Australia. They were turned into guinea pigs for that experiment. What did that experiment deliver—the very experiment that the Leader of the Opposition wants to foist upon the entire nation? It gave that state not only the highest electricity prices in the nation but, unbelievably, it gave that state the highest electricity prices in the world. That is what the Leader of the Opposition wants to copy and inflict upon the nation.


The Labor Party talk about the greater happiness for the mass of the people. That 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target resulted in South Australia having the highest rate of disconnections in the nation. In fact, they went to a 130 per cent increase in disconnections. In 2009-10 in the state of South Australia, there were 4,748 disconnections—people having electricity turned off. Fast forward: once they'd implemented the wonderful policy of a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target, in 2016-17 there were 10,902 households in South Australia that had their electricity disconnected—a 130 per cent increase. That is what the Labor Party want to inflict on all of Australia. How does a family operate if they've had their electricity disconnected? How do their kids do their homework at night? How do they cook their evening meal? How do they keep food fresh in a refrigerator if they have no electricity after it was cut off? And yet the policies of the Australian Labor Party are to introduce and copy the very policies that saw a 130 per cent increase in South Australian households having their electricity cut off.


We have seen from the Australian Energy Regulator what it has done to the average debt. While the average electricity bill debt in Queensland is $650 and in New South Wales it is $850, in the state of South Australia it is $1,200, almost 50 per cent higher. What that means is that residents in South Australia have less money in their pocket to spend on services, at the local shops or at the local cafe. They have less money to buy something extra for their kids or something nice or to save money for a holiday, because they have to put more money aside for electricity. We are talking about a $550 difference between Queensland and South Australia in what they have to pay on their bill, yet this is the policy that the Labor Party want to inflict on all of Australia.


It doesn't stop there. We also have seen the Labor Party commit to upping the Paris targets. They think the Paris targets that we have committed to are not high enough. They want to up it to a 45 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.


So I would ask the members of the Labor Party this. We know what your plans are for electricity. We know how your plans proceed. We know exactly what happens. We have the example of the state of South Australia. But can you tell us: how are you going to get a 45 per cent reduction in emissions in the transport sector? Are you going to put up the price of petrol? Are you going to put up the price of registration? Are you going to take cars from people? Explain to the Australian public how you are going to get a 45 per cent reduction in transport. How are the Labor Party going to get a 45 per cent reduction in emissions in the agricultural sector? What do they have planned for the farmers of this nation if they inflict or force upon them a 45 per cent reduction? What about industry, which uses gas? How are they going to get a 45 per cent reduction there? Quite simply, we'll close the businesses down, put the workers out of work and send the production offshore. Is that the plan that the Australian Labor Party have? What about gas for home heating? How does the Labor Party intend to get a 45 per cent reduction in the emissions from people using gas for their home heating? Do you expect people to sit shivering in the cold so we can achieve some sort of virtue signalling and so you can run around and say, 'Yes, we've achieved our targets?' This is what the Australian people need to know. This is what the Labor Party need to explain about their policies. We know the damage that they are going to cause in the electricity sector, but tell us: what are your policies on transport to get those reductions, what are your policies on agriculture, what are your policies for industry, and what are your policies for gas and heating?


Finally, this is where we see the greatest difference between the coalition and the opposition. We see the difference in speech after speech in this chamber. Members of the Labor Party simply think the size of our economic pie is fixed. They think the wealth that we've created just arrives naturally and it's just a matter of carving it up in a way that they see as fair and equitable. This is a mistake that, as we've seen in nation after nation, has sent countries backwards, because the size of the economy is not fixed. The wealth that we have in this nation depends on the hard work, the entrepreneurial efforts and the risk taking of the Australian citizen.


That's why we think that it is best policy to lower the corporate rate of tax, because we know that we need to have that corporate rate of tax internationally competitive. How long can we continue with a 30 per cent corporate tax rate, stuck at that level since the year 2000, if we see all our international competitors lowering their corporate rate of tax? We see the US bringing it back to 21 per cent. We see the UK bringing it back to 19 per cent. We see Hong Kong and Singapore at 15 and 17 per cent. How can we attract investment if we are going to have a 30 per cent corporate tax rate, plus a top marginal rate of tax of 49 per cent, where 50 per cent of every extra dollar that someone earns goes to the government? These are the destroyers of the incentives that create the wealth in our nation.


There cannot be greater clarity between what the opposition plans for this nation and what the coalition does. We see the plans of the opposition. They will give us uncompetitive energy prices. They'll copy South Australia and give us the highest prices in the world. They'll make transport unaffordable for many Australians. They'll make our corporate rate of tax uncompetitive. If we have those things uncompetitive, how can we in this nation therefore afford to pay the wages that we'd like to see? How can we increase people's wages if more and more of every business's expenses has to go to a higher and higher electricity bill to meet some artificial target so the Labor Party can go around in their electorates and virtue-signal to the Greens to try to get their preferences?


This is the choice that is coming, and it is a stark choice. It is about a coalition government acting responsibly, bringing the budget back to a balance, then to a surplus and then paying down that debt as the coalition government have done and succeeded at before. The alternative is a reckless Labor Party that will spend and spend money we don't have, make our nation uncompetitive and destroy wealth. (Time expired)

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (16:45):  It gives me great pleasure to rise on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019. I would have to say that I've been in this place 10 years now and back in the electorate there is the best response to a budget I've ever met. It's been a tough decade for Australian taxpayers and, after the 4½ years since the coalition came to government, at last a surplus is in sight. It's not the member for Lilley's fake promises. It's not the, 'We'll be back in the black by 2012-13,' as promised by the member for Lilley. It's not the 'My commitment to a surplus in 2012-13 was a promise made and it will be honoured,' as the then Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in April 2011. It's not a hundred other quotes announcing the surplus being delivered when the record shows six years of multibillion-dollar deficits under the former Labor government.


It's been hard work since that time, in the 4½ years of the coalition government. Since coming to government, the coalition has applied a steady handbrake on growth to government expenditure. It's not a brick wall that would have stalled the economy, no slashing of jobs and no savage cuts, but gentle pressure across the board that has allowed for growth in government expenditure, has increased services and, most importantly, has promoted growth in the country. I think perhaps the most important news in the budget is that we do return to surplus next year, a year earlier than we predicted. Contrast that to the former government, where the surplus just kept getting postponed and put further and further out. In fact, this government, with a sustained effort, will bring in a surplus 12 months earlier than predicted. This is an enormous turnaround, and we have gotten there by underpromising and overdelivering—always a very good path for governments.


The brightest part of the economy is the jobs growth, with 427,000 in the last 12 months, and one million new jobs since the coalition was elected in 2013. It doesn't happen by accident. One million new jobs means there are one million people that are no longer on new start; one million people that are paying tax and contributing to the wealth of this nation; and one million people that will are renting and building houses and installing a new kitchen in their house, giving jobs to other people.


The budget delivers immediate tax relief for middle-income earners. Within four years, the government will remove the 37-cents-in-the-dollar rate completely. Now, a lot of rubbish has been spoken about the changes the government proposes in taxation. I would love to wax lyrical about that and point out all of those errors, but there is a bill coming up on this matter in the next 24 or 48 hours, and I'll reserve my comments on the changes to the tax rates to that debate.


There is a whole raft of good news. In Grey, without doubt, the big ticket item in infrastructure is the commitment to duplicate the Joy Baluch AM Bridge at Port Augusta. For those of you that don't know—I know, of course, you would, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons—all of the north-south traffic through Central Australia and all of the east-west traffic across the south of Australia passes over this single bridge at Port Augusta. It is the only viable link between the east and west of Port Augusta. Emergency services can be sidelined if traffic is interrupted on the bridge. Yorkeys Crossing, which is the alternative crossing, is around about a 30-kilometre diversion around the northern swampland of the gulf. It is sometimes suspect and sometimes closed because of wet weather. That has been the fail-safe measure here. I point out that all of the emergency services in Port Augusta are located on the east side, and there is a substantial population living on the west side. You can imagine what would happen if the bridge happened to be out of commission when one of those emergencies eventuated.


East and west Port Augusta were first joined in 1927 by the Great Western Bridge, a wooden bridge which still stands but looks more like a jetty than a bridge—a wooden structure. It was superseded in 1972 by the now-named Joy Baluch AM Bridge. That bridge has served us and the nation—I've talked about the crossflow of traffic and freight across the nation—well since then. However, the designs of 1972 are quite different to today's, and that bridge, as part of its features, has a narrow walkway to the side of the road. This walkway is about 1.4 metres wide, and two gophers can't pass each other if they meet on the walkway. The other day, a lady was pushing a pram with twins in it—the side-by-side arrangement, Deputy Speaker Irons; you would be quite familiar with it—across the bridge, and the pedestrian they encountered had to step onto the roadway to go around the pram. It is obviously not a safe arrangement. In fact, schools are now bussing children from one side of the gulf to the other. Parents draw their breath when their children ride across the bridge on the walkway. They are millimetres from 100-tonne-plus road trains. It's an accident waiting to happen.


Up until April last year it all worked okay, until Port Augusta City Council, which now owns the Great Western Bridge, closed the bridge—the old wooden walkway I talked about earlier—which had fallen into a dilapidated state. These things happen; the bridge had to be closed. Of course, the old wooden bridge was where the pedestrians in Port Augusta had been crossing the gulf since 1972. It forced all of the foot traffic onto the Joy Baluch AM Bridge—and I've described that walkway. I raised this issue with the former South Australian government, along with the then minister for transport, the member for Gippsland. I asked for an engineering report with suggestions on how to install a safe, separated walkway on the bridge. In the almost 12 months through to the state election it never came. I could not believe it. Despite my repeated calls for the state minister to come up with an engineering report on what was the state's bridge it never came. I had great concern for safety in the city.


So the caravan's moved on. In the lead up to the election, I met with a number of business groups. I met with SACOME, the South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy. Their No. 1 priority was the duplication of the bridge across the gulf. I was very pleased indeed when that wish, if you like, was granted in the budget. $160 million committed from the federal government to partner the Marshall state government on an 80-20 basis. Let me say, what a pleasure it is to work with a government that is open for building infrastructure in rural and regional areas. We were able to strike a deal quite quickly. It's a huge investment. It will be quite disruptive, and I ask residents to be somewhat patient, because we know that none of the work has been done on this bridge at this stage. We will need such things as native title clearance, EPA clearance and coastal protection clearance. We don't know exactly where the bridge is going to go and whose houses and businesses might have to be removed as a result of building that bridge. We have no designs at this stage. We are starting from scratch and it will take a little bit of time.


There has been a bit of sniping about the projections in the budget for the expenditure. There's $60 million in the forward estimates. The extra $100 million lies in the projections. Let me say, if we are running in front of the time frame that Treasury predicts to build this bridge, we will find the money. You will not find that this government is holding up the construction of that bridge. I'll be putting pressure on at every level to make sure that we get on with this job, because this is very important. If we are seen to be dragging our heels and something bad happens—I don't even want to contemplate that. I am just so thankful that we've got this commitment from the federal government and that we have this commitment from the Marshall state government.


So that's the big ticket item in Grey. But, let me tell you, there are a lot of extra things in the budget, many of which I and others like me have been lobbying for. In aged care we have an extra 14,000 home-care packages to go along with the 6,000 that the minister allocated in the MYEFO last December. That is 20,000 packages. We know this is still not going to be enough to fill the backlog, but it is an enormous commitment. The Minister for Aged Care has taken this chamber through a process where he has actually drawn in the numbers, so we now understand what that backlog is. It's an enormous commitment and I thank him very much for it. He's also put aside money to help rural aged-care facilities. They can apply to it for capital grants, and I have quite a number that are looking for any kind of assistance they can get. Delivering aged-care services in the country is more expensive than delivering them in the city, and we need to recognise that. These smaller facilities, which are suboptimal in size, are so important to their local communities. As much as is humanly possible, people need to be able to age within their own communities where they are supported by friends and family.


Also in the budget—and I think this is very important—there is an increase, from $250 to $300 per fortnight, in the amount that age pensioners can earn before it will affect their pension. They will applaud this. There is an extension of the $20,000 automatic tax write-off for small businesses—for all businesses, in fact. This has been a very popular measure in the last few years, and I applaud the fact we've been able to extend that. We've raised the threshold for qualification for independent youth allowance. It does raise my eyebrow, I must say, that the independent youth allowance is dependent on what your parents earn. It seems to me that 'independent' would indicate that the student is independent. But we have lifted that threshold where they can apply from $150,000 to $160,000, with an extra $10,000 for each student that is under that parent's responsibility at that stage.


From 1 July there's a new package for parents needing childcare. It will make a considerable difference to working parents. There's a further $200 million on offer for another round of the Building Better Regions Fund. We've had quite a number of very good projects funded throughout the Grey electorate under this program. We always have lots of applications, and I'm looking forward to trying to partner again with those people putting applications into the next round. We have a commitment to a fourth round of the Stronger Communities Program. Once again, this is at the lower end, the grassroots, of community, where we see grants of from $2,000 to maybe $20,000. These are grants that make an enormous difference to voluntary organisations.


The budget committed an extra $550 million for the Stronger Rural Health Strategy. Many times I've spoken in this chamber about the challenges of finding GPs to work in rural Australia, and the suggestions that I've brought forward include something that has not been picked up yet: postcode-specific Medicare provider numbers. This is a constant issue for those of us who live in the country. In fact, at this stage, the electorate of Grey is 29 GPs short. That is up from a figure of around 19 eighteen months ago, and I'm very concerned. That's why I'm pleased the government is making a considerable commitment in this area, including upskilling existing doctors so they feel better prepared to deal with whatever the practice may throw at them, and increasing the number of placements for undergraduates to experience something of rural living while they're going through their training program.


Something that many schools around my electorate will be celebrating is a commitment to permanent funding of the School Chaplaincy Program. This is a program that was created by the coalition. It was altered somewhat during the Labor years, but we brought it back in its original form. It is extremely popular. The schools just lap it up, I have to say. When we're talking about issues in this place such as mental health and our young people needing assistance, a quiet hand and someone to go to to talk about issues, the School Chaplaincy Program is really delivering.


So, right across the board, I welcome the budget. As I said, it's probably the one that has gone down the best in the entire time that I've spent in this chamber.

Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (17:00):  I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and the related bills. As has been said, this side of the House will be supporting supply. It is for this reason that I support these bills, which will appropriate about $7.9 billion for the remainder of this financial year and then around $108 billion for the 2018-19 financial year.


But my support for supply is in no way support for the unfair Liberal budget we have just witnessed. This budget is just like every other Liberal budget in that it fail the fairness test. While this is not unexpected, it is always disappointing. It is disappointing to see a federal government so committed to giving its friends at the top end of town an $80 billion tax handout but happy to cast aside the needs—yes, the needs—of children, the elderly and the sick. Instead of investing in schools, TAFEs and universities, instead of investing in hospitals and Medicare and instead of investing in the welfare of pensioners, this government is instead taking care of big business. It is taking care of the multinationals and it is taking care of the banks. I know the banks are having a bit of a rough trot at the moment, courtesy of the banking royal commission, but surely those opposite must question the need to make them feel better at the cost of $17 billion. A cynic in the room could even be forgiven for thinking that the $17 billion was by way of a mock apology for a banking royal commission that this government clearly did not want to have. This government stonewalled the banking royal commission for more than 600 days. It did everything it could to prevent the shocking and unacceptable banking practices that are now front-page news from being exposed. But, thanks to Labor's long and hard fight for the banking royal commission, the government capitulated and we are gaining an insight into how customers have been disgracefully treated by the banks.


This government ought to think long and hard about rewarding this behaviour, especially when we consider what is not being rewarded in this budget. The more than generous $80 billion in tax handouts to the top end of town have to be paid for from somewhere. Let's think about this for a moment. The government is giving $17 billion to the big banks and taking $17 billion out of education. So, on the one hand, it is giving $17 billion to the banks and, on the other hand, it is taking $17 billion out of the education portfolio. That truly is unbelievable. Unfortunately for the mums and dads worried about their children's education, unfortunately for those in the community who are sick or have ill family members and unfortunately for those pensioners who rely on the energy supplement to get by, that handout is being paid for with savage cuts to education, health and the pension. This government has plans to persist with its $715 million in cruel cuts to hospitals during the next two years, with further cuts locked in for the five years from 2020. Those opposite are forcing up the out-of-pocket costs on patients needing to see specialists by keeping the Medicare freeze in place. Do they not understand how this is hurting struggling households having difficulty with living pressures and how it is hurting those struggling with low and stagnant wage growth and others struggling with cuts to their wages of up to $77 per week, thanks to this government's shameful stance on penalty rates?


Difficult choices are being made around this country when it comes to things such as private health cover. When you are paying more and more for less and less, you'll find that people start ditching their private health insurance because they can no longer afford the annual price hikes and they can no longer see the point of private health insurance. So how about the government looks to address this affordability crisis, instead of rewarding those with at least an $80 billion windfall? The same applies to education. Cutting $17 billion from schools, as I said before, and cutting another $270 million from TAFE—where is the sense in this? To my mind, and to the minds of most Australians, the last thing we should be doing is stripping money from education. Rather, we should be investing in it and doing all that we can to encourage further investment in education.


I do not know how this government thinks this country can continue to ensure we will have a supply of skilled and trained workers when it continues to strip funding from vocational education. The whopping $3 billion ripped from vocational education has not been enough for Prime Minister Turnbull's government. This budget includes a further $270 million worth of cuts to TAFE and apprentices. I suggest the education minister take time to actually learn what TAFE is all about and how important it is in training Australians for all types of work.


Seriously, have we ever had to withstand a worse education minister in this country? Has there ever been an education minister more out of touch with universities, with TAFEs and even with the early childhood sector? The technical and further education system deserves more than the elitist and dismissive attitude of Senator Birmingham, and apprentices and those in technical education deserve more than the stripping of essential funding by the senator. It's time someone in the government woke up the education minister, gave him a good old shove and stopped him bagging a reputable institution that delivers much more than energy healing and basket weaving. The education minister showed his ignorance of the university sector when he proclaimed that they operate on rivers of gold. Anyone who has anything to do with the sector, anyone who has worked in it and anyone with a skerrick of interest in universities knows that this is only a misguided and dangerous fantasy. He showed his disdain for and ignorance of the TAFE sector as he casually dismissed the efforts of all those TAFE students currently studying. In case those opposite cannot assist the minister for education in learning what goes on in a TAFE, I'm going to take you through some of the many courses and examples of trades training delivered at South Metropolitan TAFE, which includes the Rockingham campus in my electorate of Brand: aero skills and skills in avionics, aviation—a commercial pilot licence—marine craft construction, maritime operations and marine engineering, engineering—industrial electrician, accounting, project management and nursing. The list goes on but, alas, there is no basket weaving or energy healing on offer at the moment.


I think the education minister doesn't really like the portfolio he's been given. He has shown his ignorance of the university sector, his disdain for TAFE and vocational education, and his utter ignorance of and inability to learn anything about early childhood learning and its funding. Given the magnitude of the cuts the minister for education is applying to the sector, it makes me suspect that Minister Birmingham is perhaps auditioning for another role in this government. Perhaps he's auditioning for the Finance portfolio, but of course we know it's going to take quite a few levers to get Senator Cormann out of that role.


While Minister Birmingham has cut into schools and TAFE, that doesn't complete the education trifecta. Of course, universities and higher education are the other place where this government has delivered cuts in very real and dangerous spades. I worked in the university sector before entering this place, so I speak from experience when I talk about how damaging this government's attack on the sector is and the dreadful impact it is having on our institutions, the staff and, most importantly, the students.


The ruthless cuts of this government started before my being elected to this place in 2016. The 2014 budget was just the start of a long and sustained attack on Australians' right, regardless of their bank balance, to a university degree. It's a right based on ability, not bankability. There is still $2.2 billion in university cuts entrenched in the Treasurer's latest budget, despite the voices of many in the field telling how bad it is.


I have met with vice-chancellors and senior staff from three universities in Western Australia: UWA, which stands to lose $38 million, Curtin University, which stands to lose $86 million, and Murdoch University, which stands to lose $35 million from this budget. When the cuts to Edith Cowan University, which are $49 million, are added, this creates a cut of over $208 million from universities for my state of Western Australia. This is utterly unacceptable.


I've said this before: I can only imagine that it's the intention of this government, by putting universities in a funding vice, to push institutions toward instituting higher fees. What we are seeing is the opportunity for a better future that a higher education affords being taken away from those who cannot afford it. I have been to many open days and other university events, and I have talked to students and staff about how these cuts will impact them, and their views aren't positive. Their reality isn't positive. Instead of helping young people to start out on what should be one of the most exciting times as a young adult, we are saddling them with doubt, stress and debt.


I'd like to commend the work of the National Union of Students on their Build a Better Budget campaign. They are campaigning hard for a better deal for university students around the country. Those opposite would do well to listen to student-led grassroots campaigns like this one, and they would do well to work for better standards for students and to increase federal funding for universities around the country. Labor has committed to reversing the savage cuts to the university sector and to moving towards having 200,000 extra Australians attending university, effectively abolishing the Prime Minister's unfair cap on university student places. Labor has always been the only party serious about improving education standards and opportunities in Australia and will continue to be the only party to ensure that those commitments are met. It might seem like a cliched expression, but stating the obvious is somehow helpful in this place: young people are the future. We should be adequately funding, growing and adapting our education institutions to ensure that young Australians who aspire to reach a little higher through the Australian education system have the opportunity to do so. Increased cost of higher education will be unmanageable for many.


People are doing it tough when it comes to managing their household budget—faced with the rising cost of living and housing affordability pressures and when faced with underemployment and stagnated wage growth. Some of the most vulnerable people who are dealing with these pressures are doing it on a pension, a fixed income with no wriggle room. How is this government is taking care of them? The answer is that it's not. What it's doing instead is slashing the energy supplement from their pension and leaving a $14 hole in a pensioner's fortnightly pay. For many that will be a very difficult hole to fill. Fourteen dollars might not seem like much to those opposite, but it is when you're on a fixed income, when your pension is carefully budgeted to pay for essentials such as food, rent, heating and power. This burden should not be put on older people in our community. It will cause immeasurable stress on our elderly and vulnerable, and I for one take no comfort in their sacrifice to the big end of town's $80 billion tax handout.


But the vulnerable, regardless of where they are, are an easy target for some. This budget has extended the freeze in foreign aid funding, which is effectively another cut in funding, this time of $140 million, to some of the most desperate and poorest people in the world. Australia's overseas development assistance is at a record low, and the foreign minister has presided over more than $11 billion in cuts to date. The whole point of foreign aid, according to DFAT, is to promote our national interests by promoting prosperity, reducing poverty and enhancing stability, with a focus on our neighbourhood, but here we are as a country slashing our aid budget and undermining our role and responsibilities as a leader in our region.


In this budget, the government has given billions of dollars to those who do not need it, and those who need support most are paying for it. There is another way, a fairer way, of delivering a budget that Australia needs and deserves. Labor's approach to the budget is fair and responsible. It does not squeeze the most vulnerable to benefit the most well off. It is considered when it comes to budget repair. We'll deliver better funding for public hospitals, with every single public hospital benefitting from Labor's investment. Labor's $2.8 billion investment in hospitals will reverse the cruel cuts employed by this government. It will fund more beds, more services and more staff. Our plan will also deliver lower taxes for 10 million working Australians, and we'll also restore Sunday penalty rates. In fact, Labor's plan will see workers who earn up to $125,000 a year paying less tax than they would otherwise pay under this government, with more than four million people in this country getting a tax cut.


As I said before, Labor will abolish Prime Minister Turnbull's cap on university places, which denies disadvantaged students access to university. We introduced the demand driven funding system, a system which enabled more people to go to uni and that allowed an additional 190,000 students to get a place at one of the higher education institutions around this country. This is important when you consider that research tells us that by 2020—in only two years—two out of every three jobs created in this country will require a diploma or other higher education qualification. Investing in higher education place and young people's access to it is a smart thing to do and the right thing to do. We will also abolish upfront fees for 100,000 TAFE places in courses where Australia needs the skills. I would be more than happy to show Senator Birmingham, the supposed Minister for Education, around my local TAFE and show him firsthand what a vital institution it is and for him to meet with some young people engaged in vocational training. It might help open his eyes to the real world, where investment in vocational education delivers skilled workers. For that matter, I'd be very pleased to take him around a university as well.


Labor can deliver on our commitments because we put people ahead of big business and the banks and because that $80 billion of tax windfall to the top end of town can be much better used to deliver for more people in our country. We'll be guided by clear fiscal principles that repair the budget in a fair way. We will not ask the most vulnerable to carry the heaviest burden. Tough calls have been made on tax reform, but they are fair calls: negative gearing, capital gains tax, trusts, and dividend imputation refundability. We will close loopholes to those who need them least. Our plan is fairer and more responsible because we've made the big calls and we've got them right. (Time expired)

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-05-21,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (17:15):  It gives me great pleasure to speak about the budget, because the budget is a very important part of governing. Ultimately, the first role of this government is the defence of the Australian people, to ensure that Australians are safe and that provision is made for our welfare. The next is to create an economy that rewards endeavour. You have to reward endeavour, because the government doesn't have any money; the government only has your money. We need to get that clear: we spend your money, and it needs to be spent responsibly. But we also, if we can, should give some back, because an economy has to create endeavour. Those who get out of bed earlier than others—those who take risks—ultimately need to get rewarded for that. If you fail to grasp that, you get to a point where you stifle the money that comes into this place and the country becomes poorer. Ultimately, a country is rich when its citizens are rich. I think that is the difference and the contrast between how we view a budget and how the Australian Labor Party views a budget. In this budget, we must make sure we look after those who can't look after themselves. We have a duty of care to our senior Australians. We have a duty of care to educate the future and to look after our children. We also have a duty of care to be a beacon to other countries in the world, and I will touch on Australian aid in this budget as well.


Let's just run through this: in 2007, the nation had no government debt, and now we have government debt of $349.9 billion. That is partly from the years of the Labor Party in power, but we have also run deficit budgets ourselves, so we need to look very clearly at that. This year the budget will have a deficit of $18.2 billion and next year a deficit of $14.5 billion, but by 2019-20 we will have a surplus budget of $2.2 billion. I need to make it very clear for those who might be listening that a surplus budget does not mean we no longer have debt. A surplus budget simply means that we have spent less money than we have received, and that then affords us the opportunity to start to pay down debt. We have a long way to go. In 2020-21 we will have an $11 billion surplus, and in 2021-22 there is a projected surplus of $16.6 billion. But that is still only chipping away at the debt.


But I think there are some very good things in this budget contained in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019, and it's about investing in growth and investing in incentives. I want to just touch on the $530 tax rebate for the people who live in my patch. Seventy-three per cent of the people who live in my patch earn under $87,000. The electorate of Mallee is not an electorate made up of people who are very rich. We're not an inner city Sydney or a Brighton or some of those suburbs in Melbourne, but we are very fair and decent people. So we will be quite appreciative of this tax cut.


I noticed that someone put on my Facebook, 'You can keep my $10, and that should go to health and education.' I replied very quickly that I can give you some schools and some hospitals in my patch that would happily take his donation of $530. He didn't reply, and I put that challenge out there. But can I say that that does create incentive, and $530 for those people in that year will be spinning through our local economy. They will spend it on essential things. That's a family trip to the pool. That's a little camping trip on the Murray, a great place. Spinning money through our economy is very important to our country towns. We have over 17,000 small businesses in the electorate of Mallee, and they will benefit from the $20,000 instant tax write-off. There are things that you can deduct instantly to make your business grow. I think that's been very welcome.


One of the things I'm particularly proud of in this budget is addressing health concerns. Unfortunately, we have a shortage of general practitioners in my patch. If you're a general practitioner who has tuned in on the radio, listening to the great debate in parliament, because that's what a good general practitioner should do, can I just say that there are very welcoming people in my patch who would love to have you. Part of this budget is that we have invested $550 million into a stronger rural health strategy. This means that GPs will be able to train in a regional area from start to finish. More than that, there's going to be the opportunity for a graduate who practices in a rural area to have a Medicare provider number, so they will be able to practice. Also, there will be support around graduate positions. What was happening was that people would train in the regions but then have to go to the city for those graduate years, and somehow the attraction of the great lights of the city—whether they fell in love or enjoyed the coffee—meant they didn't come back. Just on that, I might point out that Mildura was the second city in Victoria to get a barista, so if you want good coffee as a GP, you can get it in our part of the world.


There's been some good money put aside for regional development, with round 3 of the Building Better Regions Fund. This is the fund that in our patch has built the Swan Hill saleyards upgrade; the Horsham North Children's Hub; some facilities around recreational lakes, like Tchum Lake, Watchem Lake, Wooroonook Lake; the Mildura runway upgrade; and, recently, the Mallee Accommodation and Support Program facilities, which got $2.4 million, for which I did a sod turning the other day. Having that fund so that councils and communities can work with me to try and tender for it has also been welcome.


I am very pleased to see more money for education in our patch. There are 119 schools in the electorate of Mallee, and every one of those schools gets more. One of the things I've been advocating for, surprisingly, more than anything in the lead-up to the budget, was the school chaplaincy program. Because some of my country schools are reasonably small country schools, they wouldn't have an opportunity to have a school counsellor or wouldn't be able to afford a school counsellor. I was very pleased to see that the National School Chaplaincy Program of $247 million over the forward estimates has been committed. When I started as a member of parliament five years ago I was pulled aside by a young lady, who was 17, and her dad. They said they were in Swan Hill and that there were no mental health support services at all for her when she was going through a difficult time. We now have three headspaces in the electorate of Mallee, in Mildura, Swan Hill and Horsham, combined with the school chaplaincy programs. So they have that initial point of contact within the school network and can be directed to headspace for more clinical support. It makes me very pleased that we are addressing the needs of youth mental health in the great electorate of Mallee.


We have massive infrastructure needs in our patch. One of the great things I've got to say about my electorate is that we are a net contributor to the Australian economy, with $5.3 billion annually of agricultural product being produced—not bad—with only 140,000 residents of Australia. But those things have to be carted on rail or on roads. I was pleased to see that the federal budget continues to fund the Murray Basin Rail Project, with a $440 million upgrade. We are now seeing upgrades on our roads. Of course, something I'd like to see more of, frankly, is Roads to Recovery. There is no point producing something on a farm and not being able to get that onto a national road. You still need to be able to get that 60-tonne B-double down that dirt country road to get the product to the market. I think we should be doing more, and we should continue a higher allocation of that.


One of the things that is also very relevant to the people in my patch is funding for pensioners. Now, I'm going to touch on this a little bit. There are 20,234 pensioners in the electorate of Mallee. Whilst I was pleased to see that a pensioner can earn $300 per fortnight without it upsetting their pension payments, I would have liked to have seen that able to be accumulated in a lump sum and then averaged across a year. I will explain why this is. Three hundred dollars per fortnight is $7,800 over a 12-month period.


Increasingly, many of our senior Australians are going to be an important aspect of filling the labour shortage, particularly in a horticultural region. I was at Boundary Bend Olives the other day, and they were picking their olive harvest. They were employing 130 people for about an eight-week period. They have people who tend to be grey nomads who come in and work. Once they've worked the harvest, they will go up to Queensland and spend the money there, or maybe they'll even go down to Tasmania and spend the money down there, which would make some members in this place very happy—or even across to South Australia, if they're really scraping the barrel for places they might go to visit!


We should be empowering them to do that seasonal work. Rather than making it just $300 per fortnight, it makes sense that they could accumulate $7,800—so work a vintage, work a season in horticulture or work somewhere—and then go away and take their holidays, and they will largely spend that money locally. So, whilst I'm very pleased to see that our pensioners can earn a little bit more without it upsetting their pension, I would like that to be able to be accumulated and then averaged over a 12-month period both to provide an incentive for our workforce in our horticultural industry and to create more flexibility for our senior Australians who choose to do something in the workforce. I've got to say: pensioners have a lot of skills. We should empower them. They've still got a lot to offer Australia.


One thing I think we need to look at very seriously in a welfare payment—and it concerns me a great deal—is the impacts on single pensioners. If you are two pensioners living in a household, by the time you pay your rates and by the time you pay your power bill, you can get through. It's not a rich, vibrant living, but you can get through. But what happens when one of those pensioners passes away? The rates still need to be paid. The power bill still needs to be paid. I think that, if there's one thing in the welfare budget that we should look at some increases in, it should be that single widow pension. I think that would be a very interesting and compassionate response, particularly when people find themselves in those hardships, and in the light of the expenses of daily living.


I was very pleased to see $51.3 million put aside for agricultural counsellors. It's one thing to have a free trade agreement, but a free trade agreement simply opens an opportunity. There's no point having an opportunity unless you can turn an opportunity into a reality. A lot of our producers produce very, very good product. In my patch, there is really nothing you can eat that isn't grown in the Mallee, be it table grapes, be it carrots—25 per cent of Australia's carrots—or be it citrus. I was told once that the only thing you can't catch in the Mallee is a Murray cod, because technically it's on the South Australian side once you get on the water, and all that water is making its good way down to South Australia to be used effectively there as well. You've got to be able to turn those opportunities into reality, and the additional $51.3 million to do that is very welcome.


As well, something that, whilst not in the budget, slipped through the radar for many people is the unlocking of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan that came with the SDLs. I'll explain why this is relevant to my patch. One of the great lessons we've learnt out of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is that you can achieve good environmental outcomes with the investment of some pumps, some dams, some risers and a culvert here or there. People may not have realised this, but there will be $300 million worth of investment—think about that: $300 million worth of investment—in the electorate of Mallee to deliver seven environmental water projects, and they have to be built by 2024. Whilst the budget was going on here, in the other chamber over there they were passing the SDLs. This will achieve better management of our water as well as unleashing quite a substantial amount of infrastructure that has to take place in my patch.


One of the other great things in the budget, which is a small thing, which appeals to me as an aviator as well as a farmer, was $260 million for the GPS satellite based augmentation strategy. For people who don't understand what that is—I first saw this in Canada—essentially you can have inter-row sowing and GPS technology. Instead of it taking five metres, it will get it down to 10 centimetres, so the accuracy is substantially improved. There's also a big advantage for aviators—and I am one—in being able to do GPS approaches to airports.


There are a lot of good things in this budget. There are a lot of things to be proud of. There are things that we can do better, and we should always have that robust debate. I do not hold the view that everything we do on our side of the parliament is perfect and everything the other side does is wrong and evil, or vice versa, but we need to ensure that we spend Australians' money wisely, create incentive and look after those who can't look after themselves. I think this is a very fair and reasonable budget.

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (17:30):  I often end up following the member for Mallee's speeches for some reason. He's a good speaker and I do enjoy listening to his contributions. I'd like to say a couple of things, if you don't mind, Deputy Speaker, following his contribution. He mentioned the instant asset write-off. I'm very proud that the government had included this. I would remind him that in 2013, when the coalition came to government, they axed the instant asset write-off that was in place under Labor. They killed it stone dead, much to my disappointment. So I was very pleased to see it return, member for Mallee. It was a good decision and one that Labor has been backing all the way through. He made mention of the Building Better Regions Fund and round 3. I'm very disappointed that in Tasmania we've seen very little of this money. I look forward to perhaps seeing a little more of it. Maybe they'll open it up in time for the Braddon by-election and we'll see some rolling in.




Mr Broad:
  Heaven forbid!




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  Yes, heaven forbid! We heard the Prime Minister today talk about the supposed falsehood of education cuts. We all know that schools had funding budgeted to them. It was in the budget papers in black and white. A certain figure was in the budget papers a couple of years ago and that figure was cut. So it's good to see that funding in total is now on the increase, but that's from a low base—a base that's already been cut. There'd be a lot more money for schools in your electorate, member for Mallee, if those cuts had not been made by this Treasurer.


I come to the budget. Two weeks ago, we listened as a Liberal Treasurer handed down a Liberal budget that again failed the fairness test. There was a $17 billion handout for big banks while cutting $17 billion from schools. What illustrates a budget that's unfair better than that? Here we have banks before a royal commission admitting to things like forging signatures, charging dead people fees and charging for services that were not delivered. So here we have the banks admitting to all of these things and this government's tough action for those crimes is to give them $17 billion in tax breaks. A round of applause for the tough action of this government! There was a $17 billion handout for banks while cutting $17 billion from schools. New aged-care packages are paid for by stripping the residential aged-care places. There is not one extra dollar for aged care; just a shuffling of the deck. There is a $270 million cut for TAFE. What a great way to train Aussie kids for jobs of the future: cutting their pathways to that future by cutting TAFE and training on top of the government's entire axing of the trade training centre program when it first came to government in 2013! I think that was one of the most scandalous decisions of this government. Those trade training centres were a project of the former Prime Minister, John Howard. I would have thought the Liberals would have been proud of that program. Labor liked that program and we kept it in place when we were in government. It worked. It gave kids who wanted to train for the future a place to gain skills, and one of the very first acts of the Liberals upon coming to power was to axe trade training centres. That cut, the cuts to TAFE and the drop in apprenticeships of 130,000 over the last five years all add up to a government that is not looking after the interests of young people. Thank you, Member for Mallee!


The government will make a $127 million cut to the ABC, all because this organisation dares to report news that this government doesn't like and airs opinions this government doesn't agree with. There's no reason I can think of as to why this government would be cutting that sort of money from the ABC other than just sheer malice against the national broadcaster. They might think they're being a bit smart in doing it, but we're talking about a funding cut that will result in less money for children's broadcasting, less money for drama production, less money for news and current affairs and, as far as I'm concerned, less money for regional and rural reporting. The ABC does a wonderful job in the regions in bringing the stories of country Australia to the rest of Australia, and that will all be put at risk because of this government's petty vindictiveness. The list goes on.


The big shining light of this budget, apparently, is a $10 a week, or about $540 a year, tax cut for working Australians. That's lorded as the government's major achievement of this budget—a 10-bucks-a-week tax cut. But they keep quiet about the more than $7,000 a year that they plan to give back to high-income earners, like every member in this place, bank executives, lawyers and highly paid surgeons. Anybody on more than $200,000 a year, by the time this government's tax program gets through the parliament, if it gets through the parliament, will be getting $7,000 a year back in tax breaks, when ordinary workers will get back just over $500. What an absolute disgrace when it comes to fairness. Australians expect better than this second-rate attempt to copy the failed trickle-down economic model that has wreaked absolute havoc across the once mighty American middle class. Trickle-down has been in place in America for the last 30 or 40 years, since Reagan. Kansas tried to take it even further; they've doubled back. I see the member for Brisbane having a bit of a chuckle—he's a member of the IPA brigade, I believe, or the retailers.



Ms Flint interjecting—




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  Sorry, the IPA brigade is over there—the member for Boothby.




Ms Flint:
  We know you're Labor. You don't believe in freedom.




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  I don't believe in trickle-down, Member for Boothby. Trickle-down is a failed experiment. They've had it in place in America for 40 years. It has absolutely failed. You've got a widening gap of income in America. The once mighty middle class in America that everybody aspired to—the great American middle class; the great American dream—has gone. People are casualised and contracted out. There are low wages. You've got the wealthy getting wealthier, rich beyond comprehension, whereas everybody else is living in their car. There was a woman living in her car doing three jobs at, I think, a doughnut shop and other franchises. She died in her car because she was living in her car between shifts instead of being able to go home. This is the reality of trickle-down economics in America and this is the future that we can expect in Australia if those failed policies gain a bigger foothold here than they have already.




Mr Fletcher:
  Why don't you find another rhetorical straw man to attack?




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  I wouldn't speak of straw men, Minister.



Mr Fletcher interjecting—




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  The straw man is a character without a brain, Minister—I'd be careful there! Trickle-down economics is a model that makes those with money even richer but leaves those without even further behind. So Labor absolutely rejects trickle-down. We reject it completely. What we believe in—



Mr Fletcher interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Order!




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  The pink and grey galah is having a bit of a squawk down there at the dispatch box, so I'd ask him to pipe down.


We believe in trickle-up. We know that the best growth comes from feeding the roots, not the leaves. You don't spray the leaves; you feed the roots. You provide strong foundations to an economy—strong foundations in health, education, infrastructure and community services. You feed the grassroots. You feed the people. You feed the masses at the bottom. You don't feed the top; they're getting enough. You feed the bottom. You provide strong foundations in all of these services.


Yet this Liberal budget, like all Liberal budgets before it, fails this test. It's all about the top end of town, and that does not help the people of my electorate. The medium household income in Lyons is $981 per week. That's less than both the Australian average and the Tasmanian average. People in my electorate are not wealthy. It doesn't mean they don't work hard. They do. And it doesn't mean they don't deserve respect. But this government believes that, for a $10 tax cut, the people of my electorate will forget about the health and hospital cuts, they'll forget about the cuts to schools, TAFEs, trade centres and universities, they'll forget about the cuts to pensions and the robo-debt scandal, and they'll forget about the second-rate NBN. Well, the people of my electorate are smarter than that. They won't forget about these cuts and the difficulties that this government has placed upon them.


We all know this is a government that can't be trusted. It says it will build a new $461 million bridge in Bridgewater in my electorate. But a detailed look at the budget pages shows a glaring hole in the budget allocations. Just $25 million is earmarked in the forward estimates. Now $25 million is a lot of money, but it's not going to build a bridge. There is no time frame and no detail. It is a promise from a government that also promised no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to pensions, no cuts to the ABC and then cut the lot of them. It provides little comfort to the people of my electorate that this is a government that cannot be trusted.


This budget shows just how much disregard this government has for rural and regional communities and people by failing to commit to new rounds of the Mobile Black Spot Program.



Mr Fletcher interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Lyons has the call.




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  It's alright, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, I appreciate the protection but I don't require it. The chicken hawk can continue squawking. The pink-and-grey galah down there can keep going and squawk all he likes.


Connectivity is vital in a regional electorate that's prone to bushfire. It can mean the difference between life and death. But this budget ends mobile black spot funding at the end of the next financial year. As those opposite always like to remind us, mobile black spot funding was one of their initiatives. It was a good one; they should have kept it. It ends next year, a decision condemned not only by members on this side of the House but, I would certainly hope, by regional members on the opposite side. It was a short-sighted, stupid decision. When you consider that there is $80 billion to give to corporations and banks but not even a few million to address critical communications gaps in our regions, you really do have to wonder about the priorities of this government when it comes to regional Australia.


This budget is an affront to Australians everywhere. It's only Labor that will provide a budget that is responsible and gives Australians a fair go. Labor has a plan to deliver lower taxes for 10 million Australians. Under its plan, every Australian earning up to $125,000 a year will pay less tax. In my electorate of Lyons, 90 per cent of workers earn less than $90,000 a year. Labor's plan has real benefits for every single one of those people, and every single one of them will be better off under Labor's plan than under the coalition's plan. Only Labor's plan also results in better-funded schools and universities and a better-resourced TAFE, providing people, including our young people, with the knowledge, skills and training they need to reach their goals and enter the careers and industries they want to.


Only Labor reverses this government's billion-dollar cuts to health and hospitals, creating better systems across the country that are able to accommodate demand and minimise waiting lists. It's no secret that the Tasmanian health system, under the Liberal government in Tasmania, is one of the worst in the country, with appalling outcomes, ambulance ramping and long waiting times for surgery. You name it, it's behind on every measure. It is poorly resourced an unable to meet the needs of the community. Tasmania's health system needs national support. It's not going to come from this government, but it will come from Labor. Labor has made that commitment. For too long, Tasmania has been neglected by this Liberal government. Tasmania has been ignored for the past five years. It's clear that this government thinks it can buy back support with a $10-a-week tax cut and vague promises of infrastructure that will be given at some undetermined time in the future. But Tasmania will not forgive or forget this government's arrogance, nor will Tasmanians tolerate this government's pandering to the Prime Minister's big business and big bank mates. Tasmanians will not respond well to the government's habit of abandoning rural and regional communities when they need assistance most.


We had a speech in the Federation Chamber earlier today on the member for Grey's motion on suicide prevention trials—which has bipartisan support, I must say. The glaring fact out of that speech and that motion was that rural and regional communities suffer with that issue. It's rural and regional communities that need support. It is rural and regional communities that are left behind under this government's budget. We need to do better, and only Labor will do better.

"Wicks, Lucy, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (17:45):  I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and the other appropriations bills before the House and commend the work of the Treasurer in particular for his work on this budget. This is a budget that is good for my electorate on the Central Coast and is good for Australia. In my time today I'd like to talk about five local examples of why this is the case. Firstly, we're delivering safer communities in places like McEvoy Oval at Umina Beach. Secondly, we're backing small businesses like Six String Brewing at Erina. Thirdly, older Australians are being supported while also being protected from Labor's retiree tax. Fourthly, we're seeing tax cuts for almost 60,000 low- and middle-income earners in Robertson while guaranteeing the essentials like Medicare. Finally, we're delivering infrastructure that our region needs, like better local roads and infrastructure that rejuvenates Gosford and our region, such as the performing arts and conference centre.


I'm starting with safety and security, because I know that for many people of all ages this is their No. 1 concern. Last week we were joined by the Minister for Home Affairs, the member for Dickson, who met with local residents at Ettalong Beach, and then a couple of days later by the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, the member for Mitchell, who made a significant announcement at Umina Beach. I thank both of them for joining me on the peninsula, because this was a week when we took another step forward in uniting with our community against crime, vandalism and antisocial behaviour.


At Umina Beach, we gathered at the fabulous Jasmine Greens Park Kiosk to announce new funding from the government's Safer Communities Fund for CCTV cameras to keep our region safe. The cameras will be located at the Peninsula Recreation Precinct, where the cafe is located, at McEvoy Oval at Umina Beach, at the San Remo BMX park and at Banjo's Skate Park in Terrigal, where construction is underway. The funding boost was welcomed by local community leaders who came with us to hear the news firsthand over a coffee and some beautiful food prepared by Gabby Greyem, including Rod Unsworth and Mark Nitsos from the Umina Community Group, Stuart Field and his son Ronan from Woy Woy Peninsula Little Athletics—one of the groups who use McEvoy Oval—Matt Sawyer from the Peninsula Touch Association, Matt Cooper and Senior Constable Paul Scollon from Umina Beach PCYC, Central Coast councillor and advocate Jilly Pilon—who was also there to speak about Banjo's Skate Park—and Detective Inspector John Zdrilic from the Brisbane Water police district in the New South Wales Police Force. Of course, we were hosted by Gabby Greyem from Jasmine Greens, who really has been a tireless community advocate, particularly on this issue.


Police tell us how CCTV cameras are an effective crime prevention measure, a valuable investigative tool and a deterrent to antisocial behaviour. McEvoy Oval, a local community hub as well as a sports field, will be covered, and it will help to protect the new amenities block, which was recently opened thanks to funding from all three levels of government and the local clubs themselves. The driving force behind that project was Kylie Brown from Woy Woy Peninsula Little Athletics Club, who told us that the club facilities at McEvoy Oval are often targeted, sadly, by vandals with graffiti, including just a few days ago, and in fact goods were stolen from the sporting clubs, resulting in a flow-on cost to the community to repair that damage. So Kylie said that this CCTV funding is most welcome at such a pivotal time for the club.


The funding is being committed under round 2 of the coalition's Safer Communities Fund, and I'm advised that the budget also allows for a third round of funding, which we are already starting to plan for and will no doubt advocate for. Keeping our communities safe also benefits small businesses, and there's great news in this budget for them too. Our economic plan has delivered more than one million jobs into the Australian economy over the last five years, which is of great benefit to so many households and businesses. Parts of our ongoing plan are our small- and medium-business tax cuts, which will help more than 15,000 local businesses with turnovers of up to $50 million if they're incorporated and up to $5 million if they're unincorporated as they look to invest, employ and pay their workers more.


This budget also extends the popular instant asset write-off for small businesses for a further 12 months. Small businesses with turnovers of up to $10 million can benefit from writing off assets costing less than $20,000, and I'm advised that well over a thousand local businesses in my electorate have already taken advantage of this great initiative.


But, ultimately, it's not the government that creates jobs; it's business, which is why we need to listen to industries who have specific needs so that they can continue to grow. One of these industries is craft brewers, many of which are Australian owned, such as Six String Brewing in Erina and Block 'n Tackle in Kincumber. This budget means that craft brewers and distillers will no longer pay additional tax, allowing them to compete on fairer terms with large beverage companies. As part of our commitment, the government will increase the amount beverage companies can claim back on their excise and extend the concessional draft beer excise rate to smaller kegs like the sizes typically used by craft brewers.


To find out exactly how our local brewers would benefit, we went down to Six String on a Friday afternoon for a drink and a chat with Chris Benson and Ryan Harris, owners of Six String, along with Chris's wife, Sharon. Chris told me the announcement was a much-needed recognition for independent breweries as an emerging industry with different needs from the bigger beer companies. As the owner of a small business, Chris said this tax cut will make Six String more flexible, with increased cash flow allowing them to expand, employ more staff and invest in things such as larger tanks to increase the capacity of the brewery itself. It will open the doer to new local products. They've got a number of new beers, such as the delicious and inventive chai latte beer, and it's expected to lead to a downward pressure on beer prices. Nationally, there are around 380 craft breweries in Australia, employing the equivalent of almost 2,400 people, and I commend this budget for backing small businesses like these.


Building a strong economy also means we can keep supporting older Australians and guaranteeing the essentials like Medicare. My electorate has almost 31,000 people over the age of 65, and in this budget we made some important announcements providing more choice so they can live healthier, more independent and safer lives. This includes more financial security by increasing the pension work bonus, expanding the Pension Loans Scheme and delivering relevant skills and training advice to help workers build their careers or transition to jobs in new industries. We're also offering more choice, with 14,000 additional high-level home-care places by 2021-22, adding to the 6,000 places provided since last year's budget.


The budget also guarantees the funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which is a major breakthrough so that Australians with a permanent significant disability receive the best care we can provide. It's important for my electorate on the Central Coast, where, once it's fully rolled out, it will directly help almost 3,000 people and their families.


There's also a strong focus on health in this budget. To begin with, hospitals will receive record funding. Under our new agreement, New South Wales public hospitals will receive over $39.5 billion over the five years to 2024-25, delivering an additional $8.9 billion in funding the compared to the previous five years—up 29 per cent. Medicare, medicines and mental health are also getting a boost, including through the legislated Medicare Guarantee Fund, meaning we can help people to access life-saving medicines for breast cancer and spinal muscular atrophy. I've already spoken with the Minister for Health about the wonderful $1.3 billion National Health and Medical Industry Growth Plan, which will transform and save lives through world-leading medical developments as well as create tens of thousands of new jobs. This includes $500 million for the Genomics Health Futures Mission, which will help Australians live longer and receive better treatment personalised to their medical needs.


This funding boost comes at a really ideal time for the Central Coast where we're seeing an exciting transformation in Gosford with the arrival of the new medical school and research institute on the grounds of the newly upgraded Gosford Hospital. This is a game changer for our region: an $85 million project funded across this government, the New South Wales government and the University of Newcastle. As well as providing a university presence in Gosford and all the jobs and opportunities that will bring, we will also have links with the University of Newcastle's global advisory board, which has connections with the great universities of the world, like Cambridge and New York. It will be a centre of excellence in medical teaching and an international hub for integrated healthcare research and innovation. A collaborative task force has already been working behind the scenes on how the medical school and research institute can be the catalyst for even more jobs, growth and opportunities, including by potentially attracting major corporations to choose Gosford as their base.


As my team and I were meeting with local families across Saratoga and Davistown on Saturday, many people were pleased to hear about this project and some, like Edith on Davistown Road, were also concerned about what we are doing for young people. So I'm pleased to see this budget delivers $110 million in additional investment in child and youth mental health services, with a focus on providing mental health services to children within the school setting. There's also $338 million in new mental health funding with a focus on suicide prevention, research and older Australians. An additional one million people will receive diagnosis, treatment and recovery through a new Million Minds Mission in mental health research with funding of $125 million over the next decade.


For those who need to see a GP without worrying about their hip pocket, the number of GP services that are bulk billed continues to rise, with figures from the July to March period of around 648,000. This is an increase of more than 111,000 since Labor were last in government, with the total percentage of GP bulk billing services sitting at 86.6 per cent, which is up three per cent since the coalition was elected. We will also guarantee the essentials when it comes to schools funding, with government and independent schools funding in my electorate rising by $43.4 million when comparing this school year to the 2027 school year. The Catholic school system across Australia also receives a boost. Funding growth for Catholic schools will be $2.93 billion from now to 2027, a growth of 46.3 per cent. And children of preschool age will benefit from a multimillion-dollar preschool funding boost, which, in my electorate, will mean over 2,000 children will be able to access 15 hours of quality early learning in the year before school.


But families are also concerned about the cost of living and that is why a central part of this budget is tax relief, with a focus on low- and middle-income earners, particularly on the Central Coast. Almost 60,000 taxpayers in the Robertson electorate alone will receive an offset of up to $530 a year under our plan to reduce cost pressures on household budgets. For example, a high school teacher earning $75,000 will have an extra $530 in their pocket from the budget year onwards, with an extra $3,740 in their pocket over the first seven years of the tax plan. A shop assistant in Erina on $45,000 will have an extra $440 in their pocket from the budget year onwards, with an extra $3,380 in their pocket over the first seven years of the tax plan as the tax relief increases. We are also lifting tax brackets to ensure wages don't get eaten by higher taxes and to ensure the government lives within its means. What this translates to is a forecast return to a modest budget balance in 2019-20, increasing to a projected surplus of $11 billion in 2020-21, meaning we will no longer be borrowing to pay for essential services.


Finally, this budget helps deliver the infrastructure that the Central Coast deserves by confirming funding for major projects. We are investing $10 million to help Gosford's long-awaited world-class regional performing arts and conference centre on the site of the former Broadwater Hotel on Mann Street, which will fulfil a decades old dream of our community. The government has invested $7 million towards projects that rejuvenate Gosford such as the regional library learning hub. We are also delivering on our commitment to 600 new jobs in the nearby ATO building. The Somersby Industrial Estate, Banjo's skate park and Terrigal Trojans House upgrade were all confirmed in the budget, along with roads funding for the Central Coast Council through the Roads to Recovery Program election commitments such as the upgrade of Oceana Street at Copacabana. Other road commitments are either already completed or well under way, such as the roundabout on the intersection of Langford Drive and Woy Woy Road in Kariong and Ryans Road at Umina Beach.


Thousands of hardworking local commuters are also benefitting from our commitments, which I'll shortly speak about in more detail elsewhere in the House today. This includes NorthConnex—the M1, M2 missing link—plus our commitment to continuous mobile coverage on trains with Wi-Fi at train stations. These commitments are on track, along with funding from the New South Wales government business case to investigate faster rail options between Sydney and Newcastle.


I strongly commend this budget and these appropriation bills to the House. I do so because of all the reasons outlined today but also because of people like Meredith, from Daleys Point, who wrote to me to say thank you. She said she was so glad there is better help for older people still needing to work. She made particular mention of the Treasurer, who said that, ultimately, it is not the government's money to spend but belongs to the hard-working people of Australia. On a personal note Meredith said, 'Thank you for your kind birthday wishes and birthday card.' Meredith, I hope you had a very happy birthday and that you can plan for even more birthdays in the future with even greater confidence under this government. I commend these bills to the House.

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (18:00):  Back in 2005, prior to the global financial crisis, the member for Wentworth, as a backbencher, commissioned a paper on tax reform entitled Taxation Reform in Australia: Some Alternatives and Indicative Costings. The paper advocated for lower tax rates and a simplified system—in particular, a flatter tax structure. Thirteen years later, after the GFC, the now Prime Minister is finally trying to bring his wishes for a flatter income tax structure to fruition. The paper also noted that arguments for taxing capital gains at the same rate as income are compelling ones. To simplify the argument back in 2005: if you try to tax higher income earners too much, they will be pushed into tax minimisation strategies such as negative gearing and taking full advantage of the capital gains tax discount. Such discounts should be removed, the paper advocated.


So it appears that Prime Minister Turnbull should really be supporting Labor's proposed changes in those areas. Instead, this budget looks after big business at the expense of people who work and struggle. Australians earning as much as $200,000 will be subject to the same tax rate as those earning as little as $41,000 under the tax plan put forward by Scott Morrison to flatten Australia's taxation system, previously known as a progressive taxation system.


Budget tax cuts through to 2024 and 2025 will be less progressive than in our current system and will only help the rich get richer. The promise of income tax cuts worth $140 billion would, as the member for Wentworth's 2005 paper noted, bring the vast majority of working Australians into the same tax bracket, meaning that high-income earners would contribute a much smaller proportion of overall tax revenue than they currently do. In two elections time, the government proposes a shift towards this flat tax system, where the current 37 per cent tax bracket would be axed and workers on incomes between $41,000 and $200,000 would be taxed at the same marginal rate—quite a boon if you are a high-income earner.


In the electorate of Burt, the average income earner is on around $60,000 a year. How on earth is it fair for a construction worker on $60,000 a year to pay the same tax rate as a CEO or a lawyer who is earning $200,000 a year? How can it be fair that, under this tax experiment being put forward by the government, the lawyer or accountant, earning more than three times as much as a construction worker, gets a tax cut that is more than three times as big? In fact, The West Australian newspaper crunched the numbers on Mr Turnbull's unfair tax plan and found that those living in the leafy western suburbs of Perth would pocket an income tax cut of, on average, 11½ times the size of the cut that workers in the suburbs of Gosnells and Armadale, in my electorate, will be receiving. How is 60 per cent of the tax cuts ending up in the pockets of the top 20 per cent of households fair?


The Liberals say they want to deliver tax relief for low- and middle-income Australians. But their income tax plan is holding people hostage for tax cuts. If they really cared about low- to middle-income earners, they would split their proposals so that those that come into effect from 1 July could be supported but those that will only provide a benefit for high-income earners could be avoided. Instead, it seems that this government only cares about the top end of town.


It's interesting, though, to note that the International Monetary Fund says that taxing the super-rich will help reduce inequality without having an adverse impact on growth. The head of the IMF's fiscal affairs unit said that the average top income rate for the rich country members of the OECD—that includes Australia—had fallen by nearly 30 per cent since 1981. If that had occurred for ordinary income earners in Australia, they'd now pay no tax at all. He said there was scope for a more progressive system to tax the rich at higher rates in an effort to redistribute income to those who are less well off.


Meanwhile, this government's budget seeks to do exactly the opposite. The government has not only failed the fairness test set by Labor and, more importantly, by the community; it's also failed the fiscal responsibility test that it set for itself. Net debt for this coming year is double what it was when the Liberals came to office, while gross debt will remain well above half a trillion dollars for each year for the next decade. Both types of debt are growing faster under this government than under the previous government, and the previous government had to contend with the GFC.


Labor's approach to the budget for this nation is fairer for middle Australia and the most vulnerable people in our community, and it's more responsible when it comes to budget repair. Labor would deliver lower taxes for 10 million working Australians. Labor's plan will see those earning up to $125,000 a year still paying less tax than they would under the Liberals. Indeed, under Labor's plan, four million working Australians would receive nearly double the tax cut that they would under this Liberal government.


But the unfairness of the budget doesn't stop at its approach to income tax. This budget raises questions about how committed this Liberal government is to helping Western Australia with its financial woes, with the Turnbull government, over the term of this budget, halving its infrastructure spend for Western Australia. The budget papers also reveal that the only money that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer will provide Western Australia to help with its low allocation of GST is $189 million in this current financial year. There is no extra money to be provided in the budget year or in any of the forward estimates after that. Under the Liberal budget, WA is set to receive only the equivalent of a 50c GST share.


Even the infrastructure funding for Western Australia that the Prime Minister came to announce pre budget is a hoax. It was stated that Western Australia would be receiving an infrastructure spend of $3.2 billion. But then, once we saw the budget delivered and we got into the detail of the budget papers, it shows not only that actually there is no new infrastructure money in this budget but also that, over the period of the budget, the infrastructure spend is only down at $1.2 billion.


This compares to Labor's commitment of a $1.6 billion WA fair share fund, which will provide Western Australia with the equivalent of 70c in the dollar GST. Maybe it's this contrast that explains why the government is hiding the recently delivered Productivity Commission report on GST distribution—and only the Liberals are hiding from the people of Western Australia. Not only are they hiding this Productivity Commission report but they're running away from the by-elections to be held in Perth and Fremantle.


Now, everyone can see that this government is about mates rates on tax, helping those who earn the most, handing $80 billion to the biggest businesses and the banks, as well as its ongoing protection racket for the banks, trying to avoid a royal commission and then, as we've seen in the budget, defunding ASIC and defunding the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. It's no wonder that this Liberal government is cutting and running.


Only Labor is committed to delivering a fair go for Western Australia by delivering the infrastructure, health and education funding that WA needs, as well as providing actually budgeted GST assistance. Only Labor is committed to delivering lower taxes that are fair for millions of working Australians. Labor's approach to the budget is fairer for middle Australia and for the most vulnerable in our community and more responsible when it comes to budget repair. We will deliver extra funding for public hospitals. We'll deliver 20 new MRI machines for regional centres and outer suburbs. We'll abolish Mr Turnbull's cap on university places, and we'll abolish up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE places, to help Australians build their skills. Bear that in contrast to the $270 million cut in funding for TAFE under this government's budget. Labor can deliver on these commitments because, unlike this government, we won't be giving away $80 billion in tax cuts to big business and the banks.


Under a Shorten Labor government, we will achieve a budget coming back into balance in the same year as the government. We'll deliver a bigger cumulative budget surplus over the forward estimates, as well as substantially bigger surpluses over the 10-year medium term, and we'll put the majority of the savings raised from our revenue measures over the medium term towards budget repair and paying down debt. A Shorten Labor government will also be guided by clear fiscal principles, including repairing the budget in a fair way that doesn't ask the most vulnerable Australians to carry the heaviest burden. We will more than offset new spending with our savings and revenue improvements. This is in stark contrast to the approach of this government. We will be able to bank changes in receipts and payments from changes in the economy, and this will be seen in a positive bottom line for our budget—something this government has never seen—because Labor has made the tough calls, tough calls that this government has decided to try and pay us out on, on things like negative gearing, capital gains tax, looking at how income is split through trusts and, of course, the dividend imputation refund. By closing these loopholes, we will be able to make sure that we're able to provide the essential services that all Australians need.


Our plan is fairer and more responsible because it makes sure that those that are most vulnerable in our community are looked after, and it makes sure that we get budget repair done in a fair way. We're able to do that because we've made the big calls and we've got them right. We will of course support supply, but once again we see in this budget the stark contrast between Labor's fair approach and this government's mean, arrogant, out-of-touch, wrong priorities. Let's hope that this budget is their last.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (18:12):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and the related appropriations bills. I note that these bills demonstrate the benefits of the sound economic management that we've seen once again from the Liberal-National government. The benefit of focusing on jobs and growth flows through to everyone in Australia, most obviously to those who directly benefit from the jobs this government is helping to create—a record number of jobs, I've got to say; one million jobs since Labor left government.


Having more people than ever in jobs means that there's less pressure on the welfare budget. Having more people than ever in jobs means that there's greater tax revenue to facilitate the things that we all need and want. A stronger economy means that we can spend more on health care. A stronger economy means that we can invest more in education. A stronger economy means that we can start paying down the debt that Labor left behind. A stronger economy also means that families can start keeping more of their own money. We recognise on this side of the House that tax cuts are not a handout. When Labor spruiks handouts and giving away money, they fail to acknowledge that it was their money in the first place. Taxing someone less is not giving them money; it is letting them keep more of their own money, and that is exactly what this government is doing.


The federal budget that the Treasurer brought down earlier this month recognises that cost of living is a major issue for most families, especially those on low to middle incomes. By giving back in lump sum up to $530 each to those low- and middle-income earners, this government will immediately ease cost-of-living pressures. Our tax relief will make it easier for families to pay their electricity bills. It will make it easier for a family to pay their car registration or their council rates bill. A stronger economy also enables investment in major infrastructure projects, which in turn creates jobs as well. A stronger economy also enables investment in our communities.


Representatives from regional areas always face the challenge of ensuring that we see a fair share returned to the regions, especially to the regions where the wealth is created. The regions of Central Queensland and North Queensland punch well above their weight when it comes to delivering dollars into the coffers of both state and national governments. But we often get a raw deal when it comes to seeing some of that wealth reinvested into the region to address our infrastructure and industry needs. However, I've got to say we've been seeing some pretty big wins lately. Many of our big wins have centred around major upgrades of the Bruce Highway that have addressed concerns that North Queenslanders have been raising with me for some time.


In 2012, I led a convoy of Liberal-National politicians, including former Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss, along the entire 1,700-kilometre stretch of the Bruce Highway, highlighting places that needed attention most urgently. That convoy and my 'fix the Bruce' campaign worked, securing record funding for the Bruce Highway, and major projects like the Mackay ring road are now under construction. This project will provide a new major crossing of the Bruce Highway. It will take highway traffic out of the city, easing congestion, especially during peak hour. It will also take dangerous heavy trucks off the local streets. Just as importantly, it will create local jobs. I've spoken with a number of contractors and workers on site about the number of local people who have secured their jobs on the back of this infrastructure project. Those jobs came at a time when they were badly needed. But half a billion dollars of works in stage 1 of the Mackay ring road is only the beginning. We still need to close the loop on this ring road, and I'll be working to secure funds for the second stage of the ring road from measures that were announced in the budget.


The Liberal-National government allocated $3.5 billion to Roads of Strategic Importance, and $1½ billion of that package is earmarked specifically for northern Australia. A further $1.4 billion was announced in the budget for the Bruce Highway but as yet is not allocated to any specific project. I'll also be fighting for funds out of those allocations to be set aside to flood-proof the Goorganga Plains area of the Bruce Highway just south of Proserpine. Goorganga Creek floods very easily and very regularly, with heavy rain cutting off the Whitsunday Coast Airport from the actual Whitsunday coast. That means that flights from southern capitals are sometimes returned to their airports of origin and tourists can't get to where they want to go. The Queensland government's Department of Transport and Main Roads has begun the essential planning work on that project because of $12 million in federal funding, which this budget points to. Outcomes from that planning process will inform what needs to be done and what funds will be required to keep the north moving.


The Bruce Highway is a vital link for all of Queensland, connecting industries and products with end users. In this Liberal-National government's budget, we saw—as we have seen over the last few budgets—the spending of a record $6.7 billion on the Bruce Highway. As I said before, a major part of that was on the Mackay ring road. But there is another Bruce Highway project in my electorate that's also worth half a billion dollars, and that is the replacement of the Haughton River bridge, identified by people in my electorate as the most urgent black spot that needs fixing. That project not only replaces the ageing and unsafe Haughton River bridge; it includes another two overpasses, a number of different bridges that are going to go over flood-prone areas and the upgrade of about nine intersections along a 14-kilometre section of the Bruce Highway. The federal government is providing $411 million towards this project—as I said, it's worth a total of half a billion dollars or more—and works kicks off in the middle of this year. We pushed to bring that forward when the state government said it couldn't come forward, and we've brought that project on this coming calendar year. Further south, we've already invested $57 million into the Sandy Gully bridge upgrade, just north of Bowen. Sandy Gully is another regularly flood-prone area, cutting access to Abbot Point for workers who are based in Bowen, further south in Mackay and in the Whitsundays. It also severed the Bruce Highway—the arterial transport link that keeps the north moving—right there and then. These road projects all create jobs for the north. Most of those jobs, though, as we know, only last during the construction of that particular infrastructure project, but they increase freight movements as well, and that adds to a greater economy, which creates long-term jobs.


Talking about long-term jobs, we're seeing the benefits of the regional jobs and investment package that I fought so hard to secure during the lead-up to the 2016 election. North Queensland suffered badly during the downturn in the resources sector, and that's why I pushed for a jobs package to address the needs of regional centres around the Bowen Basin area. The Liberal-National government recognised the importance of those regional economies and the dollars that the mining industry and mining communities contribute through royalties, through wages and through taxes. We're now seeing the fruit of all that work, with more than $9.7 million from the government contributed towards investments that total about $50 million in that region. In Mackay, the Liberal-National government provided $1.6 million to D&T Hardchrome so they could build an industrial standard electroplating and finishing facility in Paget. D&T have been a great contributor to the mining services sector in Mackay, and this particular project will provide access to services that previously have had to be sourced far beyond the mining region where they are needed. Another funding project in Mackay was $420,000 provided to Diacon, a local company who will expand their plastic conveyor protection systems business. There was $250,000 to Linked Group Services to help them showcase their energy efficiency initiatives. In total, there's been a federal government investment of about $2½ million in four projects worth about $12 million in Mackay. These projects will create 84 jobs, the vast majority of which will be ongoing, so we are directly creating permanent jobs from this one-off investment. In the Whitsundays, we announced $5.8 million of funding under the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages for the Ozone Whitsundays Eco Resort at Riordanvale. This is a $37 million development and it'll feature contemporary villas, a striking wedding and conference venue, and a boutique native fauna park. When it's complete, it'll create more than 100 jobs and boost land based tourism options for one of Australia's premier tourism destinations in the Whitsundays. In Bowen, that same jobs package is delivering $1½ million for the Murroona Gardens aged-care facility.


One of the most important industries in North Queensland is defence, with the Townsville city being home to the Army's Lavarack Barracks, a RAAF base, the Townsville Field Training Area as well as the port of Townsville's Berth 10, which is designed for the Royal Australian Navy. Consequently, we in the north were jubilant about Queensland's win of the $1.8 billion Land 400 Defence deal. That deal will have big benefits for Townsville. About 150 Boxer super-tanks—I guess they're not tanks; they're weaponised reconnaissance vehicles—will be based in that garrison city. Two hundred million dollars will be spent on building simulation facilities over the next 10 years and 80 jobs will be created during the construction phase.


But not all important projects involve such big dollars. The Liberal-National government has helped and continues to help industry and community provide a better lifestyle and greater amenities for families living in the north. The federal government recently provided $150,000 to Mackay cane growers for their irrigation efficiency training program, which helps them reduce electricity costs and boost productivity in the cane-farming sector. We provided half a million dollars to Carlisle Adventist Christian College. I was just there on Sunday, yesterday, to provide them with a hospitality and home economics facility. Just on the weekend—as I said, yesterday—I opened new classrooms and a science lab for the school, to which the federal government directly contributed to the tune of $375,000. We delivered $15,000 for the Mackay kidney support group to buy a new car, when one of their previous cars was stolen, $15,000 for the Mackay Tennis Association to upgrade their courts and develop a new kitchen, and about $10,000 for the Mackay St Vincent de Paul Society to help them reduce their electricity costs, leaving them more dollars to support clients who are homeless. There has been about $200,000 invested in the Dalrymple disability respite service centre. All in all, there has been about $250,000 poured into community services around the Mackay region in just the past six months.


We supported VMR, the volunteer marine rescue, in Burdekin with $20,000 for their services. The Burdekin Art Society and Cungulla men's shed have also been recipients of funding. I secured $250,000 for Home Hill State High School's multipurpose hall. There's been a lot done for the community. We've helped the Mackay and Whitsunday region in their time of great need in the wake of Cyclone Debbie, with the federal and state governments providing joint tourism recovery funding, including $1 million for new infrastructure at Peter Faust Dam, $2 million for Hill Inlet lookout on Whitsunday Island and $1 million to enhance facilities at Flagstaff Hill in Bowen. There's more to come. This year's budget provides a number of measures that will benefit the north, including a $550 million Stronger Rural Health Strategy, which will deliver around 3,000 additional doctors and 3,000 additional nurses into rural general practice; an additional 14,000 high-level in-home-care packages to help older people remain in their own homes; 13½ thousand new residential aged-care places and 775 short-term restorative places, which will be made available where they are most needed. The chaplaincy program in our schools will get more funding to focus on antibullying, and we are skilling Australians by investing $1½ billion, an extra $250 million that we've provided in this budget, in the Skilling Australians Fund to deliver apprenticeships and traineeships that are so vital in training young Australians for the jobs of the future. We've enabled pensioners to earn more and keep more of their pension, and there are initiatives to address the need for more seasonal workers in the fruit and vegetable sector, with a two-year trial of incentives aimed at increasing the number of jobseekers who take on such work. I could go on about the sports infrastructure grants program and about the tax relief we've provided that's going to help over 66,000 taxpayers in the electorate of Dawson.


All of this stuff is contained in our budget. It's been a great budget for North Queensland, providing all these local benefits. I'm proud to support these bills.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (18:27):  I'm happy to get up here and support the appropriations bills Nos 1 and 2, one about parliamentary departments No.1, and Nos 5 and 6. Of course, Labor always support supply. The lessons of 1975 have not been lost on the Labor Party. It is important, though, for the contest over the budget to protect the nation state. We don't want to get into a situation like that in the United States of America where they have to come up with one deal after another simply to fund the public service, public servants and public service jobs. We don't want our nation beset with crises of that nature.


Nevertheless, this is going to be a debate about the government's budget strategy and, in particular, their ideas about corporate tax. We know that the government's budget basically backed in an idea which has no support in this country. It can't find support in the public sphere and it can't find support in this nation's parliament, particularly in the other place. That idea is $80 billion worth of corporate tax cuts, which are tax cuts the like of which Australia has never seen. We know when the Hawke-Keating government undertook taxation reform in the 1980s it involved a lowering of corporate tax rates, but it also involved a broadening of the base with things like the fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax and the petroleum resource rent tax. That was taxation reform. It involved spirited debate at the taxation summit and, as I think Mr Keating notably once said, they crossed the finish line with one wheel off the chariot.


Taxation reform is difficult. It's hard work. If you broaden the base, if you lower rates, that sort of reform is noted and lauded. Keating's reforms of the eighties were good all round, but this budget starts with a different idea, a Reaganesque idea: you just give $80 billion to companies and $17 billion to big banks, and somehow that idea, that great largesse, blows a hole in the nation's budget and blows a hole in its capacity to deliver services to schools, hospitals, aged-care homes and everything else that the federal government might fund and simply lowers the rate for companies, and somehow that will translate into a common good, a public good. That is nonsense. It's such nonsense that even in the United States of America, where this idea originated, it's starting to lose support.


In The Economist on 26 April, in the print edition, the headline read: 'Marco Rubio offers his Trump-crazed party a glint of hope. The Florida senator thinks that reheating Reaganomics is a dead end.' I encourage those opposite to read the article. It's not written by a socialist; it's in The Economist, so they would be safe in reading it. They might want to read Mr Rubio's quote in the article. It says:


""There is still a lot of thinking on the right that if big corporations are happy, they're going to take the money they're saving and reinvest it in American workers,"" he says—


quoting Mr Rubio—


""In fact they bought back shares, a few gave out bonuses; there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the American worker.""


Think about this. Marco Rubio is on the conservative end of his party in the United States of America, the home of that sort of neoliberal idea—the Reaganomics—where, if you somehow lower the corporate tax rate, there will be a magical nirvana of higher wages and higher revenues, and somehow everything will work out in the never-never. In America, Senator Rubio puts a sword to that idea in the US Senate.


You would think that those opposite would just stop and think about what they're doing to their own political brand and what they're doing to this nation's capacity to fund schools and hospitals, pay down debt and encourage growth. We know the sort of corporate largesse. As I said before: $80 billion to corporations in the corporate tax cut and $17 billion to banks, despite all of the evidence to the royal commission—day after day after day of evidence of poor corporate ethics, bad corporate behaviour and one story after another, and now amazingly involving children's bank accounts. You would think there would be some underlying ethical boundary to bad behaviour, but clearly not. Every day, when we see these stories, we know it was the right call to have the royal commission, and we now see this government still wanting to shove $17 billion to Australian banks.


It's interesting. The other problem with this budget is that it has an assumption that you'll get reasonable wages growth in the coming years, but this of course does not match up with what this government's doing. On the one hand, the government say wages will grow, but we know that their policy is divorced from this. We know they're going to cut penalty rates. That's this government's policy: cut penalty rates and hack into workers. And we know they're going to get stuck into unions. They're the two basic tenets of this government's wages policy—surprise, surprise! On the one hand they want to do these things and on another they expect wages growth. On 17 May, The Sydney Morning Herald reported that wages growth was 'stuck in the mud'. It talked about how workers 'got a 0.5 per cent pay rise in the three months to March', which is 'the softest result in the history of the series'. It talked about how 1.3 million workers in the retail industry are banking an average pay rise of 1.5 per cent, which is actually a real wage cut of 0.4 per cent in real terms when compared to inflation. Think about the consequences of expecting your wages to go to one end and then having them go the other. Capital Economics' chief economist, Paul Dales, is quoting as saying wage growth is 'stuck in the mud at 2.1 per cent in the first quarter and likely to stay there or thereabouts' for the rest of the year.


But it wasn't just them. The Australian Financial Review on 17 May quotes deputy governor Guy Debelle. He's talking about what normally happens: the unemployment rate goes down and workers then have some capacity to ask for a pay rise. He says:


There is a risk that it may take a lower unemployment rate than we currently expect to generate a sustained move higher than the 2 per cent focal point evident in May wage outcomes today.


This is a problem for the old model—that is, where unemployment fell, workers would have more bargaining power and thus ask for a pay rise. We've got the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank here saying that that model might well be broken.


Why is it broken? I'll tell you why: because this government has set out to break it. This is why they are appointing Fair Work Commissioners who side with employers. This is why they are hacking into penalty rates. This is why they oppose increases to the minimum wage. This is why we have the very, very concerning series of charges brought against trade union officials for blackmail. That tactic went out with the 17th century. Of course, it's not surprising, when these charges are brought, to see that they don't survive the court process because it is not blackmail to ask for a pay rise or to get your union to ask for a pay rise. That's part of a healthy wages system.


So this government is wrong on tax and wrong on wages. It's not just the Labor Party saying so and not just a union saying so. The Reserve Bank of Australia and other economists are putting a pretty cogent case about wages. The Australia Institute is saying magical wage growth underpins the budget forecasts. You are not going to get magical wages growth if you are hacking into workers and unions every day. I'll tell you, Deputy Speaker, for your own information, you have to let workers and unions bargain. It's not criminal, either in civil law or criminal law, to have a strike to withdraw your labour; it's a standard right across industrialised economies, and it has been for some time.


So if those things are broken, then necessarily we are starting to question the government's approach to things like Newstart as well. Of course, the level of Newstart is a concern. It's a concern with ACOSS, Social Services and many people in my electorate, including the Anti Poverty Network, who take issue with it and have sent representatives to see me about it. It's also a concern with business. Jennifer Westacott was on Sky News, saying:


But we've got to make sure while they're on Newstart that it's adequate, that we're not entrenching them into disadvantage, that they've got the opportunity to get back into the workforce because they're able to maintain a reasonable standard of living. I mean $39 a day is not a lot of money, it's a very low amount of money for people to actually live on.


This is certainly the case. I've noticed many people in my electorate struggling on Newstart at the level that it's at, and also dealing with a regime of oversight that is very, very onerous. If you miss a simple appointment or if there's a mistake with your appointment with a job services provider, you can be cut and thrown into poverty and sometimes homelessness very quickly indeed. So we do have to be mindful in this place about just how difficult it is to live on Newstart and just how onerous a regime we are imposing on people who are on very low incomes, particularly if they have to sustain over a long period of time out of the labour market or are in and out of casual work or are in labour hire, which is the other big problem. We have to have be cognisant of that. When not only the Australian Council of Social Services is telling you it's not adequate but when business is also telling you it is not adequate, you know there is a case to be answered here.


I'm very proud that Labor has committed to reviewing the nature of these payments and I think we should review them with an eye to the adequacy of those payments and with a view to preventing people from falling into poverty. Once you have fallen into poverty, we know, it doesn't just affect your capacity to apply for work but there's also a fair bit of evidence to say that once you have fallen into those poverty traps, it's very hard to make the right judgements to get out of them. And it is very hard to live on very low incomes for a long period of time.


So this government's budget strategy, which Ayn Rand would be proud of, I don't think is very sensible or well thought out or reasonable in the modern era. We are saying to the government: you are going down the wrong path; you need to reconsider. The Labor Party won't follow you down this path so you should split the bills, allow us to do taxation reform for those who need it and, for those who don't—the big corporates—we should leave them to do what they should do, which is invest, create jobs and pay taxes like everyone else. We should get back to having a sustainable fiscal strategy which provides tax relief to those who need it, which pays down debt and which allows us as a nation to provide the services that we need now such as schools and hospitals and that we will need for the future.

"Evans, Trevor, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mr EVANS
 (Brisbane) (18:42):  I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 cognate debate with Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2018-2019, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2017-2018 and Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2017-2018, and to state, in case there was any doubt amongst honourable members, that this month's budget has been a great budget for Brisbane. More than 75,000 people across the electorate of Brisbane will be getting tax relief next financial year commencing in 40-something days' time, meaning the hardworking people of Brisbane will be keeping more of their own hard-earned money as reward for their efforts because this government's strong economic plan is starting to pay dividends.


A year ago, talking here on last year's budget, the topic was business tax cuts and we just heard that last year's budget still manages to distract members of the opposition. Last year, we talked about how this government was predicting what would happen if we backed Australian businesses, notably the small and medium family businesses which together make up such a large proportion of Australia's economy and its enterprise. We talked about why supporting those small and medium and family businesses might pay certain dividends. Now we are here seeing the very real evidence that the key planks of this government's strong economic plan are working—the tax relief already delivered for small and medium businesses, our innovation agenda, the new free trade agreements and the growth of our defence industry. We see evidence of these policies working certainly in Brisbane, right across Queensland and indeed across Australia.


Last week, two notable economic milestones were reached. Queensland's population reached five million and the target of one million jobs being created since the coalition government was elected was reached—about half a year earlier than was hoped for originally. The first milestone is a sign of the confidence Australians have in the great state of Queensland, including the 3.5 million who choose to make their homes in the south-east corner, centred on the wonderful place that is the City of Brisbane.


The second milestone, those jobs, is an unambiguous sign that the government's strong economic management is paying the dividends that we were talking about here in this place a year ago. A million jobs means a million livelihoods out there improved, a million more people having the security, dignity and prosperity of work. Record jobs being created, business investment rising, the budget strengthening is the story underpinning the budget. 


Nationwide, our policies are coming together to help Australia's small and medium businesses create all of these new jobs faster than jobs have ever been created in the history of this country. Last year, a record 1,100 jobs a day were created, on average. That means, as I said, more Australians are being productive. It also means more Australians are paying taxes, and fewer of them are relying on welfare. That is a powerful outcome economically and morally. And it is enabling, in turn, this government to provide and guarantee the essential services. For instance, in the budget there is a record level of support for seniors and a record investment in the Great Barrier Reef. Finally, with certainty, it is enabling the government to fully fund the NDIS out of consolidated revenue.


This is all at the same time as being able to give tax relief to the Australians whose hard work and success have helped to bring this about. That is the real power of supporting Australia's small and medium businesses and it is the power of supporting hard-working Australians. The government's policies are fostering the conditions and the framework so that so many more Australians can prosper and so many more Australian businesses can grow and hire even more Australians. It is very good news for the 31,000 small businesses situated in my electorate of Brisbane. The feedback we received when the Treasurer visited Brisbane just last week, after the budget, was very positive. Local business people and local workers all clearly support the tax cuts as fair and well targeted. The return to surplus next year was a very welcome improvement, as were the guarantees to the essential services that Australians rely on.


Nationwide, the government's income tax relief, as announced in the budget, will benefit 10 million Australians, including over two million Queenslanders. There couldn't be a bigger contrast with our opponents, whose shadow Treasurer, last week at the National Press Club, pledged to retain the top marginal tax rate at 49 per cent indefinitely. As usual, Labor's approach is all about high taxes, not lower taxes. I want to talk about infrastructure for a moment. Others have already noted here today that, in this budget, we deliver a record $75 billion in an investment pipeline of key infrastructure projects right across Australia. More than $20 billion of that infrastructure bonanza is for projects in Queensland, including in and around Brisbane.


I have previously welcomed in this place the $300 million the government is investing in the Brisbane Metro. That congestion-busting project is critical because of the strong population growth in Brisbane and the extra workers that brings into the Brisbane CBD, and because of the very high proportion of commuters in Brisbane that use buses rather than rail. It is a vital project to keep our city moving. It will cut daily travel times, reduce bus congestion in the CBD and improve bus services to the suburbs. For a daily commuter, it may mean over an hour of travel time saved each and every week—time that everyone would rather spend at home with their families and friends.


Last week, I was really pleased to join with the Brisbane Lord Mayor and the federal Minister for Infrastructure to inspect the site of the proposed underground metro station in Brisbane's cultural precinct. So, soon, there will be a world-class public transport project to accompany Brisbane's world-class cultural and entertainment offerings—QPAC, the Art Gallery, GoMA, the State Library and the Queensland Museum. In addition to the Brisbane Metro, the budget includes a whole raft of other infrastructure projects helping the people of Brisbane and south-east Queensland. It includes $1 billion to ease congestion on the M1 highway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast and a further $3.3 billion for additional upgrades along the Bruce Highway to improve safety and reduce congestion, taking the government's total investment to $10 billion and supporting around 2½ thousand jobs. These are all game-changing infrastructure projects that in various ways will improve the lives of millions of people who call south-east Queensland and Brisbane home.


The budget also continues the Turnbull government's strong commitment to supporting Australia's best health and medical research, including a record $6 billion in budget measures. In the same way that last year's budget really identified and singled in on the opportunities in our defence industry, this year's budget is really homing in and identifying the big opportunities that sit in front of Australia in the space of medical research. We have established the Medical Research Future Fund to provide long-term sustainable funding for medical research. It already has a balance of $7 billion and it's on track to reach $20 billion by 2021.


This budget includes $2 billion in disbursements from the Medical Research Future Fund to fund various research projects and priorities. Investment in medical research is critical to providing new treatments to diseases and to improving the quality of life of all Australians through things such as treating brain cancer in children, reducing premature births and developing new medical devices. It's all about improving and saving lives and it's part of our commitment to delivering the essential services that Australians rely on, guaranteed, as I said, by the strong economic plan that underpins our ability to guarantee the services.


Health and medical research is an area in which Australia is world class, and I'm proud that many of these amazing researchers are calling Brisbane home. Last week, it was really exciting to have the chance to visit the UQCCR with the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt. The minister announced $1.2 million in funding being awarded to UQ's Professor David Paterson through the Medical Research Future Fund. Professor Paterson's research is about tackling antimicrobial resistance and has the potential to save 30,000 lives, which puts the work that we do here in this place into some perspective.


I've also recently visited Queensland's largest medical research centre, the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute. I've had the opportunity on many occasions visiting there to hear from some of the scientists and medical researchers there about their fascinating and very important work.


Australia has all of the necessary ingredients to bolster its position as a world leader in medical research, but it's essential that we don't rest on our laurels. In this budget, the centrepiece of the government's commitment to health and medical research is a new investment of $1.3 billion in the National Health and Medical Industry Growth Plan, to be overseen by Professor Ian Frazer, AC. It's about identifying discoveries and translating ideas into practice and commercial successes and it really has the potential to turbocharge the health and medical research industry just as the government's strategic investment in the defence industry sector in last year's budget is doing.


As well as improving health outcomes for hundreds of thousands of Australians, this will create up to 28,000 new skilled medical research jobs and develop the next generation of Australia's world-leading medical research industry. Groundbreaking biological and medical technologies have a significant place in the future of health care, and so this government's growth plan will also provide for a minimum of 130 new clinical trials and add a 50 per cent increase in exports and new markets in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The growth plan includes half a billion dollars of funding over 10 years for the Genomics Health Futures Mission, which will help more than 200,000 Australians live longer and get better treatment tailored to their medical needs. The first genomics project will be Mackenzie's Mission, with almost $20 million being provided for screening trials for rare and debilitating birth disorders, including spinal muscular atrophy, fragile X and cystic fibrosis.


Another research investment is $248 million over five years for an expanded Rare Cancers, Rare Diseases And Unmet Need Program and new international clinical trial collaborations. We're also providing funding of almost a billion dollars a year to the National Health and Medical Research Council and have funded the $500 million Biomedical Translation Fund to help transform biomedical discoveries into commercial opportunities for Australian researchers.


That's just one aspect in summarising the plan for a stronger economy and what it means in one great area going forward for Brisbane and for all of Australia. But I did also want to mention in passing that the budget does include, contrary to some of the talk of cuts that we hear repeatedly from the other side, record funding for hospitals and schools, guaranteed funding for disability services and a comprehensive approach to aged care so older Australians can live healthier, more independent lives.


This budget ensures the government lives within its means, with a forecast return to moderate balance in 2019-20 increasing to a projected surplus of $11 billion in 2020-21. Importantly, we're no longer borrowing to pay for essential services and we have the lowest average real growth in payments of any government on either side of politics over the last 50 years.


I also wanted to mention quickly in passing that in my electorate of Brisbane more than 5,000 local families stand to benefit under the budget from our reforms to childcare. That'll come into place on 2 July and is obviously on top of their tax relief. There is also the guaranteed funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. That will be directly helping 1,800 people and their families in my electorate of Brisbane. This budget is the next step in our long-term economic plan to deliver all of those essential services on which we rely and to provide tax relief to hardworking Australians to thank them for the hard work that they and so many small and medium businesses have done over the last year in helping to get Australia back into this strong position while simultaneously living within our means.


I want to spend a moment comparing and contrasting what I've just outlined to some of the things that we've heard from those opposite. I want to spend a moment talking about the politics of envy and the case that Labor are now pushing, because it does seem that they have absolutely nothing else to talk about—certainly not a significant economic plan. I was in the chamber earlier and I heard the member for Lyons. He said one thing that was right; he identified that I was laughing—chuckling, I think, was the word he used—in response to his contribution. I was laughing because these are just discredited Labor lines that are being rolled out like robotic union Daleks. I think they hope that if they say them often enough they'll become true. His speech and so many other speeches that we're hearing from Labor reveal that they have no actual plan. At the heart of all of those uninspired Labor lines is this false war that they're trying to whip up, chasing the divisive politics of envy.


Sadly, we all had to endure the opposition leader's budget reply speech a few weeks ago. For those lucky enough not to hear it, let me summarise it briefly. Labor essentially said that they would spend a stack of money that they don't have on all manner of things. They said that they could pay for it because they'll tax banks and big companies more. That's essentially what they said. So, 10 points out of 10 for the politics of division and envy, but, sadly, zero points for adding things up and zero points for honesty. If you look at their numbers, you'll see that there are no changes in the forward estimates to the taxes being paid by big businesses and banks—not in our forward estimates and not in theirs. In their forward estimates over the next four years, their biggest tax takes include $10 billion from retirees, which is the biggest; $6 billion in additional taxes on small and medium businesses, the ones that we just identified as having created all of the jobs and prosperity over the last year; $2 billion from home owners; and precisely zero in additional taxes from big businesses and banks. That stands in stark contrast to the multinational tax avoidance laws that this government's passed—sadly, without Labor's support.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (18:57):  I would like to make a contribution in this cognate debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and other appropriations bills. There's probably one thing that we have learnt since the handing down of this budget by the Treasurer, and that is that it is only a Labor government that understands and knows about the delivery of fairness. Fairness is not about what you say or the words you might want to couch your budget in. Fairness is about what you do; it's all about actions. This government, once again, has failed that test. As a matter of fact, they've failed it five times.


This is their fifth attempt at a budget delivering so-called fairness to the Australian community, yet, despite the rhetoric of those opposite, this is really a budget about big business. We've heard in the past about trickle-down economics. We have heard that, provided we give it to the big end of town, it will eventually work its way down to the workers. We know that over the last couple of years businesses have been making reasonable profits, and yet we are seeing the lowest wage growth in living memory at the moment. They want to take this whole concept further—to say, 'Well, just trust us,' and, 'Let's make our key signature policy giving $80 billion to the big end of town in the hope that that's going to stimulate the economy and create jobs, and that everyone's going to live in a land of prosperity.'


After five years, I think the tired old government over there should be starting to think about giving it up. Let's face it: that's what the electors are thinking. The previous speaker might want to get bolshie about this, but he, like any of those on the other side of the parliament with margins under 5 per cent, knows what the polls mean. They know that people have turned off. They're no longer listening. It's one thing for the Liberals to want to come out and say that they're concerned about fairness and about returning fairness to the Australian economy and to working families. But to make your key signature policy all about big business is really not delivering much in the way of fairness for working families of this country.


In fairness, the tax plan does give a modest $10 a week to Australian workers. As I say, it's modest, and we will support such a modest increase. But don't forget that they're giving with one hand while, with the other hand, savagely making cuts to pensions, cuts to education and cuts to health. I'm not sure they can actually sell that at the election. I invite them to try! They've got to get out there and say, 'We'll give you something and we'll take all of this from you.' It simply is not going to work, because, as I say, people have turned off. They're no longer listening, despite the talk around the corridors here, and I know, regrettably, you guys don't get a bounce out of this. I'm not sure what that means—should you go to a longer period for elections, or which leader should you take to the election? All that is in the hands of you and your party room. But the realistic aspect about this is that a $10 tax cut for Australian workers does not cut it when you want to do things such as take $17 billion out of education and cut into health and pensions. People are aware of this stuff. This is not something new. They've seen this before. This is a government that is showing all the signs of being tired. It's out of ideas, and the only thing it can come up with is: 'Let's throw some money at big business.'


Bear in mind, this mob opposite is the same mob that protested vigorously about having a royal commission into the banking industry. They said, 'We know what's happening in our financial institutions. All the royal commission is going to do is make lawyers rich.' I'm not sure how the lawyers on the other side would take that. They said, 'It would only tell us what we know.' I really hope those opposite and those in the Treasury didn't know about all the things we now know about—things about AMP and what is occurring with the Dollarmites at the 'which bank'. All those things are happening. It's a far cry from what they wanted to do and say about a royal commission into trade unions—absolutely. They were looking at one prosecution as a result of the trade union royal commission, but I think that's been withdrawn now.




Mr Wallace:
  Only one? Only one, you reckon?




Mr HAYES:
  Only one flowed out of the royal commission, as my friend reminds me. But it took $78 million for that one. Anyway, we've lost the board of AMP. We have a financial system in debacle, a financial system which has been protected by those opposite, who withdrew the very protections we put in place for people so that financial advisers would act in the best interests of clients. One of the first actions of the government opposite was to withdraw that. What! These are the people who are now saying, 'We want you to trust us with our fifth budget because we are all about fairness for Australian people.' No wonder people are starting to think, 'When they talk about fairness, let's see what their track record is.' I've got to say it's pretty dismal.


Anyone in this joint must think that it is our absolute honour to be here. Very few people get to represent their community in the federal parliament. When you think in those terms, you must think the Australian people deserve better than what's being offered by this government. They deserve better than to be told that what's in your interests is to give the top end of town a lift at the expense of everybody else. A modest tax cut, if it's affordable, is the right thing to do. But you don't give with one hand and take with the other.


I have just one little piece of advice for those opposite: if you can't afford to give an $80 billion tax cut to business—and I accept that you can't—simply don't do it. You wouldn't do this in your household economy. You wouldn't say, 'Look, I'd like to buy that new car but I can't afford it so let's just add it to the mortgage.' If you can't afford it, don't do it. Don't do it at the expense of working families, at the expense of pensioners, and don't do it at the expense of all those people who put their blood, sweat and tears in, who are raising families and who want the best outcome for them. And by the way, we need that $80 billion for our future.


The cutting of $17 billion out of education is ridiculous. Any investment in education is not a line item. It's not something you just say, 'This is what we're doing in our budget, how we're going to save money.' An investment in education is an investment in our future. It's an investment in our prosperity. It's an investment in our nation. It's not just a line item in the 2018 budget. And $17 billion is almost exactly the amount of money the banks are going to get, a tax cut of $17 billion as a reward for their hard effort over the last 12 months. The royal commission will no doubt now discover more and more things. I know those opposite didn't want the royal commissioner to extend the terms of reference but they might be stuck with them now, because the Australian people are getting more and more concerned about what they're seeing is happening in their financial institutions. By the way, over the last period of 12 months, those banks made something in the vicinity of $34 billion in straight-out profit.




Ms Madeleine King:
  They need a tax cut!




Mr HAYES:
  They really need it, don't they? And you know what happened? Those workers in the financial institutions, well, jeez, they haven't done terribly well. They haven't increased their salaries. The executives may have actually got some bonuses. As a matter of fact, they did work some stuff with the Dollarmites, making sure those accounts were working so that people got a payout. A number of banks and financial institutions were signing off fraudulent statements on behalf of applicants at the NAB. Look, you guys opposite have got to start thinking there's more to being in government than trying to pull a job of smoke and mirrors, more than just pulling the wool over the eyes of people.


I'm very fortunate. I work in the most multicultural community in the whole of the country, bar none—very vibrant, very colourful. We have many, many opportunities to celebrate New Year from the start, with everyone else, on the 1st January, through to my last New Year's, celebrated in August or September with another group. Mine is not a rich community. The average income in my community is a tad over $60,000. I know what this budget means for them. I know what taking $14 a fortnight off pensioners means for those people. They're not going to go and work an extra shift. They are not going to work some overtime to make this up. The pension is all they get. Taking the $14 energy supplement off them at a time when the member for Hughes keeps reminding this House about energy prices. At a time when he wants to talk about record energy prices in New South Wales, he's part of a government that is going to take $14 off pensioners who can't go and make up that difference.


We need to be a bit smarter about this. We need to give people the opportunity to go out and invest in themselves and in their future. We did that in the global financial crisis. By the way, you never, ever hear a word about that from those opposite, but we came through that reasonably well, because we stimulated the economy. We did that by looking after families and encouraging them to invest in their futures. That is not what we're seeing coming out of this budget.


The mums and dads in my community are more concerned about what's happening in education. I preface this by saying that mine's not a rich electorate. As a matter of fact, I have the lion's share of refugees coming to this country, and many of the migrants make their home in the Fairfield and Liverpool areas. Interestingly, of the 12,000 refugees that the government decided to take, particularly out of the Middle East—and we supported them—we get 7,000 in Fairfield. Yes, there are all sorts of issues that come with that in terms of making sure those people are appropriately settled, which is fine, because I think we are a very giving community in my area. But what I've seen with the people from the Middle East or, before that, the people from Cambodia or, before that, the people from Vietnam is that they have a passionate belief in education. They believe that the ticket to success in a country like Australia is to ensure that their children have a first-class education, and they just cannot rationalise in their minds what this government is doing in taking $17 billion out of education. I know they all want to get up and say that's all just hyperbole over there. We have even got the Catholic bishops coming out today and reaffirming what this means in respect of Catholic education.


We are privileged to be in this place. We are privileged to have the honour of representing our communities in this parliament. Not many people get this opportunity. When we're here, we should be trying to make a difference for the better in our community, not simply rattle off some lines about how this is the budget and we're going to do all these various things. We should, on both sides of the House, be trying to make a difference for the better. Quite frankly, after five budgets, I just do not think those opposite have that view in mind. Perhaps they think this is their ticket to another election. I've got to say: guys, I think you're mistaken on that as well. But, if you're not in this House with a genuine commitment to make a difference for the better in the community, you should not be here.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (19:12):  The Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and the other appropriation bills before us today demonstrate the stark choice which is going to face the people of Australia at the next election. It will be a choice between a Turnbull government which delivers sober reform and a strong economy, and an opposition that arrogantly parades its false and vacuous promises. It will be a choice between responsible government for all and naked self-interest. On this side of the House, we have delivered a million more jobs and record bulk-billing rates, and we're delivering $75 billion worth of infrastructure our nation desperately needs. On that side, they have kowtowed to law-breaking unions, shielded members who should never have taken a seat in this place, and tried to set Australians against each other in an outdated and divisive class war—wait, I've got more about that.


And why? Because on this side of the House we have real leaders who have shifted the debate on everything from stopping illegal immigration to fixing our declining school standards. The Leader of the Opposition, on the other hand—well, he's just shifty. Three years ago, the Heydon royal commission saw straight through this Leader of the Opposition. The commission's counsel assisting called him evasive on the witness stand, while the commissioner himself said that his non-responsive approach to giving evidence called into question his very credibility. Since that royal commission, we've had the question of this Leader of the Opposition's credibility settled once and for all: he has none. You simply can't trust a word he says. Sadly, to the detriment of this House and our nation's democracy, we have seen ample evidence of that over recent months.


There's no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition read the same court decisions as the rest of us when it came to the test for eligibility under section 44 of the Constitution. He knew what it meant as well as the rest of us. He knew that there was a two-stage test for those who held dual citizenship and that the 'all reasonable steps' that they parroted on about applied only when a foreign law operates irremediably to prevent an Australian citizen from renouncing his or her citizenship.



Ms Madeleine King interjecting—




Mr WALLACE:
  And they still can't accept the High Court's decision. He knew that the law was firmly established, just as the court has held in Sykes v Cleary and later reaffirmed in Re Canavan, delivered on the 27 October 2017. Yet for six months he misled the Australian public and dishonestly maintained that no fewer than four of his members of parliament were eligible to represent their local constituents when clearly they were not. Months of Labor parliamentary salaries and perks were paid out, while my colleagues on this side of the House in fact did the right thing and resigned or referred themselves to the High Court immediately.



Ms Madeleine King interjecting—




Mr WALLACE:
  He went further, of course. Famously, he gave no less than a 'rolled-gold' guarantee that all Labor members were eligible. The people of Australia and the unfortunate constituents of Fremantle, Braddon and Longman know what that guarantee was worth.



Ms Madeleine King interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  The member for Brand will cease interjecting.




Mr WALLACE:
  They know how much trust they can place in the Leader of the Opposition. But it's always been that way with him. What about the workers of CleanEvent when the Leader of the Opposition stripped away their pay and conditions while the AWU received secret payments of $75,000 for those arrangements? What about the workers at Chiquita Mushrooms when the Leader of the Opposition sold them out in return for secret $4,000-a-month training payments to his union? They quickly found out how much credibility he had as an advocate for the working people. And who could forget Labor's 'Mediscare' campaign in the 2016 election?


Even his own colleagues can't trust him. Former Prime Minister Rudd learned that the hard way. No doubt he trusted his then employment minister when that minister pretended to be a loyal cabinet colleague. As Mr Rudd soon discovered, trust in this Leader of the Opposition is often misplaced. No doubt the woman who replaced him, former Prime Minister Gillard, trusted the now Leader of the Opposition when he threw his support behind her. We all know how long that lasted. 'Up until the spill,' he told reporters, 'I was going to support the Prime Minister.' There you have it. The Leader of the Opposition was 'going to be loyal'. He was 'going to tell the truth', right up until the moment his self-interest changed his mind.


The workers he claims to represent, the people of Australia, his own closest colleagues—they all know that this Leader of the Opposition will do anything, say anything and doublecross anyone to claw his way to the top.




Mr Irons:
  Whatever it takes.




Mr WALLACE:
  Whatever it takes, and at what cost? We began to learn that back in 2013. In his desperate efforts to gain the then CFMEU's support, the Leader of the Opposition was once again ready to promise almost anything, to the detriment of his party and the Australian people. He agreed to the CFMEU's demands that he oppose any industry specific regulator, including the one he himself established in 2012. He agreed to oppose any form of building code, despite the clearly established need. He agreed to oppose any kind of compulsory evidence-gathering powers for a regulator in the building industry, despite the ever-mounting evidence, now proven, of staggeringly widespread union illegality. Having made his deal with the lawless construction union and linked his self-interest to theirs, it is difficult to know what representatives of the CFMMEU would have to do before the Leader of the Opposition would not stand next to them. Justice Geoffrey Flick said of them:


It is difficult, if not impossible, to envisage any worse conduct than that pursued by the CFMEU.


This is a union that has been fined almost $15 million, far more than has ever been seen before.


It's an organisation with around 70 officials personally before the courts. Its boss, John Setka, by the way, has been widely congratulated by those opposite for having blackmail charges dropped last week. Everyone knows it's not unusual at all for the DPP to drop charges in legal proceedings. What is unquestionable is that John Setka has been found guilty of 59 separate offences, including assault and theft, and was jailed twice, in fact, for contempt of court. He has even admitted that illegal activity is at the heart of the way he does business. Channelling ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, Mr Setka told Sky News last week, 'We get fantastic pay rises and good conditions for our members because we fight it outside the law.'


Even the Leader of the Opposition's own colleagues know how wrong and self-serving his continued support for the CFMMEU is. Labor's hero, former Prime Minister and ACTU boss, Bob Hawke, has called the construction union's behaviour appalling and said that he would not tolerate it. He told The Australian in 2016, 'I would throw them out,' just as he himself threw out its predecessor, the Builders Labourers Federation. Oh, for a Labor leader with some backbone today! Even Kevin Rudd has called for the CFMMEU to be expelled from affiliation with Labor, and for the influence of trade union factions in the party to be reduced. Even Peter Beattie said last week that he would refuse CFMMEU donations if he were the leader.


Yet there this Leader of the Opposition is, telling CFMMEU members at the Oaky Creek north mine site, where threats, including threats to rape children, and intimidation had been rife, 'The privilege for us today is to be in your company.' There he is, defending the CFMMEU day in, day out, just like his job depended on it. That's because it does—with $11 million in donations paid to Labor since 2001 and the factional support of its many active members, this Leader of the Opposition is owned lock, stock and barrel by the CFMMEU. The most sickening part of all of this is the fact that the Leader of the Opposition peddles his divisive, dishonest and exploitive envy mongering under the banner of a fair go. It's a cynical and nauseating distortion of what we all believe is at the heart of our uniquely Australian egalitarian way of life.


Where is the Leader of the Opposition's fair go when he is slugging senior Australians, who have worked and saved their whole lives, with a new multibillion-dollar retiree tax? Where is the fair go for 2.6 million Australians with APRA regulated superannuation accounts? What clever excuse is he going to give them when it comes time to explain why he has pillaged $3.75 billion from their hard earned savings? Where's the fair go for the millions of Australians whose jobs will be put at risk by the insatiable hunger of this Leader of the Opposition for more and more tax and his desire for the keys to the Lodge?


Even if what passes for a moderate version of Labor's tax plan were enacted, there would be 1.4 million Australian workers put at risk. There would still be thousands of businesses whose investment decisions had been undermined overnight. It would still mean many thousands of unemployed or underemployed Australians who would no longer have the opportunity to take up one of the new jobs created by our investment. What clever weasel words will the Leader of the Opposition use when it comes time to explain to our young people why there are no jobs for them? And where was the fair go for the workers at Clean Event or at Chiquita Mushrooms when their union secretary gave away their pay and conditions for his union's benefit?


Whether he's the secretary of the AWU or the Leader of the Opposition, he has only one guiding principle—that is, selling out the people he's meant to represent in the interest of his own. That's how he ran the AWU back then. It's how he's running the Labor Party today. It will be how he runs the country if he is ever allowed to occupy the Lodge. In the end, there is only one Australian the Leader of the Opposition is looking out for, and that is the Leader of the Opposition himself. There is only one standard to which he holds his words and his actions, and that is naked self-interest. His colleagues know that, those present here tonight know that, his supporters know that and the people of Australia know that. They have seen through the shifty Leader of the Opposition, and when they have the chance next year they will, as we should today, shun his empty politics of selfishness and division and support the Turnbull government's plan for a stronger, more prosperous Australia.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (19:26):  The member for Fisher should stand on his feet and resign. That was the most appalling speech. This debate is about his government's budget, and these bills are about appropriations for the budget. Yet he engaged in a 14-minute tirade against the Leader of the Opposition. How pathetic he is. How pathetic is everyone on that side? Every question time, every chance they get, they slag off the Leader of the Opposition. What a bunch of cowards. This is your budget, and yet all you want to do is come in here and slag off the Leader of the Opposition. There's a metaphor they use in sport: play the ball, not the man. Perhaps everyone on the government benches needs to remember that. Play the ball and not the man. Be engaging on policy, that is what you should be doing as a government. This is about your budget. You would think they'd have some pride about what the government has put forward and be in here talking about their great vision. But, no, like a bunch of cowards they're going on the hack and are not standing up here. They can't even defend their Treasurer's budget. Just how useless are they? It is pathetic. If you're not in here to stand up and advocate for policy, if you're not in here to stand up and advocate for measures or your vision for this country, then resign. You have no business being an elected representative, and you have no business representing your communities.


The electorates of the member for Fisher and of the members on the Sunshine Coast are some of the poorest electorates that we have. It's so typical of the Liberal and National parties to forget the bush. It's so typical of them to come up here and completely forget the regions and not advocate for the regions. Some National Party held electorates and some Liberal Party held electorates are among the poorest electorates that we have. Yet what we are seeing from this government in these appropriations bills is cuts to the pension. They're actually cutting the pension. The age pension is well below the poverty line, but this government, this miserable mob of MPs who claim to represent the regions, is cutting the pension by $7 a week. I know it's not a lot to a millionaire, to someone who lives it up and who lives in a harbourside mansion. I know it's not a lot to those who may have 10 or 12 investment properties. I know it's not a lot to the silver spoons across the chamber from us. But it is a hell of a lot to a pensioner, to someone who is trying to survive on that fixed income. They say, 'We're just correcting the scrapping of the clean energy supplement, because there's no longer the carbon tax.' Something the government doesn't recognise is that—news flash!—energy bills have gone up under their watch. Under their great—I use exclamation marks—stewardship energy bills have gone through the roof. And now they want to cut the pension. They also want to lift the retirement age to 70. What an absolute disgrace. They are going to say to nurses, to cleaners, to builders: 'Keep working until you're 70.' They say it's because Australians are living longer. It's not about how long you can live. It's about your working age and how long you can work for. That's the problem with this government, and that is the problem with its proposals in this budget.


Another area that this government hasn't been honest about is the cuts to early childhood education. And what the government is doing—

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:29):  It gives me great pleasure this evening to rise to speak on the appropriation bills for 2018 and 2019. I'd like to start off on the subject of university funding and the recent case of Professor—or now Doctor—Ridd. I'll start with the comments about what John Stuart Mill wrote back in the year 1869 in On Liberty:


The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.


It is that belief that is the reason why we fund our universities with taxpayers' dollars so that they are the bastions of free speech, places where free and open debate are welcome. They become places where dissenting opinions are welcomed, not frowned upon, where alternative views and theories are listened to and tested. The idea of gagging scientists, of silencing academics criticising their university, of having intolerance for different views, where dissent must be crushed rather than encouraged, is a perversion of those words of Mill. It is a perversion of the legacy of the Enlightenment. That is how totalitarian regimes develop and work.


And yet we have the treatment by James Cook University of Professor Ridd. First they tried to punish the professor for simply daring to question the sacred peer review. And these are the words they objected to which Professor Ridd said:


… we can no longer trust the scientific organisations like the Australian Institute of Marine Science, even things like the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies – a lot of this is stuff is coming out, the science is coming out not properly checked, tested or replicated and this is a great shame because we really need to be able to trust our scientific institutions and the fact is I do not think we can any more …


Professor Ridd is merely voicing an alternative opinion. His opinion should be tested against the facts with different hypotheses tested over and over. That is how the scientific method works. But yet, because of those words, there was not only the campaign to curtail Professor Ridd's academic freedom; James Cook University actually made an order that he should not even discuss their campaign to silence and censor him.


And this has gone to the length of absurdities. He was even told not to contact or speak with his wife about the case. He was told that he could not trivialise, satirise or parody James Cook University, and that is what they've accused him of. They've actually accused him of trivialising, satirising and parodying, because he sent a newspaper article about his case to an old friend—merely copied the article—and wrote the words 'for your amusement'. For that, we have a university trying to censor a professor.


But we know what Professor Ridd's real crime was. His real crime was that he dared to question leftist groupthink ideology—an ideology that has a totalitarian mindset that dissenters must be crushed. So I say to those running James Cook University: 'Your targeting and your seeking to silence Professor Ridd are an affront to everything our universities stand for. They are an affront to the very principles of Western civilisation, to the legacy of enlightenment and to our democracy.' When John Stuart Mill used the word 'evil', he said that the particular evil of silencing the expression of opinion is something that we should avoid. I ask those running James Cook University to look at themselves closely, look at the history of the enlightenment and allow Professor Ridd to continue his work. And, if his work is wrong, prove it with science and evidence.


I'd like to address a few other issues during this debate. Firstly, there is the contrast between the coalition and the Labor Party during the budget speech and budget-in-reply speech. We heard the opposition leader, on the night of the budget-in-reply speech, say that he would commit the Labor Party to copying the South Australian experiment—the failed South Australian experiment of a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target which was inflicted upon the poor, long-suffering residents of South Australia. They were turned into guinea pigs for that experiment. What did that experiment deliver—the very experiment that the Leader of the Opposition wants to foist upon the entire nation? It gave that state not only the highest electricity prices in the nation but, unbelievably, it gave that state the highest electricity prices in the world. That is what the Leader of the Opposition wants to copy and inflict upon the nation.


The Labor Party talk about the greater happiness for the mass of the people. That 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target resulted in South Australia having the highest rate of disconnections in the nation. In fact, they went to a 130 per cent increase in disconnections. In 2009-10 in the state of South Australia, there were 4,748 disconnections—people having electricity turned off. Fast forward: once they'd implemented the wonderful policy of a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target, in 2016-17 there were 10,902 households in South Australia that had their electricity disconnected—a 130 per cent increase. That is what the Labor Party want to inflict on all of Australia. How does a family operate if they've had their electricity disconnected? How do their kids do their homework at night? How do they cook their evening meal? How do they keep food fresh in a refrigerator if they have no electricity after it was cut off? And yet the policies of the Australian Labor Party are to introduce and copy the very policies that saw a 130 per cent increase in South Australian households having their electricity cut off.


We have seen from the Australian Energy Regulator what it has done to the average debt. While the average electricity bill debt in Queensland is $650 and in New South Wales it is $850, in the state of South Australia it is $1,200, almost 50 per cent higher. What that means is that residents in South Australia have less money in their pocket to spend on services, at the local shops or at the local cafe. They have less money to buy something extra for their kids or something nice or to save money for a holiday, because they have to put more money aside for electricity. We are talking about a $550 difference between Queensland and South Australia in what they have to pay on their bill, yet this is the policy that the Labor Party want to inflict on all of Australia.


It doesn't stop there. We also have seen the Labor Party commit to upping the Paris targets. They think the Paris targets that we have committed to are not high enough. They want to up it to a 45 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.


So I would ask the members of the Labor Party this. We know what your plans are for electricity. We know how your plans proceed. We know exactly what happens. We have the example of the state of South Australia. But can you tell us: how are you going to get a 45 per cent reduction in emissions in the transport sector? Are you going to put up the price of petrol? Are you going to put up the price of registration? Are you going to take cars from people? Explain to the Australian public how you are going to get a 45 per cent reduction in transport. How are the Labor Party going to get a 45 per cent reduction in emissions in the agricultural sector? What do they have planned for the farmers of this nation if they inflict or force upon them a 45 per cent reduction? What about industry, which uses gas? How are they going to get a 45 per cent reduction there? Quite simply, we'll close the businesses down, put the workers out of work and send the production offshore. Is that the plan that the Australian Labor Party have? What about gas for home heating? How does the Labor Party intend to get a 45 per cent reduction in the emissions from people using gas for their home heating? Do you expect people to sit shivering in the cold so we can achieve some sort of virtue signalling and so you can run around and say, 'Yes, we've achieved our targets?' This is what the Australian people need to know. This is what the Labor Party need to explain about their policies. We know the damage that they are going to cause in the electricity sector, but tell us: what are your policies on transport to get those reductions, what are your policies on agriculture, what are your policies for industry, and what are your policies for gas and heating?


Finally, this is where we see the greatest difference between the coalition and the opposition. We see the difference in speech after speech in this chamber. Members of the Labor Party simply think the size of our economic pie is fixed. They think the wealth that we've created just arrives naturally and it's just a matter of carving it up in a way that they see as fair and equitable. This is a mistake that, as we've seen in nation after nation, has sent countries backwards, because the size of the economy is not fixed. The wealth that we have in this nation depends on the hard work, the entrepreneurial efforts and the risk taking of the Australian citizen.


That's why we think that it is best policy to lower the corporate rate of tax, because we know that we need to have that corporate rate of tax internationally competitive. How long can we continue with a 30 per cent corporate tax rate, stuck at that level since the year 2000, if we see all our international competitors lowering their corporate rate of tax? We see the US bringing it back to 21 per cent. We see the UK bringing it back to 19 per cent. We see Hong Kong and Singapore at 15 and 17 per cent. How can we attract investment if we are going to have a 30 per cent corporate tax rate, plus a top marginal rate of tax of 49 per cent, where 50 per cent of every extra dollar that someone earns goes to the government? These are the destroyers of the incentives that create the wealth in our nation.


There cannot be greater clarity between what the opposition plans for this nation and what the coalition does. We see the plans of the opposition. They will give us uncompetitive energy prices. They'll copy South Australia and give us the highest prices in the world. They'll make transport unaffordable for many Australians. They'll make our corporate rate of tax uncompetitive. If we have those things uncompetitive, how can we in this nation therefore afford to pay the wages that we'd like to see? How can we increase people's wages if more and more of every business's expenses has to go to a higher and higher electricity bill to meet some artificial target so the Labor Party can go around in their electorates and virtue-signal to the Greens to try to get their preferences?


This is the choice that is coming, and it is a stark choice. It is about a coalition government acting responsibly, bringing the budget back to a balance, then to a surplus and then paying down that debt as the coalition government have done and succeeded at before. The alternative is a reckless Labor Party that will spend and spend money we don't have, make our nation uncompetitive and destroy wealth. (Time expired)

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (16:45):  It gives me great pleasure to rise on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019. I would have to say that I've been in this place 10 years now and back in the electorate there is the best response to a budget I've ever met. It's been a tough decade for Australian taxpayers and, after the 4½ years since the coalition came to government, at last a surplus is in sight. It's not the member for Lilley's fake promises. It's not the, 'We'll be back in the black by 2012-13,' as promised by the member for Lilley. It's not the 'My commitment to a surplus in 2012-13 was a promise made and it will be honoured,' as the then Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in April 2011. It's not a hundred other quotes announcing the surplus being delivered when the record shows six years of multibillion-dollar deficits under the former Labor government.


It's been hard work since that time, in the 4½ years of the coalition government. Since coming to government, the coalition has applied a steady handbrake on growth to government expenditure. It's not a brick wall that would have stalled the economy, no slashing of jobs and no savage cuts, but gentle pressure across the board that has allowed for growth in government expenditure, has increased services and, most importantly, has promoted growth in the country. I think perhaps the most important news in the budget is that we do return to surplus next year, a year earlier than we predicted. Contrast that to the former government, where the surplus just kept getting postponed and put further and further out. In fact, this government, with a sustained effort, will bring in a surplus 12 months earlier than predicted. This is an enormous turnaround, and we have gotten there by underpromising and overdelivering—always a very good path for governments.


The brightest part of the economy is the jobs growth, with 427,000 in the last 12 months, and one million new jobs since the coalition was elected in 2013. It doesn't happen by accident. One million new jobs means there are one million people that are no longer on new start; one million people that are paying tax and contributing to the wealth of this nation; and one million people that will are renting and building houses and installing a new kitchen in their house, giving jobs to other people.


The budget delivers immediate tax relief for middle-income earners. Within four years, the government will remove the 37-cents-in-the-dollar rate completely. Now, a lot of rubbish has been spoken about the changes the government proposes in taxation. I would love to wax lyrical about that and point out all of those errors, but there is a bill coming up on this matter in the next 24 or 48 hours, and I'll reserve my comments on the changes to the tax rates to that debate.


There is a whole raft of good news. In Grey, without doubt, the big ticket item in infrastructure is the commitment to duplicate the Joy Baluch AM Bridge at Port Augusta. For those of you that don't know—I know, of course, you would, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons—all of the north-south traffic through Central Australia and all of the east-west traffic across the south of Australia passes over this single bridge at Port Augusta. It is the only viable link between the east and west of Port Augusta. Emergency services can be sidelined if traffic is interrupted on the bridge. Yorkeys Crossing, which is the alternative crossing, is around about a 30-kilometre diversion around the northern swampland of the gulf. It is sometimes suspect and sometimes closed because of wet weather. That has been the fail-safe measure here. I point out that all of the emergency services in Port Augusta are located on the east side, and there is a substantial population living on the west side. You can imagine what would happen if the bridge happened to be out of commission when one of those emergencies eventuated.


East and west Port Augusta were first joined in 1927 by the Great Western Bridge, a wooden bridge which still stands but looks more like a jetty than a bridge—a wooden structure. It was superseded in 1972 by the now-named Joy Baluch AM Bridge. That bridge has served us and the nation—I've talked about the crossflow of traffic and freight across the nation—well since then. However, the designs of 1972 are quite different to today's, and that bridge, as part of its features, has a narrow walkway to the side of the road. This walkway is about 1.4 metres wide, and two gophers can't pass each other if they meet on the walkway. The other day, a lady was pushing a pram with twins in it—the side-by-side arrangement, Deputy Speaker Irons; you would be quite familiar with it—across the bridge, and the pedestrian they encountered had to step onto the roadway to go around the pram. It is obviously not a safe arrangement. In fact, schools are now bussing children from one side of the gulf to the other. Parents draw their breath when their children ride across the bridge on the walkway. They are millimetres from 100-tonne-plus road trains. It's an accident waiting to happen.


Up until April last year it all worked okay, until Port Augusta City Council, which now owns the Great Western Bridge, closed the bridge—the old wooden walkway I talked about earlier—which had fallen into a dilapidated state. These things happen; the bridge had to be closed. Of course, the old wooden bridge was where the pedestrians in Port Augusta had been crossing the gulf since 1972. It forced all of the foot traffic onto the Joy Baluch AM Bridge—and I've described that walkway. I raised this issue with the former South Australian government, along with the then minister for transport, the member for Gippsland. I asked for an engineering report with suggestions on how to install a safe, separated walkway on the bridge. In the almost 12 months through to the state election it never came. I could not believe it. Despite my repeated calls for the state minister to come up with an engineering report on what was the state's bridge it never came. I had great concern for safety in the city.


So the caravan's moved on. In the lead up to the election, I met with a number of business groups. I met with SACOME, the South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy. Their No. 1 priority was the duplication of the bridge across the gulf. I was very pleased indeed when that wish, if you like, was granted in the budget. $160 million committed from the federal government to partner the Marshall state government on an 80-20 basis. Let me say, what a pleasure it is to work with a government that is open for building infrastructure in rural and regional areas. We were able to strike a deal quite quickly. It's a huge investment. It will be quite disruptive, and I ask residents to be somewhat patient, because we know that none of the work has been done on this bridge at this stage. We will need such things as native title clearance, EPA clearance and coastal protection clearance. We don't know exactly where the bridge is going to go and whose houses and businesses might have to be removed as a result of building that bridge. We have no designs at this stage. We are starting from scratch and it will take a little bit of time.


There has been a bit of sniping about the projections in the budget for the expenditure. There's $60 million in the forward estimates. The extra $100 million lies in the projections. Let me say, if we are running in front of the time frame that Treasury predicts to build this bridge, we will find the money. You will not find that this government is holding up the construction of that bridge. I'll be putting pressure on at every level to make sure that we get on with this job, because this is very important. If we are seen to be dragging our heels and something bad happens—I don't even want to contemplate that. I am just so thankful that we've got this commitment from the federal government and that we have this commitment from the Marshall state government.


So that's the big ticket item in Grey. But, let me tell you, there are a lot of extra things in the budget, many of which I and others like me have been lobbying for. In aged care we have an extra 14,000 home-care packages to go along with the 6,000 that the minister allocated in the MYEFO last December. That is 20,000 packages. We know this is still not going to be enough to fill the backlog, but it is an enormous commitment. The Minister for Aged Care has taken this chamber through a process where he has actually drawn in the numbers, so we now understand what that backlog is. It's an enormous commitment and I thank him very much for it. He's also put aside money to help rural aged-care facilities. They can apply to it for capital grants, and I have quite a number that are looking for any kind of assistance they can get. Delivering aged-care services in the country is more expensive than delivering them in the city, and we need to recognise that. These smaller facilities, which are suboptimal in size, are so important to their local communities. As much as is humanly possible, people need to be able to age within their own communities where they are supported by friends and family.


Also in the budget—and I think this is very important—there is an increase, from $250 to $300 per fortnight, in the amount that age pensioners can earn before it will affect their pension. They will applaud this. There is an extension of the $20,000 automatic tax write-off for small businesses—for all businesses, in fact. This has been a very popular measure in the last few years, and I applaud the fact we've been able to extend that. We've raised the threshold for qualification for independent youth allowance. It does raise my eyebrow, I must say, that the independent youth allowance is dependent on what your parents earn. It seems to me that 'independent' would indicate that the student is independent. But we have lifted that threshold where they can apply from $150,000 to $160,000, with an extra $10,000 for each student that is under that parent's responsibility at that stage.


From 1 July there's a new package for parents needing childcare. It will make a considerable difference to working parents. There's a further $200 million on offer for another round of the Building Better Regions Fund. We've had quite a number of very good projects funded throughout the Grey electorate under this program. We always have lots of applications, and I'm looking forward to trying to partner again with those people putting applications into the next round. We have a commitment to a fourth round of the Stronger Communities Program. Once again, this is at the lower end, the grassroots, of community, where we see grants of from $2,000 to maybe $20,000. These are grants that make an enormous difference to voluntary organisations.


The budget committed an extra $550 million for the Stronger Rural Health Strategy. Many times I've spoken in this chamber about the challenges of finding GPs to work in rural Australia, and the suggestions that I've brought forward include something that has not been picked up yet: postcode-specific Medicare provider numbers. This is a constant issue for those of us who live in the country. In fact, at this stage, the electorate of Grey is 29 GPs short. That is up from a figure of around 19 eighteen months ago, and I'm very concerned. That's why I'm pleased the government is making a considerable commitment in this area, including upskilling existing doctors so they feel better prepared to deal with whatever the practice may throw at them, and increasing the number of placements for undergraduates to experience something of rural living while they're going through their training program.


Something that many schools around my electorate will be celebrating is a commitment to permanent funding of the School Chaplaincy Program. This is a program that was created by the coalition. It was altered somewhat during the Labor years, but we brought it back in its original form. It is extremely popular. The schools just lap it up, I have to say. When we're talking about issues in this place such as mental health and our young people needing assistance, a quiet hand and someone to go to to talk about issues, the School Chaplaincy Program is really delivering.


So, right across the board, I welcome the budget. As I said, it's probably the one that has gone down the best in the entire time that I've spent in this chamber.

"King, Madeleine, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (17:00):  I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and the related bills. As has been said, this side of the House will be supporting supply. It is for this reason that I support these bills, which will appropriate about $7.9 billion for the remainder of this financial year and then around $108 billion for the 2018-19 financial year.


But my support for supply is in no way support for the unfair Liberal budget we have just witnessed. This budget is just like every other Liberal budget in that it fail the fairness test. While this is not unexpected, it is always disappointing. It is disappointing to see a federal government so committed to giving its friends at the top end of town an $80 billion tax handout but happy to cast aside the needs—yes, the needs—of children, the elderly and the sick. Instead of investing in schools, TAFEs and universities, instead of investing in hospitals and Medicare and instead of investing in the welfare of pensioners, this government is instead taking care of big business. It is taking care of the multinationals and it is taking care of the banks. I know the banks are having a bit of a rough trot at the moment, courtesy of the banking royal commission, but surely those opposite must question the need to make them feel better at the cost of $17 billion. A cynic in the room could even be forgiven for thinking that the $17 billion was by way of a mock apology for a banking royal commission that this government clearly did not want to have. This government stonewalled the banking royal commission for more than 600 days. It did everything it could to prevent the shocking and unacceptable banking practices that are now front-page news from being exposed. But, thanks to Labor's long and hard fight for the banking royal commission, the government capitulated and we are gaining an insight into how customers have been disgracefully treated by the banks.


This government ought to think long and hard about rewarding this behaviour, especially when we consider what is not being rewarded in this budget. The more than generous $80 billion in tax handouts to the top end of town have to be paid for from somewhere. Let's think about this for a moment. The government is giving $17 billion to the big banks and taking $17 billion out of education. So, on the one hand, it is giving $17 billion to the banks and, on the other hand, it is taking $17 billion out of the education portfolio. That truly is unbelievable. Unfortunately for the mums and dads worried about their children's education, unfortunately for those in the community who are sick or have ill family members and unfortunately for those pensioners who rely on the energy supplement to get by, that handout is being paid for with savage cuts to education, health and the pension. This government has plans to persist with its $715 million in cruel cuts to hospitals during the next two years, with further cuts locked in for the five years from 2020. Those opposite are forcing up the out-of-pocket costs on patients needing to see specialists by keeping the Medicare freeze in place. Do they not understand how this is hurting struggling households having difficulty with living pressures and how it is hurting those struggling with low and stagnant wage growth and others struggling with cuts to their wages of up to $77 per week, thanks to this government's shameful stance on penalty rates?


Difficult choices are being made around this country when it comes to things such as private health cover. When you are paying more and more for less and less, you'll find that people start ditching their private health insurance because they can no longer afford the annual price hikes and they can no longer see the point of private health insurance. So how about the government looks to address this affordability crisis, instead of rewarding those with at least an $80 billion windfall? The same applies to education. Cutting $17 billion from schools, as I said before, and cutting another $270 million from TAFE—where is the sense in this? To my mind, and to the minds of most Australians, the last thing we should be doing is stripping money from education. Rather, we should be investing in it and doing all that we can to encourage further investment in education.


I do not know how this government thinks this country can continue to ensure we will have a supply of skilled and trained workers when it continues to strip funding from vocational education. The whopping $3 billion ripped from vocational education has not been enough for Prime Minister Turnbull's government. This budget includes a further $270 million worth of cuts to TAFE and apprentices. I suggest the education minister take time to actually learn what TAFE is all about and how important it is in training Australians for all types of work.


Seriously, have we ever had to withstand a worse education minister in this country? Has there ever been an education minister more out of touch with universities, with TAFEs and even with the early childhood sector? The technical and further education system deserves more than the elitist and dismissive attitude of Senator Birmingham, and apprentices and those in technical education deserve more than the stripping of essential funding by the senator. It's time someone in the government woke up the education minister, gave him a good old shove and stopped him bagging a reputable institution that delivers much more than energy healing and basket weaving. The education minister showed his ignorance of the university sector when he proclaimed that they operate on rivers of gold. Anyone who has anything to do with the sector, anyone who has worked in it and anyone with a skerrick of interest in universities knows that this is only a misguided and dangerous fantasy. He showed his disdain for and ignorance of the TAFE sector as he casually dismissed the efforts of all those TAFE students currently studying. In case those opposite cannot assist the minister for education in learning what goes on in a TAFE, I'm going to take you through some of the many courses and examples of trades training delivered at South Metropolitan TAFE, which includes the Rockingham campus in my electorate of Brand: aero skills and skills in avionics, aviation—a commercial pilot licence—marine craft construction, maritime operations and marine engineering, engineering—industrial electrician, accounting, project management and nursing. The list goes on but, alas, there is no basket weaving or energy healing on offer at the moment.


I think the education minister doesn't really like the portfolio he's been given. He has shown his ignorance of the university sector, his disdain for TAFE and vocational education, and his utter ignorance of and inability to learn anything about early childhood learning and its funding. Given the magnitude of the cuts the minister for education is applying to the sector, it makes me suspect that Minister Birmingham is perhaps auditioning for another role in this government. Perhaps he's auditioning for the Finance portfolio, but of course we know it's going to take quite a few levers to get Senator Cormann out of that role.


While Minister Birmingham has cut into schools and TAFE, that doesn't complete the education trifecta. Of course, universities and higher education are the other place where this government has delivered cuts in very real and dangerous spades. I worked in the university sector before entering this place, so I speak from experience when I talk about how damaging this government's attack on the sector is and the dreadful impact it is having on our institutions, the staff and, most importantly, the students.


The ruthless cuts of this government started before my being elected to this place in 2016. The 2014 budget was just the start of a long and sustained attack on Australians' right, regardless of their bank balance, to a university degree. It's a right based on ability, not bankability. There is still $2.2 billion in university cuts entrenched in the Treasurer's latest budget, despite the voices of many in the field telling how bad it is.


I have met with vice-chancellors and senior staff from three universities in Western Australia: UWA, which stands to lose $38 million, Curtin University, which stands to lose $86 million, and Murdoch University, which stands to lose $35 million from this budget. When the cuts to Edith Cowan University, which are $49 million, are added, this creates a cut of over $208 million from universities for my state of Western Australia. This is utterly unacceptable.


I've said this before: I can only imagine that it's the intention of this government, by putting universities in a funding vice, to push institutions toward instituting higher fees. What we are seeing is the opportunity for a better future that a higher education affords being taken away from those who cannot afford it. I have been to many open days and other university events, and I have talked to students and staff about how these cuts will impact them, and their views aren't positive. Their reality isn't positive. Instead of helping young people to start out on what should be one of the most exciting times as a young adult, we are saddling them with doubt, stress and debt.


I'd like to commend the work of the National Union of Students on their Build a Better Budget campaign. They are campaigning hard for a better deal for university students around the country. Those opposite would do well to listen to student-led grassroots campaigns like this one, and they would do well to work for better standards for students and to increase federal funding for universities around the country. Labor has committed to reversing the savage cuts to the university sector and to moving towards having 200,000 extra Australians attending university, effectively abolishing the Prime Minister's unfair cap on university student places. Labor has always been the only party serious about improving education standards and opportunities in Australia and will continue to be the only party to ensure that those commitments are met. It might seem like a cliched expression, but stating the obvious is somehow helpful in this place: young people are the future. We should be adequately funding, growing and adapting our education institutions to ensure that young Australians who aspire to reach a little higher through the Australian education system have the opportunity to do so. Increased cost of higher education will be unmanageable for many.


People are doing it tough when it comes to managing their household budget—faced with the rising cost of living and housing affordability pressures and when faced with underemployment and stagnated wage growth. Some of the most vulnerable people who are dealing with these pressures are doing it on a pension, a fixed income with no wriggle room. How is this government is taking care of them? The answer is that it's not. What it's doing instead is slashing the energy supplement from their pension and leaving a $14 hole in a pensioner's fortnightly pay. For many that will be a very difficult hole to fill. Fourteen dollars might not seem like much to those opposite, but it is when you're on a fixed income, when your pension is carefully budgeted to pay for essentials such as food, rent, heating and power. This burden should not be put on older people in our community. It will cause immeasurable stress on our elderly and vulnerable, and I for one take no comfort in their sacrifice to the big end of town's $80 billion tax handout.


But the vulnerable, regardless of where they are, are an easy target for some. This budget has extended the freeze in foreign aid funding, which is effectively another cut in funding, this time of $140 million, to some of the most desperate and poorest people in the world. Australia's overseas development assistance is at a record low, and the foreign minister has presided over more than $11 billion in cuts to date. The whole point of foreign aid, according to DFAT, is to promote our national interests by promoting prosperity, reducing poverty and enhancing stability, with a focus on our neighbourhood, but here we are as a country slashing our aid budget and undermining our role and responsibilities as a leader in our region.


In this budget, the government has given billions of dollars to those who do not need it, and those who need support most are paying for it. There is another way, a fairer way, of delivering a budget that Australia needs and deserves. Labor's approach to the budget is fair and responsible. It does not squeeze the most vulnerable to benefit the most well off. It is considered when it comes to budget repair. We'll deliver better funding for public hospitals, with every single public hospital benefitting from Labor's investment. Labor's $2.8 billion investment in hospitals will reverse the cruel cuts employed by this government. It will fund more beds, more services and more staff. Our plan will also deliver lower taxes for 10 million working Australians, and we'll also restore Sunday penalty rates. In fact, Labor's plan will see workers who earn up to $125,000 a year paying less tax than they would otherwise pay under this government, with more than four million people in this country getting a tax cut.


As I said before, Labor will abolish Prime Minister Turnbull's cap on university places, which denies disadvantaged students access to university. We introduced the demand driven funding system, a system which enabled more people to go to uni and that allowed an additional 190,000 students to get a place at one of the higher education institutions around this country. This is important when you consider that research tells us that by 2020—in only two years—two out of every three jobs created in this country will require a diploma or other higher education qualification. Investing in higher education place and young people's access to it is a smart thing to do and the right thing to do. We will also abolish upfront fees for 100,000 TAFE places in courses where Australia needs the skills. I would be more than happy to show Senator Birmingham, the supposed Minister for Education, around my local TAFE and show him firsthand what a vital institution it is and for him to meet with some young people engaged in vocational training. It might help open his eyes to the real world, where investment in vocational education delivers skilled workers. For that matter, I'd be very pleased to take him around a university as well.


Labor can deliver on our commitments because we put people ahead of big business and the banks and because that $80 billion of tax windfall to the top end of town can be much better used to deliver for more people in our country. We'll be guided by clear fiscal principles that repair the budget in a fair way. We will not ask the most vulnerable to carry the heaviest burden. Tough calls have been made on tax reform, but they are fair calls: negative gearing, capital gains tax, trusts, and dividend imputation refundability. We will close loopholes to those who need them least. Our plan is fairer and more responsible because we've made the big calls and we've got them right. (Time expired)

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-05-21,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (17:15):  It gives me great pleasure to speak about the budget, because the budget is a very important part of governing. Ultimately, the first role of this government is the defence of the Australian people, to ensure that Australians are safe and that provision is made for our welfare. The next is to create an economy that rewards endeavour. You have to reward endeavour, because the government doesn't have any money; the government only has your money. We need to get that clear: we spend your money, and it needs to be spent responsibly. But we also, if we can, should give some back, because an economy has to create endeavour. Those who get out of bed earlier than others—those who take risks—ultimately need to get rewarded for that. If you fail to grasp that, you get to a point where you stifle the money that comes into this place and the country becomes poorer. Ultimately, a country is rich when its citizens are rich. I think that is the difference and the contrast between how we view a budget and how the Australian Labor Party views a budget. In this budget, we must make sure we look after those who can't look after themselves. We have a duty of care to our senior Australians. We have a duty of care to educate the future and to look after our children. We also have a duty of care to be a beacon to other countries in the world, and I will touch on Australian aid in this budget as well.


Let's just run through this: in 2007, the nation had no government debt, and now we have government debt of $349.9 billion. That is partly from the years of the Labor Party in power, but we have also run deficit budgets ourselves, so we need to look very clearly at that. This year the budget will have a deficit of $18.2 billion and next year a deficit of $14.5 billion, but by 2019-20 we will have a surplus budget of $2.2 billion. I need to make it very clear for those who might be listening that a surplus budget does not mean we no longer have debt. A surplus budget simply means that we have spent less money than we have received, and that then affords us the opportunity to start to pay down debt. We have a long way to go. In 2020-21 we will have an $11 billion surplus, and in 2021-22 there is a projected surplus of $16.6 billion. But that is still only chipping away at the debt.


But I think there are some very good things in this budget contained in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019, and it's about investing in growth and investing in incentives. I want to just touch on the $530 tax rebate for the people who live in my patch. Seventy-three per cent of the people who live in my patch earn under $87,000. The electorate of Mallee is not an electorate made up of people who are very rich. We're not an inner city Sydney or a Brighton or some of those suburbs in Melbourne, but we are very fair and decent people. So we will be quite appreciative of this tax cut.


I noticed that someone put on my Facebook, 'You can keep my $10, and that should go to health and education.' I replied very quickly that I can give you some schools and some hospitals in my patch that would happily take his donation of $530. He didn't reply, and I put that challenge out there. But can I say that that does create incentive, and $530 for those people in that year will be spinning through our local economy. They will spend it on essential things. That's a family trip to the pool. That's a little camping trip on the Murray, a great place. Spinning money through our economy is very important to our country towns. We have over 17,000 small businesses in the electorate of Mallee, and they will benefit from the $20,000 instant tax write-off. There are things that you can deduct instantly to make your business grow. I think that's been very welcome.


One of the things I'm particularly proud of in this budget is addressing health concerns. Unfortunately, we have a shortage of general practitioners in my patch. If you're a general practitioner who has tuned in on the radio, listening to the great debate in parliament, because that's what a good general practitioner should do, can I just say that there are very welcoming people in my patch who would love to have you. Part of this budget is that we have invested $550 million into a stronger rural health strategy. This means that GPs will be able to train in a regional area from start to finish. More than that, there's going to be the opportunity for a graduate who practices in a rural area to have a Medicare provider number, so they will be able to practice. Also, there will be support around graduate positions. What was happening was that people would train in the regions but then have to go to the city for those graduate years, and somehow the attraction of the great lights of the city—whether they fell in love or enjoyed the coffee—meant they didn't come back. Just on that, I might point out that Mildura was the second city in Victoria to get a barista, so if you want good coffee as a GP, you can get it in our part of the world.


There's been some good money put aside for regional development, with round 3 of the Building Better Regions Fund. This is the fund that in our patch has built the Swan Hill saleyards upgrade; the Horsham North Children's Hub; some facilities around recreational lakes, like Tchum Lake, Watchem Lake, Wooroonook Lake; the Mildura runway upgrade; and, recently, the Mallee Accommodation and Support Program facilities, which got $2.4 million, for which I did a sod turning the other day. Having that fund so that councils and communities can work with me to try and tender for it has also been welcome.


I am very pleased to see more money for education in our patch. There are 119 schools in the electorate of Mallee, and every one of those schools gets more. One of the things I've been advocating for, surprisingly, more than anything in the lead-up to the budget, was the school chaplaincy program. Because some of my country schools are reasonably small country schools, they wouldn't have an opportunity to have a school counsellor or wouldn't be able to afford a school counsellor. I was very pleased to see that the National School Chaplaincy Program of $247 million over the forward estimates has been committed. When I started as a member of parliament five years ago I was pulled aside by a young lady, who was 17, and her dad. They said they were in Swan Hill and that there were no mental health support services at all for her when she was going through a difficult time. We now have three headspaces in the electorate of Mallee, in Mildura, Swan Hill and Horsham, combined with the school chaplaincy programs. So they have that initial point of contact within the school network and can be directed to headspace for more clinical support. It makes me very pleased that we are addressing the needs of youth mental health in the great electorate of Mallee.


We have massive infrastructure needs in our patch. One of the great things I've got to say about my electorate is that we are a net contributor to the Australian economy, with $5.3 billion annually of agricultural product being produced—not bad—with only 140,000 residents of Australia. But those things have to be carted on rail or on roads. I was pleased to see that the federal budget continues to fund the Murray Basin Rail Project, with a $440 million upgrade. We are now seeing upgrades on our roads. Of course, something I'd like to see more of, frankly, is Roads to Recovery. There is no point producing something on a farm and not being able to get that onto a national road. You still need to be able to get that 60-tonne B-double down that dirt country road to get the product to the market. I think we should be doing more, and we should continue a higher allocation of that.


One of the things that is also very relevant to the people in my patch is funding for pensioners. Now, I'm going to touch on this a little bit. There are 20,234 pensioners in the electorate of Mallee. Whilst I was pleased to see that a pensioner can earn $300 per fortnight without it upsetting their pension payments, I would have liked to have seen that able to be accumulated in a lump sum and then averaged across a year. I will explain why this is. Three hundred dollars per fortnight is $7,800 over a 12-month period.


Increasingly, many of our senior Australians are going to be an important aspect of filling the labour shortage, particularly in a horticultural region. I was at Boundary Bend Olives the other day, and they were picking their olive harvest. They were employing 130 people for about an eight-week period. They have people who tend to be grey nomads who come in and work. Once they've worked the harvest, they will go up to Queensland and spend the money there, or maybe they'll even go down to Tasmania and spend the money down there, which would make some members in this place very happy—or even across to South Australia, if they're really scraping the barrel for places they might go to visit!


We should be empowering them to do that seasonal work. Rather than making it just $300 per fortnight, it makes sense that they could accumulate $7,800—so work a vintage, work a season in horticulture or work somewhere—and then go away and take their holidays, and they will largely spend that money locally. So, whilst I'm very pleased to see that our pensioners can earn a little bit more without it upsetting their pension, I would like that to be able to be accumulated and then averaged over a 12-month period both to provide an incentive for our workforce in our horticultural industry and to create more flexibility for our senior Australians who choose to do something in the workforce. I've got to say: pensioners have a lot of skills. We should empower them. They've still got a lot to offer Australia.


One thing I think we need to look at very seriously in a welfare payment—and it concerns me a great deal—is the impacts on single pensioners. If you are two pensioners living in a household, by the time you pay your rates and by the time you pay your power bill, you can get through. It's not a rich, vibrant living, but you can get through. But what happens when one of those pensioners passes away? The rates still need to be paid. The power bill still needs to be paid. I think that, if there's one thing in the welfare budget that we should look at some increases in, it should be that single widow pension. I think that would be a very interesting and compassionate response, particularly when people find themselves in those hardships, and in the light of the expenses of daily living.


I was very pleased to see $51.3 million put aside for agricultural counsellors. It's one thing to have a free trade agreement, but a free trade agreement simply opens an opportunity. There's no point having an opportunity unless you can turn an opportunity into a reality. A lot of our producers produce very, very good product. In my patch, there is really nothing you can eat that isn't grown in the Mallee, be it table grapes, be it carrots—25 per cent of Australia's carrots—or be it citrus. I was told once that the only thing you can't catch in the Mallee is a Murray cod, because technically it's on the South Australian side once you get on the water, and all that water is making its good way down to South Australia to be used effectively there as well. You've got to be able to turn those opportunities into reality, and the additional $51.3 million to do that is very welcome.


As well, something that, whilst not in the budget, slipped through the radar for many people is the unlocking of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan that came with the SDLs. I'll explain why this is relevant to my patch. One of the great lessons we've learnt out of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is that you can achieve good environmental outcomes with the investment of some pumps, some dams, some risers and a culvert here or there. People may not have realised this, but there will be $300 million worth of investment—think about that: $300 million worth of investment—in the electorate of Mallee to deliver seven environmental water projects, and they have to be built by 2024. Whilst the budget was going on here, in the other chamber over there they were passing the SDLs. This will achieve better management of our water as well as unleashing quite a substantial amount of infrastructure that has to take place in my patch.


One of the other great things in the budget, which is a small thing, which appeals to me as an aviator as well as a farmer, was $260 million for the GPS satellite based augmentation strategy. For people who don't understand what that is—I first saw this in Canada—essentially you can have inter-row sowing and GPS technology. Instead of it taking five metres, it will get it down to 10 centimetres, so the accuracy is substantially improved. There's also a big advantage for aviators—and I am one—in being able to do GPS approaches to airports.


There are a lot of good things in this budget. There are a lot of things to be proud of. There are things that we can do better, and we should always have that robust debate. I do not hold the view that everything we do on our side of the parliament is perfect and everything the other side does is wrong and evil, or vice versa, but we need to ensure that we spend Australians' money wisely, create incentive and look after those who can't look after themselves. I think this is a very fair and reasonable budget.

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (17:30):  I often end up following the member for Mallee's speeches for some reason. He's a good speaker and I do enjoy listening to his contributions. I'd like to say a couple of things, if you don't mind, Deputy Speaker, following his contribution. He mentioned the instant asset write-off. I'm very proud that the government had included this. I would remind him that in 2013, when the coalition came to government, they axed the instant asset write-off that was in place under Labor. They killed it stone dead, much to my disappointment. So I was very pleased to see it return, member for Mallee. It was a good decision and one that Labor has been backing all the way through. He made mention of the Building Better Regions Fund and round 3. I'm very disappointed that in Tasmania we've seen very little of this money. I look forward to perhaps seeing a little more of it. Maybe they'll open it up in time for the Braddon by-election and we'll see some rolling in.




Mr Broad:
  Heaven forbid!




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  Yes, heaven forbid! We heard the Prime Minister today talk about the supposed falsehood of education cuts. We all know that schools had funding budgeted to them. It was in the budget papers in black and white. A certain figure was in the budget papers a couple of years ago and that figure was cut. So it's good to see that funding in total is now on the increase, but that's from a low base—a base that's already been cut. There'd be a lot more money for schools in your electorate, member for Mallee, if those cuts had not been made by this Treasurer.


I come to the budget. Two weeks ago, we listened as a Liberal Treasurer handed down a Liberal budget that again failed the fairness test. There was a $17 billion handout for big banks while cutting $17 billion from schools. What illustrates a budget that's unfair better than that? Here we have banks before a royal commission admitting to things like forging signatures, charging dead people fees and charging for services that were not delivered. So here we have the banks admitting to all of these things and this government's tough action for those crimes is to give them $17 billion in tax breaks. A round of applause for the tough action of this government! There was a $17 billion handout for banks while cutting $17 billion from schools. New aged-care packages are paid for by stripping the residential aged-care places. There is not one extra dollar for aged care; just a shuffling of the deck. There is a $270 million cut for TAFE. What a great way to train Aussie kids for jobs of the future: cutting their pathways to that future by cutting TAFE and training on top of the government's entire axing of the trade training centre program when it first came to government in 2013! I think that was one of the most scandalous decisions of this government. Those trade training centres were a project of the former Prime Minister, John Howard. I would have thought the Liberals would have been proud of that program. Labor liked that program and we kept it in place when we were in government. It worked. It gave kids who wanted to train for the future a place to gain skills, and one of the very first acts of the Liberals upon coming to power was to axe trade training centres. That cut, the cuts to TAFE and the drop in apprenticeships of 130,000 over the last five years all add up to a government that is not looking after the interests of young people. Thank you, Member for Mallee!


The government will make a $127 million cut to the ABC, all because this organisation dares to report news that this government doesn't like and airs opinions this government doesn't agree with. There's no reason I can think of as to why this government would be cutting that sort of money from the ABC other than just sheer malice against the national broadcaster. They might think they're being a bit smart in doing it, but we're talking about a funding cut that will result in less money for children's broadcasting, less money for drama production, less money for news and current affairs and, as far as I'm concerned, less money for regional and rural reporting. The ABC does a wonderful job in the regions in bringing the stories of country Australia to the rest of Australia, and that will all be put at risk because of this government's petty vindictiveness. The list goes on.


The big shining light of this budget, apparently, is a $10 a week, or about $540 a year, tax cut for working Australians. That's lorded as the government's major achievement of this budget—a 10-bucks-a-week tax cut. But they keep quiet about the more than $7,000 a year that they plan to give back to high-income earners, like every member in this place, bank executives, lawyers and highly paid surgeons. Anybody on more than $200,000 a year, by the time this government's tax program gets through the parliament, if it gets through the parliament, will be getting $7,000 a year back in tax breaks, when ordinary workers will get back just over $500. What an absolute disgrace when it comes to fairness. Australians expect better than this second-rate attempt to copy the failed trickle-down economic model that has wreaked absolute havoc across the once mighty American middle class. Trickle-down has been in place in America for the last 30 or 40 years, since Reagan. Kansas tried to take it even further; they've doubled back. I see the member for Brisbane having a bit of a chuckle—he's a member of the IPA brigade, I believe, or the retailers.



Ms Flint interjecting—




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  Sorry, the IPA brigade is over there—the member for Boothby.




Ms Flint:
  We know you're Labor. You don't believe in freedom.




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  I don't believe in trickle-down, Member for Boothby. Trickle-down is a failed experiment. They've had it in place in America for 40 years. It has absolutely failed. You've got a widening gap of income in America. The once mighty middle class in America that everybody aspired to—the great American middle class; the great American dream—has gone. People are casualised and contracted out. There are low wages. You've got the wealthy getting wealthier, rich beyond comprehension, whereas everybody else is living in their car. There was a woman living in her car doing three jobs at, I think, a doughnut shop and other franchises. She died in her car because she was living in her car between shifts instead of being able to go home. This is the reality of trickle-down economics in America and this is the future that we can expect in Australia if those failed policies gain a bigger foothold here than they have already.




Mr Fletcher:
  Why don't you find another rhetorical straw man to attack?




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  I wouldn't speak of straw men, Minister.



Mr Fletcher interjecting—




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  The straw man is a character without a brain, Minister—I'd be careful there! Trickle-down economics is a model that makes those with money even richer but leaves those without even further behind. So Labor absolutely rejects trickle-down. We reject it completely. What we believe in—



Mr Fletcher interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  Order!




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  The pink and grey galah is having a bit of a squawk down there at the dispatch box, so I'd ask him to pipe down.


We believe in trickle-up. We know that the best growth comes from feeding the roots, not the leaves. You don't spray the leaves; you feed the roots. You provide strong foundations to an economy—strong foundations in health, education, infrastructure and community services. You feed the grassroots. You feed the people. You feed the masses at the bottom. You don't feed the top; they're getting enough. You feed the bottom. You provide strong foundations in all of these services.


Yet this Liberal budget, like all Liberal budgets before it, fails this test. It's all about the top end of town, and that does not help the people of my electorate. The medium household income in Lyons is $981 per week. That's less than both the Australian average and the Tasmanian average. People in my electorate are not wealthy. It doesn't mean they don't work hard. They do. And it doesn't mean they don't deserve respect. But this government believes that, for a $10 tax cut, the people of my electorate will forget about the health and hospital cuts, they'll forget about the cuts to schools, TAFEs, trade centres and universities, they'll forget about the cuts to pensions and the robo-debt scandal, and they'll forget about the second-rate NBN. Well, the people of my electorate are smarter than that. They won't forget about these cuts and the difficulties that this government has placed upon them.


We all know this is a government that can't be trusted. It says it will build a new $461 million bridge in Bridgewater in my electorate. But a detailed look at the budget pages shows a glaring hole in the budget allocations. Just $25 million is earmarked in the forward estimates. Now $25 million is a lot of money, but it's not going to build a bridge. There is no time frame and no detail. It is a promise from a government that also promised no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to pensions, no cuts to the ABC and then cut the lot of them. It provides little comfort to the people of my electorate that this is a government that cannot be trusted.


This budget shows just how much disregard this government has for rural and regional communities and people by failing to commit to new rounds of the Mobile Black Spot Program.



Mr Fletcher interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Lyons has the call.




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  It's alright, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, I appreciate the protection but I don't require it. The chicken hawk can continue squawking. The pink-and-grey galah down there can keep going and squawk all he likes.


Connectivity is vital in a regional electorate that's prone to bushfire. It can mean the difference between life and death. But this budget ends mobile black spot funding at the end of the next financial year. As those opposite always like to remind us, mobile black spot funding was one of their initiatives. It was a good one; they should have kept it. It ends next year, a decision condemned not only by members on this side of the House but, I would certainly hope, by regional members on the opposite side. It was a short-sighted, stupid decision. When you consider that there is $80 billion to give to corporations and banks but not even a few million to address critical communications gaps in our regions, you really do have to wonder about the priorities of this government when it comes to regional Australia.


This budget is an affront to Australians everywhere. It's only Labor that will provide a budget that is responsible and gives Australians a fair go. Labor has a plan to deliver lower taxes for 10 million Australians. Under its plan, every Australian earning up to $125,000 a year will pay less tax. In my electorate of Lyons, 90 per cent of workers earn less than $90,000 a year. Labor's plan has real benefits for every single one of those people, and every single one of them will be better off under Labor's plan than under the coalition's plan. Only Labor's plan also results in better-funded schools and universities and a better-resourced TAFE, providing people, including our young people, with the knowledge, skills and training they need to reach their goals and enter the careers and industries they want to.


Only Labor reverses this government's billion-dollar cuts to health and hospitals, creating better systems across the country that are able to accommodate demand and minimise waiting lists. It's no secret that the Tasmanian health system, under the Liberal government in Tasmania, is one of the worst in the country, with appalling outcomes, ambulance ramping and long waiting times for surgery. You name it, it's behind on every measure. It is poorly resourced an unable to meet the needs of the community. Tasmania's health system needs national support. It's not going to come from this government, but it will come from Labor. Labor has made that commitment. For too long, Tasmania has been neglected by this Liberal government. Tasmania has been ignored for the past five years. It's clear that this government thinks it can buy back support with a $10-a-week tax cut and vague promises of infrastructure that will be given at some undetermined time in the future. But Tasmania will not forgive or forget this government's arrogance, nor will Tasmanians tolerate this government's pandering to the Prime Minister's big business and big bank mates. Tasmanians will not respond well to the government's habit of abandoning rural and regional communities when they need assistance most.


We had a speech in the Federation Chamber earlier today on the member for Grey's motion on suicide prevention trials—which has bipartisan support, I must say. The glaring fact out of that speech and that motion was that rural and regional communities suffer with that issue. It's rural and regional communities that need support. It is rural and regional communities that are left behind under this government's budget. We need to do better, and only Labor will do better.

"Wicks, Lucy, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (17:45):  I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and the other appropriations bills before the House and commend the work of the Treasurer in particular for his work on this budget. This is a budget that is good for my electorate on the Central Coast and is good for Australia. In my time today I'd like to talk about five local examples of why this is the case. Firstly, we're delivering safer communities in places like McEvoy Oval at Umina Beach. Secondly, we're backing small businesses like Six String Brewing at Erina. Thirdly, older Australians are being supported while also being protected from Labor's retiree tax. Fourthly, we're seeing tax cuts for almost 60,000 low- and middle-income earners in Robertson while guaranteeing the essentials like Medicare. Finally, we're delivering infrastructure that our region needs, like better local roads and infrastructure that rejuvenates Gosford and our region, such as the performing arts and conference centre.


I'm starting with safety and security, because I know that for many people of all ages this is their No. 1 concern. Last week we were joined by the Minister for Home Affairs, the member for Dickson, who met with local residents at Ettalong Beach, and then a couple of days later by the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, the member for Mitchell, who made a significant announcement at Umina Beach. I thank both of them for joining me on the peninsula, because this was a week when we took another step forward in uniting with our community against crime, vandalism and antisocial behaviour.


At Umina Beach, we gathered at the fabulous Jasmine Greens Park Kiosk to announce new funding from the government's Safer Communities Fund for CCTV cameras to keep our region safe. The cameras will be located at the Peninsula Recreation Precinct, where the cafe is located, at McEvoy Oval at Umina Beach, at the San Remo BMX park and at Banjo's Skate Park in Terrigal, where construction is underway. The funding boost was welcomed by local community leaders who came with us to hear the news firsthand over a coffee and some beautiful food prepared by Gabby Greyem, including Rod Unsworth and Mark Nitsos from the Umina Community Group, Stuart Field and his son Ronan from Woy Woy Peninsula Little Athletics—one of the groups who use McEvoy Oval—Matt Sawyer from the Peninsula Touch Association, Matt Cooper and Senior Constable Paul Scollon from Umina Beach PCYC, Central Coast councillor and advocate Jilly Pilon—who was also there to speak about Banjo's Skate Park—and Detective Inspector John Zdrilic from the Brisbane Water police district in the New South Wales Police Force. Of course, we were hosted by Gabby Greyem from Jasmine Greens, who really has been a tireless community advocate, particularly on this issue.


Police tell us how CCTV cameras are an effective crime prevention measure, a valuable investigative tool and a deterrent to antisocial behaviour. McEvoy Oval, a local community hub as well as a sports field, will be covered, and it will help to protect the new amenities block, which was recently opened thanks to funding from all three levels of government and the local clubs themselves. The driving force behind that project was Kylie Brown from Woy Woy Peninsula Little Athletics Club, who told us that the club facilities at McEvoy Oval are often targeted, sadly, by vandals with graffiti, including just a few days ago, and in fact goods were stolen from the sporting clubs, resulting in a flow-on cost to the community to repair that damage. So Kylie said that this CCTV funding is most welcome at such a pivotal time for the club.


The funding is being committed under round 2 of the coalition's Safer Communities Fund, and I'm advised that the budget also allows for a third round of funding, which we are already starting to plan for and will no doubt advocate for. Keeping our communities safe also benefits small businesses, and there's great news in this budget for them too. Our economic plan has delivered more than one million jobs into the Australian economy over the last five years, which is of great benefit to so many households and businesses. Parts of our ongoing plan are our small- and medium-business tax cuts, which will help more than 15,000 local businesses with turnovers of up to $50 million if they're incorporated and up to $5 million if they're unincorporated as they look to invest, employ and pay their workers more.


This budget also extends the popular instant asset write-off for small businesses for a further 12 months. Small businesses with turnovers of up to $10 million can benefit from writing off assets costing less than $20,000, and I'm advised that well over a thousand local businesses in my electorate have already taken advantage of this great initiative.


But, ultimately, it's not the government that creates jobs; it's business, which is why we need to listen to industries who have specific needs so that they can continue to grow. One of these industries is craft brewers, many of which are Australian owned, such as Six String Brewing in Erina and Block 'n Tackle in Kincumber. This budget means that craft brewers and distillers will no longer pay additional tax, allowing them to compete on fairer terms with large beverage companies. As part of our commitment, the government will increase the amount beverage companies can claim back on their excise and extend the concessional draft beer excise rate to smaller kegs like the sizes typically used by craft brewers.


To find out exactly how our local brewers would benefit, we went down to Six String on a Friday afternoon for a drink and a chat with Chris Benson and Ryan Harris, owners of Six String, along with Chris's wife, Sharon. Chris told me the announcement was a much-needed recognition for independent breweries as an emerging industry with different needs from the bigger beer companies. As the owner of a small business, Chris said this tax cut will make Six String more flexible, with increased cash flow allowing them to expand, employ more staff and invest in things such as larger tanks to increase the capacity of the brewery itself. It will open the doer to new local products. They've got a number of new beers, such as the delicious and inventive chai latte beer, and it's expected to lead to a downward pressure on beer prices. Nationally, there are around 380 craft breweries in Australia, employing the equivalent of almost 2,400 people, and I commend this budget for backing small businesses like these.


Building a strong economy also means we can keep supporting older Australians and guaranteeing the essentials like Medicare. My electorate has almost 31,000 people over the age of 65, and in this budget we made some important announcements providing more choice so they can live healthier, more independent and safer lives. This includes more financial security by increasing the pension work bonus, expanding the Pension Loans Scheme and delivering relevant skills and training advice to help workers build their careers or transition to jobs in new industries. We're also offering more choice, with 14,000 additional high-level home-care places by 2021-22, adding to the 6,000 places provided since last year's budget.


The budget also guarantees the funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which is a major breakthrough so that Australians with a permanent significant disability receive the best care we can provide. It's important for my electorate on the Central Coast, where, once it's fully rolled out, it will directly help almost 3,000 people and their families.


There's also a strong focus on health in this budget. To begin with, hospitals will receive record funding. Under our new agreement, New South Wales public hospitals will receive over $39.5 billion over the five years to 2024-25, delivering an additional $8.9 billion in funding the compared to the previous five years—up 29 per cent. Medicare, medicines and mental health are also getting a boost, including through the legislated Medicare Guarantee Fund, meaning we can help people to access life-saving medicines for breast cancer and spinal muscular atrophy. I've already spoken with the Minister for Health about the wonderful $1.3 billion National Health and Medical Industry Growth Plan, which will transform and save lives through world-leading medical developments as well as create tens of thousands of new jobs. This includes $500 million for the Genomics Health Futures Mission, which will help Australians live longer and receive better treatment personalised to their medical needs.


This funding boost comes at a really ideal time for the Central Coast where we're seeing an exciting transformation in Gosford with the arrival of the new medical school and research institute on the grounds of the newly upgraded Gosford Hospital. This is a game changer for our region: an $85 million project funded across this government, the New South Wales government and the University of Newcastle. As well as providing a university presence in Gosford and all the jobs and opportunities that will bring, we will also have links with the University of Newcastle's global advisory board, which has connections with the great universities of the world, like Cambridge and New York. It will be a centre of excellence in medical teaching and an international hub for integrated healthcare research and innovation. A collaborative task force has already been working behind the scenes on how the medical school and research institute can be the catalyst for even more jobs, growth and opportunities, including by potentially attracting major corporations to choose Gosford as their base.


As my team and I were meeting with local families across Saratoga and Davistown on Saturday, many people were pleased to hear about this project and some, like Edith on Davistown Road, were also concerned about what we are doing for young people. So I'm pleased to see this budget delivers $110 million in additional investment in child and youth mental health services, with a focus on providing mental health services to children within the school setting. There's also $338 million in new mental health funding with a focus on suicide prevention, research and older Australians. An additional one million people will receive diagnosis, treatment and recovery through a new Million Minds Mission in mental health research with funding of $125 million over the next decade.


For those who need to see a GP without worrying about their hip pocket, the number of GP services that are bulk billed continues to rise, with figures from the July to March period of around 648,000. This is an increase of more than 111,000 since Labor were last in government, with the total percentage of GP bulk billing services sitting at 86.6 per cent, which is up three per cent since the coalition was elected. We will also guarantee the essentials when it comes to schools funding, with government and independent schools funding in my electorate rising by $43.4 million when comparing this school year to the 2027 school year. The Catholic school system across Australia also receives a boost. Funding growth for Catholic schools will be $2.93 billion from now to 2027, a growth of 46.3 per cent. And children of preschool age will benefit from a multimillion-dollar preschool funding boost, which, in my electorate, will mean over 2,000 children will be able to access 15 hours of quality early learning in the year before school.


But families are also concerned about the cost of living and that is why a central part of this budget is tax relief, with a focus on low- and middle-income earners, particularly on the Central Coast. Almost 60,000 taxpayers in the Robertson electorate alone will receive an offset of up to $530 a year under our plan to reduce cost pressures on household budgets. For example, a high school teacher earning $75,000 will have an extra $530 in their pocket from the budget year onwards, with an extra $3,740 in their pocket over the first seven years of the tax plan. A shop assistant in Erina on $45,000 will have an extra $440 in their pocket from the budget year onwards, with an extra $3,380 in their pocket over the first seven years of the tax plan as the tax relief increases. We are also lifting tax brackets to ensure wages don't get eaten by higher taxes and to ensure the government lives within its means. What this translates to is a forecast return to a modest budget balance in 2019-20, increasing to a projected surplus of $11 billion in 2020-21, meaning we will no longer be borrowing to pay for essential services.


Finally, this budget helps deliver the infrastructure that the Central Coast deserves by confirming funding for major projects. We are investing $10 million to help Gosford's long-awaited world-class regional performing arts and conference centre on the site of the former Broadwater Hotel on Mann Street, which will fulfil a decades old dream of our community. The government has invested $7 million towards projects that rejuvenate Gosford such as the regional library learning hub. We are also delivering on our commitment to 600 new jobs in the nearby ATO building. The Somersby Industrial Estate, Banjo's skate park and Terrigal Trojans House upgrade were all confirmed in the budget, along with roads funding for the Central Coast Council through the Roads to Recovery Program election commitments such as the upgrade of Oceana Street at Copacabana. Other road commitments are either already completed or well under way, such as the roundabout on the intersection of Langford Drive and Woy Woy Road in Kariong and Ryans Road at Umina Beach.


Thousands of hardworking local commuters are also benefitting from our commitments, which I'll shortly speak about in more detail elsewhere in the House today. This includes NorthConnex—the M1, M2 missing link—plus our commitment to continuous mobile coverage on trains with Wi-Fi at train stations. These commitments are on track, along with funding from the New South Wales government business case to investigate faster rail options between Sydney and Newcastle.


I strongly commend this budget and these appropriation bills to the House. I do so because of all the reasons outlined today but also because of people like Meredith, from Daleys Point, who wrote to me to say thank you. She said she was so glad there is better help for older people still needing to work. She made particular mention of the Treasurer, who said that, ultimately, it is not the government's money to spend but belongs to the hard-working people of Australia. On a personal note Meredith said, 'Thank you for your kind birthday wishes and birthday card.' Meredith, I hope you had a very happy birthday and that you can plan for even more birthdays in the future with even greater confidence under this government. I commend these bills to the House.

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (18:00):  Back in 2005, prior to the global financial crisis, the member for Wentworth, as a backbencher, commissioned a paper on tax reform entitled Taxation Reform in Australia: Some Alternatives and Indicative Costings. The paper advocated for lower tax rates and a simplified system—in particular, a flatter tax structure. Thirteen years later, after the GFC, the now Prime Minister is finally trying to bring his wishes for a flatter income tax structure to fruition. The paper also noted that arguments for taxing capital gains at the same rate as income are compelling ones. To simplify the argument back in 2005: if you try to tax higher income earners too much, they will be pushed into tax minimisation strategies such as negative gearing and taking full advantage of the capital gains tax discount. Such discounts should be removed, the paper advocated.


So it appears that Prime Minister Turnbull should really be supporting Labor's proposed changes in those areas. Instead, this budget looks after big business at the expense of people who work and struggle. Australians earning as much as $200,000 will be subject to the same tax rate as those earning as little as $41,000 under the tax plan put forward by Scott Morrison to flatten Australia's taxation system, previously known as a progressive taxation system.


Budget tax cuts through to 2024 and 2025 will be less progressive than in our current system and will only help the rich get richer. The promise of income tax cuts worth $140 billion would, as the member for Wentworth's 2005 paper noted, bring the vast majority of working Australians into the same tax bracket, meaning that high-income earners would contribute a much smaller proportion of overall tax revenue than they currently do. In two elections time, the government proposes a shift towards this flat tax system, where the current 37 per cent tax bracket would be axed and workers on incomes between $41,000 and $200,000 would be taxed at the same marginal rate—quite a boon if you are a high-income earner.


In the electorate of Burt, the average income earner is on around $60,000 a year. How on earth is it fair for a construction worker on $60,000 a year to pay the same tax rate as a CEO or a lawyer who is earning $200,000 a year? How can it be fair that, under this tax experiment being put forward by the government, the lawyer or accountant, earning more than three times as much as a construction worker, gets a tax cut that is more than three times as big? In fact, The West Australian newspaper crunched the numbers on Mr Turnbull's unfair tax plan and found that those living in the leafy western suburbs of Perth would pocket an income tax cut of, on average, 11½ times the size of the cut that workers in the suburbs of Gosnells and Armadale, in my electorate, will be receiving. How is 60 per cent of the tax cuts ending up in the pockets of the top 20 per cent of households fair?


The Liberals say they want to deliver tax relief for low- and middle-income Australians. But their income tax plan is holding people hostage for tax cuts. If they really cared about low- to middle-income earners, they would split their proposals so that those that come into effect from 1 July could be supported but those that will only provide a benefit for high-income earners could be avoided. Instead, it seems that this government only cares about the top end of town.


It's interesting, though, to note that the International Monetary Fund says that taxing the super-rich will help reduce inequality without having an adverse impact on growth. The head of the IMF's fiscal affairs unit said that the average top income rate for the rich country members of the OECD—that includes Australia—had fallen by nearly 30 per cent since 1981. If that had occurred for ordinary income earners in Australia, they'd now pay no tax at all. He said there was scope for a more progressive system to tax the rich at higher rates in an effort to redistribute income to those who are less well off.


Meanwhile, this government's budget seeks to do exactly the opposite. The government has not only failed the fairness test set by Labor and, more importantly, by the community; it's also failed the fiscal responsibility test that it set for itself. Net debt for this coming year is double what it was when the Liberals came to office, while gross debt will remain well above half a trillion dollars for each year for the next decade. Both types of debt are growing faster under this government than under the previous government, and the previous government had to contend with the GFC.


Labor's approach to the budget for this nation is fairer for middle Australia and the most vulnerable people in our community, and it's more responsible when it comes to budget repair. Labor would deliver lower taxes for 10 million working Australians. Labor's plan will see those earning up to $125,000 a year still paying less tax than they would under the Liberals. Indeed, under Labor's plan, four million working Australians would receive nearly double the tax cut that they would under this Liberal government.


But the unfairness of the budget doesn't stop at its approach to income tax. This budget raises questions about how committed this Liberal government is to helping Western Australia with its financial woes, with the Turnbull government, over the term of this budget, halving its infrastructure spend for Western Australia. The budget papers also reveal that the only money that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer will provide Western Australia to help with its low allocation of GST is $189 million in this current financial year. There is no extra money to be provided in the budget year or in any of the forward estimates after that. Under the Liberal budget, WA is set to receive only the equivalent of a 50c GST share.


Even the infrastructure funding for Western Australia that the Prime Minister came to announce pre budget is a hoax. It was stated that Western Australia would be receiving an infrastructure spend of $3.2 billion. But then, once we saw the budget delivered and we got into the detail of the budget papers, it shows not only that actually there is no new infrastructure money in this budget but also that, over the period of the budget, the infrastructure spend is only down at $1.2 billion.


This compares to Labor's commitment of a $1.6 billion WA fair share fund, which will provide Western Australia with the equivalent of 70c in the dollar GST. Maybe it's this contrast that explains why the government is hiding the recently delivered Productivity Commission report on GST distribution—and only the Liberals are hiding from the people of Western Australia. Not only are they hiding this Productivity Commission report but they're running away from the by-elections to be held in Perth and Fremantle.


Now, everyone can see that this government is about mates rates on tax, helping those who earn the most, handing $80 billion to the biggest businesses and the banks, as well as its ongoing protection racket for the banks, trying to avoid a royal commission and then, as we've seen in the budget, defunding ASIC and defunding the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. It's no wonder that this Liberal government is cutting and running.


Only Labor is committed to delivering a fair go for Western Australia by delivering the infrastructure, health and education funding that WA needs, as well as providing actually budgeted GST assistance. Only Labor is committed to delivering lower taxes that are fair for millions of working Australians. Labor's approach to the budget is fairer for middle Australia and for the most vulnerable in our community and more responsible when it comes to budget repair. We will deliver extra funding for public hospitals. We'll deliver 20 new MRI machines for regional centres and outer suburbs. We'll abolish Mr Turnbull's cap on university places, and we'll abolish up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE places, to help Australians build their skills. Bear that in contrast to the $270 million cut in funding for TAFE under this government's budget. Labor can deliver on these commitments because, unlike this government, we won't be giving away $80 billion in tax cuts to big business and the banks.


Under a Shorten Labor government, we will achieve a budget coming back into balance in the same year as the government. We'll deliver a bigger cumulative budget surplus over the forward estimates, as well as substantially bigger surpluses over the 10-year medium term, and we'll put the majority of the savings raised from our revenue measures over the medium term towards budget repair and paying down debt. A Shorten Labor government will also be guided by clear fiscal principles, including repairing the budget in a fair way that doesn't ask the most vulnerable Australians to carry the heaviest burden. We will more than offset new spending with our savings and revenue improvements. This is in stark contrast to the approach of this government. We will be able to bank changes in receipts and payments from changes in the economy, and this will be seen in a positive bottom line for our budget—something this government has never seen—because Labor has made the tough calls, tough calls that this government has decided to try and pay us out on, on things like negative gearing, capital gains tax, looking at how income is split through trusts and, of course, the dividend imputation refund. By closing these loopholes, we will be able to make sure that we're able to provide the essential services that all Australians need.


Our plan is fairer and more responsible because it makes sure that those that are most vulnerable in our community are looked after, and it makes sure that we get budget repair done in a fair way. We're able to do that because we've made the big calls and we've got them right. We will of course support supply, but once again we see in this budget the stark contrast between Labor's fair approach and this government's mean, arrogant, out-of-touch, wrong priorities. Let's hope that this budget is their last.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2018-05-21,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (18:12):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and the related appropriations bills. I note that these bills demonstrate the benefits of the sound economic management that we've seen once again from the Liberal-National government. The benefit of focusing on jobs and growth flows through to everyone in Australia, most obviously to those who directly benefit from the jobs this government is helping to create—a record number of jobs, I've got to say; one million jobs since Labor left government.


Having more people than ever in jobs means that there's less pressure on the welfare budget. Having more people than ever in jobs means that there's greater tax revenue to facilitate the things that we all need and want. A stronger economy means that we can spend more on health care. A stronger economy means that we can invest more in education. A stronger economy means that we can start paying down the debt that Labor left behind. A stronger economy also means that families can start keeping more of their own money. We recognise on this side of the House that tax cuts are not a handout. When Labor spruiks handouts and giving away money, they fail to acknowledge that it was their money in the first place. Taxing someone less is not giving them money; it is letting them keep more of their own money, and that is exactly what this government is doing.


The federal budget that the Treasurer brought down earlier this month recognises that cost of living is a major issue for most families, especially those on low to middle incomes. By giving back in lump sum up to $530 each to those low- and middle-income earners, this government will immediately ease cost-of-living pressures. Our tax relief will make it easier for families to pay their electricity bills. It will make it easier for a family to pay their car registration or their council rates bill. A stronger economy also enables investment in major infrastructure projects, which in turn creates jobs as well. A stronger economy also enables investment in our communities.


Representatives from regional areas always face the challenge of ensuring that we see a fair share returned to the regions, especially to the regions where the wealth is created. The regions of Central Queensland and North Queensland punch well above their weight when it comes to delivering dollars into the coffers of both state and national governments. But we often get a raw deal when it comes to seeing some of that wealth reinvested into the region to address our infrastructure and industry needs. However, I've got to say we've been seeing some pretty big wins lately. Many of our big wins have centred around major upgrades of the Bruce Highway that have addressed concerns that North Queenslanders have been raising with me for some time.


In 2012, I led a convoy of Liberal-National politicians, including former Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss, along the entire 1,700-kilometre stretch of the Bruce Highway, highlighting places that needed attention most urgently. That convoy and my 'fix the Bruce' campaign worked, securing record funding for the Bruce Highway, and major projects like the Mackay ring road are now under construction. This project will provide a new major crossing of the Bruce Highway. It will take highway traffic out of the city, easing congestion, especially during peak hour. It will also take dangerous heavy trucks off the local streets. Just as importantly, it will create local jobs. I've spoken with a number of contractors and workers on site about the number of local people who have secured their jobs on the back of this infrastructure project. Those jobs came at a time when they were badly needed. But half a billion dollars of works in stage 1 of the Mackay ring road is only the beginning. We still need to close the loop on this ring road, and I'll be working to secure funds for the second stage of the ring road from measures that were announced in the budget.


The Liberal-National government allocated $3.5 billion to Roads of Strategic Importance, and $1½ billion of that package is earmarked specifically for northern Australia. A further $1.4 billion was announced in the budget for the Bruce Highway but as yet is not allocated to any specific project. I'll also be fighting for funds out of those allocations to be set aside to flood-proof the Goorganga Plains area of the Bruce Highway just south of Proserpine. Goorganga Creek floods very easily and very regularly, with heavy rain cutting off the Whitsunday Coast Airport from the actual Whitsunday coast. That means that flights from southern capitals are sometimes returned to their airports of origin and tourists can't get to where they want to go. The Queensland government's Department of Transport and Main Roads has begun the essential planning work on that project because of $12 million in federal funding, which this budget points to. Outcomes from that planning process will inform what needs to be done and what funds will be required to keep the north moving.


The Bruce Highway is a vital link for all of Queensland, connecting industries and products with end users. In this Liberal-National government's budget, we saw—as we have seen over the last few budgets—the spending of a record $6.7 billion on the Bruce Highway. As I said before, a major part of that was on the Mackay ring road. But there is another Bruce Highway project in my electorate that's also worth half a billion dollars, and that is the replacement of the Haughton River bridge, identified by people in my electorate as the most urgent black spot that needs fixing. That project not only replaces the ageing and unsafe Haughton River bridge; it includes another two overpasses, a number of different bridges that are going to go over flood-prone areas and the upgrade of about nine intersections along a 14-kilometre section of the Bruce Highway. The federal government is providing $411 million towards this project—as I said, it's worth a total of half a billion dollars or more—and works kicks off in the middle of this year. We pushed to bring that forward when the state government said it couldn't come forward, and we've brought that project on this coming calendar year. Further south, we've already invested $57 million into the Sandy Gully bridge upgrade, just north of Bowen. Sandy Gully is another regularly flood-prone area, cutting access to Abbot Point for workers who are based in Bowen, further south in Mackay and in the Whitsundays. It also severed the Bruce Highway—the arterial transport link that keeps the north moving—right there and then. These road projects all create jobs for the north. Most of those jobs, though, as we know, only last during the construction of that particular infrastructure project, but they increase freight movements as well, and that adds to a greater economy, which creates long-term jobs.


Talking about long-term jobs, we're seeing the benefits of the regional jobs and investment package that I fought so hard to secure during the lead-up to the 2016 election. North Queensland suffered badly during the downturn in the resources sector, and that's why I pushed for a jobs package to address the needs of regional centres around the Bowen Basin area. The Liberal-National government recognised the importance of those regional economies and the dollars that the mining industry and mining communities contribute through royalties, through wages and through taxes. We're now seeing the fruit of all that work, with more than $9.7 million from the government contributed towards investments that total about $50 million in that region. In Mackay, the Liberal-National government provided $1.6 million to D&T Hardchrome so they could build an industrial standard electroplating and finishing facility in Paget. D&T have been a great contributor to the mining services sector in Mackay, and this particular project will provide access to services that previously have had to be sourced far beyond the mining region where they are needed. Another funding project in Mackay was $420,000 provided to Diacon, a local company who will expand their plastic conveyor protection systems business. There was $250,000 to Linked Group Services to help them showcase their energy efficiency initiatives. In total, there's been a federal government investment of about $2½ million in four projects worth about $12 million in Mackay. These projects will create 84 jobs, the vast majority of which will be ongoing, so we are directly creating permanent jobs from this one-off investment. In the Whitsundays, we announced $5.8 million of funding under the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages for the Ozone Whitsundays Eco Resort at Riordanvale. This is a $37 million development and it'll feature contemporary villas, a striking wedding and conference venue, and a boutique native fauna park. When it's complete, it'll create more than 100 jobs and boost land based tourism options for one of Australia's premier tourism destinations in the Whitsundays. In Bowen, that same jobs package is delivering $1½ million for the Murroona Gardens aged-care facility.


One of the most important industries in North Queensland is defence, with the Townsville city being home to the Army's Lavarack Barracks, a RAAF base, the Townsville Field Training Area as well as the port of Townsville's Berth 10, which is designed for the Royal Australian Navy. Consequently, we in the north were jubilant about Queensland's win of the $1.8 billion Land 400 Defence deal. That deal will have big benefits for Townsville. About 150 Boxer super-tanks—I guess they're not tanks; they're weaponised reconnaissance vehicles—will be based in that garrison city. Two hundred million dollars will be spent on building simulation facilities over the next 10 years and 80 jobs will be created during the construction phase.


But not all important projects involve such big dollars. The Liberal-National government has helped and continues to help industry and community provide a better lifestyle and greater amenities for families living in the north. The federal government recently provided $150,000 to Mackay cane growers for their irrigation efficiency training program, which helps them reduce electricity costs and boost productivity in the cane-farming sector. We provided half a million dollars to Carlisle Adventist Christian College. I was just there on Sunday, yesterday, to provide them with a hospitality and home economics facility. Just on the weekend—as I said, yesterday—I opened new classrooms and a science lab for the school, to which the federal government directly contributed to the tune of $375,000. We delivered $15,000 for the Mackay kidney support group to buy a new car, when one of their previous cars was stolen, $15,000 for the Mackay Tennis Association to upgrade their courts and develop a new kitchen, and about $10,000 for the Mackay St Vincent de Paul Society to help them reduce their electricity costs, leaving them more dollars to support clients who are homeless. There has been about $200,000 invested in the Dalrymple disability respite service centre. All in all, there has been about $250,000 poured into community services around the Mackay region in just the past six months.


We supported VMR, the volunteer marine rescue, in Burdekin with $20,000 for their services. The Burdekin Art Society and Cungulla men's shed have also been recipients of funding. I secured $250,000 for Home Hill State High School's multipurpose hall. There's been a lot done for the community. We've helped the Mackay and Whitsunday region in their time of great need in the wake of Cyclone Debbie, with the federal and state governments providing joint tourism recovery funding, including $1 million for new infrastructure at Peter Faust Dam, $2 million for Hill Inlet lookout on Whitsunday Island and $1 million to enhance facilities at Flagstaff Hill in Bowen. There's more to come. This year's budget provides a number of measures that will benefit the north, including a $550 million Stronger Rural Health Strategy, which will deliver around 3,000 additional doctors and 3,000 additional nurses into rural general practice; an additional 14,000 high-level in-home-care packages to help older people remain in their own homes; 13½ thousand new residential aged-care places and 775 short-term restorative places, which will be made available where they are most needed. The chaplaincy program in our schools will get more funding to focus on antibullying, and we are skilling Australians by investing $1½ billion, an extra $250 million that we've provided in this budget, in the Skilling Australians Fund to deliver apprenticeships and traineeships that are so vital in training young Australians for the jobs of the future. We've enabled pensioners to earn more and keep more of their pension, and there are initiatives to address the need for more seasonal workers in the fruit and vegetable sector, with a two-year trial of incentives aimed at increasing the number of jobseekers who take on such work. I could go on about the sports infrastructure grants program and about the tax relief we've provided that's going to help over 66,000 taxpayers in the electorate of Dawson.


All of this stuff is contained in our budget. It's been a great budget for North Queensland, providing all these local benefits. I'm proud to support these bills.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (18:27):  I'm happy to get up here and support the appropriations bills Nos 1 and 2, one about parliamentary departments No.1, and Nos 5 and 6. Of course, Labor always support supply. The lessons of 1975 have not been lost on the Labor Party. It is important, though, for the contest over the budget to protect the nation state. We don't want to get into a situation like that in the United States of America where they have to come up with one deal after another simply to fund the public service, public servants and public service jobs. We don't want our nation beset with crises of that nature.


Nevertheless, this is going to be a debate about the government's budget strategy and, in particular, their ideas about corporate tax. We know that the government's budget basically backed in an idea which has no support in this country. It can't find support in the public sphere and it can't find support in this nation's parliament, particularly in the other place. That idea is $80 billion worth of corporate tax cuts, which are tax cuts the like of which Australia has never seen. We know when the Hawke-Keating government undertook taxation reform in the 1980s it involved a lowering of corporate tax rates, but it also involved a broadening of the base with things like the fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax and the petroleum resource rent tax. That was taxation reform. It involved spirited debate at the taxation summit and, as I think Mr Keating notably once said, they crossed the finish line with one wheel off the chariot.


Taxation reform is difficult. It's hard work. If you broaden the base, if you lower rates, that sort of reform is noted and lauded. Keating's reforms of the eighties were good all round, but this budget starts with a different idea, a Reaganesque idea: you just give $80 billion to companies and $17 billion to big banks, and somehow that idea, that great largesse, blows a hole in the nation's budget and blows a hole in its capacity to deliver services to schools, hospitals, aged-care homes and everything else that the federal government might fund and simply lowers the rate for companies, and somehow that will translate into a common good, a public good. That is nonsense. It's such nonsense that even in the United States of America, where this idea originated, it's starting to lose support.


In The Economist on 26 April, in the print edition, the headline read: 'Marco Rubio offers his Trump-crazed party a glint of hope. The Florida senator thinks that reheating Reaganomics is a dead end.' I encourage those opposite to read the article. It's not written by a socialist; it's in The Economist, so they would be safe in reading it. They might want to read Mr Rubio's quote in the article. It says:


""There is still a lot of thinking on the right that if big corporations are happy, they're going to take the money they're saving and reinvest it in American workers,"" he says—


quoting Mr Rubio—


""In fact they bought back shares, a few gave out bonuses; there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the American worker.""


Think about this. Marco Rubio is on the conservative end of his party in the United States of America, the home of that sort of neoliberal idea—the Reaganomics—where, if you somehow lower the corporate tax rate, there will be a magical nirvana of higher wages and higher revenues, and somehow everything will work out in the never-never. In America, Senator Rubio puts a sword to that idea in the US Senate.


You would think that those opposite would just stop and think about what they're doing to their own political brand and what they're doing to this nation's capacity to fund schools and hospitals, pay down debt and encourage growth. We know the sort of corporate largesse. As I said before: $80 billion to corporations in the corporate tax cut and $17 billion to banks, despite all of the evidence to the royal commission—day after day after day of evidence of poor corporate ethics, bad corporate behaviour and one story after another, and now amazingly involving children's bank accounts. You would think there would be some underlying ethical boundary to bad behaviour, but clearly not. Every day, when we see these stories, we know it was the right call to have the royal commission, and we now see this government still wanting to shove $17 billion to Australian banks.


It's interesting. The other problem with this budget is that it has an assumption that you'll get reasonable wages growth in the coming years, but this of course does not match up with what this government's doing. On the one hand, the government say wages will grow, but we know that their policy is divorced from this. We know they're going to cut penalty rates. That's this government's policy: cut penalty rates and hack into workers. And we know they're going to get stuck into unions. They're the two basic tenets of this government's wages policy—surprise, surprise! On the one hand they want to do these things and on another they expect wages growth. On 17 May, The Sydney Morning Herald reported that wages growth was 'stuck in the mud'. It talked about how workers 'got a 0.5 per cent pay rise in the three months to March', which is 'the softest result in the history of the series'. It talked about how 1.3 million workers in the retail industry are banking an average pay rise of 1.5 per cent, which is actually a real wage cut of 0.4 per cent in real terms when compared to inflation. Think about the consequences of expecting your wages to go to one end and then having them go the other. Capital Economics' chief economist, Paul Dales, is quoting as saying wage growth is 'stuck in the mud at 2.1 per cent in the first quarter and likely to stay there or thereabouts' for the rest of the year.


But it wasn't just them. The Australian Financial Review on 17 May quotes deputy governor Guy Debelle. He's talking about what normally happens: the unemployment rate goes down and workers then have some capacity to ask for a pay rise. He says:


There is a risk that it may take a lower unemployment rate than we currently expect to generate a sustained move higher than the 2 per cent focal point evident in May wage outcomes today.


This is a problem for the old model—that is, where unemployment fell, workers would have more bargaining power and thus ask for a pay rise. We've got the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank here saying that that model might well be broken.


Why is it broken? I'll tell you why: because this government has set out to break it. This is why they are appointing Fair Work Commissioners who side with employers. This is why they are hacking into penalty rates. This is why they oppose increases to the minimum wage. This is why we have the very, very concerning series of charges brought against trade union officials for blackmail. That tactic went out with the 17th century. Of course, it's not surprising, when these charges are brought, to see that they don't survive the court process because it is not blackmail to ask for a pay rise or to get your union to ask for a pay rise. That's part of a healthy wages system.


So this government is wrong on tax and wrong on wages. It's not just the Labor Party saying so and not just a union saying so. The Reserve Bank of Australia and other economists are putting a pretty cogent case about wages. The Australia Institute is saying magical wage growth underpins the budget forecasts. You are not going to get magical wages growth if you are hacking into workers and unions every day. I'll tell you, Deputy Speaker, for your own information, you have to let workers and unions bargain. It's not criminal, either in civil law or criminal law, to have a strike to withdraw your labour; it's a standard right across industrialised economies, and it has been for some time.


So if those things are broken, then necessarily we are starting to question the government's approach to things like Newstart as well. Of course, the level of Newstart is a concern. It's a concern with ACOSS, Social Services and many people in my electorate, including the Anti Poverty Network, who take issue with it and have sent representatives to see me about it. It's also a concern with business. Jennifer Westacott was on Sky News, saying:


But we've got to make sure while they're on Newstart that it's adequate, that we're not entrenching them into disadvantage, that they've got the opportunity to get back into the workforce because they're able to maintain a reasonable standard of living. I mean $39 a day is not a lot of money, it's a very low amount of money for people to actually live on.


This is certainly the case. I've noticed many people in my electorate struggling on Newstart at the level that it's at, and also dealing with a regime of oversight that is very, very onerous. If you miss a simple appointment or if there's a mistake with your appointment with a job services provider, you can be cut and thrown into poverty and sometimes homelessness very quickly indeed. So we do have to be mindful in this place about just how difficult it is to live on Newstart and just how onerous a regime we are imposing on people who are on very low incomes, particularly if they have to sustain over a long period of time out of the labour market or are in and out of casual work or are in labour hire, which is the other big problem. We have to have be cognisant of that. When not only the Australian Council of Social Services is telling you it's not adequate but when business is also telling you it is not adequate, you know there is a case to be answered here.


I'm very proud that Labor has committed to reviewing the nature of these payments and I think we should review them with an eye to the adequacy of those payments and with a view to preventing people from falling into poverty. Once you have fallen into poverty, we know, it doesn't just affect your capacity to apply for work but there's also a fair bit of evidence to say that once you have fallen into those poverty traps, it's very hard to make the right judgements to get out of them. And it is very hard to live on very low incomes for a long period of time.


So this government's budget strategy, which Ayn Rand would be proud of, I don't think is very sensible or well thought out or reasonable in the modern era. We are saying to the government: you are going down the wrong path; you need to reconsider. The Labor Party won't follow you down this path so you should split the bills, allow us to do taxation reform for those who need it and, for those who don't—the big corporates—we should leave them to do what they should do, which is invest, create jobs and pay taxes like everyone else. We should get back to having a sustainable fiscal strategy which provides tax relief to those who need it, which pays down debt and which allows us as a nation to provide the services that we need now such as schools and hospitals and that we will need for the future.

"Evans, Trevor, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mr EVANS
 (Brisbane) (18:42):  I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 cognate debate with Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2018-2019, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2017-2018 and Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2017-2018, and to state, in case there was any doubt amongst honourable members, that this month's budget has been a great budget for Brisbane. More than 75,000 people across the electorate of Brisbane will be getting tax relief next financial year commencing in 40-something days' time, meaning the hardworking people of Brisbane will be keeping more of their own hard-earned money as reward for their efforts because this government's strong economic plan is starting to pay dividends.


A year ago, talking here on last year's budget, the topic was business tax cuts and we just heard that last year's budget still manages to distract members of the opposition. Last year, we talked about how this government was predicting what would happen if we backed Australian businesses, notably the small and medium family businesses which together make up such a large proportion of Australia's economy and its enterprise. We talked about why supporting those small and medium and family businesses might pay certain dividends. Now we are here seeing the very real evidence that the key planks of this government's strong economic plan are working—the tax relief already delivered for small and medium businesses, our innovation agenda, the new free trade agreements and the growth of our defence industry. We see evidence of these policies working certainly in Brisbane, right across Queensland and indeed across Australia.


Last week, two notable economic milestones were reached. Queensland's population reached five million and the target of one million jobs being created since the coalition government was elected was reached—about half a year earlier than was hoped for originally. The first milestone is a sign of the confidence Australians have in the great state of Queensland, including the 3.5 million who choose to make their homes in the south-east corner, centred on the wonderful place that is the City of Brisbane.


The second milestone, those jobs, is an unambiguous sign that the government's strong economic management is paying the dividends that we were talking about here in this place a year ago. A million jobs means a million livelihoods out there improved, a million more people having the security, dignity and prosperity of work. Record jobs being created, business investment rising, the budget strengthening is the story underpinning the budget. 


Nationwide, our policies are coming together to help Australia's small and medium businesses create all of these new jobs faster than jobs have ever been created in the history of this country. Last year, a record 1,100 jobs a day were created, on average. That means, as I said, more Australians are being productive. It also means more Australians are paying taxes, and fewer of them are relying on welfare. That is a powerful outcome economically and morally. And it is enabling, in turn, this government to provide and guarantee the essential services. For instance, in the budget there is a record level of support for seniors and a record investment in the Great Barrier Reef. Finally, with certainty, it is enabling the government to fully fund the NDIS out of consolidated revenue.


This is all at the same time as being able to give tax relief to the Australians whose hard work and success have helped to bring this about. That is the real power of supporting Australia's small and medium businesses and it is the power of supporting hard-working Australians. The government's policies are fostering the conditions and the framework so that so many more Australians can prosper and so many more Australian businesses can grow and hire even more Australians. It is very good news for the 31,000 small businesses situated in my electorate of Brisbane. The feedback we received when the Treasurer visited Brisbane just last week, after the budget, was very positive. Local business people and local workers all clearly support the tax cuts as fair and well targeted. The return to surplus next year was a very welcome improvement, as were the guarantees to the essential services that Australians rely on.


Nationwide, the government's income tax relief, as announced in the budget, will benefit 10 million Australians, including over two million Queenslanders. There couldn't be a bigger contrast with our opponents, whose shadow Treasurer, last week at the National Press Club, pledged to retain the top marginal tax rate at 49 per cent indefinitely. As usual, Labor's approach is all about high taxes, not lower taxes. I want to talk about infrastructure for a moment. Others have already noted here today that, in this budget, we deliver a record $75 billion in an investment pipeline of key infrastructure projects right across Australia. More than $20 billion of that infrastructure bonanza is for projects in Queensland, including in and around Brisbane.


I have previously welcomed in this place the $300 million the government is investing in the Brisbane Metro. That congestion-busting project is critical because of the strong population growth in Brisbane and the extra workers that brings into the Brisbane CBD, and because of the very high proportion of commuters in Brisbane that use buses rather than rail. It is a vital project to keep our city moving. It will cut daily travel times, reduce bus congestion in the CBD and improve bus services to the suburbs. For a daily commuter, it may mean over an hour of travel time saved each and every week—time that everyone would rather spend at home with their families and friends.


Last week, I was really pleased to join with the Brisbane Lord Mayor and the federal Minister for Infrastructure to inspect the site of the proposed underground metro station in Brisbane's cultural precinct. So, soon, there will be a world-class public transport project to accompany Brisbane's world-class cultural and entertainment offerings—QPAC, the Art Gallery, GoMA, the State Library and the Queensland Museum. In addition to the Brisbane Metro, the budget includes a whole raft of other infrastructure projects helping the people of Brisbane and south-east Queensland. It includes $1 billion to ease congestion on the M1 highway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast and a further $3.3 billion for additional upgrades along the Bruce Highway to improve safety and reduce congestion, taking the government's total investment to $10 billion and supporting around 2½ thousand jobs. These are all game-changing infrastructure projects that in various ways will improve the lives of millions of people who call south-east Queensland and Brisbane home.


The budget also continues the Turnbull government's strong commitment to supporting Australia's best health and medical research, including a record $6 billion in budget measures. In the same way that last year's budget really identified and singled in on the opportunities in our defence industry, this year's budget is really homing in and identifying the big opportunities that sit in front of Australia in the space of medical research. We have established the Medical Research Future Fund to provide long-term sustainable funding for medical research. It already has a balance of $7 billion and it's on track to reach $20 billion by 2021.


This budget includes $2 billion in disbursements from the Medical Research Future Fund to fund various research projects and priorities. Investment in medical research is critical to providing new treatments to diseases and to improving the quality of life of all Australians through things such as treating brain cancer in children, reducing premature births and developing new medical devices. It's all about improving and saving lives and it's part of our commitment to delivering the essential services that Australians rely on, guaranteed, as I said, by the strong economic plan that underpins our ability to guarantee the services.


Health and medical research is an area in which Australia is world class, and I'm proud that many of these amazing researchers are calling Brisbane home. Last week, it was really exciting to have the chance to visit the UQCCR with the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt. The minister announced $1.2 million in funding being awarded to UQ's Professor David Paterson through the Medical Research Future Fund. Professor Paterson's research is about tackling antimicrobial resistance and has the potential to save 30,000 lives, which puts the work that we do here in this place into some perspective.


I've also recently visited Queensland's largest medical research centre, the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute. I've had the opportunity on many occasions visiting there to hear from some of the scientists and medical researchers there about their fascinating and very important work.


Australia has all of the necessary ingredients to bolster its position as a world leader in medical research, but it's essential that we don't rest on our laurels. In this budget, the centrepiece of the government's commitment to health and medical research is a new investment of $1.3 billion in the National Health and Medical Industry Growth Plan, to be overseen by Professor Ian Frazer, AC. It's about identifying discoveries and translating ideas into practice and commercial successes and it really has the potential to turbocharge the health and medical research industry just as the government's strategic investment in the defence industry sector in last year's budget is doing.


As well as improving health outcomes for hundreds of thousands of Australians, this will create up to 28,000 new skilled medical research jobs and develop the next generation of Australia's world-leading medical research industry. Groundbreaking biological and medical technologies have a significant place in the future of health care, and so this government's growth plan will also provide for a minimum of 130 new clinical trials and add a 50 per cent increase in exports and new markets in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The growth plan includes half a billion dollars of funding over 10 years for the Genomics Health Futures Mission, which will help more than 200,000 Australians live longer and get better treatment tailored to their medical needs. The first genomics project will be Mackenzie's Mission, with almost $20 million being provided for screening trials for rare and debilitating birth disorders, including spinal muscular atrophy, fragile X and cystic fibrosis.


Another research investment is $248 million over five years for an expanded Rare Cancers, Rare Diseases And Unmet Need Program and new international clinical trial collaborations. We're also providing funding of almost a billion dollars a year to the National Health and Medical Research Council and have funded the $500 million Biomedical Translation Fund to help transform biomedical discoveries into commercial opportunities for Australian researchers.


That's just one aspect in summarising the plan for a stronger economy and what it means in one great area going forward for Brisbane and for all of Australia. But I did also want to mention in passing that the budget does include, contrary to some of the talk of cuts that we hear repeatedly from the other side, record funding for hospitals and schools, guaranteed funding for disability services and a comprehensive approach to aged care so older Australians can live healthier, more independent lives.


This budget ensures the government lives within its means, with a forecast return to moderate balance in 2019-20 increasing to a projected surplus of $11 billion in 2020-21. Importantly, we're no longer borrowing to pay for essential services and we have the lowest average real growth in payments of any government on either side of politics over the last 50 years.


I also wanted to mention quickly in passing that in my electorate of Brisbane more than 5,000 local families stand to benefit under the budget from our reforms to childcare. That'll come into place on 2 July and is obviously on top of their tax relief. There is also the guaranteed funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. That will be directly helping 1,800 people and their families in my electorate of Brisbane. This budget is the next step in our long-term economic plan to deliver all of those essential services on which we rely and to provide tax relief to hardworking Australians to thank them for the hard work that they and so many small and medium businesses have done over the last year in helping to get Australia back into this strong position while simultaneously living within our means.


I want to spend a moment comparing and contrasting what I've just outlined to some of the things that we've heard from those opposite. I want to spend a moment talking about the politics of envy and the case that Labor are now pushing, because it does seem that they have absolutely nothing else to talk about—certainly not a significant economic plan. I was in the chamber earlier and I heard the member for Lyons. He said one thing that was right; he identified that I was laughing—chuckling, I think, was the word he used—in response to his contribution. I was laughing because these are just discredited Labor lines that are being rolled out like robotic union Daleks. I think they hope that if they say them often enough they'll become true. His speech and so many other speeches that we're hearing from Labor reveal that they have no actual plan. At the heart of all of those uninspired Labor lines is this false war that they're trying to whip up, chasing the divisive politics of envy.


Sadly, we all had to endure the opposition leader's budget reply speech a few weeks ago. For those lucky enough not to hear it, let me summarise it briefly. Labor essentially said that they would spend a stack of money that they don't have on all manner of things. They said that they could pay for it because they'll tax banks and big companies more. That's essentially what they said. So, 10 points out of 10 for the politics of division and envy, but, sadly, zero points for adding things up and zero points for honesty. If you look at their numbers, you'll see that there are no changes in the forward estimates to the taxes being paid by big businesses and banks—not in our forward estimates and not in theirs. In their forward estimates over the next four years, their biggest tax takes include $10 billion from retirees, which is the biggest; $6 billion in additional taxes on small and medium businesses, the ones that we just identified as having created all of the jobs and prosperity over the last year; $2 billion from home owners; and precisely zero in additional taxes from big businesses and banks. That stands in stark contrast to the multinational tax avoidance laws that this government's passed—sadly, without Labor's support.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (18:57):  I would like to make a contribution in this cognate debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and other appropriations bills. There's probably one thing that we have learnt since the handing down of this budget by the Treasurer, and that is that it is only a Labor government that understands and knows about the delivery of fairness. Fairness is not about what you say or the words you might want to couch your budget in. Fairness is about what you do; it's all about actions. This government, once again, has failed that test. As a matter of fact, they've failed it five times.


This is their fifth attempt at a budget delivering so-called fairness to the Australian community, yet, despite the rhetoric of those opposite, this is really a budget about big business. We've heard in the past about trickle-down economics. We have heard that, provided we give it to the big end of town, it will eventually work its way down to the workers. We know that over the last couple of years businesses have been making reasonable profits, and yet we are seeing the lowest wage growth in living memory at the moment. They want to take this whole concept further—to say, 'Well, just trust us,' and, 'Let's make our key signature policy giving $80 billion to the big end of town in the hope that that's going to stimulate the economy and create jobs, and that everyone's going to live in a land of prosperity.'


After five years, I think the tired old government over there should be starting to think about giving it up. Let's face it: that's what the electors are thinking. The previous speaker might want to get bolshie about this, but he, like any of those on the other side of the parliament with margins under 5 per cent, knows what the polls mean. They know that people have turned off. They're no longer listening. It's one thing for the Liberals to want to come out and say that they're concerned about fairness and about returning fairness to the Australian economy and to working families. But to make your key signature policy all about big business is really not delivering much in the way of fairness for working families of this country.


In fairness, the tax plan does give a modest $10 a week to Australian workers. As I say, it's modest, and we will support such a modest increase. But don't forget that they're giving with one hand while, with the other hand, savagely making cuts to pensions, cuts to education and cuts to health. I'm not sure they can actually sell that at the election. I invite them to try! They've got to get out there and say, 'We'll give you something and we'll take all of this from you.' It simply is not going to work, because, as I say, people have turned off. They're no longer listening, despite the talk around the corridors here, and I know, regrettably, you guys don't get a bounce out of this. I'm not sure what that means—should you go to a longer period for elections, or which leader should you take to the election? All that is in the hands of you and your party room. But the realistic aspect about this is that a $10 tax cut for Australian workers does not cut it when you want to do things such as take $17 billion out of education and cut into health and pensions. People are aware of this stuff. This is not something new. They've seen this before. This is a government that is showing all the signs of being tired. It's out of ideas, and the only thing it can come up with is: 'Let's throw some money at big business.'


Bear in mind, this mob opposite is the same mob that protested vigorously about having a royal commission into the banking industry. They said, 'We know what's happening in our financial institutions. All the royal commission is going to do is make lawyers rich.' I'm not sure how the lawyers on the other side would take that. They said, 'It would only tell us what we know.' I really hope those opposite and those in the Treasury didn't know about all the things we now know about—things about AMP and what is occurring with the Dollarmites at the 'which bank'. All those things are happening. It's a far cry from what they wanted to do and say about a royal commission into trade unions—absolutely. They were looking at one prosecution as a result of the trade union royal commission, but I think that's been withdrawn now.




Mr Wallace:
  Only one? Only one, you reckon?




Mr HAYES:
  Only one flowed out of the royal commission, as my friend reminds me. But it took $78 million for that one. Anyway, we've lost the board of AMP. We have a financial system in debacle, a financial system which has been protected by those opposite, who withdrew the very protections we put in place for people so that financial advisers would act in the best interests of clients. One of the first actions of the government opposite was to withdraw that. What! These are the people who are now saying, 'We want you to trust us with our fifth budget because we are all about fairness for Australian people.' No wonder people are starting to think, 'When they talk about fairness, let's see what their track record is.' I've got to say it's pretty dismal.


Anyone in this joint must think that it is our absolute honour to be here. Very few people get to represent their community in the federal parliament. When you think in those terms, you must think the Australian people deserve better than what's being offered by this government. They deserve better than to be told that what's in your interests is to give the top end of town a lift at the expense of everybody else. A modest tax cut, if it's affordable, is the right thing to do. But you don't give with one hand and take with the other.


I have just one little piece of advice for those opposite: if you can't afford to give an $80 billion tax cut to business—and I accept that you can't—simply don't do it. You wouldn't do this in your household economy. You wouldn't say, 'Look, I'd like to buy that new car but I can't afford it so let's just add it to the mortgage.' If you can't afford it, don't do it. Don't do it at the expense of working families, at the expense of pensioners, and don't do it at the expense of all those people who put their blood, sweat and tears in, who are raising families and who want the best outcome for them. And by the way, we need that $80 billion for our future.


The cutting of $17 billion out of education is ridiculous. Any investment in education is not a line item. It's not something you just say, 'This is what we're doing in our budget, how we're going to save money.' An investment in education is an investment in our future. It's an investment in our prosperity. It's an investment in our nation. It's not just a line item in the 2018 budget. And $17 billion is almost exactly the amount of money the banks are going to get, a tax cut of $17 billion as a reward for their hard effort over the last 12 months. The royal commission will no doubt now discover more and more things. I know those opposite didn't want the royal commissioner to extend the terms of reference but they might be stuck with them now, because the Australian people are getting more and more concerned about what they're seeing is happening in their financial institutions. By the way, over the last period of 12 months, those banks made something in the vicinity of $34 billion in straight-out profit.




Ms Madeleine King:
  They need a tax cut!




Mr HAYES:
  They really need it, don't they? And you know what happened? Those workers in the financial institutions, well, jeez, they haven't done terribly well. They haven't increased their salaries. The executives may have actually got some bonuses. As a matter of fact, they did work some stuff with the Dollarmites, making sure those accounts were working so that people got a payout. A number of banks and financial institutions were signing off fraudulent statements on behalf of applicants at the NAB. Look, you guys opposite have got to start thinking there's more to being in government than trying to pull a job of smoke and mirrors, more than just pulling the wool over the eyes of people.


I'm very fortunate. I work in the most multicultural community in the whole of the country, bar none—very vibrant, very colourful. We have many, many opportunities to celebrate New Year from the start, with everyone else, on the 1st January, through to my last New Year's, celebrated in August or September with another group. Mine is not a rich community. The average income in my community is a tad over $60,000. I know what this budget means for them. I know what taking $14 a fortnight off pensioners means for those people. They're not going to go and work an extra shift. They are not going to work some overtime to make this up. The pension is all they get. Taking the $14 energy supplement off them at a time when the member for Hughes keeps reminding this House about energy prices. At a time when he wants to talk about record energy prices in New South Wales, he's part of a government that is going to take $14 off pensioners who can't go and make up that difference.


We need to be a bit smarter about this. We need to give people the opportunity to go out and invest in themselves and in their future. We did that in the global financial crisis. By the way, you never, ever hear a word about that from those opposite, but we came through that reasonably well, because we stimulated the economy. We did that by looking after families and encouraging them to invest in their futures. That is not what we're seeing coming out of this budget.


The mums and dads in my community are more concerned about what's happening in education. I preface this by saying that mine's not a rich electorate. As a matter of fact, I have the lion's share of refugees coming to this country, and many of the migrants make their home in the Fairfield and Liverpool areas. Interestingly, of the 12,000 refugees that the government decided to take, particularly out of the Middle East—and we supported them—we get 7,000 in Fairfield. Yes, there are all sorts of issues that come with that in terms of making sure those people are appropriately settled, which is fine, because I think we are a very giving community in my area. But what I've seen with the people from the Middle East or, before that, the people from Cambodia or, before that, the people from Vietnam is that they have a passionate belief in education. They believe that the ticket to success in a country like Australia is to ensure that their children have a first-class education, and they just cannot rationalise in their minds what this government is doing in taking $17 billion out of education. I know they all want to get up and say that's all just hyperbole over there. We have even got the Catholic bishops coming out today and reaffirming what this means in respect of Catholic education.


We are privileged to be in this place. We are privileged to have the honour of representing our communities in this parliament. Not many people get this opportunity. When we're here, we should be trying to make a difference for the better in our community, not simply rattle off some lines about how this is the budget and we're going to do all these various things. We should, on both sides of the House, be trying to make a difference for the better. Quite frankly, after five budgets, I just do not think those opposite have that view in mind. Perhaps they think this is their ticket to another election. I've got to say: guys, I think you're mistaken on that as well. But, if you're not in this House with a genuine commitment to make a difference for the better in the community, you should not be here.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (19:12):  The Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and the other appropriation bills before us today demonstrate the stark choice which is going to face the people of Australia at the next election. It will be a choice between a Turnbull government which delivers sober reform and a strong economy, and an opposition that arrogantly parades its false and vacuous promises. It will be a choice between responsible government for all and naked self-interest. On this side of the House, we have delivered a million more jobs and record bulk-billing rates, and we're delivering $75 billion worth of infrastructure our nation desperately needs. On that side, they have kowtowed to law-breaking unions, shielded members who should never have taken a seat in this place, and tried to set Australians against each other in an outdated and divisive class war—wait, I've got more about that.


And why? Because on this side of the House we have real leaders who have shifted the debate on everything from stopping illegal immigration to fixing our declining school standards. The Leader of the Opposition, on the other hand—well, he's just shifty. Three years ago, the Heydon royal commission saw straight through this Leader of the Opposition. The commission's counsel assisting called him evasive on the witness stand, while the commissioner himself said that his non-responsive approach to giving evidence called into question his very credibility. Since that royal commission, we've had the question of this Leader of the Opposition's credibility settled once and for all: he has none. You simply can't trust a word he says. Sadly, to the detriment of this House and our nation's democracy, we have seen ample evidence of that over recent months.


There's no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition read the same court decisions as the rest of us when it came to the test for eligibility under section 44 of the Constitution. He knew what it meant as well as the rest of us. He knew that there was a two-stage test for those who held dual citizenship and that the 'all reasonable steps' that they parroted on about applied only when a foreign law operates irremediably to prevent an Australian citizen from renouncing his or her citizenship.



Ms Madeleine King interjecting—




Mr WALLACE:
  And they still can't accept the High Court's decision. He knew that the law was firmly established, just as the court has held in Sykes v Cleary and later reaffirmed in Re Canavan, delivered on the 27 October 2017. Yet for six months he misled the Australian public and dishonestly maintained that no fewer than four of his members of parliament were eligible to represent their local constituents when clearly they were not. Months of Labor parliamentary salaries and perks were paid out, while my colleagues on this side of the House in fact did the right thing and resigned or referred themselves to the High Court immediately.



Ms Madeleine King interjecting—




Mr WALLACE:
  He went further, of course. Famously, he gave no less than a 'rolled-gold' guarantee that all Labor members were eligible. The people of Australia and the unfortunate constituents of Fremantle, Braddon and Longman know what that guarantee was worth.



Ms Madeleine King interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  The member for Brand will cease interjecting.




Mr WALLACE:
  They know how much trust they can place in the Leader of the Opposition. But it's always been that way with him. What about the workers of CleanEvent when the Leader of the Opposition stripped away their pay and conditions while the AWU received secret payments of $75,000 for those arrangements? What about the workers at Chiquita Mushrooms when the Leader of the Opposition sold them out in return for secret $4,000-a-month training payments to his union? They quickly found out how much credibility he had as an advocate for the working people. And who could forget Labor's 'Mediscare' campaign in the 2016 election?


Even his own colleagues can't trust him. Former Prime Minister Rudd learned that the hard way. No doubt he trusted his then employment minister when that minister pretended to be a loyal cabinet colleague. As Mr Rudd soon discovered, trust in this Leader of the Opposition is often misplaced. No doubt the woman who replaced him, former Prime Minister Gillard, trusted the now Leader of the Opposition when he threw his support behind her. We all know how long that lasted. 'Up until the spill,' he told reporters, 'I was going to support the Prime Minister.' There you have it. The Leader of the Opposition was 'going to be loyal'. He was 'going to tell the truth', right up until the moment his self-interest changed his mind.


The workers he claims to represent, the people of Australia, his own closest colleagues—they all know that this Leader of the Opposition will do anything, say anything and doublecross anyone to claw his way to the top.




Mr Irons:
  Whatever it takes.




Mr WALLACE:
  Whatever it takes, and at what cost? We began to learn that back in 2013. In his desperate efforts to gain the then CFMEU's support, the Leader of the Opposition was once again ready to promise almost anything, to the detriment of his party and the Australian people. He agreed to the CFMEU's demands that he oppose any industry specific regulator, including the one he himself established in 2012. He agreed to oppose any form of building code, despite the clearly established need. He agreed to oppose any kind of compulsory evidence-gathering powers for a regulator in the building industry, despite the ever-mounting evidence, now proven, of staggeringly widespread union illegality. Having made his deal with the lawless construction union and linked his self-interest to theirs, it is difficult to know what representatives of the CFMMEU would have to do before the Leader of the Opposition would not stand next to them. Justice Geoffrey Flick said of them:


It is difficult, if not impossible, to envisage any worse conduct than that pursued by the CFMEU.


This is a union that has been fined almost $15 million, far more than has ever been seen before.


It's an organisation with around 70 officials personally before the courts. Its boss, John Setka, by the way, has been widely congratulated by those opposite for having blackmail charges dropped last week. Everyone knows it's not unusual at all for the DPP to drop charges in legal proceedings. What is unquestionable is that John Setka has been found guilty of 59 separate offences, including assault and theft, and was jailed twice, in fact, for contempt of court. He has even admitted that illegal activity is at the heart of the way he does business. Channelling ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, Mr Setka told Sky News last week, 'We get fantastic pay rises and good conditions for our members because we fight it outside the law.'


Even the Leader of the Opposition's own colleagues know how wrong and self-serving his continued support for the CFMMEU is. Labor's hero, former Prime Minister and ACTU boss, Bob Hawke, has called the construction union's behaviour appalling and said that he would not tolerate it. He told The Australian in 2016, 'I would throw them out,' just as he himself threw out its predecessor, the Builders Labourers Federation. Oh, for a Labor leader with some backbone today! Even Kevin Rudd has called for the CFMMEU to be expelled from affiliation with Labor, and for the influence of trade union factions in the party to be reduced. Even Peter Beattie said last week that he would refuse CFMMEU donations if he were the leader.


Yet there this Leader of the Opposition is, telling CFMMEU members at the Oaky Creek north mine site, where threats, including threats to rape children, and intimidation had been rife, 'The privilege for us today is to be in your company.' There he is, defending the CFMMEU day in, day out, just like his job depended on it. That's because it does—with $11 million in donations paid to Labor since 2001 and the factional support of its many active members, this Leader of the Opposition is owned lock, stock and barrel by the CFMMEU. The most sickening part of all of this is the fact that the Leader of the Opposition peddles his divisive, dishonest and exploitive envy mongering under the banner of a fair go. It's a cynical and nauseating distortion of what we all believe is at the heart of our uniquely Australian egalitarian way of life.


Where is the Leader of the Opposition's fair go when he is slugging senior Australians, who have worked and saved their whole lives, with a new multibillion-dollar retiree tax? Where is the fair go for 2.6 million Australians with APRA regulated superannuation accounts? What clever excuse is he going to give them when it comes time to explain why he has pillaged $3.75 billion from their hard earned savings? Where's the fair go for the millions of Australians whose jobs will be put at risk by the insatiable hunger of this Leader of the Opposition for more and more tax and his desire for the keys to the Lodge?


Even if what passes for a moderate version of Labor's tax plan were enacted, there would be 1.4 million Australian workers put at risk. There would still be thousands of businesses whose investment decisions had been undermined overnight. It would still mean many thousands of unemployed or underemployed Australians who would no longer have the opportunity to take up one of the new jobs created by our investment. What clever weasel words will the Leader of the Opposition use when it comes time to explain to our young people why there are no jobs for them? And where was the fair go for the workers at Clean Event or at Chiquita Mushrooms when their union secretary gave away their pay and conditions for his union's benefit?


Whether he's the secretary of the AWU or the Leader of the Opposition, he has only one guiding principle—that is, selling out the people he's meant to represent in the interest of his own. That's how he ran the AWU back then. It's how he's running the Labor Party today. It will be how he runs the country if he is ever allowed to occupy the Lodge. In the end, there is only one Australian the Leader of the Opposition is looking out for, and that is the Leader of the Opposition himself. There is only one standard to which he holds his words and his actions, and that is naked self-interest. His colleagues know that, those present here tonight know that, his supporters know that and the people of Australia know that. They have seen through the shifty Leader of the Opposition, and when they have the chance next year they will, as we should today, shun his empty politics of selfishness and division and support the Turnbull government's plan for a stronger, more prosperous Australia.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (19:26):  The member for Fisher should stand on his feet and resign. That was the most appalling speech. This debate is about his government's budget, and these bills are about appropriations for the budget. Yet he engaged in a 14-minute tirade against the Leader of the Opposition. How pathetic he is. How pathetic is everyone on that side? Every question time, every chance they get, they slag off the Leader of the Opposition. What a bunch of cowards. This is your budget, and yet all you want to do is come in here and slag off the Leader of the Opposition. There's a metaphor they use in sport: play the ball, not the man. Perhaps everyone on the government benches needs to remember that. Play the ball and not the man. Be engaging on policy, that is what you should be doing as a government. This is about your budget. You would think they'd have some pride about what the government has put forward and be in here talking about their great vision. But, no, like a bunch of cowards they're going on the hack and are not standing up here. They can't even defend their Treasurer's budget. Just how useless are they? It is pathetic. If you're not in here to stand up and advocate for policy, if you're not in here to stand up and advocate for measures or your vision for this country, then resign. You have no business being an elected representative, and you have no business representing your communities.


The electorates of the member for Fisher and of the members on the Sunshine Coast are some of the poorest electorates that we have. It's so typical of the Liberal and National parties to forget the bush. It's so typical of them to come up here and completely forget the regions and not advocate for the regions. Some National Party held electorates and some Liberal Party held electorates are among the poorest electorates that we have. Yet what we are seeing from this government in these appropriations bills is cuts to the pension. They're actually cutting the pension. The age pension is well below the poverty line, but this government, this miserable mob of MPs who claim to represent the regions, is cutting the pension by $7 a week. I know it's not a lot to a millionaire, to someone who lives it up and who lives in a harbourside mansion. I know it's not a lot to those who may have 10 or 12 investment properties. I know it's not a lot to the silver spoons across the chamber from us. But it is a hell of a lot to a pensioner, to someone who is trying to survive on that fixed income. They say, 'We're just correcting the scrapping of the clean energy supplement, because there's no longer the carbon tax.' Something the government doesn't recognise is that—news flash!—energy bills have gone up under their watch. Under their great—I use exclamation marks—stewardship energy bills have gone through the roof. And now they want to cut the pension. They also want to lift the retirement age to 70. What an absolute disgrace. They are going to say to nurses, to cleaners, to builders: 'Keep working until you're 70.' They say it's because Australians are living longer. It's not about how long you can live. It's about your working age and how long you can work for. That's the problem with this government, and that is the problem with its proposals in this budget.


Another area that this government hasn't been honest about is the cuts to early childhood education. And what the government is doing—

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (19:30):  I rise today to talk about the mismanagement by this government of the delivery of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Last week, we saw the Commonwealth Ombudsman's scathing report on the NDIS plan review system. Sadly, it is no surprise to me. Families are coming to my office every day, desperate for help. It is clear that we are reaching crisis point. People with disabilities and their families simply are not receiving the services and support they sorely need and—might I say—were promised. It is absolutely vital for this government to get on with the job of properly delivering the NDIS and fixing the broken plan review system.


It has been alarming to hear stories from people living in my electorate who are experiencing firsthand the poor delivery by this government of the NDIS. Michelle from Aldinga Beach has experienced frustration with long wait times and difficulty with the review process. She says her son's prosthetic legs and the 'stubbies' he needs to cushion his limbs when not wearing his prosthetics have been significantly underfunded in his plan. The family have asked for a review and have been waiting now for upwards of seven months with no end in sight. While the family wait for the outcome of the review, they have resorted to duct-taping their son's stubbies to try to stretch their use, as they are rapidly wearing out. This is absolutely unacceptable.


Mary from Morphett Vale is a single, low-income earner with a disabled son. She made a decision to cancel her private health because the supports for her son's first plan with the NDIS were working well. She did not take this decision lightly. Mary did not anticipate the lengthy wait times for a new plan. There have now been gaps in her son's funding, and Mary has been left to scramble, trying to cover the therapies her son so desperately needs. Mary says she feels frustrated and financially stretched beyond her limits. To acknowledge the delays, she was provided with interim funding to tide her family over. This funding has now been depleted, and her son is again without support, without a plan.


How is it possible, when we are talking about continuity of support and continuity of early intervention, that we have these families begging the government for some support? Mary has been told that her plan is in process. She has not been given a time frame for when her son's funding will start up again. This is causing her great distress and, without these supports, she has real concerns for his ability to maintain any progress that he's made. As I said, this is absolutely unacceptable.


Now I'll talk about Bonnie from Sheidow Park, who is also facing the anxiety caused by the lengthy wait times. This is especially distressing for the family, as Bonnie's younger daughter has a limited life span and is in palliative care. Bonnie says it took her daughter's social worker intervening for a planning date to be set. Bonnie said:


My Daughter has a limited life span. She has no access to treatment and is being ignored by the agency that is supposed to help us but in reality is just causing a huge amount of anxiety.


She says even basic administrative errors have been made. She has been told that some of these can't be fixed, including family members' names being misspelled in her daughter's plan. This clearly indicates a lack of resourcing of the NDIS by this government, and it is at the expense of Bonnie and her family.


The NDIS needs to support and value people with a disability as individuals, and this is what it was set up to do. But this government has been missing in action. Where has this government been when it comes to actually properly resourcing the NDIS? We've seen some very disturbing news in more recent days, where the government's plan is to cut off support to children with autism. That is its plan—not addressing these significant associated problems that are hurting families in my electorate.



The NDIS under Labor was designed to alleviate the anxiety of family members. It was meant to be a lifetime of support to stop ageing parents worrying about what will happen to their children when they are no longer there. All I can say from families in my electorate is that it's causing more anxiety, not less—anxiety on a daily basis about what will happen to their children next week rather than in a few years time. It is time the government dealt with these issues immediately. (Time expired)

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (10:30):  Since we were last in Canberra I've been walking and talking my way around the southside. I walked nearly 70 kilometres in six days around my electorate of Moreton. I walked from Eight Mile Plains to Sunnybank, Tarragindi to Salisbury, Moorooka to Acacia Ridge, Yeronga to Moorooka, Tennyson to Oxley, and Kuraby to Sunnybank, with a few other suburbs in between. I enjoyed meeting the people who don't often get the time to drop into their MP's office, the neighbours who are busy with their own lives and their families, those who are busy looking after others. Although I love walking, the purpose was to encourage locals to better engage with their community. 


My Say G'day in May walk was inspired by the work of the late Jo Cox. Jo was a member of the United Kingdom parliament who worked tirelessly in her community to combat what she considered to be a growing epidemic: loneliness. We often think of loneliness as affecting the elderly, and it does, but it also affects every age demographic, and it is often in times of life transition that loneliness can strike. It can happen at times like leaving school or leaving home for the first time, becoming a parent or moving into retirement. The aim of my Say G'day in May campaign was to encourage people in my electorate to engage with and join their community groups. So I asked locals to come and meet me and walk with me or to meet me for a coffee along the way or to come and check out a local community group, and they did. 


I had some great company for my walks—locals like Anna, Reeta and Eric, who joined me for my walk from Tarragindi to Salisbury, and Midhat, who walked with me from Kuraby to Sunnybank, to name just a few. In fact, the Heart Foundation's CEO, Stephen Vines, joined me with part of his local walking group—Marion, Margaret and Billy—on the beautiful walk around the Corso at Yeronga. I stopped along the way to learn a few dance moves—very badly—from local dance groups at the Queensland Taiwan Centre in Sunnybank and at the Salisbury & District Senior Citizens Centre. I got a few practical and much-needed handyman tips from some men's sheds. I dropped into some art classes at Atelier Art Classes in Salisbury and Half Dozen Group of Artists in Sherwood. I was even tempted to try my hand at mahjong at the Cathay Community Association with a 96-year-old opponent. I marvelled at the wonderful people who spend their days caring for others, like the Westside Community Services, St David's Neighbourhood Centre, Cathay Community Association, Yeronga Community Plus, Braille House, Deaf Services Queensland and Cerebral Palsy League. And I thoroughly enjoyed reading to the class at Yeronga's Hyde Road kindy. 


It's been a great experience. I've seen a lot, I've heard from many and I've learnt heaps, but the Say G'day in May campaign is not over yet. This Friday, 25 May, I'm hosting a community groups showcase at the Wellers Hill Bowls Club between 10 am and 12 noon. I've asked local community groups to come along and showcase what they do, where they do it and when they meet. Thirty community groups will be on show, so I've asked everyone in Moreton to come along. They're invited to come and meet these community groups to say g'day to their neighbours in May.

 (Lindsay) (10:59):  I move:


That this House:


      (1) acknowledges that the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS):


      (a) supports a better life for hundreds of thousands of Australians with a significant and permanent disability, and their families and carers; and


      (b) will provide about 460,000 Australians under the age of 65 with a permanent and significant disability with the reasonable and necessary supports they need to live an ordinary life;


      (2) notes that:


      (a) the NDIS began in a number of trial sites around Australia from July 2013;


      (b) the NDIS is now operational across Australia;


      (c) as at 31 December 2017, there were 132,743 participants with an approved plan with the NDIS and 9,523 children receiving support through the Early Childhood Early Intervention approach; and


      (d) the NDIS roll-out in Western Australia will commence 1 July 2018;


      (3) calls on the Government to urgently address delays and inadequacies in the NDIS operations and roll-out, including:


      (a) funding adequacy and access to the scheme;


      (b) NDIS plan approvals and plan renewals;


      (c) access to adequate health services, care and supports, housing and other essential services; and


      (d) ensuring that the pricing structure of the NDIS enables service providers to deliver high quality support to participants in the scheme including for group activities that are being threatened by the current model;


      (4) reaffirms its commitment to:


      (a) ensuring Australians with a disability continue to get the support they need;


      (b) the scheme roll-out continuing to ensure a smooth transition for people with disability and support providers; and


      (c) an adequately funded and resourced NDIS; and


      (5) encourages all Members of Parliament to support the NDIS roll-out and the access to support it provides to people with disability.


The NDIS is something that Labor members of this caucus and of previous caucuses are incredibly proud of. It is something that I am incredibly proud of and, arguably, it is one of the things that ignited my passion for politics and finding a pathway into this place. It was Labor that fought for and introduced the NDIS that would transform the lives of people with a disability and make sure that they were able to achieve the level of independence that many of us here take for granted. We left office in 2013, with a plan to fully fund the NDIS for the next 10 years. This budget is a clear admission that the National Disability Insurance Scheme has always been fully funded. This is a massive embarrassment for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, who have spent years and years fuelling the anxiety of people with a disability and their carers by telling them that the NDIS is in some kind of danger, that it is not fully funded or that, as a country, we cannot afford it. An elderly couple in my electorate, who have a son in residential care, came to see me. They're incredibly old now and they worry about his life when they pass away. This is the case for many people. With the droning and constant squealing of the Treasurer that the NDIS isn't fully funded, they were terrified that their son's future was being placed at considerable risk. It takes an exceptional type of cruelty and of being so out-of-touch to do this to families. This makes me even more committed to holding this government and its weak-as-water rhetoric to account. 


Currently, there are about 142,000 participants with an approved plan who are accessing the NDIS, which includes about 9,500 children receiving support through the Early Childhood Early Intervention, ECEI, approach. An estimated half a million people under the age of 65 will finally receive the care and support that they have been waiting for so long to receive. The Commonwealth Ombudsman raised concerns about the timeliness of reviews in its report issued last week. It stated:


Of particular concern is the issue of delays in completing reviews. In February 2018, the NDIA advised our Office it had around 8,100 reviews on hand, and it was receiving around 620 new review requests each week. The NDIA has acknowledged some reviews are taking up to nine months to be completed.


We cannot afford to stumble on the implementation of the NDIS. It is a groundbreaking scheme. It is a system, a policy and a piece of infrastructure that will change people's lives; it will create an absolutely tangible difference. Fundamentally, this NDIS is a once-in-a-generation reform package, similar to what we had when we introduced Medicare many years ago. 


My office has become an NDIS de facto office and shopfront, with people contacting me every single day about their inadequate plans, about the reviews, about needing help or advocacy and also about the staff who mean well but who are, unfortunately, not trained. Take, for example, Tracey, who resides in Penrith, with her husband and their 13-year-old son, Bradley. Tracey has voiced her concerns and frustrations about resources and funding of the NDIS multiple times. Her son Bradley is severely disabled. He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. He has severe spinal scoliosis, is non-verbal and is wheelchair-bound. Tracey is the kind of mother this country should be applauding. So this government should not be running around fuelling her anxiety about what's to come. Tracy is Bradley's full-time carer, and his dad works six days a week to provide what their family needs. Bradley is non-verbal, as I said, and he has been waiting 20 months for communication aids. That's 20 months. I'm not quite sure what the delay is, but we've asked and we've asked and we've asked. He would be one of those 8,000 people who are waiting for a review. The response continues to be 'It's being reviewed.' He's due for surgery in September for a spine fusion. He's going to need a shower trolley. Imagine that! He's going to have spinal surgery. It is 11 months since that request was made. The wheelchair has been approved, which is a small win, but it will take three months to get it from America. 


A single mum in my electorate who contacted me has two children, a six-year-old and an eight-year-old, who have both been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. She contacted me, pleading that, under the current NDIS budget, she's concerned for the wellbeing of her kids. The care plans in place for the children are inadequate and will not fund the critical support services that they need. Her son attends behavioural therapy, and mum has noticed significant improvements, as we do. The core budget gives this family some room to hire additional support at home. Without this, she will struggle to manage. Her request for a review has been lodged; however, it will be some months before it's considered. 


Briefly, I would like to acknowledge the news in the media in recent days about the National Disability Insurance Agency's categorisation of autism. Both the NDIA and the government must work with stakeholders to make sure that the NDIS delivers for people who have autism spectrum disorder and must not through some kind of cost-saving exercise make it harder for people with autism. People with autism account for about a third of the participants accessing the NDIS, and a further third will. I am incredibly disappointed with the NDIA's handling of this issue in recent days. It has been poorly managed. It is so typical of this government to bungle anything. Quite frankly, I don't think it can be trusted to deliver a pizza at this rate, let alone a life-changing opportunity for hundreds of decent Australians.

The NDIS is one of the largest and most complex healthcare projects undertaken since Federation. That's why the government has been working soberly and proactively with stakeholders to get this right. It was, after all, the Turnbull government which reached agreements for the full rollout of the NDIS with all the states and territories. It was also our chairing of the COAG Disability Reform Council which saw it endorse the frameworks and strategies needed for rollout. 


Last year we introduced the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, and properly resourced it with $209 million over four years and 300 staff. As a result, the overall story from the NDIS rollout is a positive one. When asked directly during our inquiry into mental health services under the NDIS, every one of the organisations involved stated that the rollout has seen a huge positive impact on the lives of a great many people. Service providers have taken on new staff, others have begun offering new mental health or disability services and some are expanding into new geographical sites. Many people are getting help that previously did not. Many have certainty and structure in their care, and many are enjoying the additional control they have over their own lives. As at 30 September 2017, when more than 112,000 Australians had NDIS plans, 84 per cent of participants surveyed rated their experience with the NDIS as either good or very good. 


As we address what I acknowledge are emerging areas for improvement, we should not lose sight of the fact that, in general, the NDIS is already making a life-changing difference for tens of thousands of people. There certainly are challenges, but the government is acting to address them. There are concerns about people's ability to get continued access to services which are not covered by the NDIS or for which they will not be eligible. Last year, the government addressed that concern when it came to mental health, with $80 million for community health services to help people with severe mental illness who are deemed ineligible for the NDIS. 


In this year's budget, the government has gone further, allocating a further $92.6 million for other existing clients of Commonwealth disability support programs who are ineligible for the NDIS. There are also concerns about the workforce capacity needed. Again, the government has responded in this budget with $64.3 million for a Jobs and Market Fund to support the growth of disability service providers and the disability-care workforce. There are concerns about the funding of advocacy services. Providers had been offering this support unfunded. But, last August, the government responded with a $60 million funding package to pay for that advocacy. 


While the NDIS may face challenges, we must reflect on how much worse the situation would have been under Labor. This government has taken the decisions needed to fully fund the NDIS. While we waited for the results of our economy-building policies to flow through, we took the tough decision to raise the Medicare levy. Now that our jobs-and-growth agenda is having its effect, we are instead spending the dividends of our strong economic management on supporting our community's most vulnerable. In contrast, a Labor-run NDIS would have faced a budget shortfall of more than $5 billion a year, and a true budget black hole of $57 billion in the years to come. Labor claim, of course, that the NDIS was fully funded all along. But I'm afraid their track record of managing it does not give us any reason to believe them. It was Labor, after all, that dived into trials of the NDIS a year earlier than the Productivity Commission recommended, so that they could have it as part of their election campaign. It was Labor that signed the Commonwealth up to one-sided agreements which took 100 per cent of the financial risk with little or no control over the levers to manage that risk. And let us not forget that, in just one quarter of operation under Labor, the average cost of an NDIS package blew out by an average of 30 per cent. 


Under this government, the NDIS is fully funded and on track to roll out on time. As with any project of this size there are challenges to be overcome and where they are identified this government is responding with swift and prudent action. Personally, I cannot wait for the NDIS roll-out on the Sunshine Coast, from 1 January 2019.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (11:10):  I'm speaking up today on behalf of Caddie Whitehead and her son, Xabian Paterson, a gorgeous young child who has severe cerebral palsy. Caddie drives an hour and 20 minutes each way so that she and Xabian can attend the Cerebral Palsy Education Centre in my electorate, because CPEC's flagship transdisciplinary group program, which has been operating for decades, is the best thing Caddie has found for her son. Yet, shockingly, this brilliant program will have to stop if the government fails to act quickly to fix the NDIS pricing structure, which is now making it unviable. After trying other early interventions, Caddie quickly realised that this program was going to make Xabian into the best person that he could be. The family had actually moved from New South Wales to Melbourne as Caddie's husband had a work contract. Xabian was born shortly after. When Grant's contract for work was up they decided to stay in Melbourne instead of returning to the comfort and help of their family in New South Wales, because they wanted to continue on with CPEC, as they could see the benefits for Xabian and their family.


The class is eight children and four instructors—a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a speech pathologist and an aide—plus the parents and carers. Learning from the transdisciplinary team of instructors is important, but having other families present is a key part of its magic. I visited a few weeks ago and saw this firsthand. To work, however, this program requires a one-to-two funding ratio. The program has been evaluated formally for over 20 years—individual outcomes have been evaluated, video recorded and annual assessments. It's evidence based.


So, what's the problem? It's not a lifelong program; it's early intervention for kids between 0 and 6 years old to moderate the severity of their condition, giving them skills for life and saving costs to governments later in life. The problem is that the government is making a growing mess of Labor's visionary NDIS. The NDIS pricing structure is still one-size-fits-all and requires a ratio of one-to-three for group programs, which means for every therapist you need three kids for it to be financially viable. This simply doesn't work with the severity of CPEC's participants.


The NDIA also won't fund the critical planning, preparation, resource development and support activities for this cohort, which take about 10 hours a week. So, right now, CPEC is limping along with bandaids and sticky tape trying to hold it together while cutting back places and seeing their waiting lists grow. Ridiculously, they're now covering the costs for this critical program through fundraising and higher fees. But it can't be sustained. I've written to the Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services asking her to act. We may be on opposite sides but she's a wonderful colleague and a credit to you mob. She actually cares about what she's doing. It's shameful how you've just knocked her off in preselection. I still figure it's better to approach her than the hapless Minister for Social Services.


I call on the government and the NDIA to intervene urgently to save this program. There is no time for your normal dithering with correspondence and do-nothing approach. This flagship program will die if changes aren't made urgently. This is not an isolated problem. I've been told that due to the NDIS pricing structure therapeutic group programs have been phased out by providers across the disability sector nationwide.


We hear a lot about bipartisanship. When it's convenient, it gets thrown at us—bipartisanship on the NDIS. Let me be clear: bipartisanship is not a slogan; it's not a sticker; it's not a gag on us; it's not a leave pass for scrutiny for you; it's not an excuse for inaction or bastardisation of Labor's visionary scheme. Bipartisanship is a conditional offer on the government being competent, honest and faithful to the intent of the NDIS and doing the right thing.


Unfortunately, this group-pricing saga is one of many growing problems of the NDIS under the Liberals—not placing the patient at the centre of the scheme, as was intended. There's cultural problems at the NDIA. They've got thousands of contractors and expensive consultants and not enough staff, because of the government's fake staffing cap. We heard news just today of secret plans to kick thousands of people with autism off the NDIS nationwide. The draft plans are not available for review. The IT system is a debacle—the myplace portal. The workforce challenges are a joke. The Productivity Commission says one in five new jobs in the next few years in this country will be disability-related, such is the scale of this change. Yet there's no workforce strategy. There's no national advertising campaign to try to get the workforce we need—nothing. So, we are watching.



The truth is, of course, that in their DNA the Liberals hate universal services, and they hate these universal entitlement programs. They oppose them at every step. If you look through Australian political history, Medicare was scrapped by the Liberals after Whitlam introduced it and was brought back by the Hawke government. It's always under attack by this mob. There are public schools and the NDIS: we build it, you cut it. Every groundbreaking reform, since 1908 with the invalid pension, since 1991 with the disability support pension and the NDIS— (Time expired)

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (11:15):  Thank you to the member for Lindsay for raising this important issue. The National Disability Insurance Scheme provides life-changing support to Australians with disability. This is why the Turnbull government has committed to fully funding the NDIS. The time for political games over the NDIS is well and truly over. Australians want to see the scheme fully funded and support being provided to those who need it. The Turnbull government has recognised the importance of the NDIS and has ensured that they have covered the $56 billion funding gap that had been left behind by Labor.


Despite Labor's unwillingness to support our initial plan, the government has ensured that the NDIS is fully funded without any increase to the Medicare levy, thanks to our strengthened economy and the government's strong budget management. It is now more important than ever that Australia has the strong economic management that only the coalition government can deliver to ensure we can fund the NDIS into the future. Now it is time to deliver the NDIS in the most efficient and effective way.


The recent budget guarantees the funding for the NDIS. In addition to this, the government is ensuring that those ineligible for the NDIS will continue to receive support. The government has committed $92.6 million for continuity of support for existing clients of Commonwealth disability support programs for people who are ineligible for the NDIS, and $64.3 million for a Jobs and Market Fund to support the growth of disability service providers and the disability care workforce to meet the needs of the NDIS. At its full operation, 460,000 Australians will be supported by the NDIS, with an estimated 2,129 people in my electorate of Bennelong being supported by the scheme.


There are a number of fantastic stories and lessons about the NDIS that have come from my own electorate. Royal Rehab, the Rehabilitation and Disability Support Network, is an incredible rehabilitation hospital in my electorate that has worked with thousands of people every year since its inception in 1899. It was responsible for the rehabilitation of the injured rugby league player, Alex McKinnon. Royal Rehab runs a supported independent living program as part of the NDIS and have repeatedly expressed to me how happy they are with the scheme. Particular recognition must go to their Chair, Tony Stavely, and the outgoing CEO, Stephen Lowndes, for all of their amazing hard work and dedication in serving the local community of Bennelong. Stephen concludes his tenure as CEO in June of this year, and I would like to thank him for his 10 years of committed service to Royal Rehab and to the people of Bennelong. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the incoming CEO, Matthew Mackay, and wish him the very best of luck in this role.


Naturally, the transition of such large-scale and established service provider systems like the NDIS brings with it a number of challenges. However, the government continues to work towards improving the implementation and understanding of the scheme. Two weeks ago, my office was made aware of difficulties faced by the Estia Foundation, located in Gladesville, in managing their client's NDIS budgets. Estia was initially established to provide short-term overnight accommodation to people with disabilities. However, they found that towards the end of the financial year, many clients who unexpectedly required short-term respite did not have sufficient funds in their NDIS plans. This caused Estia to undertake a restructure and turn towards more long-term group accommodation. I'm happy to report that Estia will continue to employ staff and support individuals with expert levels of care. Their work is a great asset to our local community. Experiences such as these are not ideal, but play an essential role in developing and improving the scheme.


Another great NDIS success story in Bennelong is a local organisation called RASAID, the Ryde Area Supported Accommodation for Intellectually Disabled. I've spoken about RASAID a number of times in the past. RASAID brought together 19 local families to secure accommodation for their 20 children with intellectual disabilities and with high-care needs. Last year, upon hearing that RASAID was on the verge of closing its doors due to complications with supported independent living, I immediately approached Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services, Jane Prentice, who boldly leapt into action and ensured the organisation was the beneficiary of an early trial of a new tool kit that ensured funding was secured. I cannot thank Assistant Minister Prentice enough for both her work for RASAID and her continued advocacy for the NDIS to ensure all Australians have— (Time expired)

"Templeman, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (11:21):  I'm very pleased to be supporting this motion moved by the member for Lindsay and to reaffirm my commitment to Labor's visionary National Disability Insurance Scheme. I am particularly concerned about reports that there are secret plans to remove support from those who have autism. We know that early intervention with autism is absolutely crucial to helping kids achieve the very best that they can and supporting parents to do this. Those reports are extremely concerning.


Today, I want to talk about the NDIS from the perspective of just one of the many people who has had to battle to have a fair go. Rachel Privitera is a young mum from Bligh Park in Hawkesbury in my electorate of Macquarie. She has an eight-year-old son, Cameron, who suffers from severe cerebral palsy and epilepsy, is tube fed and is legally blind. Rachel is tough. She is a fighter. But she has been forced by an underfunded and unsupported NDIS to fight harder than she should have to just so that Cameron can have access to the things he needs just to get by.


Rachel has found the battle with the National Disability Insurance Authority all-consuming. When I met with her recently with the Leader of the Opposition, she described devoting every waking moment to fighting for her son. She was doing things like walking away from the car, leaving the boot open and accidentally leaving bags in places, all because of how totally consuming her battle with the NDIA was. She wasn't being selfish. She wasn't fighting for what anyone would consider to be luxuries. This was about keeping her son sufficiently hydrated. I'm not going to go into the personal medical details here, but Rachel did share them with us when she spoke with us, and it's clear that the NDIA and this government are not doing enough.


The reality is that this government doesn't see Rachel and Cameron as a priority. If they did, they would not be throwing money at big banks and big businesses; they would be committing resources to ensure that the NDIS was working effectively and working the way it was intended to, so that everyday mums like Rachel don't have to have their lives turned upside down repeatedly by bureaucracy. Rachel has fought her way through the inadequacies and the downfalls of a poorly implemented NDIS, and secured her son what he needs.


What is so impressive, though, about this young mother is that she's not satisfied to have adequate resources for her own son alone. She's concerned for every man, woman and child who doesn't have the ability to fight the way she fought for Cameron. She's concerned that many are not having their voices heard or their needs addressed because the system simply isn't accessible. You shouldn't have to fight for something that you have a right to. The loudness of your voice and the people that you know should not determine whether or not you access the NDIS.


Rachel has now gone even further in her fight: she's taking up the fight for all families who have children with a disability. I want to share with you her words about the sort of facilities she wants to see in our communities. She wants to see fully inclusive playgrounds, like Livvi's Place playgrounds, so families like hers can feel like part of the community, not separate from it. She says: 


When our family goes to a Livvi's Place playground, we can stay for hours, we invite other friends from Cameron's special needs school, we have a BBQ! These are things that a normal family do. In a normal park, without equipment for Cameron, we can only stay for half an hour. Cameron cries, he's excluded, he can hear other kids playing & laughing. 


They're the words of a mum who knows what our community needs. It's not Cameron's disability that holds him back; it's his lack of access to things that the rest of us just take for granted.


As many Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains residents know, neither place is completely accessible. In the Hawkesbury, we have bumpy and slanted walkways, a legacy of our heritage. We have heritage guttering, high enough to ensure that a trip down the street counts as a leg day at the gym. All of this is a challenge not just for wheelchairs but for prams and elderly walkers. The mountainous terrain naturally creates its own challenges, especially for people to access recreational areas. There is certainly a demand from the community for greater inclusivity in our play areas. I'm determined to see more inclusive facilities across Macquarie, and I'll be standing alongside Rachel and Cameron and other families to fight for what is their right and for a fair go.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (11:26):  Firstly, I congratulate the member for Lindsay for moving this very important motion this morning. The member for Lindsay has been a very passionate advocate for the rights of people living with a disability in our community and has been a great supporter, not only in her time in the parliament but previous to that, of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I'm pleased that she's moved this motion today because, just like Medicare, the prices and incomes accord or Mabo, the NDIS is one of those great Labor nation-building initiatives that moves our nation forward, providing better quality of life for a marginalised group of Australians. 


I must pay credit, also, to the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, who is actually the person who provided the impetus in this parliament for the NDIS to come to fruition. When Bill was the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services in the previous Rudd government, he consulted widely. He travelled around the country consulting representative groups and people living with disabilities; he planned, crafted and helped deliver the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It should never be forgotten that Bill Shorten was the initial architect of that scheme. Finally, those living with a disability were getting support and most importantly the help that they needed for new opportunities in life and for living a rewarding and fulfilling life. That's the basis upon which we introduced the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It's progressively being rolled out throughout the country, with, as the motion points out, 132,743 participants and 9,523 children receiving support through early childhood intervention. 


There have been some teething problems. You would expect as such with a large policy and a new rollout. Certainly in Kingsford Smith, many participants in the scheme, their families and friends have consulted me about the plans and the fact that some of them have had issues—not supporting current supports, not supporting goals and new aspirations—and I'm pleased to say that, in most cases, we've been able to work them out, working with the local office that's situated in Maroubra, and I thank the staff there for the work that they've been undertaking. 


This motion moved by the member for Lindsay goes to a very important point—that is, ensuring that the pricing structure of the NDIS enables service providers to deliver high-quality support to participants in the scheme, including for group activities that are being threatened by the current model. This is becoming a big issue in the community that I'm in. Already, one of the service providers, HeadEast, which provided support for people who were victims of brain trauma associated with car accidents, has had to close. They simply couldn't continue to operate under the current pricing structure. Other providers have also contacted me, saying that, if the current pricing structure continues, they simply won't be able to provide services for people living in our community. 


The government commissioned McKinsey to do an independent report in February 2018. Recommendation 9 of that report was:


The NDIA should update the pricing structure for the core support item 'Group based activities in a centre', to allow providers to charge a high intensity loading where a more skilled worker is required to serve a participant …


The NDIA have had a look at that and responded to that recommendation. In the NDIA's response they recognise that this is an issue. They recognise that the current pricing structure is inadequate. They say that the recommendation is supported and will be implemented by 1 July 2018. That's weeks away. Some of these service providers have been contacting the NDIA and saying: 'When is this change going to be implemented? What is the new pricing structure going to be?' The NDIA can't give them an answer, and that is putting at risk the support that many of these providers are providing, particularly to people who need high-end supports in a one-to-one situation.


It's not good enough to have this uncertainty about whether high-dependency support for families in vulnerable situations is going to be able to continue under the new service model. The NDIA have to get their act together. The minister has to step in here and get the NDIA to publish what they will do in the future to ensure that these service providers can continue to provide this support and, importantly, that the people with high-end needs who rely on these services can continue to get the supports to live fulfilling and rewarding lives.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (11:31):  The National Disability Insurance Scheme is a world's first scheme to provide support to people with a disability. The mission is for it to change the way people with a disability, their families and disability providers work together. Naturally, making such a vast change to the system will create challenges. It's bigger than the original snowy dam project or even building our Navy ships. Late last year the NDIS reached a major milestone, with over 140,000 Australians with a disability now receiving this life-changing support.


During the last week of April and the first week in May we held four NDIS forums in Gilmore. The idea was to get the providers, the NDIS and the NDIA in the same room as the carers and clients of the system. This was an enriching event for all who came. They initially expressed frustration and anger at the process, but they had some issues resolved and some pathways determined. There is a real need for the planners, the LACs and the people involved to have complete dialogue with each other, as many of the issues that become frustrating can be fixed fairly readily if there is full and compassionate communication. This is confirmed by 83 per cent of participants who entered the NDIS in the December quarter rating their experience as good or very good. Also, since the scheme began, the overall average satisfaction rating has remained high at 90 per cent. 


There has been a large increase in the number of providers registered, which is now more than 12,300. There is room for more. I was told last week that many small businesses, like plumbers and other trades, could also be providers, but they don't realise it.


While the government is continuing to work with the National Disability Insurance Agency and the state and territory governments to make sure the success of the NDIS with regard to participant outcomes, financial stability and the economic benefits to the country, I must mention that it seems as if the state governments—at least in New South Wales—have retracted some of the block funding before time, so there are gaps appearing for continuity of service. It makes me feel a little concerned.


An independent evaluation conducted over the last 4½ years has confirmed the NDIS is improving the wellbeing of people with a disability. The story of Cameron McMullen in Ulladulla is a perfect example. He was proud to let us know that his life has been completely changed for the better. He has more activities and his goal for personal freedom is about to be delivered in the form of a modified vehicle. As the report indicates, the NDIS is one of the most important social policy innovations. The hundreds of good stories are often lost when the few that really do need our attention to help resolve come to our notice. 


I, for one, will be thrilled when the current trial program is universally available. That will mean that the plans that are developed for clients are shown to them and/or their carers before being delivered to the government for approval. What an amazing difference that will make, leading to fewer reviews, less dissatisfaction and happier results overall. I'm hopeful that the organisations responsible for Early Childhood Early Intervention in Gilmore have the sensitivity and background knowledge that help families and their children with disabilities to navigate the system and get the best possible outcomes. Such a group that has been an outstanding provider so far is Noah's Ark. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for them.


Some parts of the NDIS truly need help. The planners need the proposed services to be described in everyday language, but the NDIS needs the technical descriptor or medical explanation. This needs to be resolved, and was brought up in each of our fora. Mental ill health is part of the NDIS, but accessing the program can be difficult at best and impossible at worst. The very support structures that have been in place under the state government are now withdrawing their funding, as is supposed to happen, in June this year. How can we deliver a no-disadvantage system to people who pass the New South Wales state eligibility criteria for mental health support but have been rejected by the NDIS? The consequence is that very important support they have been receiving is no longer available. Sunflower House is a place where women in particular go for mental health support. Last week I spoke with a number of very concerned staff, and also Leanne, who stayed back to give me her story:


Prior to attending Sunflower House, I was totally housebound. I would not even go to my letterbox. I was socially isolated and disconnected from everyone and everything. I had attempted to take my life on numerous occasions throughout the years, the last one almost successful. This service has helped me in so many ways, I have a safe place to attend, I've made friendships, my children are no longer worried about me as they were.


Leanne has been accepted by the NDIS, but many of her new friends at Sunflower House have not, and she asked me to ask the government why not, for many of them with mental health problems are at the same risk as she was. I will ask and follow up.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (11:36):  I begin by commending the member for Lindsay for bringing this very important motion on the National Disability Insurance Scheme to the attention of the House. The NDIS, as we all know and acknowledge, is an historic reform initiated by the previous Labor government, designed to support Australians with disabilities to have the best opportunity for the same quality of life as the rest of us in the community. This is why this government must match its rhetoric with action to ensure the commitment it has repeatedly given to Australians with disability and their carers provides adequate funding and resources to support and provides all measures necessary to live their lives without barriers to the fulfilment of their potential.


In March this year the NDIS began rolling out in my electorate, giving my constituents the very-long-awaited opportunity to finally transition to and access the scheme. My constituents will join thousands of others across the north-western region of Melbourne who will be required to submit their care packages for assessment and hopefully approval. For some the process they have engaged in is already providing a source of anxiety and frustration. The longer-than-expected rolling-out in the federal seat of Calwell has been a source of concern to begin with, but now the assessment experience itself is proving a challenge, as is the pricing structure.


For instance, to date we do not have a local area coordinator for the Brimbank area, which is at the north-western end of my electorate. Many of my constituents are facing unnecessary delays and unwelcome hurdles to accessing the NDIS as a result. Despina Havelas, who is a parent and activist for families with autistic children and has founded a local support group, Autism Angels, tells me our local parents are very worried and concerned about the lack of help provided to help them navigate a very technical and different approach to assessing their cases. Most of these families are of non-English-speaking backgrounds, and that in itself is an additional disadvantage to defending the rights of their child, family friend or relative who is trying to access the NDIS.


So far the rate of approvals has been disappointing. Complaints by people trying to access the scheme are mounting, as people believe their individual needs are not being properly considered. Those who have gone through the assessment often cite the phone interview as a major obstacle, as this method of interaction does not allow person-to-person contact, which is vital in helping assess the needs of the applicants. The lived experience cannot be gauged by telephone-only assessments, as the approach by the case workers appears to be primarily driven by cost-saving attitudes and measures, which means the experience is more about deleting or refusing services that once were provided in the package in order to save money. This should not be the overriding concern of the assessment process. The best package for the individual's needs to be the primary concern. People with disabilities have a right to access the NDIS fully, not partially. They should not be made to feel that they have to fight every step of the way in order to justify the most appropriate package to help them and their carers live fruitful and valuable lives. 


One of my constituents, Andrew, attempted to access the NDIS and was refused for both the NDIS and the disability support pension. Andrew's a good example of someone who hasn't been able to convince, despite medical records, either providers that he is eligible. He has an impairment in his back, hip and shoulder that make it difficult for him to work. Andrew cannot stand for long periods of time, he cannot lift heavy things, he finds it difficult to write and has restricted movement when sitting. Andrew's treating doctor considered him eligible for the NDIS and the DSP. Despite this, an unnamed delegate told Andrew that he could not access the NDIS because the delegate was not satisfied that Andrew has a physical impairment. He is 64 years old and very soon he will not be able to even access the NDIS. He won't be able to access the age pension age pension for six month. So, the question is: what is someone like Andrew expected to do in order to support himself?

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (11:41):  I am pleased to join the discussion initiated by the honourable member for Lindsay about what is a very significant and important topic—the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The scheme is now in its second year of transition and there is a long way to go because, if you look at the numbers, as of December 2017 over 140,000 Australians with disability were enrolled in the scheme, but this has to reach an estimated number of almost half a million—about 460,000—in the next couple of years or so. So the work which is undertaken by the National Disability Insurance Agency and by state territory and Commonwealth governments to bring about a full and proper rollout of the scheme is quite substantial and will be significant in the years to come. 


There are a number of issues which arise from the operation of the scheme. Along with the honourable member who moved this motion, and another member here in the chamber, Mr Wallace, we are part of the joint standing committee which oversights the National Disability Insurance Scheme. In this parliament, we've issued a number of reports looking at various aspects of the operation of the scheme, including: early childhood and early intervention; a second report on people with psychosocial disability related to a mental health condition; and a third completed report on transitional arrangements. The committee is currently undertaking a number of inquiries into general issues relating to the scheme. One is into market readiness, which is a huge issue right across the country, particularly in those areas where there are, to use the cliche, thin markets—in other words, large areas, usually, without the same distribution of services that you would find in a major metropolitan city. There is also an ongoing inquiry, which we hope to see the fruition of soon, in relation to hearing services. 


I think it's fair to say that, in common with all who have looked at this, regardless of what side of the chamber we happen to sit on, there are a number of issues that are ongoing in terms of the work which needs to be done by the agency and, in some cases, by the state, territory and commonwealth governments. One is in relation to planning, and, particularly, the process of planning. The general view is that plans that have been entered into and created over the telephone are not as good as plans which are done in person. And related to that is the question of communication, particularly between planners and participants in the scheme and, more generally, between the agency and participants. 


That leads to a second area of ongoing challenge, and that relates to reviews of plans. I'm not necessarily speaking on behalf of the committee, but it does seem to me personally that if there's an opportunity for face-to-face planning and there's an opportunity for those plans to be reviewed by the participant and their family prior to the finalisation of the plan, it's more likely that two things will result: firstly, the plan is more likely to meet the needs of the participant, having had the opportunity to actually review it, and, secondly, if that's the case, then it cuts out or reduces substantially the number of reviews that need to be undertaken. It would seem from a point of simple bureaucratic efficiency that this would be a better way, not to mention the justice that I believe would flow from a better process.


There are also issues in relation to the involvement of providers and their appropriate input. And while there are always issues in this regard about conflicts of interest, nonetheless in other areas of public policy we've been able to resolve the conflict of interest and allow for the appropriate input of providers, and that should appropriately be the place in relation to the NDIS as well. Also related to providers, there are questions of pricing that are being looked at by the agency at the present time as well as the timeliness of payments to providers. If payments are not made in a timely way, if tens of thousands of dollars are outstanding to providers, then what we're placing at risk is the actual provision of services, and that would be a worse outcome for those who have disabilities than it is at the present time.


As I said, this is a work in progress. I welcome the specific measures that have been announced by the government in relation to the Early Childhood Early Intervention gateway, the introduction of typical support packages to benchmark the amount of support for participants with specific characteristics, the increases in risk-based quality assurance of the access and plan approval, the very necessary increase in staff training, and the redesign of the participant pathway to look at goals and sustainability in relation to participants themselves. It's a work in progress, but a very valuable scheme. (Time expired)

"Freelander, Mike, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (11:46):  First of all, I would like to thank the member for Lindsay for moving this motion this morning. The NDIS has really been the best social change that we've had brought in by this parliament since Medicare. It's made a huge difference for many of the people I've been caring for in my working career over the last 40 years as a paediatrician. It really has made a huge difference for many people, and at a level that really requires us to stop and think about what was happening previously.


Many of the people that I saw, as they got older, would have a constant worry about what would happen to their child as they approached adult life with a disability and when their parents could no longer look after them. Many parents who were elderly and who had children with, for example, Down syndrome were finding that, as their children approached adult life, it was physically difficult for them to care for them and they worried about what the future held for them. Many of them would save every cent they had by skimping on holidays, by not affording themselves the little luxuries of life to try to save for their child with a disability's future. The NDIS has now brought them certainty that we as a society will take over their role, that we will say to them: 'We are part of this journey with you. We will care for your child, whether with cerebral palsy or Down syndrome or an intellectual disability, and we will make sure that their future is secure.' That has been a huge change for them.


I can remember speaking to Julia Gillard long before she became Prime Minister, and it's my belief that we owe her a huge debt of gratitude, as well as the previous Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, who developed a bipartisan approach to the NDIS. It is very important to note that the NDIS, from its inception, had bipartisan support and commitment to funding. The attempt to politicise the NDIS has been a bit of a tragedy, and I won't have any part of that. The NDIS has bipartisan support. We should all accept that. It has bipartisan funding, and that should be the end of the argument.


There are many issues with the rollout of the NDIS. It was rolled out quite quickly, and I think it was important that we did roll it out as soon as we possibly could because the need in many cases—and the need for many of the people who I see—was urgent. So I don't think we should make any apology for the rapid rollout of this scheme. But there have been some problems. Some of them have already been mentioned. No. 1 is the lack of training of the planners; that has been a mistake and I believe it's now being remedied retrospectively. There has also been an issue with people trying to do NDIS plans over the telephone, which I don't think is appropriate. I think we've accepted that. Now that that's occurred and we've seen the problems that planning over the phone can cause, face-to-face planning is the rule rather than the exception.


We also know from talking to disability service providers, such as Macarthur Disability Services in my electorate, that there have been a number of issues with things like funding for transport. That is very important if you're disabled; trying to get to different services can be a major cost and time impost on getting appropriate intervention. That's one area. Personal care costs also have not been appropriately examined, and I think are something we're trying to fit retrospectively to make them fit for purpose.


A huge issue—and this has been identified today by the member for Gilmore—is the lack of appropriate funding for people with severe mental illness, such as one of my old patients, Nathan. He has severe schizophrenia, often medication resistant and with frequent relapses. If you ask Nathan if he has any problems, the answer, because of his fear of interaction with bureaucracies and medical and health professionals, is, 'No, I'm fine; I have no problems.' And yet Nathan has intractable problems: he sleeps on the street, he has epilepsy that's uncontrolled and he often has wounds and sores that are not being properly treated because he sleeps on the streets. So attention to people with severe mental illness is vitally important as part of the NDIS.


But I would stress that it's a wonderful program, it has bipartisan support and we support it. Thank you.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:00):  Last week the world witnessed a massacre. On 14 May, Israeli soldiers shot and killed 58 Palestinians who were protesting near the fence that separates the Gaza Strip from Israel. Over 2,000 Palestinians were injured, including over 1,000 by live fire. This comes on the back of weeks of violence directed against protesters in which 116 Palestinians have been killed and 12,600 have been injured. The killings of protesters have met with condemnation and demonstrations around the world, including within Israel and in my electorate of Melbourne. Australia should be taking a stand. Not only has the Australian government refused to condemn the killing of over 100 civilians at the hands of armed soldiers, Australia this weekend became one of only two countries—along with Donald Trump's USA—to vote against a UN Human Rights Council resolution for an independent inquiry.


Those killed were participating in marches organised by Palestinian civil society groups to call for an end to the siege of Gaza and a right of return of Palestinian refugees. For 11 years severe restrictions on access to and from the Gaza Strip have devastated the population of nearly two million. According to Physicians for Human Rights, over 35 per cent of children suffer post-traumatic stress disorder and 59.7 per cent of Gaza schoolchildren suffer from anaemia. Forty-seven per cent of households suffer food insecurity.


Australia should be affirming the right to political activity and condemning the killing of protesters. Australia should be recognising the Palestinian state and pushing for an end to the siege of Gaza and the right of return for Palestinian refugees.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (16:45):  I move:


That this House:


(1) recognises the deteriorating humanitarian crisis that has ensued between the Myanmar security forces in Rakhine State and Rohingya Muslims, since 25 August 2017;


(2) notes with grave concern, evidence from Human Rights Watch of a series of brutal crackdowns carried out by security forces against ethnic Rohingya Muslims, including:


(a) extrajudicial killing;


(b) the torture and suffering of Rohingya women, men and children;


(c) the forced displacement of more than 600,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh;


(d) the destruction, arson and takeover of more than 300 villages by the Myanmar military; and


(e) endemic rape and sexual violence;


(3) further notes:


(a) that Myanmar was home to an estimated 1.3 million Rohingya Muslims;


(b) the long history and persecution of the Rohingya population, including the denial of citizenship under the 1982 Citizenship Law and the denial of most basic government services;


(c) the poor living conditions and widespread inequality facing Rohingya Muslims isolated in Rakhine State and those now living in Bangladesh, including limited access to food, water, shelter, medical treatment and humanitarian assistance; and


(d) that the United Nations and Human Rights Watch have described the situation in Rakhine State as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing;


(4) urges the government of Myanmar to:


(a) recommit to the pursuit of peace and national reconciliation;


(b) allow unfettered humanitarian access to all parts of Rakhine State; and


(c) unconditionally release the two Reuters reporters currently detained in Myanmar; and


(5) echoes the voices of the international community and calls on Australia to:


(a) consider providing additional humanitarian assistance in response to the Rohingya crisis, particularly to assist Bangladesh in responding to the unprecedented levels of Rohingya refugees that have moved across its border;


(b) ensure that the development assistance that Australia provides to Myanmar is appropriately targeted to those most in need, and does not risk contributing to the further suffering of minority groups in Myanmar such as the Rohingya;


(c) exert maximum pressure on the Myanmar authorities to allow independent examination of claims of human rights abuses in Rakhine State, and to hold those responsible for abuses to account; and


(d) continue condemnation of the human rights abuses against the Rohingya.


In moving this motion, so I seek to draw attention to the deteriorating humanitarian situation that has occurred in Rakhine State and principally at the hands of the Myanmar security forces. This has been occurring ever since August 2017. The situation in Myanmar is not merely just violence, abuse or outright neglect but one of atrocities, a human rights crisis of catastrophic proportions that has resulted in the displacement now of over 600,000 Rohingya refugees into neighbouring Bangladesh. The situation has been described by the United Nations and Human Rights Watch as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.


I recently had the opportunity to meet with Elaine Pearson, the director of Human Rights Watch, and Richard Weir, the Burma researcher for that organisation. They gave me a horrific account of the treatment that has been afforded to the Rohingya. Their account was most chilling. It was a graphic depiction of the worst of humanity: children being beaten to death, ruthless killings and rapes, all being perpetrated by members of the Myanmar security forces. Based on the interviews conducted by Human Rights Watch and detailed satellite imagery, they have concluded that the military has destroyed, burned and taken over more than 300 villages. Clearly, there have been atrocities committed against the Rohingya, now including evidence of massacres.


It is important to note that discrimination of the Rohingya in Burma does have a long history. Now the government of Myanmar continues to deny the Rohingyas' citizenship along with the provision of basic government services such as health and education. It is this abhorrent denial of basic human rights that has incrementally led to the treatment of the Rohingya more recently. This escalation is now much more than discrimination; it is a campaign of ethnic cleansing.


Bangladesh is not a rich country by any means and is not well equipped to deal with such an influx of refugees given the limited resources and lack of appropriate infrastructure. This makes the Rohingya in Bangladesh completely reliant on humanitarian assistance for basic services. The risk is markedly higher at this time of year with the fast approaching monsoonal season. I acknowledge the hard work of agencies such as Save the Children, UNICEF, Oxfam and many others who are working tirelessly to cater for the basic humanitarian needs of those refugees.


I'm also proud that Australia is playing a crucial part in progressing further diplomatic and humanitarian efforts in Myanmar. However, if we have learnt anything from the past, it must be that much more needs to be done. The task before the Australian government and the United Nations is urgent and requires immediate attention. I call on the government to take a stronger stance with the Myanmar authorities. I call on the government to support the unimpeded humanitarian access to all parts of Rakhine State and refugee camps in Bangladesh. We must work closely with our regional partners to ensure that the government of Myanmar commits to a peaceful resolution and a national reconciliation.


I understand that, given some of the cultural practices, the resettlement of the Rohingya refugees in countries such as Australia would not be without difficulty. This is why we should be placing stronger pressure on the authorities in Myanmar to change their behaviour and hold those responsible to account. In saying this, I call on the government to consider suspending all military training in Myanmar, and to consider targeted sanctions on members of the military implicated in human rights abuses, as applied by other Commonwealth jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Canada. 


Two decades ago the international community watched in horror as Rwanda was pulled apart by a brutal genocide. Collectively it said, 'Never again.' But today we are seeing these lessons unfold once again. We cannot merely be bystanders. I ask the House to note the words of the social justice advocate and former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu, who said, 'If you are neutral in a situation of injustice, you have just chosen the side of the oppressor.'

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:50): I second the motion. It is a great privilege to speak following the member for Fowler, who has spent so much time in his parliamentary career advocating for issues like this one. What we are speaking about today is one of the most extraordinary human rights abuses that we have seen in recent decades in South-East Asia. The member for Fowler and I share a mutual passion for the subject. We have big Cambodian and Vietnamese communities, and we have growing Rohingyan communities. That's why it's a real pleasure to be able to express their incredibly strong feelings about the matter that we talking about today.


The escalating human rights crisis in Rakhine state, perpetrated by members of the Myanmar security forces, has been ongoing since August 2017. I have the great privilege of representing somewhere around 1,000 Rohingya people in my electorate of Hotham. I meet with them regularly, and I try to do the things that we do as local members of parliament. I connect them into community organisations, I support them getting active, getting involved and getting organised in their local area. But when I ask them what the most important thing is that I can help them with as a member of parliament, it is doing the thing I am doing right now—providing them with a voice. What they are desperately concerned about is the family and friends, the communities, the villages, that are being devastated by violence, by ruthless extermination of people who are doing nothing else but being of a particular ethnic origin that these security forces don't like. It is gut-wrenching to sit down with these people as they will literally cry tears of pain and talk about the things that are happening and what's going on back home. They want us to speak up as parliamentarians, because this sort of violence is unacceptable. It's unacceptable here; it's unacceptable anywhere in the world. We need to make sure we speak with one voice and make that clear. 


The torture and the suffering of Rohingyan men, women and children is still continuing to date. We know that at least 300 villages have been completely destroyed by the military presence there. There is endemic rape and sexual violence against women. In one week 3,000 people were killed and more than 52 villages were burned and destroyed. As you would know, Deputy Speaker, the United Nations tries to speak without making too much fuss, law I suppose you could say, in what it says about issues like this, but it has described the situation in Rakhine state as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing. These are extremely strong words to be used by the United Nations. We know that almost 700,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since August 2017, and they're in refugee camps now. There are 200,000 Rohingya who are languishing in these camps, some of whom are living in absolutely intolerable conditions. They have limited access to food, water, shelter, medical treatment and humanitarian assistance. Deputy Speaker, something that I know strikes you in the heart, as it does me, is that a very large majority of the people living in these camps are women and children. They face threats, including that of being human-trafficked and of sexual abuse. 


It is a massive humanitarian crisis. Even though we are very well aware of what's going on from our standpoint in Australia, the limited response from the Australian government has been very disappointing. I think $5 million was offered initially for the emergency relief effort. Seven hundred thousand people have been displaced by this crisis, so I think we can agree that $5 million is not going to go too far. In October 2017 the government committed a further $10 million. But it is so clear to me, and so clear to the people who I represent, that we can and we must do more to help with this crisis. This is the fastest-growing refugee and humanitarian crisis in the world right now.


On 13 September last year, the UN Security Council agreed on a pretty strongly-worded statement on Myanmar, condemning the violence in the Rakhine region. It was the first time they'd done so in nine years. The United Nations Association of Australia has called on the Australian government to intensify our diplomatic efforts to try to help resolve this, and I want to join in those calls. As Australians, we have an important, respected voice in this region. We can't stand by while people who are our neighbours in South-East Asia are treated in this way. There are people there who are being treated in ways worse than anything, really, that we could imagine. I think we need to be doing a lot more to speak up, and I do so today on behalf of my Rohingyan residents.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2018-05-21,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (16:56):  Firstly, I want to acknowledge and thank the member for Fowler for bringing this heartfelt motion before the chamber. Can I say to the member for Fowler that more recently, when a delegation from this place attended Vietnam for the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum, the issue was debated rigorously there by our Asian neighbours. It was only just at that stage that I got a sense of the magnitude of the issue that's before us. Without being coy or disrespectful, I would suggest that if I were to walk up the main street of most of the small regional communities in my electorate and ask them to give me an overview of what's going on with the Rohingyan community, they would be blind to the atrocities that the member for Fowler shared with the House so eloquently. So on behalf of the government I want to stand and acknowledge the contribution that he has made in raising this as an issue in the House.


It is an issue that I do not profess to be a specialist in. Rather, I would speak openly to suggest that there would be very few in this place who would not have compassion, as Australians, for that community being persecuted. From a more affirmative perspective, the Bangladeshi community—a poor community within its own capacity— are doing an amazing job to be housing these people on their border. It can bring a sense of embarrassment to a country full of riches.


In closing, I'd just like to acknowledge the member for Fowler for bringing this to the attention of the House.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (16:58):  I, too, rise to support the motion moved by the member for Fowler, which really discusses an issue that we should be discussing in this place. Some would describe it as the genocide of a people.


This motion notes, with appropriate and grave concern, evidence from Human Rights Watch about a series of brutal crackdowns carried out by security forces against ethnic Rohingya Muslims, including, as has been mentioned: extrajudicial killing; the torture and suffering of Rohingya men, women and children; the forced displacement of more than 688,000 Rohingyan Muslims into Bangladesh; the destruction, arson and takeover of more than 300 villages by the Myanmar military; and endemic rape and sexual violence.


The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority in Myanmar. Myanmar was home to an estimated 1.3 million Rohingya Muslims. There has been a long history of persecution of the Rohingya population, including the denial of citizenship under a 1982 citizenship law and the denial of the most basic government services. According to Human Rights Watch, the current military government denies that the Rohingya are an ethnic group and claims that Muslims in Arakan Province are Bengalis whose arrival is fairly recent. It takes the view that the migration that took place during the period of British colonial rule was illegal, and it is on this basis that it refuses citizenship to the majority of the Rohingya. In reality, the Rohingya have had a well-established presence in what is now Burma since at least the 12th century. Rohingya political leaders claim that the Rohingya are an ethnically distinct group, descendants of the first Muslims who began migrating to northern Arakan in the eighth century. The United Nations and Human Rights Watch have described the situation in the Rakhine state, over recent years—and I would endorse this—as a 'textbook example of ethnic cleansing', which has led to thousands of Rohingya Muslims having to flee as refugees. 


One of the things that I note—and I think the member for Wright was talking about this in relation to people in his part of the world—is that quite a substantial population of the Muslim faith live in my constituency. When I ask them about issues that concern them, the persecution of these people without the world taking action is something that disturbs them greatly. It is hard to describe, just as we struggled to describe the massacres in Africa, particularly in Rwanda. 


One of the things that always concerns me—and I support this motion wholeheartedly—is that a concept was advocated by my very distinguished predecessor, Gareth Evans, when he was foreign affairs minister and afterwards, which is the concept that was used in Libya of the right to protect a civilian population of a country when genocide is being committed against its own people. That was invoked as part of the reason for taking military action in Libya, which then led to the overthrow of Gaddafi. My question is—and I would put this question to the same situation in Syria, when its ethnic population of 300,000 people were killed by their own government—why is the international community watching large-scale ethnic cleansing in Asia? It is unacceptable to me that this action is being taken while the world watches on, virtually powerless. We should call what is occurring in that place what it is: genocide. It is genocide in a country which is not far away from us and with which we have historic connections. Thus, as international citizens, as a middle power, we have an obligation to take action. 


My view is—and I put this forward not as a Labor Party policy but as an individual watching this genocide, with a growing sense of horror and dismay—that there should be some United Nations action invoked under the right to protect that population, because that is not occurring. I would urge the government, in a respectful way, in a bipartisan way, to take that action. It would show real leadership, which we should be showing in this region. We can't allow this sort of inhumanity to continue, particularly in this region but anywhere in the world. So, in supporting the member's motion, I would urge the government to take action under the provisions of the right to protect, to advocate for that, so that these people can no longer be wiped from the face of the planet, as they are now.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (17:03):  I commend the member for Fowler for bringing this motion forward, and the members for Hotham and Holt for speaking on it and also, in anticipation, the member for Cowan. But I particularly commend the member for Wright, who I think we'd all agree has a big heart and great compassion. I commend him for supporting this motion—without trying to curry favour of the chair, of course, Deputy Speaker. 


This is a serious matter, as we know. The world has watched in horror as nearly 700,000 Rohingyas have fled their persecutors in the northern Rakhine province of Myanmar over the last nine months or more. Nearly 700,000 refugees have sought a safe haven across the Bangladeshi border in Cox's Bazar, a community that was already under stress before they arrived exhausted and traumatised. More than half of the Rohingya refugees are women and children. Hundreds of children have been separated from their families and are particularly vulnerable. The suffering we are witnessing is on a catastrophic scale. It's the fastest-growing refugee crisis in the world. 


The Rohingyas are an ethnic minority in Myanmar. The United Nations has described the military offences in Rakhine as a 'textbook example of ethnic cleansing'. The Rohingya refugees have reported house-by-house killings, women and children being raped, homes and villages burnt to the ground. To say that Cox's Bazar is overcrowded is an understatement—almost 100,000 refugees have been treated for malnutrition. They are in desperate need of food, shelter, health care and water. This is a humanitarian crisis on a grand scale. 


Many people in my electorate of Moreton are concerned about the Rohingya people. In fact, last year I met with members of the Bangladeshi community who live in my electorate of Moreton and also the neighbouring electorate of Rankin: Adjunct Professor Adil Khan, Professor Reza Monem, Mr Azharul Karim, Dr Asad Khan, Adjunct Professor Iyanatul  Islam and Dr Mazhar Hague, to name a few who were present. They presented me with a petition calling on this House to do all it can to persuade the Myanmar government: to establish a UN led or independent investigation into these allegations of genocide and human rights violations, to immediately stop the genocide and killing of innocent people, and to ensure that the rights of the Rohingya minority are respected. The atrocities committed against the Rohingya community in Rakhine state are almost beyond comprehension. These human rights abuses are unforgivable, and I hope that the perpetrators are brought to account. It may take time, but we should be relentless in pursuing those responsible for the atrocities. 


Sadly, these refugees, having fled extreme violence, are now highly vulnerable to a new danger: disease from a lack of basic services in the camps. They are reliant on humanitarian assistance, and it is crucial that there is unimpeded humanitarian access to the camps in Bangladesh and that regional partners, including Australia, work together in response to this crisis to ensure that the Rohingya population has a safe and secure place to live in peace. 


Labor has made formal representations to the Prime Minister and the foreign minister to do everything in the Turnbull government's power to respond to this escalating humanitarian crisis that is taking place in our backyard. We must speak up to set an example to the rest—not only to ASEAN countries, but to those in our backyard. So I make this request again to the Turnbull government to turn their gaze to the Rohingya crisis.

"Aly, Anne, MP",ALP,2018-05-21,"



Dr ALY
 (Cowan) (17:07):  I also rise to thank the member for Fowler for moving this motion today, but also to acknowledge the speakers on both sides who have spoken before me on this motion. Last week, my husband and I watched the Dateline special that exposed what is happening among the Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state. Being in this place, you do have a sense of it—being on some of the committees in which we received briefings about what is going on there—but I have to say that the images we saw on the television that night were really unexpected and, actually, quite harrowing. They showed the extent and the magnitude of the situation—the killings, the rapes and the arson. It is a situation that can only be described as systemic genocide. 


The member for Wright gave such a heartfelt speech just a few minutes ago, and said that most Australians wouldn't know about what's going on in Myanmar. I would have to agree with that. I think the Rohingya are at risk of being the forgotten people in our region, the people who we don't talk about, the people who are unseen, the people who are being persecuted and the people who are suffering from a genocide against them, but the people who the world has turned a blind eye to. Human rights organisations and the media are denied access to accurately report on the situation and what is going on there. There is denial of the atrocities by the Myanmar leadership, and this is particularly disheartening considering the history of Myanmar and the fight for human rights and democracy by the leadership there. 


On ending this, I should also make a point on how social media has been used by the state of Myanmar to distribute propaganda against the Rohingya in the Rakhine state. This is something that has been brought up by several media outlets. It stands as a stark warning to all of us that we need to look beyond propaganda and see the humanity in each other—it doesn't matter where you come from, what religion you are or what ethnicity you are.


I hope that today's motion, and the number of members who have spoken on this motion, will go some way to giving some kind of reassurance to people in Rakhine state that we are listening. We are here, we are listening, we see you and we will continue to speak on your behalf to make sure that the military and government of Myanmar are held accountable for what the people are going through.
