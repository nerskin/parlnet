"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the latest in our series of omnibus reports—Report 20: Two treaties tabled on 26 May 1998, the Bougainville peace monitoring group protocol and treaties tabled on 11 November 1998 .
Ordered that the report be printed.
—In all, this report considers eight treaties covering a wide range of subjects, including the destruction of antipersonnel landmines, the Bougainville peace monitoring group and economic cooperation with Indonesia. In each case the committee has concluded that it is in Australia's national interest to ratify the proposed treaties. In the time available to me, I will comment briefly on the major elements of this report.
The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is strongly supportive of the Convention on the Prohibition and Destruction of Antipersonnel Mines. This convention is a historic step towards the aim of a total global ban on antipersonnel landmines. The Australian government's commitment to the convention is to be applauded, as is the passage by this parliament of the Antipersonnel Mines Convention Act 1998, which implements in Australian law the obligations imposed by the convention.
Our report makes two recommendations aimed at continuing the momentum towards a global ban on antipersonnel landmines. Firstly, we recommend that the Minister for Defence formulate principles to guide the retention of mines for defence training purposes so as to clarify the process and the time frame for the destruction of those mines not required for training purposes. Secondly, we recommend that in the appropriate international fora the Australian government put a strong 
 position against the development of replacement weapons technologies which have indiscriminate and inhumane effects similar to those possessed by antipersonnel landmines.
The committee also strongly supports the Bougainville peace monitoring protocol. Australia has played a significant role in the Bougainville peace process by facilitating truce and cease-fire discussions between the warring parties, by contributing around 250 civilian and unarmed Defence Force personnel to the work of the peace monitoring group, and by sponsoring a substantial and growing aid program to Bougainville.
Given the scale and the nature of the devastation caused by the conflict on the island, there is much work to be done to restore even the most basic community services to those living on Bougainville. Australia's aid program will continue to play a crucial role in re-establishing services and infrastructure, in building new systems of administration and in restoring a functioning economy.
The third major treaty considered in report No. 20 is the development cooperation agreement with Indonesia. This agreement is intended to provide a generic legal framework for Australia's aid program with Indonesia. It is a useful document which will simplify the project development processes for both governments and for the non-government organisations—that is, the NGOs—which are commissioned from time to time to run aid projects in Indonesia. The agreement is important not only because of what it provides but also because it signals that, at a time of great social, political and economic upheaval in Indonesia, Australia is committed to building structures there to support a continuing and a cooperative relationship with our largest and nearest neighbour.
Finally, I would like to refer to the proposed amendment to the health services agreement with the United Kingdom. While we support the amendment and acknowledge that reciprocal medical treatment agreements are of considerable benefit to Australians travelling overseas, we are concerned about the adequacy of the costing information upon which such agreements are based. In this, as 
 in some previous cases, we were not provided with sufficient information to assess whether both parties to the agreement would be exposed to particular costs. I know my colleague the member for Macquarie took this up at the hearings.
We have recommended that, when negotiating such agreements in future, the Department of Health and Aged Care undertake a more rigorous assessment of the likely costs to both parties of any such agreements, this one in particular. In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who contributed to our reviews. These contributions are important, and they help to promote greater transparency in the treaty making process. I commend the report to the House.

"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—Australian workers have found themselves under attack from two sources in recent years. The principal source of that attack comes 
 from this government's legislation: legislation that seeks to deny them the right to collective bargaining and collective representation; legislation which, in the few weeks of sitting since the last election, has seen attempts to deny some 2½ million workers access to unfair dismissal laws; legislation that seeks to remove superannuation from those matters able to be dealt with by the industrial commission; and, of course, legislation on junior rates of pay which seeks to override an industrial commission hearing being conducted at this time by virtue of an act of this parliament.
The second major source of concern for Australian workers is the practice we saw during the waterfront dispute with the Patrick company—and with some others—whereby companies go into insolvency and cease to have money to pay their employees, but in fact the people associated with the companies and who control the financial interests of those companies indeed do have the wherewithal to meet the obligations to workers. But, rather than meet those obligations, they use a system of legal contrivances to establish other shelf companies and avoid their obligations.
The  Employment Security Bill 1999 , which I present to the parliament today, is aimed squarely at that problem. It is aimed at ensuring that workers' entitlements to pay, to accumulated leave and to other financial entitlements are actually provided to them notwithstanding the legal contrivances that some employers are willing to go to. I hasten to add that this is a small problem in terms of the number of employers who engage in this sort of activity, but we saw a very high profile example of this very thing with the Patrick stevedoring firm in a process and a campaign that was certainly aided and supported by this government.
The workers in that situation believed themselves to be employed by the same employer. They believed themselves to be employed by a company that had contracts to provide stevedoring services. It was only when the matter was unravelled in the courts that they and the rest of the Australian public discovered that the Patrick company had 
 established shelf companies and had shifted the employment of those people to those shelf companies, and those workers found themselves employed by shelf companies that had no capacity to pay their wages and accrued leave entitlements.
This sort of contrivance, this artificial arrangement, entered into expressly to avoid obligations to employees has no place in the decent and proper management of industrial relations in this country. Regrettably, the current law allows it to occur. The bill I present to the parliament today will ensure that, in those circumstances in which an associated company is able to meet the obligations of its bankrupt affiliate, it does so and that the workers' entitlements to wages are met.
Obviously not every company that goes into liquidation participates in these sorts of contrivances. There are many enterprises led by good people who, for one reason or another, find themselves on hard times and unable to continue. But we have seen a spate of cases where companies have gone into receivership owing very substantial sums of money to Australian workers, and I want to mention a couple of those.
At the Woodlawn mine, 160 workers lost $6 million in entitlements. At the Grafton meatworks, 250 workers lost $3 million. In Rockhampton and Yeppoon, 157 hospital workers lost $1.4 million. In Sizzler restaurants, 2,000 workers lost $2 million in entitlements. Of course, we had workers from Cobar coming here and 270 of them lost some $6 million in entitlements. We as a parliament have a responsibility to ensure that workers' entitlements are honoured and that artificial contrivances of business people in cahoots with smart lawyers and accountants do not deprive them of those rights.
This bill will fulfil that role. I commend it to the House. It is a pity that a bill of a similar form was not debated by this parliament, although it was moved by my colleague Mr McMullan in the last parliament. I urge the government to accept this bill and bring on a debate. (Time expired)

"Barresi, Phil, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—I move:
That the House:
(1)	 continues to support the staging of the Sydney Olympics as an opportunity to showcase Australia, its people, culture and above all our sporting traditions;
(2)	 acknowledges the commitment, work and performance of Australia's athletes and sporting organisations as they prepare to participate in the 2000 Olympics;
(3)	 deplores the disrepute caused to the Olympic ideals by the continuing bribery allegations;
(4)	 notes the concerns expressed by the local and international community at the loss of integrity in the Olympic movement and its possible effect on the successful staging of Australia's 2000 Games; and
(5)	 requests that SOCOG calls on the IOC to fund any shortfall in sponsorship finances which may result from inappropriate action by IOC members.
As a lover of sports, I am very enthusiastic about the Sydney Games. As a Victorian, I am pleased that Melbourne's groundwork paid off for the Sydney bid, ensuring it will truly be Australia's games. The Deakin electorate is home to many fine athletes who have had Olympic aspirations since childhood—Anna Wilson, Lauren Hewitt, Kyle van der Kuyp and Cathy Freeman, to name but a few. It is unfortunate that the current furore should detract from the preparation for the games and more a tragedy should it interfere with the preparation of our athletes. How ironic it is that the future of the Olympic movement has been put at risk by those who directly control the legacy of Baron Pierre de Coubertin.
Sports management theory will show that this is another example of an amateur sports 
 body evolving into a commercial entity with all the competing values associated with such a transition. Although the games organising committees are now set up along corporate lines, the games they play to accommodate the Olympic family are not. The genesis of this can be traced track to the LA Games of 1984. The games broke with tradition by turning a profit. President Samaranch begged the USOC for a healthy slice of those profits and appointed the corrupt American Bob Helmick to the club to ensure he got them. Since then, the Olympic motto of Citius Altius Fortius has applied not only to the competing athletes, but also to a growing number of IOC members who have taken bribes and other inducements while travelling the world in lavish style.
As the IOC answers to no-one, this cancerous behaviour has gone unchecked. The damage caused to the Olympic movement can only be repaired by changing the culture of the IOC. The IOC has now banned delegate visits to bidding cities altogether, which seems just as futile as sending over 100 of its members on grand tours.
While the games have changed significantly, the IOC has not. It still refers to itself as the `supreme authority of the Olympic movement'. Delegates represent the interests not of individual nations or their Olympic organisations but of the IOC itself. Until that situation is reversed, reforms are mere window-dressing. A possible revamped structure can be found in the existing IOC charter—that is, in the recognition of the world's six regional Olympic associations. These associations would emerge as important regional representatives of the national Olympic committees in their region.
The sporting world demands full transparency from the guardians of the flame. Until recently it was impossible to get an accurate picture of its financial performance. A veil of secrecy surrounded the detail. We can be sure the coffers are not empty. Revenue from television broadcast rights of the summer games alone grew ninefold from $US100 million in 1976 to around $US900 million in 1996. 
Sydney is entrusted with continuing the recent expectation of a successful and financially viable games. However, the selling of sponsorships to ensure that the Olympic caravan does not leave a trail of debt has slowed in its momentum. Recent reports indicate that SOCOG is about $90 million short of its corporate sponsorship target. This is clearly due to the actions of some IOC delegates and the loss of credibility of the organisation, from the President down.
When Sydney bid to host the games, they expected that they would provide a fillip for sport and tourism. The games were a valued asset. But there is now the real danger that Sydney has bought damaged goods and, in one way or another, the Australian public may have to foot the bill for years to come.
In that light SOCOG should call on the IOC to fund any shortfalls in finances caused by the revelations of the corruption and greed of Samaranch's team. Remember, the Olympic charter states, `All profits derived from the celebration of the Olympic Games shall be applied to the development of the Olympic movement and of sport.' The IOC will certainly make a healthy profit from the Sydney 2000 Games. Therefore, by making good any losses suffered by Sydney it would truly live out its charter. In the spirit of Olympism, they could fund a shortfall or even guarantee a minimum surplus. In this way the IOC could ensure that our athletes and sporting organisations will not suffer post-Olympics from any adverse financial consequences of hosting the games.
The IOC, by breaching their own ideals, have threatened the future of the Olympic movement, of which they are the trustees. It is only the public's insatiable desire for a universal sporting competition that keeps the Olympic movement alive. (Time expired)

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I rise today to give in-principle support to paragraphs 1 to 4 of this motion. I have some reservations about paragraph 5. I will first 
 deal with the early sections of the motion, after which I will seek to highlight the problems with paragraph 5 of the motion. Paragraph 1 calls on the House to make a statement of its continuing support for the staging of the Sydney Olympics:
. . . as an opportunity to showcase Australia, its people, culture and . . . our sporting traditions;
There seems little doubt that there remains strong bipartisan support for the Sydney Olympics within this place. Further, the success of the recent opening of Stadium Australia—one of the major venues for the games—would indicate that many Australian people share that support.
With the expected influx of overseas visitors and international television exposure, the Olympics will provide the opportunity to showcase our nation and its people. It will also place Australia on the international stage and open to criticism on our ability to handle matters of internal affairs. It is a shame that the government appears intent on tarnishing the image that Australia will present to the international community.
We will be judged by more than just the games. Attacks on the rights of organised labour, the emasculation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the victimisation of our young unemployed are just a few examples—as is the Prime Minister's reluctance to acknowledge our indigenous Australians' custodianship of this land, not to mention his inability to offer the Australian people a serious proposal for a new preamble to our Constitution that could inspire us to be proud of our national identity. At the same time, the Prime Minister demands to perform the official opening of the 2000 Olympic Games.
—I am glad the honourable member has got back to the games.
—I have never left it, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is a role historically reserved for the host country's head of state. In our present situation, that would be the Queen of England. So could our real head of state please stand up?
The second paragraph states our acknowledgment of the `commitment, work and performance' of our `athletes and sporting organisations'. As a nation, we have always respected and held in high regard the efforts and achievements of our sportspeople, not only in relation to the Olympics but in a wide range of sporting events—local, national and international. What we need to remember, however, is that today's sporting heroes were yesterday's junior players. Without adequate funding to support the development of junior sports through the provision of high standard venues and equipment, accredited coaches and officials and access to quality competition our young people will not have the opportunity to develop to the elite stance required to continue to excel in high level competitions.
The next two paragraphs of the motion deplore `the disrepute caused' to the Olympics by the bribery allegations and `notes the concerns expressed . . . at the loss of integrity in the Olympic movement and its possible effect on the successful staging of Australia's 2000 Games'. It is truly unfortunate that the International Olympic Committee's structure and bidding process has failed to keep pace with the publicly expected standards of probity. We can only hope that the IOC will retain its commitment to move forward to address these problems in a full and open fashion. The spin-off effects of the original bribery allegations have tarnished the whole Olympic movement, not just our games in 2000. The efficacy of the win of every past host city, and those that will host the games after 2000 as well as every bidding city, has now been put in doubt. I believe that we can overcome the effects of the current controversies and go on to host the most successful games of this millennium. What we need to do now is focus on that task. We can deplore the fact that these issues arose, but if they lead to progressive and overdue reform of the IOC it will have produced a beneficial outcome that may see a revitalisation of the Olympics as a whole. Similarly, we can note the concerns expressed about possible ramifications flowing from these problems. We do need to pay heed to the views of others. However, we should not accept such as a fait accompli. The task of making the games a 
 success, both as an event and financially, may be harder because of the recent controversy, but we need to focus on recovering that ground—not looking for someone else to blame.
This brings me to the last paragraph of the motion that `requests that SOCOG calls on the IOC to fund any shortfall in sponsorship finances which may result from inappropriate action by IOC members'. This section of the motion is largely a feelgood, blame others statement. I wonder why SOCOG should be the one left to make such an impractical and unlikely call on the IOC? If the mover of this motion believes this should be done, then why not request the Howard government to make this call?  It would be very difficult to establish in a clear fashion what, if any, losses were the results of `inappropriate action' alleged `by IOC members'. The contracts surrounding the organisation and operation of the games in Sydney provide (1) that the responsibility to build the venues and to meet all costs associated with the games rests with the taxpayers; (2) that approximately $160 million be provided to the Australian Olympic Committee to maintain assistance to Australian athletes; and (3) that the IOC has the right to negotiate major international sponsorship agreements and to keep one-third of the revenue from such sponsorships, 40 per cent of all television revenue and five per cent of all marketing contracts negotiated by SOCOG.

"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—Beneath the rhetoric, this motion is really about a flourishing civil culture of games and sport in Australia—I say `civil' as opposed to `public' or `government administered'—and about the government's role in sport which, in the long term, is questionable. We should take the opportunity to examine why government is involved at all in sport and we should ask ourselves what the effect is of that involvement in sport, especially at a local level.
For some very solid background on this topic, I recommend an essay by Barry Maley, a Sydney scholar at the Centre for Independent Studies which was published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 21 August 1990. 
 Maley points out that the essence of games is voluntary submission to a set of rules by the participants. He points out that there is an irony in that we Australians are often said to be very contemptuous of authority, to be natural rebels, and yet we obviously love games. Every weekend, we see in our electorates many thousands of people submitting themselves voluntarily to those rules.
He goes on to postulate that a society with an elaborate and sophisticated culture of games is much more likely to be politically sophisticated and, therefore, suffused with greater liberty. I believe he is right in saying so. While I served as Minister for Sport and Tourism I felt that, in the long term, there was something of a contradiction in Australian government policy about sports. Government on both sides in the past have sought a deep involvement in sport. We fund elite athletes to the tune of many millions of dollars and we tax Australian families very heavily to pay for that. We fund the sports federations and, in doing so, we relieve them of the necessity, to that extent, of raising any money themselves. I do not think this sort of sports policy is sustainable in the long term, because it really seeks to foster outcomes that are at best meaningless—unless you regard the modern entertainment media as important in our citizens' lives—and at worst sometimes dangerous. We can see now that elite sport really must be divorced from so-called national prestige. That its biggest problem is drug taking should tell us that it is in very deep trouble.
Sport and games, if they flourish locally, especially in schools, work to create social capital. They motivate parents and local businesses to give money to local sports clubs to improve their local community, yet heavy taxes and unnecessary government spending may actually harm this healthy habit. So you could say that, in financing elite sport for so-called national prestige, the government is actually working to inhibit a valuable thing in Australia—that is, the cultivation and growth of social capital locally. The Olympic movement was never really a force for good. These days, of course, it has harnessed government to its selfish and preposterous pseudo-political 
 ends and, in that sense, it works to leach money out of families and out of local businesses.
—Order! The member for Leichhardt will not pass between the speaker and the chair.
—This works to inflict damage on our great Australian games culture and, worse still, it also infects the weak-minded among us with the notion that the government can do it all for us, that we can get away with a little less effort. To me, the antithesis of the Australian sporting ethic is that we can get away with less effort because the government can do it for us. So I say that, in the long term, the government should leave sport well alone.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Sydney Olympic Games</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I am pleased to speak to this motion. It is appropriate that we are discussing the Olympics hosted by Sydney under the auspices of the Carr Labor government two days after its re-election in what was a rout of the opposition. We are indeed on track. The Sydney 2000 Olympics and Paralympic Games will have a very positive effect. KPMG has estimated that there will be $7.3 billion in additional economic benefits, that there will be an increase in employment of more than 150,000 jobs, and more than $1.9 billion will be collected in Commonwealth taxes.
Olympic planning under Labor is on track. All construction is on time and on budget. When Labor came to government in New South Wales in 1995, it inherited a situation in which the construction of not one new facility had been started by the Liberals in the 18 months following the bid's success. Olympic planning was a shambles presided over by four different ministers and five different government departments. No master plan had been developed for the Homebush site.
In contrast, Labor has built the world's largest Olympic stadium in which functions are already being held successfully. All facilities for the games will be completed by September this year, a full year before the start of the Games. SOCOG has made great progress: in particular it has already raised more revenue than has ever been raised by an Olympic committee before. It has successfully 
 released a ticketing policy, a launch for volunteers who will work on the games, the route of the torch relay and the torch bearer selection process. It has also successfully conducted a number of sporting test events.
Sydney's Olympic organisers are not being distracted by the IOC turmoil, which is why I want to particularly talk about section (5) of this motion which I believe is not appropriate. There is no serious indication that sponsors' revenue is in danger. Further, under the Olympic host city contract, SOCOG has no legal powers to ask the IOC for more money. Both expenditure and revenue to run the games are determined by the host city Sydney, not by the IOC. The fact is that SOCOG could still stage a games of which all Australians could be very proud on a budget of around $2.1 billion. If SOCOG does not raise one more cent, it has still raised the $2.1 billion to be fully funded. In response to the honourable member opposite who moved this motion, I do not believe that section (5) is appropriate. It is appropriate that we talk about how positive the developments have been. Two days ago we saw in part a vote for the Carr Labor government because the people of New South Wales are very proud about how efficiently the government is running the Olympics planning process.
I was surprised that the member for Cook is not listed to speak on this motion, given the role he played in the Olympics bid process. Perhaps he is out commiserating with the former member for Miranda, who has joined the unemployment queue as a result of the general view which people in New South Wales have that it is only New South Wales Labor which is competent enough to stage something such as the Olympic Games. This is one of the reasons why they rejected the incompetent rabble that is represented, for the moment, by the New South Wales Liberals under Kerry Chikarovski.
I commend all those who are doing work in New South Wales—the Premier, Bob Carr, the Olympics minister, Michael Knight, and all those associated with the planning, including the SOCOG committee. I think it is very important that in the next 18 months this federal government and the federal parliament 
 play a very supportive role for what will be an event which will give great credit to all Australians. We can all be very proud of the Olympics. They will be a sense of great pride overseas for ex-pat Australians. Even more importantly, it will raise and enhance the reputation of Australia as a nation that has the ability to hold the millennium games in a way which will make them the best games ever held.

"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,1999-03-29,"—It is a great pleasure that I speak in this debate on the motion moved by the honourable member for Deakin about the Olympic Games in Sydney. It is even more gratifying to speak in this debate on a motion moved by someone who represents an outer Melbourne seat. We do know the competition that exists between Sydney and Melbourne from time to time.
I served in the Greiner and Fahey cabinets. I am well aware of what went on in the bid for Sydney to gain the Olympics for 2000. Gaining the Olympics was a very concerted and well-planned operation. I am also well aware of subjects that have been raised by the honourable member for Cook in this House. The honourable member for Cook, who was the minister presiding over the Olympic bid at that time, did report back to cabinet on certain issues that concerned him and that cabinet deliberated on whether in fact they would agree to or not. The New South Wales cabinet at that time was very scrupulous in what we might do. We knew what China was doing in Africa in relation to building roads. Here was a country that could not look after its own people and it was out there making all sorts of contributions to African nations in trying to gain the Olympic Games. As the honourable member for Cook said, the biggest surprise that we in the Fahey cabinet received on that night was the fact that `Sydney' was called out because the IOC President at the time had never seen Beijing spelt that way before.
We understood clearly the responsibility of the government to ensure that the Olympics were staged successfully and profitably. We drew on the experience from Queensland that had successfully held a Commonwealth Games and an Expo, and its Premier of the 
 day, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, whom the Labor Party often likes to berate, was very careful in the way that the infrastructure costs were contained. One of the greatest problems we have in New South Wales at the present time is that the infrastructure costs have not been contained. There has been a blow-out of some $1 billion and the taxpayers of New South Wales will be paying for this for years to come.
As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, the country is already feeling it. There have been cutbacks by the Carr government in funds to country areas which are obviously being funnelled towards the Olympic Games in Sydney. Country New South Wales is not very impressed with that and not very impressed with the management of the construction operations in Sydney. The honourable member for Grayndler looks at these things through rose-tinted glasses at the present time. I dare say that is a little better than being red tinted, which they usually are.
The fact is that there was work done before the Labor Party took over. He must forget that the Olympic pool was almost completed by the time the Labor Party won government in New South Wales. He would also be aware that the Homebush Bay site was a site that had to be cleaned quite considerably of contamination from previous industrial efforts at that site. There was a lot of planning and a lot of work that went into getting the substance of the games ready to proceed. As I said, the coalition cabinet also had in place plans to contain the costs, which are so important in this matter.
If you want to look at Labor Party management, just look at Darling Harbour. Just have a look at the construction of this Parliament House. It started off as an estimate of something like $250,000 to $300,000 and finished up at $1.2 billion. That is management under Labor. Darling Harbour was the same. I would like to see the member for Kingsford-Smith come in here—he was the minister responsible at the time. If you want me to go through Labor Party management, I will do it. We have plenty of states to go through and plenty of federal governments to go through 
 if you want to talk about Labor Party management.
The honourable member for Deakin would be interested to know that when the Greiner government first won government in New South Wales the Victorian debt at the time stood at $32 billion. By the time Joan Kirner was kicked out, it was $40 billion. That is obviously the way the Labor Party manages any of its states and any of its obligations. The same thing is happening with the Olympic Games in Sydney. Who is going to pay? The taxpayers of New South Wales and country New South Wales.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—Like millions of Australians, I was wonderfully excited about the news several years ago that Sydney had won the right to host the Olympic Games in the year 2000. When I first saw this motion put together by government members, I approached it with some trepidation. In general, the tone of it is a negative tone. It is a tone which seeks to denigrate some aspects of the games. My concerns have just been confirmed by the three speakers opposite who have exhibited a miserable approach to the Sydney Olympics to see if they can denigrate and drag down the Sydney Olympics.
We here are excited. We think it is wonderful that the Sydney Olympics are proceeding. I do call on the government to call these people into line so we can celebrate the Sydney Olympics in a spirit of true bipartisanship and as Australians. Maybe I can bring some extra dignity and enthusiasm to the debate by quoting someone about the Olympic Games. He said:
There is nothing in the world like being in the Olympic City during a Games. The brew is one of excitement, anxiety, colour and athletic endeavour that, when taken in deep draughts by any youngster with natural ability, saturates the brain with aspirations that can lead to all sorts of juvenile resolutions. How lucky I was that my mother and father in 1956 took me from Perth to Melbourne for the first time and put me in contact with all this.
Those words were spoken by Herb Elliott, Australia's gold medallist in the 1,500 metres at the Rome Olympic Games. He was one of the world's greatest middle-distance runners 
 of all time. In fact, he was never beaten over a mile or 1,500 metres.
SOCOG has announced its ticketing policy. Five million tickets will be available for sale to the Australian public when tickets go on sale in mid-1999. All Australians are getting an opportunity to be involved in the Olympics and to see the Olympics. Further than that, SOCOG will set aside 1½ million tickets priced between $10 and $19 to enable children and the financially disadvantaged to see Olympic Games events.
What of the impact and the economic benefits, if you like, of the Sydney Olympics? According to the latest estimates of the Tourism Forecasting Council, 1½ million additional international tourists are projected to visit Australia from the mid-1990s to 2005-06 because of the Olympics related exposure. I can point out that half of those tourist visitors are expected to also travel to my state of Queensland. These tourists are estimated to generate an additional $2.7 billion in tourism exports for Australia. Over a 12-year gain period, the Sydney 2000 Games are projected to contribute an additional $6½ billion to Australia's gross domestic product.
Let us look at some of the benefits in the local area. I used to live in Lidcombe, not very far from Homebush Bay. The 760-hectare site of Homebush Bay had been marred for decades by serious environmental damage after years of landfilling and waste dumping activities. Parts of the site have been used variously as naval armaments depots, the New South Wales government abattoir, the state brickworks and as a dumping ground for much of Sydney's household and industrial waste. It is now going to be one of the greatest sporting precincts in the world.
A couple of weeks ago we saw the success of the first operational event at the Olympic stadium which attracted 104,000 people. In addition, we are going to get a superb new site for the Royal Easter Show. As a result of the Sydney Olympics, we are going to see the creation of a major metropolitan park of 400 hectares which will be larger than the city's biggest existing parks, Centennial and Moore parks. 
Let us look ahead with generosity of spirit in approaching this issue of the Sydney Olympics. Let us not, as government members seem intent on doing, clutch defeat out of the jaws of victory. Let us support SOCOG. Let us support people like Sandy Hollway, Simon Balderstone and John Bowan, who are former colleagues of mine. I pay tribute to SOCOG and to its professionalism. Certainly, with the re-election of the Carr government and with Olympics minister Knight, it leaves this great task of organising and hosting the Sydney Olympics in good, safe hands.

"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I was very pleased to receive a letter last week from Mr Stephen Hains, the City Manager of the City of Salisbury, on the ongoing vexed question of the Wingfield dump.
The Salisbury Council has an interest in the management of the Wingfield landfill site due to its strong interest in maintaining the health of the Barker Inlet and the North Arm Creek estuaries. The council pointed out to me the sensitivity of these environments, highlighted recently by the significant dieback of mangroves north of the site. Whilst not proven, this would appear to have occurred as a consequence of excessive acidification of soils in that area, attributable to the landfill site at Wingfield.
The Salisbury Council's examination of documents prepared by the City of Adelaide, the EPA and the City of Port Adelaide Enfield, reveal that potential movement of acidic water emanating from naturally occurring peat soils both within the tip site and on its boundary and the translocation of pore water to the mangroves due to horizontal pressure from an increased tip height have not been addressed. Surprise, surprise!
In addition to the above, Mr Hains points out that the control of litter from the Wing 
 field tip has been an ongoing problem, and significant quantities of plastics, paper and contaminants have been blown from the tip into the North Arm Creek despite the efforts of the Adelaide City Council to recover this litter. He also points out that an increase in the height of the tip is perceived to expose the landfill to increased wind velocities thereby exacerbating the problems currently experienced. That puts a different slant on the Wingfield dump and to claims by the Adelaide City Council of no odour, no dust, no litter off site and that satisfactory environmental safeguards are in place.
On behalf of my constituents, I thank Mr Hains and the Salisbury Council for the above information and for their opposition to an increase in the height of the Wingfield tip.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Wingfield Landfill</title>,Statements by Members,3,1,speech

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—He is so unpredictable, isn't he! He is so unpredictable one would never have dreamt for a moment that I would have got that question. It has got me totally unprepared! The Leader of the Opposition asked me whether we are going to change our policy on the sale of Telstra. The answer is a resounding no. We are not going to change our policy. The reason we are not going to change our policy is that we took it to the Australian people last October and they voted for it. By the same token, we are not going to change our policy on reforming the Australian taxation system, because we took that policy to the Australian people last October and they voted for it as well.
So far as the New South Wales electorate is concerned, I will rest my case on the words of Mr Bob Carr when he said that it was fought overwhelmingly on state issues. I would make the observation that you would have to have a very, very selective piece of electoral amnesia to imagine that the Leader of the Opposition in the federal Labor Party could draw any comfort at all from the result on Saturday. They had their opportunity in New South Wales.
Let me refer to this parliament. The last time there was a federal contest in New South Wales my colleague the Minister for Sport 
 and Tourism was resoundingly returned. The honourable member for Robertson, Mr Lloyd, was resoundingly returned. The honourable member for Hughes, Danna Vale, was resoundingly returned. The honourable member for Parramatta, Ross Cameron, was resoundingly returned. The honourable member for Macquarie, Kerry Bartlett, was resoundingly returned. There are so many of them I have forgotten all the names. I am very happy that the last time the Leader of the Opposition and I went head to head in New South Wales he got done like a dinner.

—My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. It is a matter of international interest and very timely, too, I might add. I refer the minister to the United States International Trade Commission's reported recommendation to impose substantial tariffs on Australian lamb imports to the United States. Would the minister inform the House and the many lamb producers in my electorate of Wannon what action the government is taking to protect this $100 million export trade?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Lamb Exports</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Fischer, Tim, MP",NP,1999-03-29,"—This is a very important issue which would have the interest of members on both sides of the House. I join with you, Mr Speaker, in welcoming the US delegation, including congressman Bill Archer and Carol Crawford, who is one of the members of the US International Trade Commission who signed on the recommendation of three out of six with regard to prime lamb. This is a very critical issue and the federal government is standing up for the Australian prime lamb industry at every stage.
I sent Ambassador Andrew Peacock in to present directly at the hearings of the commission which took place in Washington a few weeks ago. He presented evidence, along with Jim Bolger, the former New Zealand Prime Minister, as to why our prime lamb exports are not the cause of the difficulties being faced by the US producers.
We have gone about developing a market and providing close liaison with supermarket chains and US consumers organisations to produce and fine tune a product which has won a lot of acceptance across the United States in an area which is not traditionally a big market for lamb product.
We have done that and have now built a $100 million market—and I thank the member for Wannon for his interest. About 10 per cent of the total production of Australian 
 prime lamb is now flowing through to the United States under free fair trade. It is unsubsidised product out of Australia which we are marketing and exporting successfully to the United States. So full marks to the Australian prime lamb industry in opening up this market. What has now happened is that the US International Trade Commission has made a recommendation to the Clinton administration, which has 60 days to respond to that recommendation.
The Australian government is very concerned about the recommendations in respect of tariffs and quotas on Australian lamb and some other elements of the recommendations which would mark a very severe restriction on that export. If the recommendation of three of the commissioners, including the one that happens to be present in the gallery this day, were to be carried, that would see the existing trade continue to be able to proceed at about current levels, but there would be no ability to grow the trade or work with the US prime lamb industry—the Australian prime lamb industry has indicated their preparedness to do so—to expand the overall market and create the win-win situation which is the best way forward.
The Australian government is standing as one with the Australian prime lamb industry. It is very strong in the state of Victoria particularly—where the members for Wannon, Mallee, Ballarat and others come from—and also across so many of the states of Australia. This is a new wave market, carved out by an industry which has done the hard work and liaises with the supermarket chains directly.
I will go to Washington in May, and I am scheduled to meet with the US trade representative, Charlene Barchevsky, to further directly pursue this matter. The government is considering a number of other options to add momentum to our legitimate case in standing up for our legitimate export interests.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Lamb Exports</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 recognises the enormous pain, suffering and economic hardship which has been experienced, and which is still being experienced, by victims of asbestos exposure, and their families; and
(2)	 calls on the Government to:
(a)	 immediately ratify ILO Convention No. 162 regarding the prevention and control of health hazards due to occupational exposure to asbestos;
(b)	 immediately legislate to:
	 (i)	 preserve the right to claim general damages for relatives of victims of asbestos related diseases upon the death of the claimant in all States and Territories save New South Wales;
	 (ii)	 remove time limits on claims for damages by those suffering claims for asbestos related disease;
	 (iii)	 allow the reuse of evidence to minimise the cost of litigation and court time; and
	 (iv)	 increase financial assistance for asbestos disease support groups; and
(c)	 instigate a national inquiry into the occupational use of asbestos to determine the:
	 (i)	 extent of knowledge held by government agencies on the lethal effects of asbestos; 

	 (ii)	 extent of knowledge held by private companies using asbestos in their operations as to the lethal effects of asbestos;
	 (iii)	 nature of work practices which were employed in Australia in relation to the use of asbestos by both government agencies and private companies; and
	 (iv)	 adequacy of the existing and ongoing arrangements for the payment of compensation to Latrobe Valley workers affected by asbestos exposure in light of the privatisation of the SECV, which for decades has been the region's largest employer as well as being an employer operating in an industry in which asbestos construction materials were extensively used.
This motion is about getting justice for those men and women who have been exposed to asbestos in their working lives. Those working men and women who were exposed so cruelly to asbestos and who have died an awful, hacking death as a result of that exposure deserve to have the suffering they endured recognised by this parliament. The families who had to watch as their father or husband died that premature death need to know that we in this parliament recognise their pain. Those families who are now caring for someone with an asbestos related disease need to know that we will make sure that they will be able to access justice. Those government and private sector employers who culpably exposed their work force and their work force's families to asbestos with their eyes wide open as to the lethal impact of that exposure need to be brought to account.
Whether it takes two years or 20 years, this parliament has a responsibility to those families affected by asbestos exposure to determine forensically the truth in relation to the extent of knowledge held by employers about the impacts of asbestos exposure. As a matter of urgency, this parliament needs to introduce national legislation to ensure that affected families are able to access justice and compensation without lengthy delays, irrespective of the state they live in.
Despite the fact that asbestos and its associated diseases have been recognised as an ongoing problem in Australia—particularly in Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria—legislation to protect employees against 
 asbestos related disease and to aid compensation does not exist at the Commonwealth level. A study conducted by the Dust Diseases Tribunal in New South Wales has forecast that 7,000 Australians will die of mesothelioma and asbestos related cancer in the next 16 years and warns employers to be prepared for millions of dollars in compensation claims.
The reason this issue is extremely important to me personally and to my electorate is the very high incidence of asbestos related disease which exists in the Latrobe Valley, which makes up about two-thirds of my electorate. The Latrobe Valley is where I grew up and where I am proud to live. It is the place that my father came to when he was just 20 years old to build a new life for himself, as did so many other migrants. What bought migrants from every part of the world to the Latrobe Valley was the work which was available on the construction projects being undertaken by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria.
Literally tens of thousands of mostly migrant workers worked on these construction projects, and, as a result of the construction materials they were directed to use by the SECV, thousands of these men contracted asbestos related diseases and have died prematurely as a result of that exposure. To place the scale of this disaster in context, this is what Mr Peter Gordon, a partner in the law firm Slater and Gordon, said in relation to the level of asbestos exposure in the Latrobe Valley:
There is no question that the Latrobe Valley is a comparable or greater disaster than the situation at the blue asbestos mine at Wittenoom. Even though the exposure levels may not have been as great at the SEC plants, the number of people exposed in the Latrobe Valley would be at least 10 times more than Wittenoom. So little was done to warn the workers at the SEC. They have suffered decades of neglect and abuse.
Medical specialists in Melbourne and the Latrobe Valley also confirm the high level of exposure which has taken place. They say that mesothelioma and asbestosis in the region is endemic. Of most concern they say that the majority of cases will be diagnosed early next century. Dr David Bernshaw, a radiation 
 oncologist at the Peter MacCallum Hospital, believes that the Latrobe Valley will see a dramatic increase in mesothelioma cases. He states:
Because of the latency period of this disease, which is up to 30 years, we are going to see more and more of these cases amongst workers down there.
The increasing number of men who end up prematurely in nursing homes in the Latrobe Valley as a result of respiratory problems provides strong anecdotal support for his contention.
If history has taught us anything with regard to the handling of asbestos, it is to be vigilant with regard to the processes followed in its use. This is why this motion calls on the federal government to immediately ratify ILO convention No. 162, regarding the prevention and control of health hazards due to occupational exposure to asbestos.
I was enormously disappointed last week by the response from the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business to question No. 372 on the Notice Paper. The question, put by the shadow Attorney-General and the seconder of this motion, the honourable member for Barton, inquired of the government what action it intended to take in relation to the ratification of this convention. The Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business responded:
The Government is not proposing to take any action in relation to this convention outside the agreed consultative process. Accordingly, any further consultation about the convention will occur in the context of the periodic consideration by the Commonwealth, States and Territories of which unratified Conventions should be the subject of further examination.
For this response I have to give the minister zero out of 10. I urge him to take the convention seriously and to ensure that the states act in accordance with its principles. I also remind him that it was a similar blase attitude to asbestos handling which led to the massive exposure of workers which our community is now suffering from. I consider this an issue above party politics. In the best bipartisan tradition of this place, I urge the minister to seriously reconsider his approach to this convention.
This motion is very straightforward. At its simplest, it calls for government action to ensure that never again are we faced with the massive death toll which our community is now painfully coming to terms with as a result of exposure to asbestos. It calls for government action to ensure that those workers who have been exposed to asbestos can get compensation quickly, without having to endure convoluted legal processes which presently result in many plaintiffs dying during the process and their families completely missing out on receiving any of the compensation which is owed to them. To prevent this from happening, this motion calls for the right to sue for general damages to be preserved so that, in the event of the death of the claimant, his estate or family can continue the claim and receive appropriate compensation.
The motion also calls for a national inquiry into the use of asbestos in order to determine the culpability of employers and government agencies and to determine dispassionately the extent of knowledge held by both government and private sector employers as to the lethal impact of asbestos exposure. Finally, the motion calls for an examination of the adequacy of the compensation arrangements which exist for those Latrobe Valley workers who were exposed to asbestos in their working lives and who now can only seek damages from the SECV shell company, which is completely dependent upon the benevolence of the state government of Victoria for its funds.
It is my passionate contention that the level of compensation that an affected Latrobe Valley worker receives should not be dependent upon the amount of funds made available by the state government of Victoria but should be assessed against the damage incurred by the claimant and their family. The privatisation of the former SECV has created this new dilemma, and I believe it is appropriate that the federal government ensure that the new arrangements are capable of dealing with the expected flood of claims over the next decade. With the large number of claims anticipated, this is genuinely a national issue and should be viewed as such.
I want to wrap up my remarks today by saying a thing or two about the type of people who have been affected by asbestos exposure in the Latrobe Valley. These men and their families came from every corner of the globe to work on the construction of the Latrobe Valley's power stations. They came to the Latrobe Valley with one purpose: to build a new life for themselves so that their children would have the opportunities they did not get. To provide their children with those opportunities, they understood that they would have to work hard—and that is exactly what they did, working in open-cut coal mines or workshops, their whole bodies often black with coal, or on construction sites exposed to the heat, risking life and limb every day on dangerous scaffolding, often without even a toilet or running water on site. These men worked under conditions that few in this parliament would understand or believe possible.
But through all this these men kept quiet and got on with the job. To provide the opportunities they wanted for their children, they knew that this is what they had to do. What these men could never have imagined was that, after a lifetime of this toil and after living just long enough to see their children grow up, the working conditions they were exposed to would cruelly cut short their opportunity to see their children and grandchildren enjoy the opportunities which their hard work had been able to secure for them.
When these men signed up to work at the SECV, they did not agree to die at 55 or 60. It was not accepted by them that they would have to sacrifice their health and lose 20 years life expectancy just for the privilege of working at the SECV. These men worked hard, and their families did it tough, putting up with physically exhausted husbands and fathers who were often so worn out from work that they would have to go to sleep almost immediately upon getting home to their families.
We owe these men and their families the truth about the knowledge held by government agencies and private and government employers. We owe these men and their families access to the compensation they 
 deserve. We have a responsibility to all workers in Australia to ensure that never again will working people be so callously exposed to asbestos and be made to suffer so horribly as a result of that exposure. (Time expired)

"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—I am pleased to rise and state at the outset my support in general for the terms of the motion moved by the member for McMillan. He raises a matter of real importance which has a very direct and personal bearing on a large number of Australians. I rise as possibly one of those Australians who is directly affected, in that I suspect I am one of the few members of this House who before his arrival here was employed as an asbestos removals contractor. It was perhaps a foolhardy vocation, reflecting the lack of judgment that one has whilst at university desperately trying to save to pay the rent and meet one's bills.
There are a number of elements to the motion put forward by the honourable member. Certainly I can happily endorse the first:
That this House:
(1)	 recognises the enormous pain, suffering and economic hardship which has been experienced, and which is still being experienced, by victims of asbestos exposure, and their families.
The second part of the motion calls on the government to do a range of things, including the ratification of ILO convention No. 162, and the introduction of immediate legislation against four different listed heads in the motion.
The legislation as proposed is almost a direct mirror of the legislation which was introduced by the New South Wales government on 17 November last year, the Workers Compensation (Dust Diseases) Act. In broad terms I find that a forward looking, practical, enlightened piece of legislation. There is much that is desirable in that legislation. For example, one of the great problems with asbestos related cancer is its long gestation 
 period, or latency, as the medical profession describes it. Then when it emerges it hits very rapidly and the demise tends to be very fast, usually in 12 months or so. One of the problems in New South Wales was that they had what were, in effect, death bed hearings, where a patient in the terminal stages of the illness, in a heavily drugged state, had to come to grips with solicitors' representatives of a former employer and their own representatives. It was an undignified way for a person to spend the last days, or in some cases moments, of his life.
Similarly in regard to the common law principle that a claim ceases to have validity at the death of the claimant, there are compelling arguments to say that, in instances such as this, that measure ought to be overcome by legislation. In fact, the New South Wales bill does that; it allows the family, wife, children, the estate of the deceased, to continue to deliver on the claim. There has even been some suggestion that insurance companies were deliberately prolonging the consideration of claims in the hope that the claimant would expire. I am reluctant to even ventilate such a claim. The New South Wales bill addresses the three-year limit in the Limitations Act and gives a claimant the opportunity to raise a claim further down the track.
The reuse of evidence is another matter raised by the honourable member, which it seems to me is a desirable change in the law in those other states. In New South Wales, formerly you had to have multiple experts coming forward and giving evidence in every case. This provision allows, where expert testimony has been provided on a question relating to a broad class of people and the impact of asbestos or asbestosis, that evidence to be reusable, if you like, in other cases. Certainly both the Bar Association and the New South Wales Law Society were comfortable with and supportive of this commonsense measure, which particularly allows for expediting the hearing of cases in this last phase of people's lives.
The request to increase financial assistance for asbestos disease support groups is a good one and one which I support. Around Australia numerous organisations are doing an 
 excellent job of raising awareness and making resources available to those who have contracted asbestos related cancer. I pay tribute to the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of New South Wales, WorkCover New South Wales, the Australian Lung Foundation, the Asbestos Diseases Society of Western Australia, the Asbestos Diseases Support Society of Queensland and other such organisations around the country. To be fair, this is an area where the trade union movement has played an active, and in most cases a very constructive, role. This is exactly the sort of area where organised labour, in my view, has an important role to play in educating both the work force and the employer.
I am not supportive in this instance of the ratification of ILO convention 162, not because I do not regard this as an extremely important issue and one that ought to be underlined and highlighted but because of a view about the nature of federalism and the proper place for the use of the external affairs power. It is my view that this parliament has been excessive in undermining the powers of the states in the spirit of federalism, in particular by the use of the external affairs power. I would cite just as one example of the use by the former government of the external affairs power an ILO convention which was the constitutional basis for the unfair dismissals legislation, which was introduced into this parliament and which has proven to be so destructive to the opportunities of young job seekers in Australia.
I think the New South Wales government has shown that it is a matter within their power, over which they have a perfectly orthodox power to legislate. They have done so in this instance and that ought to be the path followed by other Australian states. That is not to say that the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has not been attentive in regard to or concerned about this issue. In fact, the question of an appropriate response to the question of compensation for asbestos exposure was directly addressed by the Labour Ministers Council, which was chaired by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business last year. The Labour 
 Ministers Council at the time requested in much the same terms as the member himself that we undertake a national survey to identify the action and experience in all states and territories in regard to preventing asbestos related diseases.
Based on the outcomes of that survey the Labour Ministers Council agreed at its last meeting in November last year to a range of strategies which are designed to avoid a similar occurrence with other potential diseases of long latency. They include a commitment to further research into relevant areas of public health prevention, generating improved data on occupational disease and ensuring effective control of workplace hazardous substances through national hazardous substances regimes.
Research is much needed. Preliminary research has been undertaken. For example, the AmericanJournal of Industrial Medicine in its edition No. 29 of 1996 cites some data from a comparative study by the Workers Compensation Board of British Columbia and the Workers Compensation Board of New South Wales into the reporting of asbestos related cancer. They found that at least 1,200 cases in a 12-year period went unreported when it was empirically demonstrable that these cases of mesothelioma were related to asbestos exposure.
There is a clear case for raising national awareness of this issue. The fantastic chemical properties of asbestos make it still one of the best insulators against both heat and electricity the world has ever seen, but it just has these tragic terminal consequences which we were not aware of at the time.
I certainly hope that I do not have personal need to have recourse to the Dust Diseases Board which was established in 1989 in an enlightened way by the Hon. John Dowd, who is now the Hon. Justice John Dowd of the New South Wales Supreme Court. This government ought to stand solidly behind all those who have contracted this disease and encourage the states to continue their efforts within the spirit of federalism. Nonetheless, we ought to play a constructive leadership role. With those caveats, I warmly commend the motion to the House.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I had pleasure in seconding the motion moved by the member for McMillan, and I commend him for moving it. It is an important issue. It is fair to say that there would not be a member in this House who would not know someone who has suffered from an asbestos related disease or, indeed had a family member who has so suffered. I sincerely hope that the member for Parramatta does not come down with any such disease.
The member for Parramatta indicated that at the time he was involved in asbestos removal, people were not fully aware of the dangers of asbestos. Regrettably, that may not be the case. Indeed, the evidence produced in so many common law cases establishes firmly that employers and government instrumentalities were certainly aware of the dangers of asbestos exposure yet, nonetheless, for reasons of economics, failed to take adequate precautions for their workers. One asks what the consequences would have been for those workers if there had not been trade unions in existence to promote health and safety issues, which, in this case, are literally a matter of life and death.
Australia has one of the highest rates of mesothelioma per capita in the world and yet there still has been very little research done. This is an appropriate area where the federal parliament could play a pivotal role in coordinating that research across Australia. As the member for Parramatta said, to have a proper system of reporting asbestos related diseases and then tracking them is very important for identifying the causes. Bear in mind that we are talking about not simply workers, but their families. There have been several cases now where wives who have washed the clothes of workers have themselves contracted the disease. It is an issue that affects the whole community.
I was concerned that the government does not appear to support ratification of ILO 162. It is regrettable indeed, because that is an important treaty which, if ratified, requires the federal government to introduce national laws and regulations applying to the use of asbestos in industry, the removal of asbestos, the disposal of asbestos and the release of air 
 borne particles from industry which can clearly affect the community generally. It is an important treaty and, as the member for McMillan said, we are extremely disappointed at the lack of interest this government has in progressing the ratification of that treaty. I note that only the South Australian and Queensland governments have so far taken steps to ratify it, although I have been informed by personal correspondence from the Hon. Jeff Shaw, the New South Wales Attorney-General and Minister for Labour, that the New South Wales government intends to take those steps.
I can contrast this government's attitude with the success and empathy that the New South Wales Labor government has had for those involved in the work force and who have contributed to the wealth of the nation by literally and finally giving their health. Under the New South Wales Workers Compensation Legislation Amendment (Dust Diseases and Other Matters) Act, the New South Wales government has provided some very practical measures whereby time limits which previously precluded workers from claiming compensation have been abolished. Bearing in mind the long gestation period of this disease, those measures overcome those complexities.
They have provided for the survival of general damages claims even after the death of workers so that their families do not suffer, and also taken practical steps regarding the re-use of evidence from one proceeding into another proceeding which has significantly reduced the cost of litigation to the individual parties and also the cost of justice to the community as a whole.
There is a marked contrast with what a New South Wales Labor government has done for the benefit of workers and their families who have given so much to the productivity of the state and the nation, when compared to the blase attitude of this Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. The contrast could not be any more stark in an area where there should be compassion and recognition of the tremendous sacrifice made by Australian workers to this nation and what should have been done to 
 protect them. These things will only come out with appropriate national recognition and inquiry.(Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Asbestos Exposure</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1,speech
"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—I would like to compliment the member for McMillan for bringing this issue before the parliament. It is a shame that the member for Barton in his contribution had to try and politicise the debate. It seemed to me that the member for Parramatta had pretty well supported the member for McMillan, and I was about to do the same. I guess my speech has changed a little.
I say to the member for McMillan that in 1958 I went to work full time in a steel mill on a blast furnace. I worked in a powerhouse and in the coke works. I was exposed to asbestos in great humps from that time. As a carpenter in the 1970s and 1980s I could not tell you how many times I put asbestos into roofs. I could not count the number of fibre discs I went through with a Black and Decker when cutting AC sheet to fit walls and behind tiles, for roofing profiles or whatever. I do not lie awake at night worrying if I am going to get the disease; if it happens, it happens.
But I can say to the parliament with great feeling and great patience that my understanding is that they knew in England in about 1936—that was the year I was born—that free-floating asbestos fibres could cause cancer of the lung. I think it is absolutely abominable, despicable and without justification that industry and government allowed the continuing use of the fibre over such a long number of decades, that we allowed it to be mined so actively in Western Australia, that we imported it from other countries and that we used it so much. There was one time when, per head of population, Australia had the greatest use of asbestos fibre of any country on earth. Did you know that? The greatest use on earth.
But there are some other issues here that we might address. Back in 1998, Collective Expertise was set up by INSERM, the French Institute of Health and Medical Research, to promote scientific and technical surveys (state of the art and major trends), and provide support to help INSERM's health sciences partners—private companies, decision makers, 
 government bodies, welfare organisations, hospitals and so on—make effective decisions and define strategies with respect to different issues. Their recommendations on asbestos disease said:
While the outcome may appear inconclusive, the experts have been able to make a number of constructive recommendations, not least that we need much more hard data. They recommend:
.	 continuing studies to improve statistics on workers' exposure, and quantitative data on contamination of workplaces
.	 efforts to ensure the exposure of workers to these fibres remains as low as possible
.	 development of experimental models to study how the fibres exert their pathogenic or toxic actions, to predict what will happen. Simple tests of fibre solubility in vitro  were criticised as premature and unscientific
.	 setting up a `bank' of asbestos fibre substitutes that would be accessible to all scientists wanting to work in the field.
I absolutely support the general terms of section (1) of the motion, which reads:
(1)	 recognises the enormous pain, suffering and economic hardship which has been experienced, and which is still being experienced, by victims of asbestos exposure, and their families;
I agree with that absolutely, and I support that part of the motion.
I am not convinced that ratifying the ILO convention will do anything for us whatsoever, other than make it just simply another piece of international paper floating around the place. It seems to me that the most effective solution to the problem is to have uniform agreement with the states that we recognise the long-term distance—it is sometimes 30 years—between initial exposure and when the disease appears. I can tell you from my own personal experience that I am one of those in a high risk category who still could easily wind up in hospital with the disease. It seems to me that Neil Bartholomaeus, Worksafe Western Australia Commissioner, was correct when, in a speech about setting the agenda for 2000, he said:
Past occupational exposure to asbestos has killed more workers than any other occupational hazard in Australian history. Although active steps have reduced the exposure of most workers to asbestos, many Australians still face the prospect of painful 
 death from presently incurable mesothelioma or of contracting other asbestos-related diseases.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—The government has to get serious about food labelling. The government must listen to the community on this issue. Deregulation of food labelling is not good for the industry and it is not acceptable to consumers. It is hard to imagine an issue more serious in our local community than those issues that involve our basic necessities. Food of course is one of life's basic requirements. There is no-one in our community who is unaffected where food is concerned. In Australia we have become accustomed to high quality food products, both fresh and processed. We are entitled to this expectation for good reason. We have tighter controls and regulations on food products than most other countries.
The community expectation on the supply and marketing of quality food demands that issues of value and health are also addressed. The government has a major role to play in 
 relation to ensuring the community has access to a food supply that is safe to eat, free of unhealthy herbicides and pesticides and that meets the nutritional expectations of the community. We must also ensure that consumers are given the capacity to evaluate food value as against food prices to ensure that the community has access to food that is value for money.
Increasingly, many consumers are also demanding that foods be produced in ways that are ethically sound and environmentally sustainable. Meeting the varying demands of consumers in a free market economy where primary producers must also compete against imported foodstuffs and maximise exports of local food products is clearly the challenge. While regulation is obviously the only path to take on public health and safety issues like pesticides and herbicides, it is unrealistic to strictly regulate on matters relating to nutritional expectation and value for money.
The important issue at hand here is that consumers are given the information they need to make decisions on the criteria they feel are important in their choice of food. The solution is food labelling. Food labelling is the consumers' only realistic method of determining what the food is and whether one product differs greatly in terms of expectation of ingredients, manufacturing processes or nutritional outcomes. There should be no debate that information is a vital part of the freedoms associated with a healthy market economy. Without informed choice consumers are left to the peril of marketing, deception or ambiguity. The government's plans to deregulate food labelling will abandon the consumer and the confidence we have in our present system.
Labor has a history of taking food labelling very seriously. When in government we tackled the difficult issues of food labelling, in particular, the matter of country of origin labelling and the protection of the `Product of Australia' tag, unlike the current government, who shed crocodile tears when in opposition on this issue but when in government watered down the level of Australian goods required to bear the label `Made in Australia'. This government have never taken food labelling 
 seriously. They do not understand this issue from the point of view of the consumer.
Members opposite should understand that the Australian consumer today is hungry for information on food. When my family and I are shopping, I notice that many shoppers, like us, are now stopping before they put food into the trolley. They are reading the labels. People want to know the nutritional content, the country of origin, the ingredients and any other facts they can find out about the products before they make a purchase. Of course they also take some things for granted—like the fact that jam contains fruit—and they should be entitled to do so. These things are the matters usually dealt with by food labelling regulations.
One issue of growing concern for consumers is the use of genetically modified organisms in the manufacture of food products. People have a wide range of concerns about the use of GMOs in food—from the ethical and spiritual concerns through to the nutritional, taste and health aspects of genetically altered food. Concerns with GMOs often underlie a deep and fundamental concern about gene technology and the application of this technology in the commercial world. We all live in a technological age where we sometimes quite rightly fear that science can disregard the human perspective. Morally or ethically, human discovery does not always lead to human progress. The gene industry is one that some people would never wish to sponsor and as such would purchase their food free of such technology. This can only be achieved when they have reasonable access to that information through food labelling.
This government is very loud when talking about mutual obligation and freedom of choice in relation to many matters, as we have heard recently. So it should be incumbent on this government to offer the same freedoms of choice to consumers through legislation and proper food labelling. There is a lot of information about this subject that people need to know. As that information becomes available, attitudes to GMOs may well change. While concerns exist and for varying reasons the community may wish to avoid genetically altered food, food labelling 
 must identify any foods where GMOs are used.
This will not happen under this government because it cannot get it right on food labelling. The government has not taken seriously the fact that there is near zero compliance of the requirement for testing and approval of genetically modified food products. There is little to no chance that consumers or retailers will have identified all the products with genetically modified organisms by the 13 May deadline. While this places retailers in an unenviable position, for consumers it will mean that they are no closer to finding out the truth on what they are buying or what they are eating—a situation that may please the government, which, after all, voted against the labelling of genetically modified foods late last year.
Food labelling is about much more than just genetically modified organisms. Food labelling is an issue for every product we purchase. Food labelling allows consumers the confidence to purchase products of a particular description and to know that that product falls within the community expectation of ingredients and nutritional requirements. The government's current plans to deregulate food labelling will pull the rug out from under consumers' feet. Nearing Easter it is timely to consider the government's deregulation of food labelling and its impact.
Will the coalition hop from house to house this Easter telling kids and their parents that the chocolate Easter eggs they are eating may contain no chocolate at all? Or will the government tell consumers that it will remove the requirement for jam to contain at least 40 per cent fruit? And what of the great Australian meat pie? An Aussie icon of such magnitude, it is surprising that it did not get a run in John Howard's preamble. Even guidelines for the meat pie will be thrown out the window under this government's recommendations.
Food labelling regulations are put in place to assist the consumer. Consumers only get a fair deal when they can go to the supermarket and compare apples with apples and jams with jams. The ability of manufacturers to produce, for example, jams of inferior fruit 
 quality without labelling as such will lead to many consumers purchasing products that are of a reduced value for money. Consumers are owed better than this from this government or any government. They work too hard and earn too little to throw money away at the supermarket. Only regulated food labelling will assist the consumer in making informed comparisons at the point of purchase.
Food labelling is also a genuine health issue. When you are shopping for yourself and your family, you want to know that a certain product is made from the ingredients that you expect. With deregulated food labelling, the nutritional value of food can be seriously diminished without consumers being aware of this. This is of genuine concern to many. Without regulated food labelling, public nutrition can be played off against industry expedience. With food labelling deregulation what is removed are the minimum standards of ingredients that are usually healthier, fresher and generally better for us. Of course, they are usually more expensive. Therefore, a manufacturer of jams can reduce the amount of fruit in a jam jar but they can still call it jam. They will reduce their costs and still compete against other jam manufacturers.
 Where will this eventually lead us? All the jam manufacturers will be forced to reduce their fruit content to compete. The eventual loser is the consumer. As a parent, I want to know that the jam I buy for my family contains a minimum of fruit, that a meat pie contains a minimum of meat and that the integrity of other food products is also maintained. Without that integrity we cannot properly assess the balance of diets of our families or ourselves. That, quite frankly, is just not good enough.
Further, I am concerned that Australia's international reputation as a manufacturer of quality foods will be diminished by the falling standards of domestic production. It is widely acknowledged that Australia's food exporters succeed by not only competing by price alone but also providing the world with superior quality foods. The deregulation of food labelling will only serve to reduce this reputation on primary products.
The impact of the export on processed foods could be far more serious. Export opportunities for value added products lie very much in the top end of the market. Through tourism and other mediums, the global community will develop a particular belief in the quality of Australian food—qualities that must be maintained and, if anything, increased if locally manufactured goods are to compete in overseas markets. For all these reasons, the government needs to get serious about food labelling. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Food Labelling</title>,Grievance Debate,11,1,speech
"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—I move:
That the requested amendment be not made.
The Senate has argued that the introduction of approved procedure facilities discriminates against uninsured patients. On the basis of this, schedule 1 of the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  was amended at part 5 by the opposition with the support of other senators. The opposition moved two amendments to subsection 10(2) of part 5 of the bill which made the Commonwealth liable for a private patient's facility fee and raised the scheduled Medicare benefit payable for procedures undertaken in approved facilities from 75 per cent to 85 per cent.
The government does not accept these amendments for the following reasons. Uninsured patients are ensured access to the types of services proposed to be undertaken in approved procedure facilities in a number of ways. Under the Australian health care agreement, state governments are already able to provide treatment outside of a hospital in doctors' rooms. Given the additional funding that has been provided to the states by the Commonwealth under these agreements, there is every reason to think that uninsured patients would have access to similar services in the public sector or services purchased from the private sector by the state government. Uninsured patients can also access services in the private approved procedure facilities established in this bill. In fact, the ABS survey `Private Hospitals' found that, in 1996-97, 25 per cent of patients admitted to private hospitals did so on a self-insured basis.
Let us take the example, though, of a typically uninsured person. He or she attends a public hospital with a condition requiring a procedure that I, as minister, have determined appropriately to be undertaken in an approved procedures facility. The person sees a doctor who makes a clinical decision. The patient could have this condition treated safely in an approved procedures facility. As the Austral 
 ian health care agreement ensures that all eligible Medicare patients are guaranteed treatment in public hospitals, this person's treatment could be undertaken either in a public hospital, as it would be now, or in a freestanding approved facility contracted by the public hospital free of charge.
The simple fact is that we are talking about privately insured patients here, not publicly insured patients. If we look at public patients, they are no worse off because the situation for them does not change. To accept this amendment would mean that private patients would have the overall financial impact. We estimate it to be $30.5 million per annum—$14 million from Medicare and $16.5 million for a facility fee calculated at the current default table rate of $130 per day (that is at band one) for an estimated 50 ABFs performed at 10 services per day over 245 working days. For an opposition who demonstrated a feigned concern in the Senate inquiry at the effect of this previously cost neutral bill on the Commonwealth, this additional impost of $30.5 million is untenable.
The amendment has missed the key point on the approved procedure facility provisions. Procedures undertaken in approved procedure facilities will be procedures that would otherwise have been undertaken in a hospital or a day hospital facility. It is a requirement that this fact be determined before I approve any procedure to be undertaken in an approved procedure facility. Increasing the Medicare rebate for such services from 75 per cent to 85 per cent gives an added incentive for states and territories to cost shift to the Commonwealth—something the opposition has also talked of being concerned about in the past. So the opposition is asking the Commonwealth to contribute to a private patient's accommodation charge. The fact is that hospital services have changed over the last 15 years. While a rigid demarcation between in-hospital and out-of-hospital treatment may have been tenable in 1984, it is not tenable in 1999. This bill simply allows health funds to have people treated in the most appropriate place. It does not apply to public patients.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—Part 5 of the Health Legislation Amendment 
 Bill (No. 2) 1999 , as the Minister for Health and Aged Care has just outlined, creates a new class of approved facilities in which medical procedures can be undertaken which previously could be done only in hospital. The way in which this is being proposed by the government will benefit only privately insured patients. Public patients sent by a hospital or a doctor to an approved facility could incur a potentially large gap payment. The economic justification, which the minister has just outlined, for creating this new class of facility is that procedures in these approved facilities would be more economic because the overheads for office based procedures are much less than doing the same thing in a hospital.
This bill does enable the medical practitioner to make an additional charge to cover the costs of providing services in an approved facility, for example, to recoup the capital costs of setting up a location for more advanced surgery. The bill also enables the private health fund to cover this additional charge through insurance policies. The government argues that the benefit for the health fund of this proposal is that it will still be cheaper for health funds to pay the 25 per cent gap on the schedule fee plus the facilities fee plus whatever contracted amount above the schedule fee is contracted between the specialists and the funds. The government argues—and we will certainly see if this ever comes to pass—that to cover the same procedure in a day surgery or a hospital is more expensive where there would be a day's accommodation charge. If this is true, then the benefits should be equally great for the public system as for the private. If procedures are relocated from a public hospital to an approved facility, there should be savings to the public purse because the specialist fees and the facilities fee could be much lower than the cost of a public hospital stay.
As the bill was drafted, the public patient would face the unenviable choice of waiting for a bed in a public hospital or have an opportunity to have the procedure done at a publicly funded day surgery or at their own expense in an approved doctors room. This would mean that a public patient would have 
 to meet the remaining 25 per cent of the schedule fee, the whole of the facilities fee and any over schedule fee charges made by the doctor. This would constitute a very large gap payment for any Medicare patient. To solve this problem the opposition propose that a Medicare rebate be required for any procedure for which there is a facilities fee set which can be covered by private health insurance. As this involves expenditure, this is taken in the form of a request to the House.
The Senate's request, as the minister has outlined, was moved by the opposition and supported by all non-government senators, apart from the absent Senator Colston. The request seeks to simply put public patients on the same footing as private patients in relation to surgery carried out in these approved facilities. It is extraordinary that such a request even has to be made. It states that where the minister has established a facilities fee, the amount payable as a Medicare rebate for such procedures should be 85 per cent of the schedule fee and the facility benefit. Without this provision there will be little chance of a public patient using an approved facility which seemed designed to be a special arrangement for those with private health insurance only. It looks as though the government's ulterior motive in this matter is simply to apply its powers in a manner biased towards private insurance. This is wrong and also makes no economic sense.
If the development of technology means that surgical procedures can be safely done out of hospitals and that this results in economic savings, then the minister should be more interested in making those savings in the 70 per cent of the health sector that he is directly responsible for and for which he pays directly and indirectly the bulk of the bills. Instead of being fixated by the 30 per cent of the public who have private health insurance, he should be looking to the application of this new approach to public patients, not leaving it up to whether or not the states might do it.
The government has advanced two arguments, which we have just heard from the minister. Firstly, it is concerned because the request proposes a benefit rate of 85 per cent, as is paid for rebates involving procedures in 
 doctors rooms, rather than the 75 per cent, as is paid for in private hospitals. (Extension of time granted) The government argues that this would be some sort of perverse incentive to carry out procedures in approved facilities and that this would result in inappropriate procedures being carried out. I have to say that is just the government arguing against itself. If it is cheaper to do these procedures in doctors rooms, then further encouragement is a good thing.
In response, it should be made clear that the bill makes the minister responsible for making the decision about which procedures are approved to be undertaken in an out-of-hospital setting. The government has further argued that, because the Senate has amended the legislation to restrict approved procedures to those which are normally carried out in a hospital, all the work being done in approved facilities should be work that is relocated from a hospital. Therefore, these procedures would previously have attracted a 75 per cent rebate and they should attract the same rate in approved facilities.
This overlooks the fact that public patients pay nothing out of their pockets for hospital treatment and private patients in public hospitals are insured for the 25 per cent gap. Approved facilities are unlikely to bulkbill if they receive only a 75 per cent rebate and therefore public patients will of course be reluctant to use these approved facilities where they will have to make large gap payments. This means public hospitals will not achieve the economic gains that would be made by encouraging public patients to have procedures done outside of hospital.
Moreover, reducing the payment—this is from 85 per cent to 75 per cent—would create an unacceptable anomaly. Because most of the proposed approved facilities are likely to be in major practices or adjacent to specialist rooms, a patient is going to be receiving an 85 per cent rebate for one service and a 75 per cent rebate for other services carried out on the same premises.
The second argument the government has advanced is that providing a rebate for the facility fee would amount to cost shifting—we have just heard the minister repeat this argu 
 ment—because the states would save on hospital funding and Medicare costs would increase. This is another example of the government not seeing an opportunity before it. The government argues that the states should use some of the funds—we have just heard this again from the minister—provided to them through the Australian health agreements to pay for out-of-hospital procedures for public patients, and the agreements provide for this to be done. This manifestly ignores the reality that the states are strapped for cash when it comes to public hospitals. They can barely keep their hospitals clean and safe, let alone have money to spend in the way that the government proposes.
Once again, if it is a good idea, let us see the government do it. This federal government is responsible for what goes on in doctors rooms. If it is a good idea, it should be done for public as well as private patients. Cost shifting would be a serious issue only if these approved facilities became a significant sector of activity. In this case, if it was done safely and well, the Commonwealth needs simply to make an adjustment to the next hospital funding agreement. To not offer this option would exclude public patients and impose large gap payments for them to use what would essentially be private facilities.
I therefore commend the request of the Senate to the House and urge the government to reconsider its position. If the government rejects this request, it will be signalling its intention to proceed with out-of-hospital surgery which will benefit only those with private health insurance, will exclude public patients, and public hospitals will get no relief. If the government refuses to restore some equity to this proposal, then the opposition will have no alternative but to seek to delete what is a half-baked proposal contained in part 5 of this bill.
There may be a case that provision needs to be made for safe and economic use of new technology which has made it possible for new procedures in an out-of-hospital setting. If the government is unwilling to establish adequate safety and quality procedures under an appropriate regulatory regime and to treat public patients fairly and equally alongside 
 private patients, then the time has not arrived for this new branch of surgery to gain approval. The opposition continues to support parts 1 to 4 of this bill and will vote for these sections as amended when the bill is next considered in the Senate.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—I have no desire to get into a long debate. There is no possibility of the government and the opposition reaching any common ground on this because there is a very simple thing that the opposition is overlooking—that is, we do not run public hospitals. The states run public hospitals.
—They're no good. That's why you should do it.
—It is all very well to say you should turn the Australian health care system on its head, but that is not going to happen in the next five years. Given that we do not run public hospitals, I cannot tell the states what to do.
—Exactly!
—Exactly, so you are cutting out your own argument. We do control private health insurance. I am doing something to try to help those with private health insurance. I have already done a lot by increasing the health care agreements by an amount of money that the opposition would have thought unimaginable and certainly was much better than it was able to do in 1993 or 1988.
If the benefits are equivalent to what is happening in a public hospital, then it is the role of the state, not the Commonwealth. If hospitals are strapped for cash, that is because of the agreement signed in the dying days of the Keating government in 1993. What happened there was that the Commonwealth took money out of the financial assistance grants to the states and put it into the health care grants. The states were, in a net position, not a lot better off, except their hands were tied. Clearly, they had to cut back on their own resources into health. The net effect was that the health care agreement was a sham and public hospitals have suffered.
We have not done that. Any extra money we have put into the health care agreements is new money. We are not robbing the states financial assistance grants to do it. The states do have flexibility that they did not have under the old system to do this if they wish. I think they would be silly not to do it, but I cannot compel them to do it. The whole tone of what the opposition is saying is, `Well, just get the states to do this. If they're not going to do it, we'll fix it up in five years.' That is not the way Commonwealth-state relations work. It is not the way it worked under the Labor Party and it is not the way it works under us.
The shadow minister talked about an anomaly. In fact, what we are trying to do is correct Labor's anomaly—that is, the anomaly whereby you get 100 per cent rebate on the schedule fee if you have a procedure done in rooms and an 85 per cent rebate if it is done out of rooms. That is because private health insurance can cover the other 25 per cent. So you have an incentive now to have the highest cost treatment. This is something that, in a small way, is helping drive costs in the private health care sector.
Finally, again, the shadow minister said, `Give it $30 million if it does fix it in five years time.' I am sorry. Having opened up a new avenue of cost shifting costing the Commonwealth $150 million for no net gain, I am not prepared to do that. Having some idea of how expenditure works in government, I can assure you were you in government you would not be allowed to do it either. We believe that the opposition, while they may be sincere, are misguided. They do not understand how Commonwealth-state relations work. We will not be accepting this amendment.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—The opposition does understand full well the nature of the Australian health care agreements. The minister has acknowledged that he as the federal Minister for Health and Aged Care cannot control what the states do or what public hospitals do. He must know how severely strapped state hospitals are. The idea that they may or may not take up this initia 
 tive is one that he has just acknowledged in his remarks as outside of his control.
It is the case under the current health arrangements in Australia that the Commonwealth government is responsible for paying doctors for what happens in their rooms. That is what this bill, the  Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 , is all about. It is paying doctors for things that they do in their rooms—a Commonwealth responsibility. If it is a good idea for it to be done to support private patients and to reduce the overall cost of private health insurance—and I have previously indicated that I have my doubts about whether or not it will in fact reduce those costs—it is good enough for public patients as well. Public patients will be directed by their doctors to these approved facilities because that is where these procedures will be carried out. The reality of the government's refusal to accept this request from the Senate will be that public patients—Medicare patients, the vast majority of Australians who do not have private health insurance—will face very extensive gaps when they have treatment in these approved facilities.
That is what this government is about. It is about turning health policy on its head, saying, `We think this is a good idea, but we're only going to introduce it for private patients outside hospitals to get the advantage of a new way of getting health insurance.' The opposition certainly do not support it. We will not support a situation where public patients will face anything up to $200 in out-of-pocket gap payments to be treated in these approved facilities. If that is the way the government wants to proceed, we certainly will seek to have this part deleted in the Senate.",REPS,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—I have to answer that because that is complete rubbish. If a public patient wants to be treated in a private hospital now they are up for $450 for the bed plus the doctor's fee and any fees that may be paid by way of theatre fees or other fees. The fact is that they rarely do that; they go into public hospitals. This will still be provided in public hospitals. For you to say 
 that there will be a $200 fee is absolute and utter rubbish.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—The three bills being debated this evening propose further reform of the financial sector in Australia. The first bill brings the regulation of credit unions and building societies into line with other authorised deposit taking institutions, or ADIs, and establishes a single regulatory framework for life insurance companies and friendly societies. The second bill permits transfers of businesses amongst authorised deposit taking institutions or life insurance companies. `Transfers' is really a cute term for de facto mergers. The third bill deals with the treatment of retirement savings accounts for friendly societies.
The financial sector industry essentially supports these bills. From our point of view, 
 we consider them to be important in establishing regulatory and prudential arrangements, and we welcome and support that direction. But it is what the bills do not say that concerns us. Effectively, the bills could operate to take away the Treasurer's consent to mergers. That consent is critical to the four pillars policy preventing further unfettered bank mergers. The erosion of the four pillars policy by stealth is at issue here. It is that erosion that we want to stop. It is not the empty rhetoric from the Treasurer or assurances from the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation which may well be made in good faith; it is protection in legislation which we are after.
The bills before the House are part of the long awaited second round legislative response to the Wallis financial system inquiry. And what a wait it has been! This government received the Wallis report in March 1997—two years ago. It took nearly six months for the government to even respond to the report, and the first round of legislation was not introduced to the House until March 1998. But there is suddenly a huge urgency about this round of reforms. The government introduced the bills under consideration on 11 March 1999—nearly two years to the day after the Wallis report was completed—and now it wants to rush the bills under consideration today through parliament in time for a 1 July 1999 start-up date.
I want to make it perfectly clear that Labor will not be delaying the passage of these reforms unnecessarily, but we will be seeking to refer the bills to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to examine them in detail. We need to examine the reforms closely to ensure that they take Australia's financial sector in the right direction, because our detailed inquiries of the minister have not produced satisfactory explanations in response. We have sought answers to address our concerns, but they have not been completely forthcoming. I will detail these concerns shortly. We will cooperate in ensuring that scrutiny occurs in sufficient time for a start-up date of 1 July 1999.
We worked to open the Australian financial system to foreign banks. All of these reforms 
 contributed to a fundamental shift in the way the Australian financial sector operates and the way financial services are provided in Australia. The Wallis report recommendations have continued that reform, and the prudential and regulatory framework Labor put in place has paid dividends during the Asian region's financial crisis. Against this backdrop we should be leading more effectively the debate on sensible financial system reforms in the development of a modern international financial architecture.
Labor has been generally supportive of the Wallis recommendations. As the recent crises in Asian economies stand testament to, sound financial management and prudential regulation are important protections for every national economy. Many of the recommendations implemented from the Wallis report have contributed to the establishment of a sound prudential system that has served Australia well to date. Whilst reserving Labor's position on the detailed reforms contained in the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 1) 1999 , generally the transfer of regulatory responsibility for building societies, credit unions and friendly societies from the states and territories to the Commonwealth is a sensible move.
A single prudential regulator promotes consistency in regulation across the sector, adding certainty to the industry and encouraging development. The financial sector needs that certainty. The government has certainly ensured that the current tax debate raging on the two fronts of the GST and the Ralph review is not providing any certainty at all for investment in Australia, but the debate also provides a real opportunity for the financial sector to put a case for reform that benefits its growth as, if you like, an industry sector in its own right. On the detail of the bill, we will be asking the Senate committee to look in detail at its amendments of the Corporations Law and the corporations agreement, and we want to take a look at the impact on the terms and conditions of employment of the people transferring to APRA.
The impact of the changes in prudential regulation for life insurance companies will 
 also need detailed consideration. The facility the bill sets up for APRA to provide, under state and territory laws and on a cost recovery basis, prudential regulation and advisory services for cooperative housing societies and trustee companies is a significant extension of APRA's federal prudential role.
Labor acknowledges the widespread support for the bill throughout the financial sector, including credit unions and banking groups. The government and industry are planning for the transfer of regulation to occur on 1 July 1999. While Labor will insist that the bill be examined by a Senate committee because of the significance and extent of the reforms, we will seek to ensure that the committee's deliberations leave sufficient time for the bill to be passed with any necessary amendments in time for that regulatory transfer to occur on 1 July.
But we do have concerns with this bill and the related bills which are being debated in a cognate form tonight. It is my intention to move a second reading amendment dealing with those concerns, and I do so in the following terms.
I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""the House, while supportive of continuing reform of the financial sector:
(1)	 condemns the Government for seeking to push this complex bill through the House so rapidly, given that it has taken the Government two years to introduce it in response to the recommendations of the Wallis Inquiry into the Financial Sector;
(2)	 rejects the Government's attempts to water down the requirement for the Treasurer to consent to institutional changes within the financial sector;
(3)	 calls on the Government to confirm that it will not use the provisions of this bill to relax its `four pillars' policy; and
(4)	 condemns the failure of the Government's attempted reliance on `red-hot' competition and of the Wallis reforms to date to prevent exorbitant rises in bank fees and charges"".
As highlighted in the second reading amendment, we do have serious concerns over aspects of this bill, but I want to focus tonight on one issue in particular. As it currently 
 stands, section 63 of the Banking Act 1959 requires the Treasurer's consent before an authorised deposit taking institution can amalgamate or enter into a partnership with another authorised deposit taking institution, or enter into a reconstruction. This requirement for the Treasurer's consent is an important legislative aspect of the four pillars policy because it gives the Treasurer the right to approve or refuse a merger between the big four banks. But schedule 2, item 53 of the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 1) 1999 makes it clear that the Treasurer's consent is not required where the business of an authorised deposit taking institution is transferred under the Financial Sector (Transfers of Business) Bill 1999, another bill now before the House.
Labor absolutely rejects the government's attempt to remove the requirement for the Treasurer to consent under the Banking Act 1959. As I will discuss in the context of the transfers of business bill, removing this consent may mean there is no role whatsoever for the Treasurer where a transfer application is made. In other words, the Treasurer could stand by and watch the four pillars tumble, having no power to prevent two of the major four banks effectively merging.
The removal of the requirement for the Treasurer's consent may have been done in an attempt to streamline the transfer process. But its effect, intended or not, is potentially to weaken the four pillars policy, and that is entirely unacceptable. If the government does not stand by the four pillars policy, it must say so clearly; and if it does, it must state that categorically and reinforce it with legislation; it must amend the bill to ensure that the Treasurer has to consent under the Banking Act to a transfer.
I said before that Labor has generally been supportive of the Wallis recommendations. However, as has been made clear, we consider that not all of the Wallis recommendations serve the financial sector or the wider Australian community well. The recommendation to remove the four pillars policy is one such recommendation, and that came out in Wallis. 
Labor takes the view that, in the current Australian market, mergers between the major four banks are not in the national interest. The government appears to have been—to put it as kindly as possible—`confused' on its stance. The Treasurer has said that it will not happen until the margins for small business lending improve and new entrants appear in the financial sector. But what details the Treasurer has attached to these criteria are unknown. They smack of the wriggle room of conveniently vague tests that he will be able to announce as having been satisfied when he decides to announce that he has consented to a merger that collapses the four pillars policy.
The Financial Sector (Transfers of Business) Bill, the second bill in this package tonight, does not provide any reassurance that the four pillars policy is set in concrete. As with the first of the bills, the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill, Labor will not oppose this second bill in the House. But we do reserve our position in the Senate, pending the outcome of the Senate committee inquiry.
The bill allows authorised deposit taking institutions or life insurance companies to transfer their business amongst themselves so long as they get the approval of APRA. Two types of transfer are available, one voluntary and one compulsory. This power has been available under state and territory laws for building societies, credit unions and friendly societies. The bill is intended to ensure that they retain access to those provisions. However, the bill also extends the power to other authorised deposit taking institutions and life insurance companies. It is extending what has been transferred. Hence, the bill opens the way for transfers of business—in other words, mergers—between the four major banks and between major life insurers.
Currently, a stringent process is to be followed before mergers can occur between the four major banks. This point was set out very clearly in an article in the Australian Financial Review on 15 March this year, on page  26,  under  the  by-line  of  Hans van Leeuwen:
At present, banks can only merge through one bank buying all the shares in another, or through a scheme of arrangement worked out in the courts.
Transferring assets and liabilities between banks is virtually impossible, because many bank assets cannot be handed over without borrower consent.
""It's not really practical at the moment because banks have such complex assets and liabilities,"" said Clayton Utz partner Mr Brian Salter. ""You'd need the consent of all the counterparties. But now the banks—
that is, under the current bill—
can fast-track that.""
Currently, you need the consent of the counterparties. But this bill provides a new mechanism, with which it may be easier to comply, where you will not need to get the counterparties to agree.
Whilst the bill requires APRA approval for a voluntary transfer to be satisfied that the proposed transfer has been `adequately adopted' by both the transferring body and the receiving body, there is absolutely no guidance in the bill as to what `adequately adopted' means. Treasury provided written advice to my office when we sought further clarification of the point. They said:
APRA will set out transfer rules which need to be met for APRA to be able to accept that a body has agreed to a proposed transfer.
This is quite extraordinary. Legislative safeguards have been built up over years to protect shareholders and creditors during mergers, takeovers and acquisitions and yet this bill says that for transfers all that will be worked out by regulation. It will not be contained in the legislation but done through regulation.
Who knows what adequate adoption means. Maybe it is as simple as a signed form from one director. That would be, again, quite extraordinary. Who knows, though, because there is nothing in the bill. It is all being left to the regulations. In other words, `Trust us, we're the government' is essentially the theme of this new bill.
The bill contains a section that has the effect of exempting anything done under the bill from the operation of any other act unless that other act is prescribed in regulation. That means—understand this point, Mr Deputy 
 Speaker—that, even if the transfer breached the merger provisions of section 50 of the Trade Practices Act, it would not matter. What sort of nonsense is this? Here is a situation where Treasury has assured us that the Trade Practices Act will effectively be prescribed in regulations. But there is nothing to compel the government to do it in the bill. Again, `Trust us, we're the government.'
If the government is so certain that it is going to incorporate the Trade Practices Act by regulation, why not just put it in the bill itself and enshrine it in the legislation? While it is about it, why not include the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998, the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeover Act 1991 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 as well?
The more you dig, the dirtier the bill gets. In deciding whether to permit transfers, the bill provides that APRA may consult with the ACCC but is not compelled to do so. This, again, is entirely unacceptable. The ACCC is the competition watchdog of the economy. It must be involved in monitoring institutional changes within the financial sector. Even the Treasurer said in September 1997, in the government's response to the Wallis report, that the government agreed with the general approach that:
Prudential arrangements should . . . minimise adverse effects on competition, competitive neutrality and efficiency.
Yet here is a government saying that APRA does not need to consult with the ACCC, the national competition watchdog, on whether transfers, which may well result in massive institutional change in the sector, will affect competition. Where does the Treasurer get off in relation to this?
—It's wrong.
—It is not wrong. If it is wrong, get the minister to come before this House and explain where this analysis is wrong. Written advice from Treasury says that the reason the bill says APRA `may' rather than `must' consult with the ACCC is `due to matters of scale and urgency'. That is a great detailed response; it is due to matters of scale and urgency. It may instead of must. It is a pretty significant distinction, which 
 even the member for Wannon might start to acknowledge once he listens to this argument. There is nothing in the legislation to compel APRA to consult. If the member for Wannon believes that there is, he should get up in this House and show where it is.
Under the scale test, APRA sets the competition threshold, throwing the ACCC's merger guidelines out the window. What a strange state of affairs—with APRA, the prudential regulator, becoming the competition regulator on assessments of whether or not the anticompetitive aspects of a proposed transfer warrant the ACCC's involvement. The ACCC must be consulted. On the urgency front, the ACCC is able to turn around approvals for merger proposals where they are not anticompetitive, often in less than a day. That is the truth of it. So we reinforce the point that the ACCC must be consulted.
Unlike the current requirements under the Banking Act, this bill provides that the minister does not have to consent to the transfer. At the moment under the Banking Act, the minister must consent. This bill reverses that. Again, when we have sought advice on this point, Treasury's advice is that the minister `will not waive the requirement for his consent for large financial institutions such as the four major banks'. The statement is, at best, an indication of how the minister will exercise his complete discretion under the act. But there is nothing in the act to prevent him from abandoning that indication. After all, what we are talking about here is the man who, as Treasurer, said he would never, ever introduce a GST, and then did.
The minister, the Treasurer, must be compelled to consent or refuse to consent to a proposed transfer. The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, in a letter to the Australian Financial Review on 22 March, said that the Treasurer would have to consent to mergers anyway under the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998. But that would only occur where a person sought to hold a stake above 15 per cent in a financial sector company. We asked the Treasury to advise of the possibility of avoiding the need to seek the Treasurer's consent under the act by not actually changing ownership of shares in a 
 transfer. We have not received a response to that specific request.
So we have concerns that, technically, a transfer may occur without the need to seek the Treasurer's consent and without the ACCC's involvement. That is the nub of our concern, and that is the issue that the government has to address. We have many concerns with this bill, and I have moved a second reading amendment which outlines those concerns. It is a second reading amendment that I understand has been circulated. We do understand the need for flexibility in the prudential mechanisms available in the financial sector, but that flexibility must be balanced against the other interests of shareholders and deposit holders and also the interests of the wider community in the provision of and access to financial services.
I want to turn, finally and briefly, to the last bill in this package, because it specifies rates of tax that apply to the retirement savings accounts business of friendly societies. On the superannuation front, the government has a very ordinary record indeed. It has gutted national savings, breaking its promise to deliver Labor's co-contribution scheme and replacing it with a half-baked savings rebate that lasted all of six weeks. The only savings policy introduced by this government—now into its fourth year of government—is something that lasted six weeks, and its retirement savings accounts will do little to advance the interests of savings and retirement incomes.
Although Labor believes the retirement savings accounts are second-class retirement savings vehicles when compared to superannuation accounts, the reality is that they do exist in the marketplace and this bill ensures that friendly societies that offer these RSAs will be able to compete with other institutions. As this bill is cognate with the other two financial sector reform bills, Labor reserves its position until after the Senate inquiry. I commend the second reading amendment to the House.

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—In listening to the member for Hotham speak on the Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and cognate bills, I felt he was rather confused and confusing. The contribution left one wondering just how much work he had done in looking at some of the proposals and the thrust of this legislation. While we would welcome his qualified support for the bills, I did find it a bit odd that, even though the Wallis inquiry reported nearly two years ago, he was trying to insinuate in some of his earlier comments that it has taken the government this long to respond. I find that very hard to understand, given there were 115 recommendations in the Wallis inquiry.
One of the major recommendations from the Wallis inquiry—and which we have heard quite a lot of debate about already—was the setting up of APRA. That was no small change to financial regulation, yet I remind the honourable member that APRA actually came into being on 1 July last year. So I do not know that this accusation about the government being tardy in responding to the Wallis inquiry is all that reasonable; I think it is fairly unreasonable.
I found quite a few of the comments in the member for Hotham's response somewhat inconsistent on these sorts of points. I almost felt at one stage that, in his comments, he was actually agreeing with the government's approach to economic management. I thought that was a very welcome response, and I hope he will continue to offer that support.
I think all people in Australia recognise that the fact Australia is in such a sound economic position at the moment is very much due to the government's economic management, very much due to the fact we have the budget back into balance and very much due to the strong leadership of the current government. It is those factors that have placed Australia and Australians in a very much stronger position than they otherwise would have been—particularly given the Asian financial crisis and the fact that something like six of our 10 major trading partners are currently in recession. Yet Australia continues to post very strong economic growth and some rates that 
 are the envy of not only the rest of the world but, secretly anyway, the Labor Party, who wish they could have achieved something similar.
I do find his comments on the four pillars policy a little bit strange also. Given that the four pillars policy was never set in concrete under Labor, why should it suddenly be set in concrete under the coalition? Let us face it, it was not set in concrete under Labor. But suddenly, because the boot is on the other foot, you say that it ought to be. I find that a bit confusing too.
The whole question of whether APRA, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, should or should not consult with the ACCC seems to overlook the fact that the ACCC has its own charter. Its responsibilities are very clear on the question of competition. The question of whether or not it has to consult seems to overlook the fact that the ACCC is independent and can indeed step in, as the Treasurer has made very clear on a number of occasions, when it comes to the whole question of competition.
Before getting back to the first two bills before the House, I want to say that I did have a wry smile when the member for Hotham talked about the third bill in this cognate debate, the  Income Tax Rates Amendment (RSAs Provided by Registered Organizations) Bill 1999 . He had the sheer audacity to come back to the l-a-w tax cuts. I just could not believe that. He was actually prepared to revisit the l-a-w tax cuts. No wonder he has left the chamber. He did not want to hear that one. It really was quite amazing.
I think it is important to note that these bills are part of the government's moves to further improve financial regulation. I welcome the qualified support. I trust that, as we go through this debate and as the Senate looks at the bills, we will see continuing support from the opposition on these bills. As is, I think, recognised by the opposition spokesman, the member for Hotham, the financial services inquiry, led by Stan Wallis, provided a very good framework for further improving our financial regulations in Australia. As I said, there were 115 recommendations. The govern 
 ment has moved with, I think, responsible haste to implement these recommendations, and I think that we are already seeing some of the benefits.
The financial system inquiry reported in March 1997, and the first bill, the  Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 1) 1999 , is one of a package of 11 bills implementing some of the recommendations. As Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, there are some aspects of this bill in which the committee does have a particular interest, these obviously being the changes that come with financial supervision and the changing of responsibilities from the Reserve Bank to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, having also served on the committee in the last parliament, you would be very much aware of these changes as, indeed, is the next speaker, the member for Chisholm, who is also taking a very keen interest in these changes. The logical progression of changing this regulation and setting up APRA has been welcomed throughout the financial community and has, in fact, been strongly supported in this parliament.
Schedule 1 of this bill seeks to expand and clarify APRA's functions undertaken as a result of an agreement with a state or territory. We recognise that it is important that we bring building societies and credit unions under the one regulatory authority. That has been recognised also by the states, and they have moved to make complementary legislation to achieve this.
The bill will also enable APRA to be contracted to provide prudential regulation or advice services on a fee-for-service basis, subject to the agreement of the minister. In schedule 2, the amendments extend the scope and reach of the Banking Act 1959 to include not just banks but all deposit taking institutions. Clearly, if we are going to have an efficient financial sector, we ought to bring the whole gamut of deposit taking institutions under the one prudential regulation. As has already been discussed, the bill also removes the responsibilities and powers of the Reserve 
 Bank to supervise banks and gives them to the Prudential Regulation Authority. The bill also allows for the establishment of a single licensing regime for banks and other non-bank deposit taking institutions to be overseen by APRA.
As I stated earlier, APRA was established in July last year with operational autonomy to prudentially supervise banks and other deposit taking institutions, life and general insurance companies and superannuation entities, and to develop policies in the performance of that role—a very responsible role.
To come back to the role of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, it will be very much part of the responsibilities of that committee to call APRA to account to the parliament—as, indeed, the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration already has the responsibility to call the Reserve Bank to account to the parliament. We look forward to that opportunity. I believe that the committee will, as has been demonstrated already with the Reserve Bank, show that it is more than up to the responsibility to undertake that task, and we will continue to take our role very seriously and responsibly.
Clearly, prudential regulation is concerned fundamentally with the quality of a financial institution's risk management systems, and APRA has been granted extensive powers of investigation, intervention and administration for the purpose of resolving the position of financial institutions which have become unviable. It is very important that the Australian public and the financial sector do have confidence that that role can be undertaken properly, and I believe that this bill helps to build on that role of APRA.
As I said, there are already moves under way to allow APRA to assume the regulation of building societies and credit unions. It is expected that, ultimately, APRA will have the responsibility for the entire financial sector except for merchant banks, finance companies and non-superannuation investment funds. The legislation also allows APRA to be funded by fees levied on institutions under its supervision in lieu of the current arrangement where 
 by the banks deposit one per cent of their eligible liabilities to the Reserve Bank. So that will obviously be an important change.
APRA will also have the power to issue and, most significantly, the power to revoke banking licences—a control, incidentally, that the Reserve Bank did not have. I would have thought that the member for Hotham would have taken that point on board because it is very significant. When he was talking about shortcomings, I think he overlooked this and a number of other matters when he was trying to nitpick the bills. He was struggling to find something that he could really be critical of, so it was just a nitpicking exercise rather than a serious analysis of the shortcomings because, frankly, I do not think you could find them.
It is also important to note that APRA will have the power to set prudential standards in addition to those made under the Banking Act. APRA will also be able to issue enforceable directions in relation to these standards, thus strengthening its capacity for early intervention in problem cases. That is the sort of reassurance that the Australian public expects from the government, and indeed I believe that the parliament will support that.
I note that the opposition is to move two amendments. The first amendment is to the  Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 1) 1999 . As I said earlier, the first point in this amendment really is a bit of nitpicking and overlooks the obvious when it talks about taking two years to respond. The fact that APRA has now been in place and operating for nearly nine months shows, quite clearly, that the government has moved quickly. It is self-evident to anyone who has the faintest understanding of what this is all about that setting up something new like APRA in any time less than the government has done would be asking the almost impossible. I would commend Graeme Thompson and his team who have set up APRA because I think they have done it very efficiently, very smoothly and very professionally. That is what would be expected, and that is the way the government has moved. As I say, this amendment really is nonsense in the light of that simple fact.
Part 4 of the amendment talks about the question of competition and bank fees and charges. I would draw to the attention of honourable members that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration in fact focused on this in its hearings with the Reserve Bank. In fact, at our last hearings held late last year, we raised this very issue with the Reserve Bank. We anticipate that the Reserve Bank will be responding to the committee at or before its next hearings in a few months time where in fact we will be seeking to find out just what the net position is for banking customers when it comes to the relative changes of the competition bringing down interest rate margins versus the increase in fees and charges that most bank customers are now paying.
In moving to the second bill, the  Financial Sector (Transfers of Business) Bill 1999 , I note that the member for Hotham in his amendment again makes the qualification `while supportive of continuing reform of the financial sector'—in other words, he is trying to have two bob each way, I think. He goes on to call on the government:
. . . to confirm that it will not use the provisions of this bill to relax its `four pillars' policy;
As I said earlier, this wears a bit thin when you look at the fact that, when Labor were in power, they had 13 years to do this, and they did not. They did not amend the Banking Act. They did not see the need to amend the Banking Act. I believe that the former member for Blaxland would have violently opposed any amendment of the Banking Act that would have taken away his discretion while he was Treasurer to have control over whether or not banks were able to merge. I hasten to add that the government has no intention or plans to allow that course to occur, but I do find it somewhat strange that the member for Hotham should be coming in here demanding something that in 13 years of government he never saw the need to have.
I commend the Treasurer for the way that he has handled this whole approach to the reform of financial regulation. I believe that the Wallis inquiry was one of those landmark inquiries that this nation is fortunate enough 
 to get every decade or so. I believe that the government has responded in a very responsible, measured way, which has shown that we are willing to undertake that reform in a way that will enhance the financial sector regulation while at the same time allowing the proper development of our financial institutions to be truly competitive as we go into the next millennium.
I would reject the comments of the member for Hotham. They really do show a somewhat confused approach to these bills, and there are a lot of inconsistencies in some of his comments. Nonetheless, I welcome the way he seemed to endorse the government's economic management in a very cautious manner. I hope that he will continue to find ways of doing that because, when a government is performing well, it does behove the opposition to give a bit of credit where credit is due. Sometimes when you listen to question time you would find that hard to believe but it seems that, when we come into the chamber later in the day, it is possible to believe. I hope that we might find ways of expanding the member for Hotham's compliments when he feels that they really are due.
So I think the government will be rejecting the amendments that have been put by the opposition. And I believe that these bills do, in fact, represent another step in implementing the Wallis inquiry's recommendations. It shows that the government is indeed setting out to build up a financial regulatory authority and a financial system that is capable of taking Australia into the next millennium with a financial system that not only is strong but will indeed enable us to attract business from the region and will truly make Australia a financial centre for this region—something that I know the Prime Minister and the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation are very keen to promote and something that I think, justifiably, this legislation helps to support.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I rise today to speak on one of the bills before the House, the Financial Sector (Transfers of Business) Bill 1999 . The ambiguity of this bill necessitates my rising to speak tonight on the threat it poses to the current four pillars 
 policy. I stated in my first speech in this House that I would take all opportunities to speak against any further erosion of the four pillars policy. It is with grave concern then that I, like many others, note the possibility that the bill is removing the four pillars policy by stealth.
This bill is part of the government's long-awaited second round legislative response to the Wallis financial system inquiry. It should not be forgotten that one of Wallis's recommendations was the removal of the then sixpillars policy. At the time the Treasurer stated that the removal of regulation over the four major banks would not be considered until there was greater competition in the market, especially in relation to small business lending and new entrants in the financial sector.
I rise today to challenge the government to go on the record and state that the measures in this bill are not there to erode the four pillars policy. In the minister's second reading speech he clearly states, `It is also good to facilitate change in the industry.' Change for change's sake is not necessary. Whilst Labor welcomes a progressive, dynamic, robust industry, it does not support change driven purely by a negative cost cutting agenda, simply designed to increase already massive profits. Concern about the bill's intent was canvassed in the Financial Review on Monday, 15 March 1999 in an article by Hans van Leeuwen. It said:
Banks have gained a new and simplified way to merge with each other under new Federal Government legislation tabled in Parliament last week.
Under the new rules, one bank can simply transfer all its liabilities and assets to another, an almost impossible task under the present regime.
The only proviso is that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Federal Treasurer must both give their imprimatur to the merger.
And, further on:
The legislation is part of the package that is moving credit unions, building societies and friendly societies to the APRA umbrella.
Those institutions already have the so-called ""transfer of business"" rules and the new legislation extends those rules to banks and insurance companies.  

. . .              . . .             . . .
The rules may also circumvent the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
The legislation says APRA can choose to consult with the ACCC on the rules, but does not have to.
Clearly I am not alone in my concerns over the intention in the bill. The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation did respond in a letter to the editor of the Financial Review  on Monday, 22 March 1999 and stated:
The Government has not changed its position on bank mergers policy as may have been inferred from ""Federal legislation makes bank mergers easier"" . . . The proposed transfer of business mechanism is an additional prudential tool available to facilitate a quick and effective transfer of business to protect depositors or policy owners where a financial institution is in distress.
Although the minister keeps asserting that the bill is a `tool for protecting depositors where their financial institution is in financial hardship', the mechanisms of the bill do not limit the scope for voluntary or compulsory transfers to cases where institutions are in financial difficulty.
The case for keeping the four pillars policy is sound and based on three key aspects: first, and most notably, jobs; second, public opposition to its removal; and third, no net benefit from further concentration of the financial industry in Australia. Turning to jobs first, employment in the finance industry is concentrated in the major banks and the leading life offices. McIntosh Baring, in its annual report Australia's banks, a ready reckoner in July 1996, suggests that 35,000 jobs would be lost as the result of an amalgamation process which would create two major banks. Allan Fels, Chairman of the ACCC, warned that any big bank merger would face a tough competitive test. In the Financial Review of 27 November 1998 he said:
If the ACC were asked to consider the merging of four pillars into three, it would also look at the competitive outcome of a two-pillar policy, because one merger among the big four banks was likely to be followed by another.
In the three years to 1997 there have been 23,000 retrenchments in the industry. This has combined with the general decline in employment numbers in some parts of the sector, a 
 decline in full-time employment, rising part-time and casual work and increased pressures on remaining staff—all creating incredibly high levels of insecurity in the work force. On the issue of jobs alone the government should commit to the retention of the four pillars policy. The loss of 35,000 to 40,000 jobs Australia-wide would have a devastating impact on unemployment levels and should not be contemplated by this or any government.
The second reason for keeping the four pillars policy is public opposition to its removal. The public has quite clearly indicated that it sees no benefit from big bank mergers and that it would be opposed to any further concentration in the industry. I quote from an article in the Financial Review on Friday, 27 November 1998 by Jeremy Flint. It stated:
The Australian Financial Review  has obtained a copy of Newspoll's report to a confidential client detailing the results of interviews with 1,200 people across the country on bank mergers. It concluded the political risks are ""very high"" for any Government or political party supporting mergers among the big four banks.
""A third of the general community would be less likely to support a party prepared to allow mergers,"" Newspoll's executive summary said.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Around 60 per cent of people polled on big bank mergers believed that customer service would be worse if they went ahead, 61 per cent expected higher fees and charges as a result, and 78 per cent expected fewer jobs.
""An overwhelming majority of Australians expect only negative outcomes from bank mergers,"" Newspoll's report said. ""These opinions are very firmly held.""
The third reason is that there is no net benefit from further concentration of the financial industry in Australia. The potential benefits to be derived from big bank mergers are equivocal at best, yet the major banks seem so sure that mega mergers are the only way forward for the Australian financial system. This is indicated by the beliefs of one of the retiring CEOs of Australia's largest bank, which has overseen a share price increase from $4 to $27—
—That's wonderful.
—It's fantastic—and profit increasing from $7.56 million to $2.5 billion. Can he still be disappointed that he has not secured a merger? This suggests either that he may retire with a healthier nest egg or that there is some evidence that mergers would pay off. Yet the existing evidence does not seem to support this belief. A 1995 Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report on the future of retail banking found that banks grew less efficient as they grew larger. The conclusion drawn is that the retail banking industry is currently not susceptible to scale economies and that banks of different sizes can coexist and be profitable.
The Financial Systems Inquiry Final Report of March 1997 summarised the evidence on efficiencies derivable from bank mergers:
. . . the evidence from studies on bank mergers and efficiencies to date has been at best equivocal on whether or not there are efficiency gains to be derived from mergers and on the whole points to there being no correlation between bank mergers and improved efficiency—although it is clear that some mergers do result in efficiency gains.
The Wallis report went on to say that this is not to say that cost savings are not possible, but in general it is efficiency gains which are considered to be of most benefit to the community and to be in the longer term interest of the performance of the industry.
Whilst it is clear that big bank mergers may produce cost reductions—and this is universally at the expense of jobs—this does not mean they will deliver efficiencies which can be passed onto customers through fee reductions, increased services, lower interest rates and the like. Cost reduction is achieved primarily through staff reductions, closure of branches, data processing and operations. One study found that the reduction in staff costs accounted for over half of the total cost reductions. On the whole, the evidence does not suggest that mergers are a guarantee of success. The banks have made numerous assertions that they can survive only if the four pillars are removed and that the sky will fall in if they are barred from mergers. This is not supported by research.
The recent Canadian experience subjected the arguments for mega bank mergers to a high level of scrutiny by a number of bodies. 
 The evidence before the task force included, firstly, a 1997 survey of 23 different studies of mergers which found that, for large multiproduct banks, growth in size does not produce any important efficiencies of scale or scope; secondly, the opinion of a European professor of banking and finance that overall institutional business fails to enhance profitability systematically; thirdly, a study by Mercer Management Consulting of 500 US and Canadian mergers since 1990 which found that two out of three mergers fail as the new entity underperforms in the industry. The final report of the task force notes the chairmen of the banks seeking mergers were invited to present evidence which refuted the `indications from the international evidence that merges of this sort are unlikely to generate economies of scale or scope'. They provided no persuasive, substantive responses. 	I challenge the Australian banks to demonstrate the need for mergers because, of all the studies I have read and those I have quoted in my address to the House, none actually categorically make this claim.
The bill proposes several changes which could in effect erode the four pillars policy. The bill removes the key elements of current protection in the four pillars policy: the removal of the requirement for the Treasurer to approve the merger and the role of the ACCC in assessing the effect of a proposed merger on competition. On the removal of the Treasurer's consent, section 63 of the Banking Act 1959 as it currently stands requires the Treasurer's consent before an ADI can amalgamate, enter a partnership with another ADI or enter a reconstruction. This is an important legislative aspect of the four pillars policy, as it gives the Treasurer the right to approve or refuse a merger between the big four banks on the basis of public interest. It is important that the ultimate political responsibility rests with the government for a decision in which all citizens have a substantial interest, both economic and otherwise. The  Financial Sector (Transfers of Business) Bill 1999  removes the necessity for the Treasurer to consent to either a voluntary or compulsory transfer. The Treasurer could stand by and watch the four pillars tumble, with no power to prevent two of the major four banks effectively merging. 
 The requirement that the Treasurer has to consent under the Banking Act to a transfer must be maintained at all costs.
I turn now to the role of the ACCC in assessing the effect of a proposed merger on competition. The bill does not require APRA to consult with the ACCC. It may do so if it chooses, but there is no compulsion. The role that the ACCC currently performs in assessing the effect of a proposed merger on competition and on public benefit grounds must remain a key feature of the regulatory structure of the finance sector. Any move away from the current enshrining of these obligations in the acts to regulation is a watering down of the current protection and leaves one wondering if this bill is the beginning of the end for the four pillars policy. I reiterate the warning of the Finance Sector Union about the massive job losses that this would create and call on the government to articulate its position on the four pillars policy.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—The Financial Sector Reform (Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill (No. 1) 1999  and cognate bills represent the second stage of the Wallis financial reforms, which were initiated in response to the report of the financial system inquiry, chaired by Stan Wallis. As I noted in my second reading speech, the aim of the second stage is to transfer regulatory supervision for building societies, credit unions and friendly societies from the states and territories to the Commonwealth. This is fundamental reform that will provide a new regulatory system that is less cumbersome and duplicative than the state and territory financial institution system. It will enable the non-bank deposit taking sector, including building societies and credit unions, to provide a more effective source of competition for the banks in the retail market. They will operate under the same rules as banks and will be prudentially regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, and regulated as companies by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC. There will be a single regulatory framework for life insurance companies 
 and friendly societies which also recognises the special features of friendly societies.
The opposition has expressed concern that the government's four pillars policy will be undermined by the Financial Sector (Transfers of Business) Bill 1999 . This is not so. The four pillars policy remains intact. APRA will, of course, take into account government policies when assessing applications. In addition, concerns have been expressed that decisions may be made which fail to take into account the operation of other acts such as the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act. In response, I note that subclause 43(4) of the transfers of business bill enables other acts to be prescribed by regulations to ensure their independent operation. Subclause 11(2) of the transfers of business bill provides that APRA must not approve a transfer of business if it would be contrary to the purposes of an act prescribed under the provisions mentioned in subclause 43(4).
The government intends to prescribe the following acts as a minimum under subclause 43(4) of the transfers of business bill. They are: the Trade Practices Act 1974, the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998, the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1991, and the Foreign Acquisition and Takeovers Act 1995. I urge the Labor Party not to be sidetracked by this illusory factor which they have created in their own minds about four pillars. This bill provides APRA with the prudential supervision power to transfer businesses that are in financial distress. I will repeat that: this bill provides APRA, who has the prudential supervision of financial institutions, with the power to transfer businesses that are in financial distress and subject to all the points that I have made before. It deals explicitly with it. The Labor Party has a history with financial institutions that have been in distress. Given their history, given their record of dealing with banks, whether as a customer of a bank or as a shareholder in a bank, I urge the Labor Party not to stand between this very important bill and the prudential supervision of financial institutions.
I make one final point: these bills are intended to take effect from 1 July this year. We have the support of the credit unions, the 
 friendly societies and the building societies for it to take effect from 1 July this year. We want it to come into effect as soon as possible. The states have all agreed—that is, the Liberal and Labor states and territories—with these bills. They want them to take effect as soon as possible. They want one regulatory regime for various parties. Unfortunately, the Labor Party stands in the way.
I want to take a moment to reflect on the lack of prudential supervision of financial institutions in the past. The House is surely aware that the state banks were not prudentially supervised by the RBA when they were operating, unless it was a voluntary reference. As far as I am aware, the state banks of South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales were not prudentially supervised by the RBA. The effect of that was to allow those financial institutions to run out of control. In the case of the State Bank of South Australia, it decided to build its loan book from around $4 billion to around $23 billion in a matter of five or six years. The net effect of that was to put enormous pressure on the bank and on its internal controls. There was very little supervision of the loan book.
At the same time, the State Bank of South Australia started up an arm called Beneficial Finance, an investment banking arm. Beneficial Finance was making loans that would make the hairs curl on any prudential supervisor. They were making loans right outside of their charter. The effect of that was that, when the great credit crunch that Paul Keating said we had to have came and interest rates shot up to 21 per cent, all these bad loans came home to roost.
As the South Australian Liberal Party said prior to the last election, the South Australian State Bank cost an estimated $13 billion to the people of South Australia. It effectively destroyed what had been the excellent financial record of South Australia up until the mid eighties. Operators like Tim Marcus Clarke were allowed to get away with blue murder by John Bannon. There was no prudential supervision of the state's financial institutions with the net effect being that the people of South Australia had to pick up the pieces of the Bannon-Marcus Clarke partnership. They 
 are still paying for it and they will be paying for it for a generation.
The same lack of prudential supervision applied in Victoria. The State Bank of Victoria decided that it wanted to get into a more aggressive side of lending. Therefore, Tricontinental was set up. In my experience, and I have some intimate knowledge of this, Tricontinental took charge of horses as security for loans. When we went to go and find those horses, the security for multimillion dollar loans, I was advised, `The horses are in the local supermarket. If you go to the third row on the fourth shelf, you'll find a can of Pal dog food, and that's probably where the horse is.' That is because the horses were worth nothing to begin with. Tricontinental was using the savings of Victorians to take charge of horses that were barely performing and that were of no value.
So when it came to the great Keating credit crunch, what happened? All these bad loans came home to roost. It was a tragedy because the people of Victoria ended up paying for the bad lending tactics of the State Bank of Victoria and Tricontinental. The net effect was that Keating had to come and bail out the State Bank of Victoria. He said the Commonwealth Bank—he liked dealing with the Commonwealth Bank—would take the good loan book and they would leave the bad loan book with the government and the people of Victoria. In the case of the State Bank of New South Wales, I would like to think that I have some knowledge of this, but I will refer to Trevor Sykes's book, The Bold Riders. Trevor Sykes's book opens up with the classic example where the State Bank of New South Wales was proposing to lend money to Bond Brewing that in one loan was almost greater than the entire capital of the State Bank of New South Wales.
This is the great 1980s, that wonderful time when there was no prudential supervision of financial institutions. I think the opposition agrees with us—that is, we do not want to go back to the bad old days of the 1980s. We do not want to go back to the days when there was no prudential supervision of financial institutions. That is why governments stay out of owning financial institutions. That is why 
 we have set up APRA under Wallis. APRA are going to supervise all financial institutions. That is why we specifically give them the power to transfer business activities within those financial institutions to another financial institution if that financial institution is in distress. I have dealt with that explicitly. I have cited the number of acts that will be prescribed, particularly the Trade Practices Act. Any bank mergers will require approval under the Trade Practices Act, specific approval.
Under those circumstances, we are not going to be sold off with a Labor Party searching for something to stand on. We are not going to be sold off on that. We are going to stick to our guns, because this side of the House believes in the proper prudential supervision of financial institutions. That side of the House opposes it at every point. We believe in the proper activities of financial institutions where people putting their money in banks, building societies, credit unions and friendly societies know that at the end of the day they have a very good chance of getting their money back and that it is not going to be lent on some stupid activity which state banks across Australia acted on in the 1980s. We are past those days.
This is the final step to the end of the 1980s. I would be severely distressed if the Labor Party decided to oppose the proper prudential supervision of financial institutions. You cannot hang your hat on this. You oppose us on everything we do—tax reform, youth wages, Telstra, industrial relations reform, everything. Now you are going to oppose us on this—Wallis reforms, reforms that have been lauded by the International Monetary Fund as being world path breaking reforms, regulatory reforms and prudential supervision that are the envy of Asia, our nearest neighbours. In this case, the Asian region wishes it had regulatory reform like this and prudential supervision like this. We are taking a very strong stand on it. We are leaders in the region and are regarded as leaders in the world in prudential supervision. We will continue to push ahead with these reforms, notwithstanding the obstruction of the Labor Party at every point.

Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM (AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Kernot, Cheryl, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1998 forms part of the government's ongoing review of civil aviation legislation and contains a number of machinery amendments. These include replacing a number of technical terms in the Civil Aviation Act; giving the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the power to expand the list of key personnel that the holder of an Air Operator's Certificate will be required to have; replacing the definition in the Civil Aviation Regulations of `domestic commercial flight' with `regulated domestic flight', making it clear that safety regulation is not to be based fundamentally on the commercial nature of an aviation activity; replacing the current mandatory requirement for applicants for an AOC to supply flight manuals to CASA with a requirement for a manual only where a new type of aircraft is being introduced into Australia for the first time; giving CASA new powers to retain seized goods for more than 60 days and to destroy seized goods after application to a court; making fees prescribed by regulations payable to CASA, with any unpaid fee becoming a debt owed to CASA; and provisions for CASA to issue, by way of a disallowable instrument, design standards for aircraft for which standards are not in place on an equivalent level of safety principle.
These are all technical changes. They are important. They signal that positive reform is proceeding at CASA, despite recent events so clearly chronicled in Four Corners tonight. The opposition has no problem with these technical changes; we see them as sensible and desirable. But we have concerns, serious concerns, about the actual process of reform in aviation safety and airspace management and about the future direction of CASA.
Last week Mr Dick Smith resigned as Chairman of CASA. I do not intend to revisit the recent debate about Mr Smith's term at CASA. But I do want to take this opportunity to urge the minister and the government to ensure that his successor is a genuinely non-political and independent appointment. Mr Smith, for all his undeniable commitment and energy, was not such an appointment. In a 
 complex industry such as aviation with its competing vested interests, it is a recipe for disaster to have someone perceived, rightly or wrongly, to be running his own particular reform agenda at the possible expense of other sectors of the industry.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Listening to the honourable member I note that, in speaking of the appointment of the chairman, she is now moving to areas which are quite outside the leave of this particular bill. This is a pure regulatory change, a technical change in terms of the bill itself. The member has moved through that fairly swiftly and now plans a wide ranging debate on matters that happen to suit her own political agenda. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would ask that you bring her back to the leave of the bill and ask her not to pursue these political excursions.
—Order! There is no point of order, but I will listen carefully to the member to ensure that she is speaking to the bill.
—Because we are entitled to have confidence in the implementation of these technical changes, those charged with the actual implementation of these technical amendments are very much a question that we should be addressing tonight. Therefore, I do not believe that I am ranging outside some of the considerations of this bill.
To continue my remarks, it is also apparent that, under Mr Smith, CASA suffered greatly from the conflict of interest generated by it being the architect and advocate of a particular airspace reform agenda known as Airspace 2000 and by being the regulator and monitor of these reforms. That conflict was identified by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation as having a `detrimental impact on aviation safety', and it has been a major cause of tension both within CASA and between CASA and other organisations.
In this respect, with hindsight, Australian aviation may have been better served having Mr Smith driving airspace reform in some other capacity. I am not saying that this is the case or that the debate about the direction or pace of that reform would have been any less divisive than it has been. But we would have 
 avoided what has been a very damaging conflict of interest between CASA wanting to design and drive the reform agenda and also being required to regulate it in terms of its safety. I hope the minister will take action to address that conflict of interest, irrespective of who is appointed the new chair of CASA.
I also want to talk about the pace of reform in this area. I think those pushing for a faster pace have failed to grasp a very fundamental point: that you ultimately achieve successful reform by taking your time and bringing people with you. If you do not consult with people, if you do not educate people, if you do not at least recognise their right to protest, to protect their own interests, whether those interests are jobs for their members or profits for their shareholders, then you are setting yourself up for a bitter divisive and ultimately unsuccessful path to reform.
Look no further, Mr Deputy Speaker, than the continuing level of support for One Nation in regional Australia to see where failure to bring people with you down the path of reform can lead. Aviation is full of vested interests and, from the airlines to the unions to the private pilots and the sports aviators, it is hard to think of an industry sector that is not. Everyone has an interest to protect and a barrow to push, and it will never be easy steering a course through that minefield of interests. But it is not helpful to force organisations into entrenched positions through a failure to consult widely and fairly, a failure to be open and transparent about decision making and a failure to properly manage the diversity of interests within aviation.
CASA is not the only organisation to blame for that outcome. Airservices Australia has a far from perfect record in this regard as well. Often, of course, CASA is in a no-win situation. For every person who contacts me and criticises CASA for not taking action on something, there is another person criticising CASA for taking action, and often on the same matter and often involving the same operator. I have letters telling me that CASA has been too heavy-handed or unfair on a particular operator and other letters telling me that CASA has been slack or not tough 
 enough on the same operator. So CASA is an organisation that is often damned if it does and damned if it does not.
It is also an organisation that is the front line of blame for just about any aviation accident, irrespective of the primary causes of the accident. That also puts a lot of pressure and stress on CASA from board members and senior management through to its people out in the field. I have no doubt that CASA is a demoralised and troubled organisation at the moment. John Wood, the Chairman of CASA's pilot council, recently described the current round of in-fighting as leaving `a bitter legacy of mistrust, division, confusion and demoralisation'. He says that the mistrust is deep and widespread and that:
. . . strong and principled leadership in both technical and political fields is needed if the wounds are ever to be healed and confidence restored.
That must now be the priority for any new chair of CASA, for the Director of CASA, Mr Mick Toller, and for the minister.
One issue that I have tried to highlight in aviation debates in the chamber so far has been the role of the minister. The minister needs to pull responsibility for CASA and for the management of airspace reform and aviation safety back on to his desk. It is true that there has been something of a slide away from ministerial responsibility and accountability. That does not mean that we need a ministerial response to each and every aviation incident in the country and it does not mean ministerial interference in CASA's functions. However, it does mean a more accountable climate and a willingness to give CASA directions where appropriate and to influence CASA's strategic approach as envisaged by the Civil Aviation Act.
CASA's recent history has given a fair amount of ammunition to those who want to see it brought back within the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services. They argue that turning CASA into a statutory authority has resulted not so much in an independent organisation but a highly politicised one and that the move to the statutory authority has led to a reduction in government responsibility and public ac 
 countability for aviation safety. I am not yet convinced of the case for moving CASA back within the department, but the fact is that those concerns will continue to grow while the government continues to push responsibility for aviation safety off its desk, be it through a lack of interest, winding back safety services or the privatisation or contracting out of key safety functions.
Where the government and opposition quite clearly differ on the issue of aviation is that we in Labor see aviation safety as a public responsibility and a crucial one. It deserves and requires the full attention of government and the full attention of the relevant minister. The Civil Aviation Act very clearly gives the minister the power to direct CASA in the general performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers. It clearly gives the minister the power to give CASA notice about its strategic direction. That reflects the intention when the original Civil Aviation Authority was set up. A balance needed to be struck between removing detailed control over the day-to-day operations of the authority on the one hand and public accountability on the other. We have slipped too far away from the ministerial responsibility and public accountability side of that balance. That must change if public confidence in aviation safety is to be restored.
Finally, two other general aspects of CASA remain of concern. The first is CASA's current restructuring program and the general climate of cost cutting that threatens to undermine CASA's capacity to do its job. The opposition has certainly welcomed some aspects of the CASA restructuring, particularly the decisions to centralise enforcement decisions and to direct more resources towards safety, education and training for the aviation industry. However, CASA has failed to establish how it plans to maintain or improve its regulation of aviation safety with a 10 per cent staff cut. CASA has lost a lot of experienced employees in recent years. I believe that that has had a detrimental effect on its work in the field. It is hard to see how that can be turned around with 10 per cent of the work force being made redundant. CASA has said that the majority of positions lost 
 will be administrative. But CASA has many technically qualified people in managerial or administrative positions. The loss of these people, I believe, will be very keenly felt.
We also need to understand how these staff cuts connect with cuts in other areas of CASA. For example, we know that CASA plans to reduce flying hours and flying training for its flying operations inspectors. This move must have an impact on CASA's capacity to exercise quality control and on its general credibility within the industry.
The other concern I have is about the general transparency of decision making in CASA and in Airservices Australia about airspace management and aviation safety. It is difficult to see how anyone can have confidence in the future of aviation safety in Australia when nobody knows exactly where we are heading. The government's refusal to release the Hawke review of structural reform within Airservices Australia is a case in point. The so-called Business Transformation Program within Airservices is well under way, with a reported likely loss of 1,400 jobs and plans for privatisation and the contracting out of key safety functions and services going ahead. The government is still refusing to tell either the aviation industry or the Australian public precisely what those plans are.
So there is a lot of work to be done in restoring confidence in CASA and its ability to regulate aviation safety. Part of that work will come with a genuinely independent and non-political appointment as chair, part of it will come with a more open and more consultative reform process and an important part of it will come with the acceptance by this government that aviation safety is a public responsibility. It is not an arms-length statutory authority, `don't worry me about it until something happens' kind of approach; it is a public responsibility for which the government and the minister of the day remain accountable.",REPS,<title>CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Jull, David, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—Obviously, there is going to be a very wide ranging debate on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1998 . May I just pick up a couple of points that have been made by the honourable member for Dickson tonight. I guess one 
 of the great advantages of having served in this place for a long time is that you accumulate a corporate memory. Perhaps the honourable member for Dickson ought to go back and look at the history of civil aviation in Australia, in particular the history of civil aviation in the last 25 or 27 years.
There is no doubt that it has been a very troubled area for a great deal of time. I suggest that that trouble goes back to 1974. In 1974 the then minister for transport, the Hon. Charles Jones, made the first major reformation of the civil aviation department. Sir Donald Anderson, who was one of the doyens and I guess one of the icons of Australian aviation, had run a very tight-knit and efficient department. It was in fact the envy of the world. It was in fact Australia being the most air safety conscious country in the world and a leader in aviation safety. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Dickson come in here tonight and suggest that the civil aviation organisations should go back into the department of transport.
—I didn't say that.
—I am glad you did not say that, because it was Charles Jones who started that and that is when all the trouble began. The day they took that specialist administration of aviation out of it and put it with roads, trains and boats was the beginning of the end and the beginning of the trouble, and it happened under a Labor transport minister.
The second great difficulty happened in the mid-eighties with the corporatisation of civil aviation. It was then that we lost so much of the corporate memory, because people with any experience left by the drove. They took the early retirement. They took big paying jobs here and overseas. They went into the airlines and we were bereft of a great deal of the experience we had enjoyed. The real difficulty we have had with the administration of civil aviation in the last 25 or 27 years is that we have had constant interference, we have had constant turmoil and we have lost sight of the ball in many respects, because there was a major change in the nature of civil aviation during that period and that change is going to continue as that industry continues to grow.
It is quite interesting at the moment. We hear everywhere about the Asian downturn. We hear about difficulties being faced by the tourism industry and the international airlines. In actual fact, what we have in Australia is a six per cent annual growth in civil aviation happening anyway. That growth over these next couple of years is going to become even greater. The advent of the Olympic Games and the emergence of greater private pilotage around Australia are going to put enormous pressures on the system, and we really are going to have to look at major reformation of those systems so we can maintain that reputation as one of the safest areas of the world in which to fly.
I felt I should say those things because I get terribly upset when I hear the blame being apportioned in a completely political matter. In actual fact, as I said, I think administrators in Australia have lost sight of the ball in terms of aviation over the last 25 years. I have every confidence that the present minister will have the capacity to get that right. I just hope that those reforms come in speedily, that they are accepted and that the accusations that were made tonight on the Four Corners program can be done away with.
I think in many respects that is one of the real difficulties we have. Many in the civil aviation industry do regard the whole thing as a club. It is very conservative. It is very hard to get change in some of those areas. The accusation was made on that program tonight that pilots are some of the most conservative people around. I think that is right. For people to say that they should not be in administration if they have not had any aviation experience is not necessarily correct. Quite often, it is good to have people in from the outside who have that capacity to look at the big picture and try to work out exactly what is going to be needed.
I also take up comments made by the honourable member for Dickson in terms of some of the reforms that are going around at the moment. She made particular reference to Australia examining things like privatisation. I sincerely suggest that she go on her study trip and look at some of the incredible things 
 that have been achieved in places like the United Kingdom. It is very much the case that the Australian aviation administration and the UK aviation administration were in parallel for a great number of years. In the United Kingdom now, there have been major reforms.
We start talking about the privatisation of air traffic control in Australia and everybody shudders. They have done it in the UK, and the efficiency of its operation has been absolutely enormous. One of the very big secrets of privatisation is to make sure that you give the air traffic controllers the right to buy the system. I would say that, if we had a situation where air traffic control in a place like Sydney was put out to tender and the air traffic controllers took over that system, they would find ways of making that work. They would find ways of making it work to the extent that we could compare ourselves in terms of those efficiencies with places like the United States.
Here we are in the 1990s heading for the year 2000 and we still have these indeterminable separations of aircraft operating in and out of Sydney. There are separations of up to three minutes. It is not necessarily because the equipment is wrong; it is because our operational procedures may not necessarily be right on cue. It is amazing, isn't it, that you can get 32-second separations at Los Angeles airport, but you have to wait three minutes in Sydney. We have this capacity to get, at an absolute maximum, something like 80 aircraft movements in an hour with two runways in Sydney. It is areas like that that we should really be looking at in terms of lightening up the system, because the pressure that is going to be there next year is going to be absolutely enormous.
I would really like to get back to the context of the bill because, as was pointed out in a point of order a little earlier, these are technical amendments which I think are generally welcomed by the industry. The amendments recognise the internationalisation of aviation, the fact that this global shrinkage is coming and that Australia very much is going to play an even greater role in the tightening up of this administration of aviation. Consequently, some of these amend 
 ments are designed simply to make sure we do have that international harmonisation.
In some parts of Australia, if you mentioned the word `globalisation', they would go into a case of white terror. In actual fact, globalisation of aviation is with us at the moment whether we like it or not. It is with us in the operations of the major airlines. Today we have seen that Ansett and one of its parent companies, Air New Zealand, have joined the Star Alliance, and that they are now in with United, Lufthansa, Thai, Scandinavian, Varig and Canadian airlines operating a global system. That will mean some very big changes in the way airlines do their business in Australia. On the other hand, Qantas and British Airways have also set up their own particular network of operators. There is a third one on the horizon with KLM, North West and some of their affiliates.
Basically, what we are heading for is a globalised industry where the operations are not necessarily going to be in the complete control of us here. I think that that is going to be one of the great trends. It is going to bring some very big advantages too for airline operators. It will be a globalised business and there are going to be some tremendous advantages and tremendous cost savings in doing it. Obviously, some of these amendments that we are looking at tonight are pointing in this direction.
I want to make reference to the fact that, at last, by virtue of these amendments, we are going to allow Australian experimental aircraft and Australian aircraft manufacturers a real chance of getting into what is an exciting and challenging industry, and what can be a very profitable industry. During the six years or so when I was the opposition spokesman on aviation, one of the great frustrations that I had was seeing some of the experimental work that was being done in Australia and knowing the real difficulties that those people who were doing this work were having in being able to test their aircraft and get operators' certificates. Quite frankly, we lost a lot of that business. It does not really matter if it is crop-dusting aircraft in Gippsland or if it is light aircraft out of places like Maroochy 
 dore and Bundaberg, we do have some very good operators there.
One of the things that excites me about this prospect is that we are really going to take these experimental aircraft to our bosom and take these radical new aircraft designs, which I am sure will come out of Australia, into our operations. It gives us some enormous opportunities not only to support the industries in some of these more remote areas of Australia but also to go out into the international marketplace and make an impression.
I have mentioned before in this place a visit I made some years ago to a place called Mojave in the middle of the Mojave Desert, about 180 miles out of Los Angeles. There are parallels that could be drawn between the operations that went on there at that particular operation and the operations at a place like Alice Springs, which is a huge airport. In terms of privatisation prospects, it probably is not, in its present operation, going to be the most profitable in the world, but because of the nature of the weather out there and the climatic conditions it gives us an opportunity to become very much an aviation centre for the Asia-Pacific region.
One of the operations that Mojave has at its base in the middle of the Mojave Desert is a civilian flight test centre. It is one of the major areas in the world where these experimental aircraft are tested and ultimately certified before they go to manufacture. That is a huge business. When I was there I was absolutely amazed to see how many Australians were there with their inventions. They were doing all their testing there because it was all too hard in Australia. I hope that, as a result of some of these amendments tonight, there is an opportunity for us to get into some of those areas to make sure that we take full benefit of the facilities that these amendments are going to make. That is an exciting prospect that Australia can certainly take full advantage of to get into the construction of new aircraft and new aircraft types. There is no doubt about the ingenuity of Australians. There is no doubt about our capacity in aviation and aircraft design. We have got quite an enviable record. I would hope that the industry will take up the opportunities that 
 are being made by the provisions of this bill to get into those particular areas.
As part of the overall reform of Australian aviation, these particular amendments, while they do not look terribly spectacular on paper, are going to be quite far reaching, and they do have some very real ramifications for the changing nature of aviation around the world. I certainly welcome them, and commend the government and the minister for bringing them into the House at this time.",REPS,<title>CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I will not speak long on this issue, the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1998 , because it has already been stated that we support the proposed amendment. We certainly support the concept of air safety. The principles underlying the new regulations are quite clear, they are concise and they obviously should be supported. But if ever there was a country that had a great deal to advantage itself by in efficient and effective air services, it is Australia. We are a country that loves to endorse new technology, we like to travel, we have a high disposable income and, as the former speaker, the member for Fadden, Mr Jull, has indicated, we have air services that are growing at six per cent a year.
The unfortunate thing is that over recent months we have been greatly troubled by some experiments with air safety. That has culminated in the resignation of the Chairman of CASA, for reasons that he knows best. We have also seen issues like staff cuts at CASA at a time when there is concern about air safety. We have seen trials with G class airspace that have not been understood by the industry or explained to the community. We certainly had the precedent of a high-ranking Air Force officer in my own electorate requiring that all Air Force planes, if they were flying in that space, not only had a pilot but also had an observer when that trial was taking place.
These are issues that have certainly clouded the issue of air safety in Australia. But I am also sure that, like me and, I am sure, you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in recent weeks most members have received a number of letters from IOPA and from people with private pilot licences because that is the sort of nation we 
 are. People who have private airstrips and who own their own personal small aircraft are, of course, putting enormous pressure on CASA too to freelance Airservices.
There is no doubt that they have a very strong case, but the important thing is that we have to have a system that is accepted by the industry and the community alike. We need a process that is transparent and that does not involve ministerial appointments to CASA, particularly just to get a specific job done. We need a system put in place that, once it is there, all parties are confident it is the best we can produce, and that certainly is not the case at present.
At this stage, I would urge the minister to bring all segments of the aircraft industry together. He is the leader. He needs to broker the arrangement. He has to get on with the job of an acceptable reform process. He is the minister, and the buck stops with him. As has been shown in recent weeks, high profile appointees with their own agenda only get in the way.",REPS,<title>CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Abbott, Tony MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—I have listened to the debate until now and some good points have been made. Notwithstanding the comments that we have just had from the member for Paterson that the CASA board has done a reasonable job in all the circumstances, obviously it is disappointing that we have had some resignations from that board, but that is the kind of thing that happens in the ebb and flow of public life. People come onto these boards with a great spirit of public service. They do the right thing, what they see as right. They find themselves frustrated or confronted by difficulties and they feel, for whatever reason, they are unable to continue. So we have this development, and I look forward to continuing the rest of this debate.",REPS,<title>CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-03-29,"—It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1998 . I listened to the member for Dickson in terms of this debate and found that she debated the substantive issues in this legislation for a couple of minutes and then moved onto a wide ranging political debate in terms of CASA. But the fact is that this is basically a machi 
 nery bill. It involves some technical changes to the Civil Aviation Act, and it aims to harmonise it with the international standards of safety regulation, which I would have thought was an appropriate objective. Its aim is also to make it shorter, simpler and easier to understand.
There was also an election commitment in the government's Soaring into Tomorrow document, which Minister Sharp at that time took to the election. Of course, the Morris committee report entitled Plane Safe and the Seaview commission of inquiry both supported the need for a review of Australian regulations and standards. So this is the result of that inquiry. There are some changes to the regulations which were overdue, and the aim of the bill is basically to facilitate the findings of the review. As I said, this bill is basically of a machinery nature and provides for the introduction of a new set of regulations which are harmonised with civil aviation laws in various countries, particularly the USA.
One of the first key features of this bill is the retention and destruction of goods. The bill provides for new powers for CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, in relation to the retention and destruction of goods seized by CASA in the course of investigating breaches of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the regulations. The power to retain seized goods for longer than 60 days and the power to destroy seized goods are vested in courts. CASA must apply to courts for orders to retain or destroy, as the case may be.
These changes have arisen in response to the difficulties which have occurred in commissioning proceedings within the 60-day time limit and provide for goods to be destroyed where the owner cannot be located or has refused to take possession of the goods. The discretion to destroy dangerous goods seized is proposed because, in practice, it is not always possible to return the seized goods. That is obviously a sensible proposal. They are saying that, in the past, they have had to do a search as to who owns the goods. They have had to store it. This simply means that, if they do not indicate ownership within the 60-day period, they can destroy it instead of wasting resources in storing it.
Unless such goods are forfeited to the state under legislation relating to property used in the commission of an offence, CASA under the current legislation is required to store the goods indefinitely, and this obviously is expensive and unnecessary. The amendments proposed will permit a CASA investigator to apply to the court for an order that the goods be destroyed where the owner cannot be located or has refused to take possession of the goods. That is the first provision, and it is one of the key provisions—that is, the ability to destroy goods after they have been held for 60 days or so. It is a simple regulatory requirement—no big deal. Despite a political address, I am very pleased to hear the shadow minister say that the opposition supports these proposals, as rightly it should.
The second part relates to the regulations. The existing act contains various references to the `civil aviation regulations'. These references will be changed to `the regulations' or `regulations made under this act' or similar. Other changes of terminology will also need to be made to enable the incorporation of overseas standards and requirements. The new regulations will be based to a large degree on the federal aviation regulations of the USA, and I think that is appropriate because the USA is a very large regulatory body which dominates the air services scene. So to coordinate our requirements in line with the American situation is, of course, appropriate.
The act is being amended to permit the sub-delegation of power to CASA to make decisions of a legislative nature in a similar manner to the US Federal Aviation Administration. So, obviously, this requires streamlining of the current act in line with overseas developments. The principles underlying the new regulations require that, firstly, they are harmonised internationally with the USA federal aviation regulations and the European joint aviation regulations so there is a coordination of the two key bodies, the US requirements and the European requirements; secondly, that they are clear, concise and understandable; thirdly, that they have a safety outcome approach—and, of course, CASA is obviously given that key responsibility; 
 fourthly, that they enforceable; fifthly, that they avoid over-regulation; and, sixthly, that they are consistent with the role of CASA.
It is envisaged that the various parts of the new Civil Aviation Regulations will be phased in over the period 1999 to 2003. Each part will issued in the form of a notice of proposed rule making, to which interested parties may respond. With the advent of these new regulations the principal act  can be amended appropriately, so a number of the provisions in the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1998 are designed to give effect to this.
The third major aspect to the bill—firstly, we have the ability to destroy goods and, secondly, there is the regulatory aspect—is the fees that can be charged by CASA. Under this part of the bill is the clarification of CASA's ability to classify the fees charged by CASA under the Civil Aviation (Fees) Regulations as debt due to CASA. Where regulations made under the act require the payment of a fee and the fee is not paid by the due date, then a late fee can be imposed. The provision which enables the making of regulations which prescribe limited late payment penalties to be imposed is also included.
The fourth aspect of the bill is design standards. The regulatory changes will, by giving CASA the power to make design standards, streamline many of the current CASA requirements and assist the manufacture of aircraft in Australia, which will be seen as obviously of great benefit to the industry itself and which also will encourage manufacture of various components and parts as part of some of the major aircraft types which are produced offshore. I am sure that members of the House have noted that a lot of the major aircraft components which are produced under the Boeing label or the Airbus label are actually produced in Australia—and that can be parts of the wing tips, aircraft windows or tail rudders. A whole range of parts is produced in Australia. These design standards are going to make it easier for parts to be produced in Australia and, obviously, that will assist in the encouragement of the aviation manufacturing sector in Australia—even though that is small, I think 
 it is appropriate that we provide those standards.
In summary, the bill is primarily of a machinery nature, providing for new parts 21 to 35 of the new Civil Aviation Regulations. It has been the subject of lobbying by the industry itself, by members of the aviation industry. It provides the new regulations, as we have seen, to harmonise with international civil aviation laws. It enables CASA to issue design standards for unusual aircraft and to provide guidelines for the production of these aircraft parts in Australia. It provides new powers for the destruction or the retention of goods seized by CASA during the course of investigating breaches of the Civil Aviation Act and regulations. And, finally, it clarifies the power of CASA to impose fees.
So I am very happy to support this bill, a bill which is basically a machinery bill that cleans up the Civil Aviation Act and which certainly brings it into line with civil aviation requirements in other jurisdictions in the international marketplace, particularly in Europe and in the USA. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—Previous speakers have covered in detail the amendment proposed to the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 1998 , legislation which is supported by the opposition. It does raise a number of issues which are related to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and its general operation. I want to raise tonight some of those issues in the context of this debate because they are germane to the operation of general aviation, in particular, in the Northern Territory.
You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, that we in the Northern Territory have a very vital general aviation sector which is extremely important in delivering services and, indeed, passengers and freight to remote communities throughout the Northern Territory. But you would be aware also, Mr Deputy Speaker, that CASA is currently undergoing a restructure, and that restructure has raised a great deal of uncertainty in the minds of people involved with aviation generally but particularly for people who live in remote and rural areas.
We need to ensure that the federal government guarantees that through this restructure of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority there will not be unnecessary staff cuts and that we will see an improvement in the level of service available to people, particularly in general aviation, as a result of any restructure, because to date the evidence points in the other direction. Indeed, I have had a number of complaints from people involved in general aviation about the failure of CASA to provide them with information or, in two cases, to provide them with appropriate guidance as to licensing arrangements to run charter operations.
These charter operations are extremely important to people in the Northern Territory because there are no regular services to many communities. They are the only means by which many people get passenger air services and specialised freight movements. The failure of CASA to deal with these applications in a timely manner costs individuals and communities a great deal of money. I am aware of a current instance where a community has gone through the hoops, confronted what it believed to be all the requirements, provided the financial security that they were required to find, and yet have to be provided with their charter operator's licence. That is significant because it bears directly upon the lives of people who live in remote communities.
While we can stand in this House and applaud the changes this bill envisages, we need to comprehend that there are many people living in the bush who are still bypassed in many respects. Although these amendments are laudable, may make the operation of the legislation better and are primarily machinery changes, they do not tell us what is happening to CASA on the ground. I can tell you that the response of many people in the Northern Territory—particularly those involved in the industry—has been one of concern for the future of CASA and what the application of these amendments will mean for the delivery of their services. It is my understanding that, under the restructure, CASA will lose 10 per cent of its work force—70 staff will be lost, with 28 of that 
 number in the field. We need a guarantee from the minister that staffing arrangements in the Darwin operations of CASA will not be affected. CASA staff in the Northern Territory are already working under stress. Any cuts will serve only to compromise air safety in the Territory and indeed, across Northern Australia.
I need not point out to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that air safety is a fundamental issue for people who live in remote and rural areas. As a frequent traveller using the services of general aviation on light aircraft, I am acutely conscious of the need for high safety standards. I am acutely aware of the need for CASA to be extremely diligent in the way it deals with people in general aviation to ensure that safety standards are properly and appropriately met. Whilst I have no comment to make about any individual operator whom I have flown with recently, I know that in the past there have been a number of fly-by-night operators who have cut corners and I think jeopardised the safety of many people who fly with them. But I am glad to say some of these operators have been forced out of the industry, and that is as it should be. That is a particularly important role for CASA, but it is also important that CASA deals with the legitimate complaints of people about the way in which they operate in a timely and appropriate fashion. It is clear to me, at least, that this has not been the case in some instances.
Because of the importance of CASA and our regard for air safety, many Territorians and people across the whole of Northern Australia are potentially at risk if CASA downgrades its operations at all—if it is unable to properly undertake the task for which it has been charged by government. We need a guarantee from this government that any changes or restructuring of CASA will not lead to a diminution of service to people who live in rural and remote Australia. In fact, it ought to lead to a movement of resources in the direction of improving the efficiency of the operation and improving the standards of service to these individuals and communities.
I want a guarantee from the minister that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's base in 
 Darwin will not be closed. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that during the lead-up to the election campaign last year there was an announcement that the Darwin base and the Townsville office would close. This would have meant a great deal of pressure being placed on the single Cairns office which would be running all these three operations, leaving no CASA office between Cairns and Perth.
—Shameful.
—It is shameful, and if it were to proceed it would demonstrate the lack of regard that this government has for people who live in the bush. As someone who has lived in a remote community or a remote part of Australia for 25 years, travelling continuously around rural and remote Australia in all of that time, I can tell you that the lack of service standards in these regions needs to be properly and appropriately understood. If CASA were to close its offices in Darwin and Townsville and rely on its operations out of Cairns and Perth only, nothing is surer than that the response time of CASA would be a lot worse than it currently is—bad as that is, even now—that the people who demand an appropriate level of service in these communities would not properly receive it and that CASA would be strapped to meet the demands placed upon it and which the government expects of it.
I do not believe that it is in this country's interests to have that circumstance prevail. We need the government to ensure that the standards we as individuals and citizens in the bush require are properly and appropriately met. The only way that is likely to happen is if we get a better staffing arrangement and improved efficiency—not necessarily by screwing the existing staff but by making sure they have got the human and capital resources to carry out the functions, not only that the government expects them to undertake but also that the community expects them to undertake—to ensure that we have got a safe and appropriate air service in Northern Australia. That also applies of course to the rest of Australia, but I am concerned especially about what it means for rural and regional Australia—particularly remote Australia— 
because of what I have related of my own experience. Mr Speaker, since you have arrived in the chair, I am sure you were listening assiduously by your television monitor to what I have been saying.

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,1999-03-29,"—I want to draw to the attention of members the Time to Care campaign. It is a campaign based on the national disability crisis and it is a campaign of the National Council on Intellectual Disability which has been put together to achieve needed support for Australians with disabilities. I want to refer to a letter I referred recently from them. It states:
Dear Mr Edwards
This letter seeks your support in helping to bring to an end the National Disability Crisis which is threatening to destroy the lives of tens of thousands of Australians with profound and severe disabilities and their families.
As part of the Time to Care  Campaign, we are appealing to all Western Australian Members of Parliament, and particularly those Members participating in the Politician Adoption Scheme, to lend their support to decisive and immediate action, both:
.	 To resolve the current backlog in unmet need for disability support services;
.	 To ensure that people with profound and severe disabilities, who represent one of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors of our community are, in future, spared the indignity of having to continually beg to have their basic support needs met.
This adopt a politician scheme was initiated in Western Australia. I have been adopted by a family by the name of Edwards—no relation. Ian looks after his profoundly disabled son Alex with their other son Mark. In my view, they do a tremendous job. This adopt a politician scheme has gone a long way towards making politicians around Australia more aware of the needs of people with disabilities. The letter continues:
The next month presents Governments with a strategic opportunity to work towards achieving these outcomes.
As a condition of the 1998 Commonwealth/State Disability Agreement (CSDA), the Commonwealth Government agreed to convene a Ministerial Meeting to explore options for a joint government response to the current crisis in unmet need. The Ministerial Meeting is to be held in Canberra . . . on 9 April 1999. Disability Services Minister, the Hon Paul Omodei, will represent Western Australia at the Meeting.
I know that Allan Carpenter, the shadow minister, is also taking a very strong interest in this issue. The letter continues:
In the lead up to the Meeting, disability groups have drafted a Disability Campaign Statement that documents the minimum action required from the Governments of Australia to resolve the crisis in unmet need. A copy of the statement is included with this letter. We ask for your support in endorsing and promoting the three key strategies recommended in the Campaign Statement.
The consequences of a continuing crisis will devastate the lives of thousands of people who are already facing a daily struggle just to survive. More and more people will face homelessness as family carers die with nowhere for their family member with a disability to go to get the care they need. More and more families will break down. More and more people will be forced to endure overwhelming stress and suffering as they wait for desperately needed support.
On behalf of people with profound and severe disabilities and their families living both within your own electorate and in Western Australia, we ask that you lend your voice to speak up for people with disabilities who, in many cases, CANNOT speak for themselves.
For the sake of the lives of citizens who necessarily depend on others to have their most basic needs met, and of the family carers who have, until now, provided the around-the-clock care required, the DISABILITY CRISIS MUST END.
It is signed by Sue Harris, who is the Executive Officer of the Developmental Disability Council of WA. This is a very good campaign. I compliment the people for the time and effort that they have put into this Time to Care campaign.
I know I do not have time to go through all of the issues that they raise in their very comprehensive document, but they say that the disability crisis must end and they say that the needs are known and governments around 
 Australia must act. They say that the governments of Australia know that at least 13,400 Australians with a profound or severe disability have a critical unmet need for a supported accommodation service to meet their day-to-day care needs or a respite service to support the caring needs of families. They go on to say many good and constructive things.
I think this is largely a campaign that politicians from all sides of the political fence can get behind. Of the three things that they say are the most important—two of them being the need to make a public commitment and the need to plan to meet individual people's needs—the allocation of adequate public funding to meet people's individual needs is important. They say:
The Governments of Australia must make provision for an IMMEDIATE allocation of $294 million to provide services for the estimated 25,400 Australians with profound and severe disabilities who have critical unmet needs for accommodation, respite and day activities.
I support their campaign. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>National Disability Crisis: Time to Care Campaign</title>,Adjournment,21,1,speech
