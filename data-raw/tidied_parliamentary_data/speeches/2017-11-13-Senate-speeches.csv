The PRESIDENT
 (11:42):  I inform the Senate that the former President of the Senate, Stephen Parry, received a letter from Senator Xenophon on 31 October 2017 resigning his place as a senator for the state of South Australia. Pursuant to the provisions of section 21 of the Constitution, the President notified the Governor of South Australia of the vacancy in the representation of that state caused by his resignation. I table the correspondence.

The PRESIDENT
 (11:37):  Senator Bernardi, do you wish to raise a point of order?




Senator Bernardi:
  Mr President, I did have a question of clarification for you. In the instance where a member of this chamber was knowingly a citizen of another country and therefore constitutionally invalid, would it be incumbent upon that individual to inform the Senate immediately prior to the consideration of any business of this chamber on such a day?



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi, my understanding of the longstanding precedent on this is that the burden is upon any individual senator to reflect upon their own eligibility and make a statement if they believe they are not. I'm happy to take further advice and bring any further information back to the chamber at a subsequent hour.




Senator Bernardi:
  Thank you, Mr President. I do have concerns that there is a member of this chamber—at least one—who knows that they are not eligible to be here because of the constitutionality, and it would concern me deeply about the integrity of this institution if we were to consider any formal business, knowing that one of the people hasn't fully informed the chamber or advised the chamber of their status.



The PRESIDENT:  On the point of order, Senator Brandis?




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, Senator Bernardi has made an assertion. No member of this chamber has indicated to the chamber that the situation he describes is in fact the case. If I may say so, with respect, Mr President, you are absolutely correct that it is incumbent upon a senator who knows that he or she may be disqualified to inform the Senate, or, in the event that a senator, knowing themselves to be disqualified, fails to do so, for the chamber to make its own determination under section 47 of the Constitution, but at the moment there is nothing before the Senate to enliven either of those proceedings. So might I respectfully suggest, Mr President, that you dismiss Senator Bernardi's point of order. If facts and circumstances were to come to light, that would be the time to deal with them.



The PRESIDENT:  On the point of order, Senator Hinch.




Senator Hinch:
  On the same point of order, Mr President. Your predecessor sat there with the knowledge, and the knowledge of his colleagues in the government, that he was illegitimately in that seat and holding that position. I support Senator Bernardi on his position because what Senator Brandis is saying now counteracts everything we've heard in the past few weeks.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis.




Senator Brandis:
  Senator Hinch, there was no information before the Senate in relation to Senator Parry. Senator Parry took a certain course since the Senate last sat. In the event that Senator Parry had not taken that course and that information had come to light, it would have been a matter for the Senate to have considered in the light of that information that was not known to the Senate then but is known to the Senate now, but it has been overtaken by the event of Senator Parry's purported resignation.


There is no information before the Senate at the moment in relation to any other individual to which Senator Bernardi's observations apply. But, if a senator were to form that view, as I said a moment ago, it would be incumbent upon them to take a certain course, and, if they declined to take that course, then it would be open to the Senate to move under section 47 of the Constitution and section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act on the basis of information before it.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi, I'll take a final submission.




Senator Bernardi:
  I don't want to labour this, Mr President, but perhaps it would facilitate things if the government would respond to the suggestion that they are advised, or have been advised, by a senator that the constitutionality of their position is in question. If that be the case, then the government are part of undermining the Constitution.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi, I hasten to add that this is beyond the original point you raised as being a point of order. This is now a matter for a question. There are times on the daily schedule to do that, such as question time. My ruling is that there is no information brought before me to allow me to make a ruling on the matter you have raised. As I said earlier, it is a matter for each individual senator. If they feel they have reached that conclusion, they should bring that forward to the chamber. If not, there are provisions by which the Senate can act, and it has acted in the past in this term of parliament. But you have brought forward no information that would allow me to make a ruling contrary to that long-established practice.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications (Senator Fifield) and the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) and Senators O'Neill and Farrell today relating to former Senator Parry.


I rise to take note of the answers—or non-answers—given by Senators Fifield and Brandis to questions asked by Senators Wong, O'Neill and me. You'll note, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, that the Attorney-General accepted a document that was tendered, and I'd like to refer to that document. It was a story by Michelle Grattan. I've known Michelle—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Sorry, Senator Farrell. Senators, could I just ask those who are not taking part in the debate to quietly move outside so I can hear Senator Farrell?




Senator FARRELL:
  Thank you for that protection, Mr Acting Deputy President. I've known Michelle Grattan since she first interviewed me when I was a candidate in the Adelaide by-election in 1988.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Is that the one Penny knocked you off on?




Senator FARRELL:
  No, that was a different one.



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  I've had a few ups and downs in politics. But Michelle Grattan—



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  he's a relative now—is not known for writing inaccurate stories. In fact, she would be one of the most reliable journalists in this place. Senator Brandis, you might recall, tried to dismiss the references of Senator Parry about what he told and who he told it to. So I'd like to refer to this comment that Michelle Grattan made. She's directly quoting Senator Parry, former President of this place. She says:


He spoke to ""various ministers"". Though he wasn't ordered to shut up about his situation, the tone of the conversations suggested he say nothing until the High Court ruled in the ""citizenship seven"" cases …


I think that's pretty unequivocal as to the statements that former Senator and President Parry made. He was being honest. Why was he being honest?


It was because he'd been attacked by Prime Minister Turnbull for not coming forward earlier. Yet we know from Michelle Grattan's story that he did speak to various ministers, and the implication of those discussions was, 'Shut up about the issue.'


Senator Fifield said he's answered all the questions we have. Let me tell you, he hasn't answered any of the questions that we've got. His defence is the North Korean defence—'What happens if North Korea stops somebody from renouncing their citizenship?' We're not talking about North Korea here. We're talking about the United Kingdom. We're talking about a country from which, perhaps, 50 per cent of the Australian population has come. We're talking about a country that has a recognised and well-publicised method of renouncing citizenship. I happen to know something about it because, before I nominated for the Senate in 2007, I had to go through that process. My mother's father was born in Pontefract in Yorkshire to, interestingly enough, an Australian mother. But I had to go through that process. I had to pay my money. As it turned out, they said I wasn't a citizen after all. They did keep my money. But there is a very simple process you've got to go through. The problem here is that the people on the other side have chosen to ignore that process. 


You might have seen Prime Minister Turnbull ramping up the issue today. He is going to refer all these Labor Party people to the High Court. Apart from being a complete waste of money, he's not relying on good legal advice. All of the people he's talking about have renounced their citizenship. These people are not like Barnaby Joyce, Fiona Nash or Stephen Parry, none of whom renounced their citizenship. All of the people that the Prime Minister is talking about today renounced their citizenship. Why did they do that? It was because the vetting processes—as you would be familiar with, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle—are thorough. In every case, if there is any doubt whatsoever, as I know from my own personal experience, you renounce your citizenship. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:07):  This whole kerfuffle, if I might call it that, has been the subject of a lot of comment around the place and a lot of discussion in this particular chamber and in the other place. The thing that I'm so curious about is why those Labor Party members of parliament who have been named and who have actually admitted certain inappropriate procedures as far as their citizenship goes have not referred themselves to the High Court. I'm particularly interested in a number of people here. I see Senator Gallagher coming into the chamber. I don't know what her position is.




Senator Gallagher:
  Read my statement.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I don't think I have ever heard her indicate it. But I have read certain articles written by particular journalists as recently as 8 November and 10 November raising issues about Senator Gallagher's position.




Senator Pratt:
  She made a statement to the chamber. It couldn't be more transparent.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I think the interjection was saying that she's fine. If she is fine, can we see the evidence? Can we have a look at the evidence? If there is evidence, why would you not produce it? The same goes for other Labor Party people. It's an unfortunate saga in the annals of this parliament, I have to say. It's something that, I might say, has come completely from left field. Everyone's blaming Mr Turnbull for it, but it's very, very clear that it has nothing to do with Mr Turnbull and nothing to do with the government as such. It is simply an issue that has arisen under the Constitution, and certain facts have come forward that have made a number of parliamentarians think carefully about their origins. Could I just, as an aside, say that my great-great-great-great—or something—grandfather came out from Scotland, not a few years ago, like Senator Cameron, but in the 1850s. On my mother's side, they came out from Germany, I think, in the 1860s.


But I don't know. Perhaps Senator Gallagher has appropriate advice or appropriate evidence. But why isn't it tabled? Why isn't it tabled in this chamber? Why don't the other Labor members of parliament who have been questioned table the information? If it's there—if Senator Gallagher says, yes, she's fine; it's there; she's got the renunciation; it's all tickety-boo, so to speak—then let's see it and put the question beyond doubt. If it's not beyond doubt, then it requires Senator Gallagher and others in the Labor Party to do the honourable thing, as has been done by many coalition members, in getting the High Court to look at it, to determine it and to make it clear one way or the other.


If there is a reasonable explanation for why Senator Gallagher shouldn't do that, then please tell us. But, otherwise, why don't we just put the matter beyond dispute? Why don't we table publicly all of the relevant information so that the public at large can be assuaged? As I say, these journalists are respectable people, as far as journalists go, and they seem to have some doubt about Senator Gallagher's citizenship. I don't really have the doubt, because I simply don't know. But, if the evidence is there, why aren't Labor people, including those in this chamber, coming forward with the documentation to put the matter entirely beyond doubt and entirely beyond argument? That would seem to be a very reasonable way to go.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-11-13,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:12):  For those who are here in the chamber, you've come to Canberra on a day when the House isn't sitting and you've come into the Senate, and I'm sure that you're going to go away from here today making a judgement about the chaos and dysfunction that are at the heart of this government. I got the thumbs up from the gentleman there in the front row of the gallery because he is a representative of the true Australians out there who are sick and tired of the game-playing by this government that's going on.


We have seen a failure to answer questions in this chamber today. We had a minister standing up and refusing to show up at Senate estimates. There have been attempts to convene to get her to answer questions about what she knew about what was going on in her portfolio. She's refused to show up there. She is coming here and making up her own questions that she wants to answer.


But we've got Senator Fifield refusing to answer questions here in the chamber. For those who were here in question time and those who were listening, all they would've heard from Senator Fifield were these sorts of mealy-mouthed comments: 'I covered this in my statement this morning.' If he's so sure about the statement that he made this morning, why didn't he repeat it in question time when Australians were listening? It was because he doesn't care enough; he doesn't have the respect for the Senate chamber to stand up and repeat that clear answer. If it's so clear and it was so perfect that he's going to refer to it here, why didn't he tell the chamber when it was filled with Australian representatives? Why didn't he have the respect to repeat in question time what he said? He answered the second question that he was asked, mealy-mouthed again, with, 'Oh, I made a contribution.' Then he was asked about exactly what he knew.


Let me go back to this question to Minister Fifield: did the minister or his office discuss concerns about former Senator Parry's eligibility with any of his ministerial colleagues or their offices? Who did you talk to? That's what the question was: did you talk to anybody?


Do you know what he said? He said, 'There are particular details about which I have no knowledge.' We were asking about what he did himself. 'I have no knowledge about myself.' That is what Senator Fifield is actually asking us to believe in his response to questions today.


This government is in decay, it's in crisis and it continues to disrespect the rules of the Senate. We've had today—with a new President coming into the chamber and the handling of Senator Parry's resignation—a classic revelation of what goes on with the Turnbull government. I want to put on the record that Senator Parry, who was sitting in that chair as the President, was a thoroughly decent man, and everybody's comments this morning indicate that he took the role very seriously. But, when it came to the moment he thought he might not be a citizen, he had a bit of a chat with Minister Fifield, who can't recall the details. We don't know who he spoke to. He's trying to get us to believe that he didn't speak to anybody, but Michelle Grattan has it in the paper that he spoke to quite a few people. The story is out. Despite the fact that the Australian people are paying very close attention to this, this government continues to stand here and misrepresent what is going on. And it expects the Australian people—represented in physical presence by you here today—to believe the nonsense that we saw at question time today.


We know that Senator Fifield's answers were appalling. We followed up with some questions to Senator Brandis:


Were any members of the Senate government leadership team made aware of concerns about the former senator's eligibility before Monday, 30 October?


We got this long list of process from the senator about who is in the leadership team and who is not in the leadership team, just to give us the benefit of his wisdom. Then he finally summed it up with, 'I have no reason to believe any one of them'—any of the six people in the leadership team—'knew anything prior to Monday 30 October.' 'No reason to believe' is not a clear, concise and believable answer in this context. Senator Farrell has referred to Michelle Grattan's reporting. It tells us that Minister Fifield knew that Senator Parry was in doubt. Minister Fifield had conversations with a range of other people, and we have this chaotic, dysfunctional government in here continuing to misrepresent that reality. I want to go to one of the great comments we heard in question time today: 'This was a candid and thorough response from the minister.' That is the same as saying this government is functional and truthful. (Time expired)

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:17):  We have just heard from Senator O'Neill a classic example of the way the Labor Party chooses to attack important political issues, and that is to build conjecture upon hypothesis upon speculation upon outright falsehoods. What we have heard from Senator O'Neill absolutely falls into that category. There has been some discussion—and you might care to wait for this, Senator O'Neill, because I am about to point out why what you just said to the Senate was not the truth—




Senator Williams:
  Don't leave, Deb. Stay here.




Senator BRANDIS:
  We heard from Senator Farrell and from Senator O'Neill, who is now skulking out of the chamber, some propositions attributed to Senator Parry on the basis of words quoted in an article by the respected journalist Michelle Grattan on the website The Conversation. It was asserted—




Senator O'Neill:
  A point of order, Acting Deputy President: I chose to leave the Senate chamber to do other work. I refuse to allow my departure to be described by Senator Brandis as 'skulking' out of the chamber. It is entirely inappropriate and he should withdraw.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill, it's not a point of order, but, Minister, Senator O'Neill has not 'skulked out'. She is here. I ask you to withdraw.




Senator BRANDIS:
  She is still here; I am glad about that, because I am about to point out—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:   Minister, I am just asking you to—




Senator BRANDIS:
  I will withdraw if you want me to.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I ask you to withdraw.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator O'Neill, if you care to wait, your error can be pointed out to you. But you obviously won't do that. Much has been made of words quoted by Michelle Grattan in an article on The Conversation website. Senator Wong, then Senator Farrell and now Senator O'Neill—none of whom, by the way, have delayed in the Senate chamber to hear the truth—have asserted that a reference in direct speech in Michelle Grattan's article is somehow proof that Senator Parry has said to Michelle Grattan that he had spoken to various ministers. I've just spoken to former Senator Parry in the last 10 minutes. Senator Parry tells me, and he has authorised me to tell the chamber, that he has never spoken to Michelle Grattan about this matter, ever. And he has also authorised me to tell the chamber that he has never used the words that are said to be attributed to him by the Labor Party in the article by Michelle Grattan—to any person, ever. So that is the truth. The truth is that the entire case made against our former colleague Stephen Parry is based on a falsehood.


I tried to make this point to Senator Wong across the table during question time, but, of course, she rudely refused to listen to me. I tried to point out that on a reasonable reading of this article in The Conversation the words in direct speech are not said by Michelle Grattan to be the words of Stephen Parry. Nevertheless, the Australian Labor Party has mounted its entire case on the assertion that they are. But we now know that they are not, because Senator Parry never spoke to Michelle Grattan and never used those words to anyone.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:21):  What an extraordinary set of circumstances this parliament finds itself in. We have no more clarity from the answers given to us about the constitutional chaos that we find ourselves in by the government in question time today. You could, sadly, drive a truck through the answers given to questions. I note that Senator Fifield sought cause to reflect in his answer straight back to his earlier statements to the chamber today. So, in debating answers to questions, I will reflect on his answers earlier today.


Senator Fifield said to the chamber he could not be definitive as to when Senator Parry started to reflect on his own particular circumstances. I put to the chamber that he must have reflected on it when referrals were made to the High Court, because they were referrals he made as President which ultimately reflected his own circumstances—in that the reason that Senator Parry was found to have citizenship by descent was in the same way that others who have left this place were also found to have. So we are expected to believe that while Senator Parry was participating in these matters as President he told no-one else of any importance within the government. 




Senator Brandis:
  It's what he says.




Senator PRATT:
  Yes. Well, ultimately, what this reflects is the situation we now find ourselves in—that you have refused to exercise any internal accountability on each other on this matter until this point in time and until you've been pulled into the motion that's been put before this chamber today. So either you are derelict in holding your members to account in terms of their eligibility to be in this place or we in this place have been withheld the information of who knew what, when, how and if they ever acted. Patently, the government has not acted until this point in time. You've not asked your colleagues to reflect on their eligibility to be in this place.




Senator Brandis:
  Why did I move that motion earlier this morning?




Senator PRATT:
  Up until this point in time, you have not done so. You have been dragged kicking and screaming. The reality is that the motion before this place would not have occurred had Labor not proposed a universal disclosure regime. And the reason we had to do that is the very circumstances that have been reflected on in answers to questions today.


As Senator Wong made clear: when we found out that the then President of the Senate, with the knowledge of a cabinet minister, had sat on information that rendered him ineligible, this meant that this parliament could not be relied on to deal with these matters appropriately through its own usual processes and that we needed before us a more stringent procedure. I'm glad that we now have that, but you can certainly see, in the answers that have been given in this place this afternoon, how manifestly inadequate the government's response has been to the constitutional chaos that this parliament finds itself in. Senator Brandis, you said, back in August, that you thought former Senators Ludlam and Waters had acted a little prematurely, and perhaps you did indeed think that at the time. But it is apparent to all members in this place that, when the court found otherwise, you did nothing proactive to address this matter—until this point in time. The government has been entirely 'hear no evil, see no evil'. You have your own 'don't ask, don't tell' policy around these matters, where we see a Prime Minister who has refused to be apprised of the problem so that he can't be held accountable for it.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:32):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 29 October 2017, of the Right Honourable Sir Ninian Martin Stephen, KG, AK, GCMG, GCVO, KBE, QC, former Governor-General of Australia and Justice of the High Court of Australia, places on record its appreciation of his long and distinguished public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


The pages of history are littered with the deeds of great Australians, of men and women in each succeeding generation and every field of human endeavour, whose achievements have enriched the tapestry of Australia's public life, who have represented the very best of our country to the world. Many great men and women have served the people of Australia with such distinction, yet there would be few whose achievements, in service not only to our nation but to our common humanity, could rival the life of Sir Ninian Stephen. He was Australia's 20th Governor-General and its first Ambassador for the Environment, a Justice of the High Court of Australia and a Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria, a member of the Privy Council, a soldier, a skilled diplomat and international jurist and, to those who had the pleasure of his acquaintance, a man of immense warmth, intelligence, urbanity and charm.


Sir Ninian Stephen was born on a poultry farm in the village of Nettlebed, in Oxfordshire, England, on 15 June 1923, the first and only child of Frederick Stephen and Barbara Cruickshank. The farm belonged to Ms Nina Mylne, the daughter of the wealthy Queensland grazier and politician Graham Mylne, and heiress to her father's considerable pastoral holdings in New South Wales and western Queensland. Ninian's mother, Barbara, worked as a lady's maid for Ms Mylne, who would become the dominating figure in Ninian's early life. Indeed, it was after Nina, not after the eighth century Pictish saint, that Ninian was named.


Three weeks after his birth, Ninian's father left the family to board the Ausonia bound for Montreal, never to return. His father's fate was kept from Ninian for most of his life; until 2003 he believed that Frederick Stephen had died from the after-effects of mustard gas poisoning from the Great War. From that moment Nina Mylne took charge both of the family's finances and of young Ninian's education. The trio moved across Europe. In Edinburgh Ninian received his early schooling at George Watson's College and the Edinburgh Academy, then in London at St Paul's, before he moved once more to Chillon College, an international school for boys in Montreux, in Switzerland.


Regrettably, Ms Mylne was not entirely unsympathetic to the cause of national socialism in Europe. She took an exceptionally dim view of Communists and Jews and attempted to inculcate in young Ninian a bien pensant's appreciation of the achievements of Hitler's Germany. In September 1938 Nina and young Ninian travelled to Nuremberg to see the Nazi party's rally and celebration of the Anschluss. She had spared no expense to secure the best seats in the stadium directly above the Fuhrer's motorcade, from which young Ninian was ideally placed to take several photographs of the imposing spectacle. However, as his biographer, Philip Ayres, concludes:


… for all its impressiveness, Nina Mylne's gesture fell somewhat short of purpose. The sort of education she had provided for Ninian was the least likely to produce anyone attracted by regimentation and propaganda … he had acquired an interest in the complexities of history that was incompatible with political intensity.


Within three years of taking those photographs, Ayres continues, Ninian Stephen:


… would voluntarily enlist in an army fighting to defend Australia against the disastrous consequences of extreme ideologies.


And, in an age and moral universe even more distant from the stadium at Nuremberg, as a founding judge on the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Sir Ninian Stephen would play a seminal role in establishing the first war crimes tribunal since those which sat after the Second World War at Nuremberg and Tokyo.


War broke out in September 1939. Though they were safe, for now, in neutral Switzerland, by December the Australian Ms Mylne had secured for the trio passage to Australia. They arrived in Melbourne in February 1940. Ninian was enrolled at Scotch College, where he completed his final year of school, gaining honours in English and French. On the advice of a school friend and with little burning ambition of his own, Ninian commenced an articled clerkship at the firm Arthur Robinson & Co in 1941. It was a chance introduction to a career that would define Ninian Stephen's life. Soon after he enrolled in a Bachelor of Laws at the University of Melbourne; however, his studies were interrupted by the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and the beginning of the Pacific War.


Along with many of his contemporaries, Sir Ninian joined the Australian Imperial Force and saw action in Borneo and New Guinea during the famed jungle campaigns of the war. He took part in a number of dangerous reconnaissance expeditions as a member of the 43rd Landing Craft Company, which, along with the then Corporal Ninian Stephen, counted among its ranks one Captain Frank Packer, future patriarch of the Packer media empire and chairman of Australian Consolidated Press, and Captain Nigel Bowen, a future Commonwealth Attorney-General and the first Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia. Ninian Stephen was commissioned as lieutenant in April 1945 and discharged the following February.


Following his return to civilian life, Sir Ninian resumed his legal education and graduated from the University of Melbourne in 1949. It was the same year in which he would propose to Valery Mary Sinclair, an art student at the same university. After a five-month engagement, they were married on 4 June 1949 at St Mark's Anglican Church in Camberwell. Recently married, admitted to practice and with the couple's first child on the way, Ninian Stephen briefly returned to Arthur Robinson & Co to work as a solicitor. There were early signs that fate did not have in store a solicitor's career for him. He later recalled that his duties seemed very much to be a continuation of the tasks he had performed as an articled clerk, such as 'concealing from the firm's partners warm, indeed red-hot, letters from the firm's Brisbane agents, complaining about my delays in resealing the probates they sent us'.


In January 1952, Ninian Stephen went to the bar. After spending six months reading with Douglas Little, later the Hon. Sir Douglas Little of the Supreme Court of Victoria, he took chambers at Saxon House in Little Collins Street—a room, as Sir Ninian would later describe it, 'just large enough for three desks if you didn't mind having to crawl under your desk to get to your seat, back hard up against the wall, when you heard a solicitor-like footstep in the corridor outside'. However, he was soon offered a place in the somewhat more salubrious surrounds of Selborne Chambers—in Sir Robert Menzies's former room, no less—overlooking Little Collins Street.


Over the next two decades, Ninian Stephen built up a successful practice specialising in equity, company law and constitutional law. He took silk in November 1966 and only four years later was appointed to the Supreme Court of Victoria. At 47 years of age, most, if not all, of the achievements for which he would gain international recognition lay ahead, but he would always reflect with singular fondness upon his time at the bar. He would reminisce, as he did in his address on the occasion of the Victorian bar dinner in May 1989, with sentiments familiar to every lapsed barrister that he missed:


… that intoxicating mixture of tension and excitement on the eve of each case, something that never wholly leaves you, however many cases you have fought; then that comfortable satisfaction when you have written the concluding part of an opinion; and the even more comfortable satisfaction when you write up your fee book at the end of the day. 


I can relate to that reminiscence.


Less than two years after his appointment to the Supreme Court, Ninian Stephen received a call from his old friend the then Commonwealth Attorney-General Sir Ivor Greenwood. The two had shared chambers in the room in Saxon House during Sir Ninian's earliest days at the bar. Senator Greenwood was now calling to offer Ninian the position of Justice of the High Court of Australia, to replace the retiring Sir Victor Windeyer. So it was that, at 48 years of age, Sir Ninian Stephen took his seat in the court, under the chief justiceshipof the great Sir Garfield Barwick.


He was the youngest of the seven justices. In a court of generally high intellectual calibre, Sir Ninian was respected by his peers for his clarity of thought, diligence, easy manner and peerless charm. Sir Anthony Mason, with whom Sir Ninian served on the bench, described his voice as, by common account, 'the most mellifluous voice in the Australian legal world'. I remember that voice. I met Sir Ninian on several occasions in the early 1980s. It was deep, rich, plangent and urbane. Of his style, Sir Anthony writes that his judgements were:


… easy to read, a world apart from the dense, grinding judicial style which is characteristic of typical High Court judgments.


And:


A central element in the Stephen style was the air of disconnected impartiality and objectivity; that of a Proustian observer seemingly disconnected from the events which he describes.


As his first High Court associate, Ross Robson—later the Honourable Justice Ross Robson of the Supreme Court of Victoria—would observe:


It appeared as if Sir Ninian's life was a joy, not a trouble. He was not burdened by angst, worry, jealousy, ambition, envy or any other vices.


Professor Hilary Charlesworth, another of Sir Ninian's former associates, writes of his judicial philosophy that, 'While he was personally a liberal and progressive thinker, these views were not consistently reflected in his judgements, which revealed a cautious attitude to judicial review and a particular social or political agenda.'


He was not obviously a supporter of states' rights nor of the federal government. On his retirement he remarked that he had no burning interest in the outcome of cases, such as might have led other justices to seek in different ways to persuade the court to their point of view. He rather saw his duty as to decide each case as he thought appropriate and let the result of the case take care of itself.


In December 1981, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser told Sir Ninian that Sir Zelman Cowen would be resigning as Governor-General in a few months time and that the Prime Minister wished to appoint Sir Ninian to his place. Although humbly startled at this invitation, he accepted and was sworn in on 29 July 1982. After Sir Isaac Isaacs, Sir Ninian Stephen is the second of three High Court justices to have served as Governor-General to date.


With the events of 1975 still fresh in the minds of many Australians, it is significant that Sir Ninian Stephen's appointment, like that of his predecessor, Sir Zelman Cowen, was lauded across partisan divides, and he more than maintained the confidence and respect of both coalition and Labor governments. Sir Ninian remains the only Governor-General to have proved two double-dissolution elections during his term of office—in 1983, on the advice of Prime Minister Fraser, and in 1987, on the advice of Prime Minister Hawke. The first of these attracted particular controversy.


On the morning of 3 February 1983, Sir Ninian was preparing to welcome the retiring Polish ambassador to Government House when at 12:15 he received an unexpected and unannounced guest in the form of a very hurried Malcolm Fraser. The Prime Minister had just called a press conference for 1 pm that afternoon at which he hoped to announce a snap double-dissolution election and thus forestall the impending Labor leadership challenge to Bill Hayden by his putative rival, Bob Hawke. The Polish ambassador's arrival was imminent and, with close to 40 pages of the Prime Minister's reasons relating to 13 trigger bills to consider, Sir Ninian told Mr Fraser to leave and that his request would be considered after lunch so that he could properly inform himself of the matter.


It was not until 4.55 pm, and after further inquiries of the Prime Minister, that Sir Ninian advised Mr Fraser that he had agreed to his request for a double dissolution. But by then Bob Hawke had already replaced Bill Hayden as Labor leader and would go on to inflict upon Malcolm Fraser a landslide defeat. This was a turbulent episode in Australian politics, but one from which Sir Ninian Stephen would emerge unruffled and wholly untarred by partisan brush.


As Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen continued the work of his predecessor, Sir Zelman Cowen, in bringing what was described, borrowing Nehru's phrase, as a touch of healing to a nation divided by the turbulent events of 1975. To the achievement of this task, like his predecessor, Sir Ninian attached great importance to the many public speeches he gave around Australia. He was conscious of the challenge faced by governors-general in the delivery of vice-regal speeches—what Professor Geoffrey Lindell describes as the importance of saying something interesting without being controversial. But it was a task which Sir Ninian, like Sir Zelman before him, saw as an important part of the Governor-General's role—to represent or interpret the nation to itself—and one to which he would deftly apply his immense intellectual skills and energy.


On government advice, Sir Ninian was also instrumental in extending the practice of governors-general playing a significant role in representing Australia to the wider world. No doubt drawing upon his international upbringing and his natural diplomacy and charm, and building on the overseas duties performed by some of his predecessors, Sir Ninian Stephen was the first Governor-General to regularly represent the nation in an official capacity abroad, meeting with foreign leaders as diverse as Margaret Thatcher, Francois Mitterand and Lee Kwan Yew and, in the words of his biographer, 'taking his office beyond the merely ceremonial and into the world of diplomacy'. In 1984, for example, he represented Australia at the funeral of Indira Gandhi, following her assassination. He also had the somewhat more dubious honour of hosting Nikolae and Elena Ceausescu at Yarralumla. Standing alongside Bob Hawke, awaiting the arrival of Romania's first family on the tarmac of Canberra's Fairbairn RAAF base, conversation turned to the Carpathian leader's unusual habit of installing CCTV cameras in the hotel rooms of his ministers. 'Why don't you try that, Bob?' Sir Ninian asked, to which Hawke replied, 'There wouldn't be enough film.'


Sir Ninian's contribution to Australia's diplomacy went hand in hand with his significant symbolic contributions within Australia. In October 1985, Sir Ninian flew to Uluru to hand over the title deeds of the sacred land to its traditional owners. As Philip Ayres observes:


This was the most symbolically significant transfer of ownership … during Stephen's tenure as Governor-General, and his speech was an effort to balance specifically Aboriginal rights, morally based in natural law in the light of historical catastrophe and dispossession, with the concept of national unity.


From these and many other achievements, it is safe to conclude that the consolidation over recent decades of the Governor-Generalship of Australia as a vibrant and admired form of unifying national leadership owes much to Sir Ninian Stephen's 6½ years in the role.


Sir Ninian Stephen's term as Governor-General concluded on 16 February 1989. At a farewell dinner speech given by Bob Hawke two days earlier, the Prime Minister thanked Sir Ninian for bringing to his tenure a wisdom and self-confidence that enhanced the role, noting that:


Where many people had imagined the Governor-Generalship could involve only the ritual performance of empty ceremony and where some still saw it as the avenue of intrusion into the affairs of elected Governments Sir Ninian Stephen showed that the post could be very different indeed. You, sir, showed the Governor-Generalship was a post of real substance, and you imbued it and refreshed it with an articulate, accessible, distinguished and may I say a very Australian spirit.


Having reached the apex of Australian public life, Sir Ninian Stephen was still far from retirement. On 21 July 1989, he was appointed by the Hawke government as Australia's first Ambassador for the Environment. This new role saw Sir Ninian represent Australia in important multilateral fora, taking part in environmental negotiations, then in relative infancy, as well as undertaking a public diplomacy role within Australia.


In 1992, the governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland chose Sir Ninian Stephen to facilitate peace talks on Northern Ireland between the Protestants and the Catholics of Ulster. Although Sir Ninian did not single-handedly achieve the impossible task of bringing to an end the long Irish troubles, his scrupulous and fair-handed work was reasonably judged a success. As the Hon. Justice Michael Kirby recalled at a dinner at Ormond College to mark Sir Ninian's 80th birthday:


When I visited my family in Ulster, outside the little town of Cullybackey, they told me that they had every confidence in ""Mr Stephen"". After all, they believed that he had been baptised a Presbyterian and came originally from Scotland. So for Ulster Unionists, who thought the Reverend Paisley a wimp and far too compromising, the image of the tall gracious Australian was reassuring.


No less significantly, in 1993 Sir Ninian was elected to sit as one of the first 11 judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. He was instrumental in devising the procedural and evidentiary rules necessary to turn the UN Security Council resolution into a fully functioning tribunal. As his tribunal colleague Professor Antonio Cassese recalls from his earliest meetings with Sir Ninian Stephen:


His moral authority, his balance, combined with friendliness and wit, naturally made him the fellow judge to whom I would turn any time I had a serious problem requiring much wisdom and experience for its solution … When Sir Ninian Stephen decided not to seek a second term and left the Tribunal in 1997, all judges felt they would lose an irreplaceable colleague. This is indeed what happened.


As to Sir Ninian's conduct at these novel proceedings, as the Hon. Dyson Heydon has observed, 'he frequently stressed something which it is easy for war crimes tribunals to forget—the need to confer procedural fairness on the generally despised defendants'. Sir Ninian was always an upholder of the rule of law.


Aside from his work mediating the Irish troubles and establishing the first war crimes tribunal since those of World War II, Sir Ninian contributed to several other major international developments of the 1990s. He advised on the democratic transition in South Africa, helped to mediate the worsening political crisis in Bangladesh, led two UN missions to Burma to investigate forced labour and chaired the United Nations Group of Experts for Cambodia in 1998 and 1999. Although these difficult ventures inevitably met varying degrees of success, the one consistent theme throughout his extraordinary career is the universally high regard in which he was held by those who had the pleasure of working with him. Several qualities shine out from these many accounts: his first-rate intellect and world-renowned charm, his wisdom and fairness, and, above all, his human warmth. It is perhaps both remarkable and unsurprising that over the course of his life Sir Ninian Stephen was honoured by no fewer than five knighthoods. Most notably, Her Majesty the Queen appointed Sir Ninian a Knight of the Garter in 1994, making him the most recent Australian to receive this personal gift of the sovereign.


Sir Ninian Stephen will be remembered for his many achievements as a jurist and a diplomat and for being a man of enormous intelligence and immense charm—the paradigm of the modern statesman. He was a truly eminent Australian, but he was also a dedicated family man, supported in all that he did by Lady Stephen. Sir Ninian and Lady Stephen have aptly been described as one of the great enduring double acts in Australian public life, and it is to Lady Stephen and their children, Mary, Ann, Sarah, Jane and Elizabeth, and to their 12 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren that I tender my condolences on behalf of the government and of a grateful nation.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:57):  I rise on behalf of the opposition to acknowledge the passing of the Rt Hon. Sir Ninian Stephen, KG, AK, GCMG, GCVO, KBE, QC on 29 October 2017, and at the outset I convey the opposition's condolences to Lady Stephen and to Sir Ninian's family and friends. Sir Ninian Stephen was a pre-eminent Australian. The honours and awards conveyed upon him are testament to this—knighted in five separate orders including, as the Leader of the Government has said, the Order of the Garter. Yet these are surpassed by the inestimable value of the public service he provided over eight decades to the military, to the law, on the High Court, as Governor-General, as Ambassador for the Environment and as an international jurist and peacemaker. As former High Court judge Michael Kirby said at Sir Ninian's 80th birthday dinner, serving Australia was not enough for Ninian Stephen—he went beyond and served a wider world.


Sir Ninian Stephen was born in England, near Oxford, in 1923 and after a childhood that included living in continental Europe and being educated in Edinburgh, London and Switzerland he arrived in Australia as a 16-year-old in 1940, completing his education at Scotch College, Melbourne, before moving to the University of Melbourne. He was effectively raised, as his biographer Philip Ayres put it, by two caring mothers—his own mother, Barbara, and Miss Nina Mylne. His father left for Canada three weeks after the boy's birth and was not to return. It was the love and provision of these two women, particularly Miss Mylne, who had an inheritance of shares in large pastoral holdings in Australia, that saw him receive a varied education across multiple countries driven partly by the preferences of his carers and partly by necessity as hostilities drew closer on the continent in the late 1930s. The growing threat of war prompted emigration to Australia, Miss Mylne's home country, and they sailed from Genoa in December 1939 amongst some 300 passengers, including many Hungarian Jews getting out of Europe while they still could. Although he was already something of an internationalist given his upbringing, the sea journey provided an even greater window to the world, with stops in Suez, Colombo and Fremantle before docking in Melbourne in February 1940.


As was the case for many young men in Australia at that time, Sir Ninian Stephen's education was interrupted by the onset of war. He enlisted as a private in the Melbourne University Regiment at the end of his first year, in December 1941. En route by rail to a training camp in regional Victoria, they heard that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. Sir Ninian would go on to serve in the Australian Imperial Force, spending 1½ years in Geraldton, where his tent mates included the artist John Brack, before finding himself sent back to New South Wales. He retrained for infantry service and then saw action in Lae, Papua New Guinea. After being commissioned as an officer in 1945, he was posted to serve in New Britain, Bougainville and Borneo before being discharged in February 1946. As we reflect at this time on the extent of his service and the duration of his life, we should remember that Sir Ninian was once an ordinary soldier, serving alongside working-class men during one of the nation's and the world's darkest hours.


The year 1949 brought two significant developments for Sir Ninian Stephen. He married Lady Valery in July of that year. They would go on to have five daughters. Then in December he graduated with his degree in law from the University of Melbourne. As the Attorney has outlined, Sir Ninian fell into law somewhat by accident, gaining a job as an office boy at the firm of solicitors known as Arthur Robinson and Co. in December 1940 whilst he decided what to do. This experience was sufficient to boost his confidence, and he was accepted to read law, beginning in February 1941. After the interruption of the war, to which I have referred, he resumed his articles and study in 1946. Significant teachers of influence in the law school at the time included Professor Wolfgang Friedmann, whose principal area of interest was international law, and Associate Professor Geoffrey Sawer, who would be a leading contributor to the study of Australian constitutional law and federalism over the ensuing decades. However, the teaching of law at the University of Melbourne at this time was, according to Sir Ninian, hardly designed to capture students' imaginations. He would go on to say that the only important feature of his time at university was 'meeting and marrying Val'.


Nevertheless, a career in the law followed. I note this came only after rejection for a position in the diplomatic corps. Beginning as a solicitor, he was called to the bar in January 1952. He shared his tiny chambers with two gentlemen who went on to significant service—Ted Woodward, who became Director-General of ASIO, a federal court judge and a chief proponent of Aboriginal land rights, and Ivor Greenwood, who became a senator and Attorney-General, eventually inviting Sir Ninian to join the High Court. It was pretty good company! But it ought to be remembered that Sir Ninian did not come to the bar with the qualifications of many others and was not deeply embedded in the Melbourne establishment, nor necessarily at that point highly credentialled in the law. However, within a decade, he established a reputation as a barrister that supplanted the need for such credentials by authoring opinions which were described as 'tightly written and clearly organised in their arguments' across many areas of law. He took silk in 1966 at the age of 43. He was appointed to the bench of the Supreme Court of Victoria in June 1970; however, that was a short stay because in March 1972 he became a justice of the High Court of Australia.


Some have written that Sir Ninian was regarded as being a judge in the tradition of Justices Dixon, Fullagar and Kitto. He received not a little encouragement to continue in this tradition upon his ascension, including from Sir Owen Dixon himself months before his death. This was a High Court before the constitutional amendment which fixed the age of retirement at 70. It was a court in which Justice McTiernan was still serving at the age of 80, having been appointed under Sir Isaac Isaacs, who had sat with the first Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Griffiths. In the 10 years Sir Ninian served on the court, it underwent substantial generational change. Sir Ninian brought a conscientious work ethic to his role at the court, but he did not allow himself to be consumed by his burdens. His first associate, Ross Robson, who has been quoted already by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, stated that Sir Ninian was 'not burdened by angst, worry, jealousy, ambition, envy or any other vices'. Perhaps that is advice or an example that should be followed in this parliament more.


During the time Sir Ninian was on the full court, there was great constitutional upheaval, not the least as a result of the events of Remembrance Day 1975 but also as a consequence of the new legislative broom that swept through the nation in the form of the Whitlam government's dramatic new legislative approach compared to the malaise and stupor of the previous two decades. These were interesting times on the court. Towards the end of his tenure, Sir Ninian described the difficulties that he saw could emerge from judges, and the High Court in particular, paying greater attention to parliamentary debates and committee reports as a means of interpreting legislation than to the legislation itself. He said, 'My own recent venture into Hansard debates left me more dubious than before about such excursions.' On his departure from the High Court, Sir Ninian expressed his belief that he had fulfilled the role of adjudicator rather than legislator.


In 1981, Mr Fraser recommended to the Queen that Sir Ninian Stephen replace Sir Zelman Cowen as Governor-General, and he took up the role in July 1982. A former jurist from Australia's highest court may seem like a natural fit for the role of Governor-General—particularly so given that, in addition to Sir Ninian, his successor in the High Court, Sir William Deane, would later be recommended for that role by the Keating government. Former judges of other courts have held the office before and since, but it is worth noting that the only time prior to Sir Ninian's appointment that a former High Court justice had occupied the position was Sir Isaac Isaacs in 1931. After the controversy that had embroiled Sir John Kerr, Sir Zelman Cowen had restored confidence in the role of Governor-General, and there was a great national interest for this to continue. Sir Ninian had recommended himself for the role not just through his record as a balanced and apolitical judge but also by his engaging personality and skill as a speech maker.


The constitutional turmoil of the previous decade was still very much front of mind for the country, and many of the questions asked of him at the informal press conference at his home after the announcement of his appointment addressed this matter. Asked for his views on the reserve powers, Sir Ninian said, 'These were a necessary fallback,' adding, 'For instance, if the Prime Minister has lost the confidence of the House and could no longer command a majority, then it is extremely doubtful that a Governor-General would be obliged to accept his advice.' As one would anticipate, he had a strong command of the constitutional responsibilities of a Governor-General but also recognised that the role did not require him to entirely surrender his independent judgement.


Senator Brandis has also referenced the events of February 1983, when Mr Fraser sought a simultaneous dissolution of the House and the Senate—in part, in an attempt to forestall the replacement of Mr Hayden as leader of the opposition by Mr Hawke. As Senator Brandis outlined, Sir Ninian insisted on being properly informed of the reasons for the simultaneous dissolution and acted to satisfy himself of the constitutionally correct course—of course, the appropriate action to take. But, in the process, Mr Fraser, so confident of the outcome of his request that he had scheduled the press conference for 45 minutes after his appointment at Government House, unannounced, found himself facing Mr Hawke, not Mr Hayden, and the rest is history. Of course, it was Bill Hayden who subsequently replaced Sir Ninian at Yarralumla in 1989.


The duties of a Governor-General are many and varied in addition to the constitutional role, and, certainly, many speeches were made by Sir Ninian Stephen. He came to the role at a time when it became more acceptable for the head of state to represent Australia overseas, and he did so. But perhaps one of the most significant acts of his term occurred in the centre of our country, because, in October 1985, Sir Ninian handed over the title deeds to Uluru to its traditional owners, who then leased it back to the nation as a national park. In this speech, he recognised that the handover symbolised the need:


… to balance specifically Aboriginal rights, morally based in natural law in the light of historical catastrophe and dispossession, with the concept of national unity.


Whilst there is no consistent precedent for the term of office of a Governor-General, it is a measure of the regard in which he was held that his tenure was extended beyond five years, to include the whole of the bicentennial year and into 1989. His biographer, Philip Ayres, stated that Prime Minister Hawke had the highest regard for him, his integrity, his intelligence and his commitment to this country. Sir Ninian saw his primary role as representing the Australian nation to the Australian people.


The next stage in Sir Ninian's service was, of course, as Ambassador for the Environment, a post to which he was appointed, as Australia's first ambassador, by Bob Hawke. Sir Ninian's interest in the environment had manifested itself in several different ways throughout his life. He was an occasional bushwalker, he had maintained a holiday residence on the River Murray and whilst on the High Court he had travelled the wilderness of Tasmania near Lake Pedder with Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick, then President of the Australian Conservation Foundation—that I had not remembered, Mr President—and a young doctor from Launceston, Bob Brown. I note that, as early as 1990, Sir Ninian was articulating the economic and environmental dangers that would stem from increasing average global temperatures. Reflecting on changes to the productivity of land and rising sea levels, he stated, 'Climate change may mean that in relatively few years our whole infrastructure becomes mislocated'.


I turn now to his work as an international jurist and peacemaker. The work Sir Ninian Stephen undertook in the 1990s and early 2000s is perhaps the most underappreciated of the phases of his career, but in many ways it is the most significant. He became a key peace broker in Northern Ireland in 1992, hardly an easy task given the sectarian divide which stretched back centuries. It's little wonder a headline in The Sunday Age asked the question 'Belfast bound, so why is this man still smiling?' Six years before the Good Friday Agreement, the going was tough. Sir Ninian attempted to mediate a dialogue between parties who at that time were not ready to come to the table with sufficient compromises or a willingness to accept others in order to bridge the gulf between them. In 2012, Lord Mayhew, who was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at the time of the talks, stated that he had:


… absolutely no doubt that Sir Ninian's contribution prepared the ground very significantly for the developments that subsequently culminated in what came to be known as the Good Friday Agreement.


In 1993, the UN General Assembly elected Sir Ninian to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for a four-year term. The Attorney has spoken in more detail about that contribution. Already serving on the International Court of Justice—in which he was involved in a case between Portugal and Australia contesting oil exploration and exploitation rights in the Timor Gap, an issue that only now seems to be coming to an acceptable conclusion—and the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Sir Ninian's nomination was announced by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans, and Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch. His duties later extended to the tribunal for Rwanda. 


Following the completion of his term at the international tribunals—he had elected to retire rather than seek reappointment—Sir Ninian found himself at work again, at the request of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who appointed him to head a group of experts inquiring into the feasibility and practicalities of a tribunal to try former leaders of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. It was a difficult, political assignment but, much like his mission in Northern Ireland, Sir Ninian's groundbreaking endeavours would later bear fruit. Three surviving Khmer Rouge leaders finally went on trial in November 2011. International assignments such as this continued into the 2000s, including as head of an International Labour Organization team to investigate whether or not assurances to eliminate forced labour were being fulfilled in what is now known as Myanmar.


The first whole-of-life biography of Sir Ninian Stephen, by Philip Ayres, is titled Fortunate Voyager. It is easy to see how Sir Ninian, a warm and caring man described by Ayres as 'charming and witty in conversation, and non-judgemental and optimistic in outlook', was indeed a fortunate voyager. Yet in his journeys along multiple paths throughout his life—all 94 years of it—one can appreciate how fortunate so many have been to benefit from his dedicated and selfless service. His work was diverse, his contributions significant, his commitment to service manifest. Our country—indeed, the world—owes Sir Ninian Stephen a great debt. We mourn his passing and again extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends at this time.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:13):  On behalf of all of my parliamentary colleagues in the Greens—and, indeed, the entire Australian Greens family—I'd like to offer our deepest condolence to the family of Sir Ninian Stephen, including to Lady Stephen, their daughters and their respective families. I won't spend too long, as most of the contribution that I wanted to make has been covered by both the Attorney-General and Senator Wong. We've heard of Sir Ninian's incredibly distinguished legal career with the Supreme Court of Victoria before moving to the High Court of Australia, where he brought a moderating influence to the bench.  He was often a voice of reason. Among many things Sir Ninian will be remembered for is providing the deciding opinion in the case of Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen, effectively to uphold the legitimacy of the Commonwealth government to make the Racial Discrimination Act and to give effect within Australia to the United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The effect of that decision was that the Wik traditional owners of the Aurukun region of the Cape York Peninsula were able to purchase land, a right that one might think today is unquestionable, but it wasn't; it was a hard-fought right, and Sir Ninian played a pivotal role in that outcome.


He was held with regard while Justice of the High Court. His calm and measured style well explains his appointment to the role of Governor-General, where he contributed to the restoration of trust and confidence in that office following the events of 1975. Sir Ninian went on to become Australia's first ambassador for the environment and in that capacity he worked to ban mining in Antarctica. He headed up peace talks in Northern Ireland. He was a judge for the international criminal tribunal investigating war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, and he helped draft a constitution for Afghanistan. Sir Ninian was a statesman, he was a humanitarian and he was a devoted family man. On behalf of the Australian Greens, we would like to thank and honour him for his service.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:15):  I rise on behalf of the Nationals to pass on our condolences to the family of Sir Ninian Stephen and to celebrate his contribution to the nation. Much has already been contributed in this place to his remarkable career. Sir Ninian was a man of humility, intellect, generosity and courtesy, and a man with a sense of a lifelong duty and warmth of character. He is most notably known for his role as Australia's 20th Governor-General serving between 1982 and 1989, but his life is full of achievements that deserve reflection in this place.


Born on a poultry farm in Nettlebed near Oxford in the United Kingdom on 15 June 1923, he was the only child of Frederick and Barbara Stephen. Sir Ninian's father passed away when he was only six months of age, so he was raised in the loving care of his mother, who worked for an expatriate daughter to a wealthy Queenslander, Miss Beatrice Mylne. Miss Beatrice Mylne was a strong-minded woman with some political views that I'm sure many people in this place would take some issue with, but she did make a significant contribution to the education and early years of Sir Ninian's life. Miss Beatrice Mylne and his mother insured Sir Ninian received a good education, and it was on this solid foundation started in the United Kingdom and continued here in Australia that set Sir Ninian on a life path of humble achievement. He spent time abroad in Europe, and because of this Sir Ninian became fluent in German as well as speaking French impeccably—a skill he would use in later life, including as Governor-General during a conference with French President Mitterrand.


At the age of 16, Sir Ninian moved to Australia with his mother, and he spent a year at Scotch College in Melbourne. In 1941, he commenced the study of law at the University of Melbourne whilst working as an article clerk with Allen Arthur Robinson solicitors in Melbourne. But Sir Ninian's time as a university student was short lived, as he stood like many men of the time in active service of our country in World War II. From 1941 to 1946—a significant time both in history and in a young man's life—Sir Ninian served with the Australian military forces in the Pacific, specifically in Borneo and New Guinea, and he made his way up to the rank of lieutenant before being discharged. Upon return to Melbourne, he resumed studies and completed a law degree and a legal career followed. Others have reflected upon this career that lead to his appointment as Justice of the High Court in 1972.


Prior to all this, however, Sir Ninian met and married his lovely wife, Valery Mary, and together they had—what may have been seen certainly from him as his five proudest achievements, his daughters—Mary, Ann, Sarah, Jane and Elizabeth. Mrs Stephen was described by The Canberra Times in 1982 as the very model of a Governor-General's wife, but we know she was an esteemed lady in her own right involved in many of the community activities supporting other women and children, as well as successfully raising five career-orientated and successful daughters. Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser chose Sir Ninian Stephen as an admiral successor to Zelman Cowen, Australia's 19th Governor-General. Sir Ninian Stephen's posting was said to be years in the making, well deserved and widely welcomed. In fact, Gough Whitlam congratulated the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, for a Governor-General of Sir Ninian Stephen's calibre.


Governor-General was a role that Sir Ninian was humbled by, stating in his official statement to the posting: 'This is a very great honour that our country has done us.' He articulated his thoughts on the role as representing not simply the Queen in Australia but 'the Australian nation to the people of Australia'. He is remembered as a highly successful Governor-General, including for his contribution to Australia's foreign affairs. Sir Ninian Stephen's contribution in this area continued in his future career, including in his role in peace negotiations in Northern Ireland. He would acknowledge that his contribution might not have brought immediate peace to Northern Ireland; however, many have reflected that his patient efforts helped bring about the Good Friday agreement in 1998.


I think we could all learn something from his approach to these and other difficult discussions that he was involved in. His technique was to encourage those he was working with to state their positions and then allow a solution to be brokered through that discussion rather than imposing himself and his solutions onto others. It is a tribute to his humility that, when asked what he thought of the role of Governor-General and why he was chosen, he thought it best that his actions do the talking and responded with:


I don't know. That calls for an immodest answer. It's much better that others should think up the reasons.


The reasons are certainly renowned now. Since his passing on 29 October 2017, tributes have flooded in for Sir Ninian and the man that he was. High Court Judge Michael Kirby, at Sir Ninian's 80th birthday, said:


Serving Australia was not enough for Ninian Stephen. He went beyond and served a wider world.


He was a great statesman, a great mind and an even greater man. Vale Sir Ninian Stephen.

The PRESIDENT
 (16:24):  I inform the Senate that, at 8.30 am today, five proposals were received in accordance with standing order 75. The question of which proposal would be submitted to the Senate was determined by lot. As a result, I inform the Senate that the following letter has been received from Senator Hanson:


Pursuant to standing order 75, I give notice that today I propose to move ""That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency: 


""The need to restore the international competitiveness of Australian manufacturers by reducing electricity prices.""


Is the proposal supported?




More than the number of senators required by the standing orders having risen in their places—




The PRESIDENT:  It is. I understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in today's debate. With the concurrence of the Senate, I shall ask the clerks to set the clock accordingly.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:25):  The federal government will be remembered for its monumental failure to provide reliable—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson, I've been advised that I need you to formally move the motion.




Senator HANSON:
  Sorry; I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


The need to restore the international competitiveness of Australian manufacturers by reducing electricity prices.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Hanson. You can now address the motion.




Senator HANSON:
  There is a need to reduce electricity prices so Australian manufacturers can be competitive. The federal government will be remembered for its monumental failure to provide reliable, continuous and internationally competitive electricity and gas prices. There is no mood for forgiveness in the electorate. The next election will be a bloodbath. The small number of Liberal and National candidates who win a seat will be huddled together on the opposition benches. It's the only way they will keep warm.


Queensland, more than any other state, is dependent on electricity because it is uncommon for gas to be used for heating or cooking. Consequently, Queensland households and businesses feel the pain of high electricity prices more than those in any other part of Australia.


Malcolm Turnbull claims his electricity plan will cut household bills by between $100 and $155 a year, or $2 a week. This is a joke, when households are paying $2,000 a year and more for electricity. Australia needs electricity prices which are comparable to those available to manufacturers overseas. We regularly pay more than $100 per megawatt for electricity. That is twice or three times the international competitive electricity price. Electricity which costs more than $45 a megawatt, including transmission and distribution, makes Australian manufacturing uncompetitive. Australian coal-fired power stations can produce electricity in the range of $8 to $32 a megawatt, making it possible to provide electricity at globally competitive prices. But these old faithful power stations are being phased out and they are not being replaced, because of the belief that carbon emissions are causing climate change. Some scientists say climate change is caused by burning fossil fuels, and others say we are experiencing a natural warming cycle. But, before the science is clear, we must decide whether to destroy our manufacturing and agricultural industries. Even if Australia ceases all man-made carbon emissions today, it would make no difference to the world, because China, India and the United States plan to continue to burn fossil fuels.


It is just too easy to move our manufacturing to countries that have what we do not—and I am talking about reliable, continuous and globally competitive electricity prices. All the polls say we will have a Labor government soon. But be warned: Labor is without a plan to reduce electricity prices to globally competitive levels. In Queensland, the Labor government wants to have 50 per cent of power coming from renewable schemes by 2030. But let's look at the cost, because they range from $100 to $800 a megawatt-hour to produce. These renewable sources are intermittent in their generation and do not provide the continuous supply required to support manufacturing and agriculture.


As I have already said, the price of electricity needs to fall below $45 a megawatt hour if we are to maintain and further attract manufacturing in this country. The government's solution to the crippling electricity price is to introduce the National Energy Guarantee, the NEG, to the National Electricity Market, the NEM. The NEG simply obliges retailers to guarantee supply and emissions, but there is no price promise. Twenty years ago, the National Energy Market did not exist, and individual states had their own generators, transmission lines and means of distribution. Under this arrangement, real electricity prices fell continuously between 1955 and 1984.


During this period, manufacturing thrived in Australia and we attracted energy-intensive industries, including steel, aluminium and fertilisers. Today, these same energy-intensive industries are leaving us and taking with them thousands of jobs. This government would like to tell you that our labour costs are too high, that our future is in service industries and that we need to work smarter. But I'm here to tell you that it won't matter how smart we work if we cannot deliver to business and households globally competitive gas and electricity prices.


The manufacturer of aluminium in Australia is, indeed, the canary down the coalmine. One electricity price caused this industry to move offshore, and the balance of our manufacturing will be in danger of doing the same. I am a Queensland senator, and there's no way I am going to look the other way while manufacturing jobs are lost in Queensland. The Boyne aluminium smelter, located south of Gladstone, was built in 1981 following the negotiation of a long-term electricity contract to provide electricity every minute of every hour for 30 years. Later, the Boyne smelter owners bought their electricity supply from the Gladstone power station. But, in 2016, the smelter could not acquire additional electricity, so they cut production and announced job losses. These jobs meant everything to the people who relied on them, but their families were not the only ones to suffer; many other jobs indirectly associated with the smelter were also lost.


Two other Australian aluminium smelters have closed recently, one in New South Wales and one in Victoria, because they could not find long-term electricity contracts at globally competitive prices. I don't want to see the only aluminium smelter in Queensland close because politicians will not solve the problem of uncompetitive, high electricity prices. Electricity represents 40 per cent of the cost of producing aluminium, which is high compared to the Australian manufacturing average of around nine per cent. But when the electricity price stops products being made or grown in Australia, the government needs to act decisively.


Agricultural businesses also use huge amounts of electricity to irrigate and keep produce cool. Farmers have repeatedly shared their concerns about electricity prices with the Australian Labor Party, but they have been ignored. There is no point in the government bragging about free trade agreements that open up markets if electricity prices mean Australian products and produce are too expensive to be sold in these newly opened markets. Rapidly escalating energy prices, like the ones we have seen in the past year, are a death sentence for manufacturers in Queensland. The economic argument that high prices breed efficiency is rubbish if you go out of business before you can develop those efficiencies.


We don't have much time to save manufacturing in Queensland or anywhere else in Australia. One Nation is a small party with limited influence, but in Queensland One Nation has a plan to cut electricity prices and keep them that way. My four-point plan is to build a new coal-fired power station in Queensland to ensure we generate electricity at a globally competitive price; write off billions of dollars spent on gold plating the transmission network, which will immediately drop electricity prices; negotiate the removal of the GST from electricity bills; and end excessive margins made by energy retailers.


It is a disgrace that each year 22,000 Queensland households have their electricity disconnected for failure to pay. That is a shocking 430 households a week. These electricity bills should never have been so high in the first place. It is a little-known but well-documented fact that the state government of Queensland sets the electricity price in Queensland. So, if you have been disconnected or stressed paying electricity bills, I recommend you put Labor last on 25 November in the Queensland state election. Labor, with its ideological but not scientific devotion to green energy, is prepared to throw manufacturing jobs under the bus for government. It's a tragedy.


If the next Queensland government follows my prescription, it is going to have to give up its debt habit and learn to manage its budget. I want the savings from lower electricity prices left with households and businesses. Families and businesses know how best to spend or save money from lower electricity bills. Wake up Australia: take your power back and vote for candidates who can explain to you how they are going to lower electricity prices and bring manufacturing back to Australia.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-11-13,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:34):  I could be a little cheeky and echo Senator Hanson's words, 'Vote for candidates who will reduce electricity prices in my home state of Queensland,' but I would mean, 'Vote for the LNP candidates,' because that's exactly what they will do.


I want to congratulate One Nation for raising this real matter of urgency. Too many times in this chamber we have urgency debates about ridiculous topics that the Greens and the Labor Party dream up, but I thank One Nation for raising this very important issue. I have to say that the idea of reducing electricity prices to help the competitiveness of Australian industry is a good one but not a new one. I well remember that in Townsville, where I'm based, almost 20 years ago—it may even have been 30 years ago—when there was a Liberal government in power in Canberra, we worked hard to encourage Korea Zinc's subsidiary Sun Metals to set up a zinc refinery, and one of the attractions we proposed to this significant Korean company was cheap power, which Australia had 20 to 30 years ago. They were looking at setting up in Korea or in Queensland. I remember that the Hon. John Moore was the business minister who negotiated this deal. There was cheap power in Queensland, so Sun Metals set up there. The cheap power, of course, was because in Queensland we are blessed with high-quality coal that produces good electricity cheaply, and that's why Korea Zinc came there. Over the years, with Labor Party interaction at both state and federal level, the prices of electricity have gone up and up and up, to the extent that I'm sure that Korea Zinc and Sun Metals now wish they had never heard the word 'Australia', because they are struggling to maintain the 300, 400 or 500 people that work at that plant in Townsville, because of the cost of electricity.


It's not just the renewable cost. The Labor Party in Queensland have actually been gouging the electricity prices to prop up their own budget. How can they gouge the price? Well, that's easy: they're the only ones who own the generators in Queensland. So, if the state budget is a little bit shy in any year, they just whack up the price of electricity. Don't worry about the jobs in Townsville. Don't worry about the jobs elsewhere in Queensland.


Whilst I respect what Senator Hanson says about her party, can I tell you that the LNP in Queensland, of which I'm a member, don't just have promises; they have a track record. They were the ones who, in government, froze household tariff 11 for one year, saving the average household $120 a year. They were the party who, in government, opposed the carbon tax, saving an average Queensland household $170 a year. They were the ones who reduced wasteful expenditure on the network infrastructure, which Senator Hanson mentioned, which would have increased electricity prices by some $7 billion. They were the government that closed Labor's Solar Bonus Scheme, which was expected to cost Queenslanders around $3.4 billion by 2028. They were the ones who maintained the uniform tariff policy to ensure that regional Queenslanders like me don't pay more for electricity than people in the south-east. They also capped prices on obsolete and transitional tariffs at 10 per cent to support Queensland farmers and businesses, and they exposed Labor's secret plans for the government network business to jack up prices, which would have resulted in even higher prices.


I want to say that, whilst I agree with much of what One Nation says, One Nation are not blameless themselves. APPEA have said:


In a miracle of economics, One Nation claims that it will bring gas prices down by banning gas production across most of Queensland.


Perhaps this is an outdated thing, Senator Hanson; perhaps you have a different policy now. But certainly this was your policy on 5 October. You can't reduce prices if you are restricting the flow of gas into the grid and into electricity generation within Queensland and elsewhere in the nation. So One Nation are not blameless in this. But, if that's wrong, Senator Hanson, you or one of your colleagues might clarify that later in this debate.


GetUp! people or union people invaded my office last Friday to give me a petition, this time on Manus. Fortunately when they were there I was in Papua New Guinea doing real work, so I don't know why they were hoping to give me a petition when I was in another country working for Australia. The guy who was arrested there—I've never met him or seen him or heard of him, but he's clearly a GetUp! person or a union man—has a letter in today's paper saying, 'All these renewable energy projects around Townsville will mean the difference, and it's not costing the taxpayer anything; it's all privately funded.' We all know that is absolute rubbish. The subsidies that go into renewable energy are just incredible. Huge subsidies go into renewable energy, which someone has to pay for, and it's the Australian taxpayer.


Unfortunately, former Senator Roberts is not here. I used to like his forensic examination of these issues. He and I keep asking the Greens, 'Okay, so you want renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions from Australia so we'll save the Barrier Reef?' I keep asking the Greens to answer this. None of them ever will. Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. So, if it's carbon emissions that are killing the world, only 1.2 per cent of those emissions are from Australia. The Labor Party have promised to reduce our emissions by 50 per cent. Fifty per cent of 1.2 is 0.6. I once asked the Chief Scientist in estimates: 'What impact will it have on the world's climate if we reduce our emissions by 1.2 per cent?' and the Chief Scientist said, 'Virtually none.'


The Greens and the Labor Party, with all of this renewable energy, will destroy Australian industry—and Senator Hanson mentioned that very clearly in her address—and make costs so expensive, not just for manufacturing but also for each household. And what impact will that have on the world's climate change? Absolutely none, according to the Chief Scientist. The Greens are hell-bent on reducing Australia's output of carbon. According to the Parliamentary Library, the number of power plants that Australia has commissioned in recent years is 73 units. At the same time, China have increased their output by 2,107 units, and India by 877 units. I repeat: Australia, 73; China, 2,107; and India, 877. All this rhetoric you get from the Greens to make you feel warm and fuzzy—'Yes, we're going to reduce our carbon emissions'—will make absolutely no difference to the changing climate of the world, but it will destroy jobs. It has destroyed jobs in Australia, and it does make it more expensive for Australians to live.


In the last few seconds remaining to me, I can give the Greens some good news: the Australian Institute of Marine Science and GBRMPA are doing research and are now working on making coral resistant to bleaching—not that any coral bleaching is the fault of Australia; it might be the fault of the world, but it's certainly not the fault of Australia. Our scientists have taken a proactive, positive approach and are developing corals that are resistant and that are continuing to grow.


Thank you for raising this matter, Senator Hanson. The Greens hypocrisy and mistruths are becoming more and more obvious as each day passes. (Time expired)

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:45):  Woe is me, for my sins in a previous life, that I get the opportunity to follow Senator Hanson and Senator Macdonald in this chamber once again! But we're here to discuss the need to restore international competitiveness of Australian manufacturing by reducing electricity prices. At the heart of all of this, there is a lot of ideology. If we're serious about reducing electricity—




Senator McKenzie:
  Let it go!




Senator DASTYARI:
  I'm getting some Frozen references thrown at me—



Senator McKenzie interjecting—




Senator DASTYARI:
  Oh, I thought you were saying 'Let it go' in terms of the cooling of the planet. I thought that's where you were heading. I thought we were heading down that path.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Dastyari, ignore the interjections.




Senator DASTYARI:
  There's ideology at stake here, because, if we're serious about reducing electricity prices, the one thing that is more important than anything else is providing a level of certainty to industry so that they're able to provide supply. What you have is such a level of uncertainty in what is going on that it is making it difficult for business and industry to make decisions.


One of the fortunate things that we're able to do as senators—and other senators have had these opportunities too—is, through the committee process, to go out and see different parts of Australia and talk to different communities. The Senate Environment and Communications References Committee, which I am a member of, held an inquiry into these matters last year regarding, specifically, the power station at Morwell, which had just announced it was shutting down. It gave us an opportunity to go out there and talk to the workers, specifically, and to the industry and others behind it. Putting aside what I think was some pretty reprehensible behaviour by the French company and how they made those decisions, when we had the opportunity to talk to the other companies that came before us, what they all spoke about was the need to have a level of certainty when they were making investment decisions. Regardless of where you sit ideologically in relation to the debate on renewable technology, what they were saying was they needed to have certain lines drawn in the sand so they could make investment and business decisions based on them.


The government, however, is held back by its own ideological debate and ideological fights on these issues. The Turnbull government is beholden to what can only be described as a far-Right element of their own party. Their latest plan restricts growth in renewables to as little as 28 per cent of Australia's energy by 2030, including rooftop solar. The current renewable energy target will deliver 23.5 per cent by 2020. The government's plan for renewable energy will mean renewable energy will grow by less than 0.5 per cent per year over the next decade, or 250 megawatts a year to 2030, given demand is projected to be flat. When you have the opportunity to have a growing renewable energy sector, surely that is where investment should be directed. 


The renewable energy industry is booming across the world, creating hundreds of billions of dollars of investment, great research and development and, across the world, 9.8 million jobs, but what we've seen is this government, under Prime Minister Turnbull, turning its back on the renewable energy sector and embracing an old-school vision of a coal-fired future for Australia. With all the rhetoric about innovation, jobs and jobs of the future, if jobs in the renewable energy sector aren't jobs of the future then you really have to ask yourself: what are? Already the Abbott-Turnbull government has destroyed one in three energy jobs in Australia based in the renewable sector, and the plan that was recently announced—the NEG, or whatever you want to call it—will destroy thousands more. 


The conservatives dream of a time in Australia when manufacturing in Australia was at its strongest, yet their policies are actually what's bringing manufacturing to its knees by putting so much uncertainty into the market that electricity prices are going to rise. Under the Prime Minister, power prices will keep going up and up, and thousands of jobs in renewable energy and with gas-intensive manufacturers are now at risk. Australia's industrial gas customers have seen no price relief from the Prime Minister's 'gentleman's agreement' with LNG gas exporters, and no export control means the government's gentleman's agreement—this cup of tea; this relationship they believe they've built—isn't actually backed up by anything. There's no legal mechanism at the heart of this, and so gas exporters are free to export gas that could otherwise be used to increase supply and lower prices here in Australia.


For years, Aussie manufacturers have had ready access to cheap and renewable energy suppliers which provided Australian firms with the competitive advantage they needed to compete globally. This is an advantage that has now disappeared. In October the outgoing CEO of BlueScope Steel, Paul O'Malley, told the company's AGM that from 2016 to 2018 BlueScope's energy electricity cost would rise by 93 per cent. The enormity of a rise like that on industry is staggering. In August, it was reported that steel company Milltech's electricity bill had blown out by 160 per cent, which actually related to $1.2 million. Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, James Pearson, has said that the surge in energy costs has forced business to defer investment decisions, with some even thinking of moving abroad.


Australian gas users are once again at the mercy of gas exporters and will continue to pay the price for the Turnbull government's failure to stand up to the big gas exporters. If you look at the government's own regulatory impact statement, it advised that this kind of agreement—this gentleman's agreement or whatever you want to call it—with gas exporters, will 'result in some users exiting the market, resulting in a loss of jobs and economic output'. That is the government's own statement. As it stands, the Turnbull government's latest energy policy thought bubble will strangle the renewable energy industry for perhaps a lousy 50c in three years time. Minister Frydenberg and the Prime Minister can't even guarantee a figure as low as 50 per cent; that's just what has been predicted by others. So, really, at the heart of it is an issue that the government has about certainty and providing certainty.


But it's not just on the issue of electricity that we have seen this ideological debate play itself out; we have seen it play itself out elsewhere. I note that Senator Macdonald was given a little bit of leeway in this debate, and I will take that leeway too. There is an ideological challenge that drives this government on every issue. Take the issue of marriage equality. Australians have now given their opinion through the postal survey; yet there are those in this argument who, just as they are doing with energy and just as they are doing with energy prices, are using ideology to try to drive an agenda. What Senator Paterson has proposed to put in this place is as dangerous as this energy policy that we're here to discuss today. It's not about ensuring equality; it's about ensuring discrimination and taking Australia back 60 years. What you now have are the young fogies of the Liberal Party being led astray by the old fogies. Australians have had their say to make our country a fairer and more equal place, not to take us back to a time where people could be denied service at a shop. The majority of parliamentarians need to respect the outcome of the postal survey when it comes down this week. What I would hate to see is those who oppose marriage equality try to take some kind of a possible 'yes' victory in the postal survey as a basis for more discrimination or as a basis to make a case against equality. That is not the question of this survey and that is not what the amendments should be. Frankly, Senator Paterson should know better than to be led astray by the old fogies in his own party.


Ideology on the conservative side of politics has led to increasing uncertainty when it comes to those who need to make investment decisions as it relates to energy prices. Until this government is able to get itself straight and in order on what it wants to achieve on energy, it is not going to be able to place the downward pressure on prices that is needed to protect and keep Australian manufacturing and jobs.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2017-11-13,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (16:55):  Before I commence, I would like to clarify that this is not my first speech. The Senate is debating today the very important issue of the need to reduce electricity prices. That is something that I expect everybody in this chamber agrees on, but the key point is how we reduce electricity prices—and we certainly don't do it by sloganeering and we certainly don't do it with the economically illiterate arguments that we've heard from some in contributions to the debate thus far. The simple fact is that the people of Australia, including the people of Queensland, my home state, are being ripped off—they are being ripped off by massive corporations like Origin and AGL in my own state of Queensland, and they are being ripped off by the two establishment parties that have put in place the energy and electricity regimes across the states that have led to massive price gouging, that have led to these price rises and that have led not just to increased costs for manufacturing, which is referred to in the proposal before us today, but also to increased costs for households.


Let's not forget that in the last financial year the state government of Queensland made $3 billion from the profits made by state-owned energy corporations, straight out of the pockets of Queensland households. Leading into the state election—we released our policies on this two months ago—the Greens are proposing to put that money straight back into the pockets of Queenslanders. Origin and AGL made $7.2 billion in profits. Those are profits for corporations, and that is profits being put before people. That is the energy regime that has been put in place by Labor and the LNP over successive governments in my home state of Queensland over the last decade. Since Queensland Labor privatised electricity retail in 2006, prices have doubled. Retail charges are now 35 per cent of power bills. The Greens' approach is to roll back Labor's privatisation, to end that price gouging, and to invest in renewable energy.


We hear the economically illiterate and ludicrous approach that we need to build new coal-fired power stations in northern parts of Queensland, which will take 10 years to build—as though that will somehow make energy cheaper rather than more expensive. I had an email from a constituent from Gladstone today. Gladstone, as some may know, has the largest power station in my state of Queensland. It has almost unlimited amounts of gas, if they wanted to tap into it, going through the port of Gladstone and yet the prices are sky-high. It is simply a factor of the privatised, corporatised electricity generation, distribution and marketing regime that has been put in place by Labor and LNP governments following the bidding of their corporate donors. That is what we need to reverse and that is the thing that will reduce electricity prices by substantial amounts, not just for a year or two by way of a subsidy but for year after year after year by reversing the privatisation that occurred before, legislating to make reliable, affordable energy for all Queenslanders something that the government is required to provide. That is what we need to do and that is the approach the Greens have put forward for the Queensland state election. Independent economists, independent energy experts who have examined the Greens' policies, agree that that would lead to savings of at least $600 a year for each and every Queensland household. If we scrapped private electricity retailers and created a single public retailer with a legal mandate to provide affordable and reliable electricity to all Queenslanders, they would each save $600 a year on their electricity bill.


The same sorts of savings would apply to manufacturers in Queensland as well. The jobs would flow on from that. Investing in renewable energy would create over 5,000 jobs a year every year for five years. The Liberal and Labor parties in Queensland want to create a ridiculous, unsustainable mine that would deliver maybe 1,500 jobs and would take all of the investment money that could otherwise be put into renewable energy that would generate over 5,000 jobs year after year after year and create cheaper electricity along the way. They are the visions and the policies that the Greens are putting forward in the state election in Queensland and that is the guaranteed way to get cheaper electricity for all people across this country.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (17:00):  It gives me great pleasure to stand up as a senator from the great manufacturing state of Victoria and talk about the need for reliable, affordable access to energy in this country right now. Unfortunately, as I sat in the chamber and listened to Senator Dastyari, I didn't hear a lot about the ALP's energy policy. I didn't hear a lot about the promotion of a 50 per cent renewable energy target. I didn't hear about the impact of Premier Weatherill's energy policy on his home state of South Australia. I didn't hear a lot about the impact of Daniel Andrews' policy on my home state of Victoria. And I didn't hear a lot about Bill Shorten's energy policy. But one thing I can be sure of from the noises we have heard from the Labor Party about this particular area of policy endeavour is that they have nothing. What they are pursuing is vanity. It is vanity to chase an international target to be seen as do-gooders on the international stage while there are over 950,000 men and women in this country who work hard every day at manufacturing in regional towns, in Melbourne proper and in the northern suburbs and western suburbs of Sydney. There are 950,000 Australians in manufacturing jobs, and they rely on reliable and affordable access to power.


It's great to see Senator Kim Carr in the chamber, a great champion of the manufacturing industry. But I do note Senator Carr is not on the speaking list, because he knows that advanced manufacturing, something he has championed as long as he has been shadow minister and as minister prior, requires access to affordable and reliable energy sources. He knows that there is no use standing up and talking about the Labor Party's energy policy, because they ain't got nothing. He also knows the costs of blackouts, particularly to manufacturers.


The Turnbull government have been delivering in spades in this very complicated and complex area of access to reliable and affordable energy supply. We've accepted 49 out of 50 of the Finkel recommendations, which will actually see us being able to work with the regulators and state and territory counterparts to ensure that our National Energy Market is functioning for all and ensuring that there is competition throughout the market, which will ensure lower prices at the end of the day. We've legislated to abolish the limited merits review process for networking businesses. We've got the ACCC looking at competition policy, because we know that there is a lack of competition within the energy market. Their interim report showed it. We are looking forward to some recommendations when they bring down their final report into what things we can do to get greater competition. We've been able to stop the gaming that was going on around poles and wires. We've suggested that certain state governments who own that infrastructure not take the cream off the top and actually give their own citizens fair access to power prices. We're also working through the COAG Energy Council. We've got the Australian domestic gas security mechanism.


With this particular conundrum, you don't just pull a lever and it all happens. You don't build solar farms all over inland Australia and suddenly have this renewable energy source. That is not how it works. That is how South Australia got into the situation it did. AEMO brought down their report that says my home state, the manufacturing state, will have a 43 per cent chance of a blackout this summer if we keep doing things the same and pursuing policies that, at the end of the day, don't deliver what we need, which is access to reliable and affordable power. We on this side of the chamber know what the impact is of increased energy prices. It's simple; the impact is on jobs. It is on the jobs of working men and women across this country—mums and dads and small business enterprises.


I just want to mention the defence industry, and I note the Minister for Defence is in the chamber. Twenty-five thousand Australians are employed in the defence manufacturing sector. It's a high-tech, future-looking industry which we are building right now. But, when I was speaking at the New South Wales conference of small to medium enterprises engaged in the defence manufacturing sector, the No. 1 concern mentioned by Chris Jenkins was the cost of energy to these businesses. It was having a direct impact on their competitiveness overseas and also on their ability to continue to grow and to employ local Australians in jobs.


I'm a National Party senator, and I cannot come to this energy debate without talking about our $62 billion agricultural industry and our food-processing industry. These are key drivers of our national economy, and in the regions they're our heart and soul. There are 320,000 jobs in the food-processing sector. We know that the increasing energy costs are going to cause agriculture to contract by up to $4.5 billion, and the food-processing sector conducted a study that said it would lose nearly 15,000 jobs simply as a result of increased energy prices. Contrary to those opposite saying the manufacturing sector is contracting, this is a sector which can grow, which wants to grow and which has the nous and the drive to grow, but it cannot when its primary input cost is exponentially increasing year on year.


I just want to touch briefly on one industry very dear to my heart as a Victorian National Party senator, and that's our $13 billion dairy industry, employing 43,000 Australians right across the country. I spoke at a dairy industry meeting a couple of weeks ago, and again high energy costs came to the fore. They are impacting our jobs and our ability to export and to ensure that these businesses are sustainable. When you're producing milk, you've got the farm where you produce the milk, where there's a high energy cost, and you've got the processing of that milk, another high-energy process. For dairy processors, their energy costs around $170 million a year. We are going to see that increase by 50 to 70 per cent this year, another $100 million for our milk processors to simply take what the cows produce in a very natural way and to make sure it's available on the shelves of our supermarkets and our restaurants. Another $100 million equates to an additional 1c a litre per year, or 15 grand for every dairy farmer in this country. That's how much they're going to lose as a result of doing nothing in this space. That is unacceptable.


In terms of on-farm costs, for our individual dairy farmers on the 5,800 dairy farms across this country, we've got a 20 per cent issue around their energy costs. We've got their sheds, the milk vats and the cooling systems they have in place on farm to keep the product fresh. We've got the irrigation pumps, particularly in north central Victoria, where our dairy industry relies on the irrigation sector. The on-farm costs of energy looking forward over this next year are an additional $4,800 per farm for this year. So that's nearly 20 grand for every single farmer when you put the increased costs of processing onto the increased cost of production from simply doing nothing and allowing energy prices to continue as they have and as they've been modelled to do.


It is unacceptable. It's a handbrake on our growth and development, and where that will be most felt will be in the regions. The highly energy-intensive industries are located in regional Australia, and it is those people who will be feeling the impact of those job losses. We can very glibly just shoot off a thousand here and 17,000 people losing their jobs there. Those are actual mums and dads. It is kitchen table stuff—people losing their jobs. It is unacceptable, because we stand here and, as Senator Dastyari said, pursue ideology over a practical response that sees the whole mix up for discussion and on the table. I would implore those senators here who care about Australian families, about a vibrant manufacturing industry and about the 950,000 Australians employed in that industry and the 43,000 Australians employed in the dairy industry to consider a pragmatic, practical approach which, yes, looks at renewables but also ensures there's reliability within the national energy system and electricity market that drives costs down and increases competition so that we can have a vibrant manufacturing sector going forward into the 21st century. It's what we're doing as a government. Please support us.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-11-13,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:10):  It's not a bad place to pick up the debate. Senator McKenzie has argued for a practical approach to energy policy grounded in facts—I think the facts mightn't be a bad place to start. The whole premise of the debate set out by those thought leaders from One Nation is that we have to choose between dealing with climate change and having a manufacturing industry. They're just wrong. They're wrong about this, as they are about many other things. This particular proposition is particularly irritating, because it's not grounded in any facts whatsoever. Bloomberg New Energy Finance—they're the people you might commonly look to in the market for a market-led assessment of what's viable in energy investment—state that the levelised cost of energy of new ultra supercritical coal in Australia will cost between $134 and $203 a megawatt hour. They are very big numbers if people are seriously contemplating investing in new coal-fired energy. By contrast, they put solar at between $78 and $140 a megawatt hour, new-build wind at between $61 and $118 and combined cycle gas at between $74 and $90 a megawatt hour. They sensibly make the observation that new coal is not a viable solution for the pressing need that we have in the energy market, which is to replace our ageing infrastructure. Bloomberg further consider the fact that when you are looking to invest in these very carbon-intensive industries there are real risks—reputational risks, financing risks, regulatory risks—associated with the very high carbon emissions that come from these technologies. They go on to say that even if the government were to completely de-risk coal by paying for the whole plant and guaranteeing an exemption from any future liabilities the lowest levelised cost of energy that could be achieved is $94 a megawatt hour, well above solar, gas or wind.


These are the facts on the ground that the ideological advocates for new coal, sitting mostly up in that back corner of the chamber, need to contend with. Their assertion that this will present a cheap alternative is simply not true. It's simply not true and it's a mark of how far the debate has descended in the coalition party room that the people peddling these untruths are allowed to continue to lead the debate while the more moderate voices sit silently. I do note that every time one of these debates takes place in the Senate, we never hear from the moderate voices. We never hear from the cabinet ministers. We just hear from the people who have no commitment to facts, who are simply committed to repeating the ideological and untrue proposition that new coal-fired power presents any solution whatsoever to Australia's energy problems.


Bloomberg also engaged, earlier this year, in a wide-ranging speech with some of the propositions around reliability and the characteristics of coal that are said to make it so important for maintaining stability and reliability in the NEM. They say we can no longer accept the assertion that coal's base-load characteristics make it inherently more desirable. They say:


In the grid of the not-too-distant future coal’s baseload operation becomes a curse, not a blessing.


The fundamental control paradigm of grids is changing from base load and peak to forecast and balance. The balancing component will require more flexible or firming capacity, not base-load. Gas-fired generation is much better suited to providing the flexibility to this system than coal and it can provide it at a much lower cost.


This group of people up in the back corner of the chamber, in One Nation and the National Party, are living in the past. They are not engaging with the reality of new energy technologies; they are not engaging with the reality of the NEM. They are propagating, essentially, a kind of culture war around energy, where the facts matter much less than what, for them, has become a kind of cultural significance of coal, a cultural attachment to coal. That'd all be very touching and sweet if it weren't being allowed, by the weakness of this Prime Minister, to drag the entire national debate off course.


The thing is that it's not just One Nation proposing new build in coal; it's also Senator Canavan, newly returned to the front bench of this government. He was up again today talking about it and citing, in support of his arguments, a report produced by the Queensland government that, he alleges, supports his ideas. I've done a bit of checking on that, and it is true that the Queensland government engaged a consultant to look at all of the options. That's a sensible thing to do, right? If you're the department and someone's put up a proposition about new coal-fired generation in North Queensland, you might want to go and have a look.


What did they find? They found that an ultra-supercritical coal power station in North Queensland would only be viable under sustained high wholesale energy prices over the 40-year life of the plant, where the wholesale price is maintained at $75 per megawatt hour. They also found that if you introduce a carbon price, say $40 a tonne, the whole thing becomes completely unviable. They highlighted that there are significant risks associated with the development of such a plant, including a real risk that it would become stranded, a white elephant, during changing market conditions. It would be highly exposed to the introduction of a federal carbon price, and this would inhibit the ability for any such plant to obtain finance and maintain value over the life of the plant. It doesn't sound like a good investment to me, not even a little bit. But that is the proposition that One Nation is taking to the election, and, from the sound of it, that is the proposition that the LNP is putting to Queenslanders.


The sad truth is that we are in the midst of an energy crisis, and it is entirely the making of this government. Our investors in the energy sector have been crying out for stability. They have come before committee after committee, review after review, and they've said, 'What we need is a clear set of investment guidelines that are realistically aligned to the carbon reduction task that the global community will expect us to perform.' And they've been waiting for a set of settings just like that for four years, from this government. The truth is that, under the previous Labor government, we did have a clear framework in place to manage the National Electricity Market and reduce carbon, and, in a fit of pique and through a series of entirely opportunistic decisions, the whole thing was dismantled under Mr Abbott.


The coalition have been crab walking sideways towards re-establishing something since they realised the scale of the catastrophe they created. Mr Turnbull—who previously, as we all know, supported emissions trading—kind of floated, through Mr Frydenberg, the idea of an emissions intensity scheme, but that lasted a full 24 hours before it was knocked over by the dinosaurs in the hard Right of the party room. They then fiddled around for a while with Mr Finkel's report, and he, helpfully, tried to support the government by coming up with a clean energy target. That was something that everybody thought was entirely sensible as well, but it couldn't survive the coalition party room. They then came back again for a third go, with a proposition called the NEG, the National Energy Guarantee, which appears to be something that was cooked up in the space of five or six weeks by the Energy Security Board and constitutes an eight-page letter containing a set of ideas to be referred to COAG. This is the sum total of the energy debate in the four years that the government has had to consider this issue and to resolve the pressing investment questions that are facing the sector. There's no point coming in here and bleating about manufacturing and high energy prices if you're sitting over there. If you've been sitting over there and providing support to this government day after day in this chamber, you have to take responsibility for the decisions that they've taken—and the decisions they've taken are precisely none. This is a government entirely paralysed by its own divisions, and it is failing Australia.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:21):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I wish to speak on Auditor-General report No. 14, Performance audit—Design and implementation of the Community Development Programme: Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet; Department of Employment; Department of Human Services.This report was tabled last week and to say that it's shocking would be putting it mildly. You'd think that we were talking about two completely different programs.


I'm a member of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee, which is inquiring into the Community Development Program—an inquiry, which I might say, is being ably chaired by Senator McAllister. We have heard the most amazing and shocking evidence around the faults in this program. It was like we were talking, as I said, about two completely different programs. It's almost like the ANAO are saying, 'They've implemented this really well, but they've implemented a really poor policy design.' Is that what they're saying? It's absolutely incredible. They also rely on Andrew Forrest's Creating Parity report as if that is some accredited document that is signed off by all of the community. That report has been soundly rejected by a large number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and it has been critiqued extensively, in terms of the deep concerns that a lot of people have about that report. But the ANAO report almost references it as if it's the bible of what we should be doing in Aboriginal policy in this country, when, as I said, it has been soundly rejected by a large number of people.


The ANAO's report makes no sense when you actually look at what's happening on the ground. It's almost like a doctor saying, 'Gee, the surgery was really good; it's a pity the patient died'! Hundreds of thousands of people have been penalised and thrown off income support. There are about 35,000 people on the CDP in rural and remote areas, and 85 per cent or more are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. There are more penalties and more people breached off income support with that program than there are for the whole of the income support process and those that have compliance issues. It is having a dramatic and fundamental impact on people's lives.


At our Senate inquiry hearing in Kalgoorlie, one of the people that gave evidence was the superintendent of police in the Kalgoorlie region. He spoke about the impacts of the program that he had seen on communities—the consequences of people being breached and the consequences for people having to move from, for example, Warburton. I myself went to Warburton and spoke firsthand to the people affected by this—and to those in a number of other communities, I might add. They say a number of people are having to move into Kalgoorlie because they don't have access to any funding supports. They're trying to find work or some other visible means of support. And they're having to leave their children back in their home communities. That's having a cascading effect—on grandparents, for example. We've had a number of reports about the reduced spending in communities because people have been breached and don't have money, and of people in communities who have work who are basically spending the whole of their wages now in supporting other community members.


The problems with this program are absolutely intense. As I said, it's like we're talking about two completely different programs. There was very little to no consultation when RJCP was rolled over into the Community Development Program. The program is so bad that even the minister knows that it needs reform. The minister has tried once, with an even worse policy—which, thank goodness, was one of the zombie bills, when that bill was before the last parliament. But even the minister has acknowledged that.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2017-11-13,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:53):  On behalf of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Tehan, I table a ministerial statement in response to the Foreign Affairs and Trade References Committee report on the inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel and a related document.


MINISTERIAL STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE COMMITTEE'S REPORT ON THE INQUIRY INTO SUICIDE BY VETERANS AND EX-SERVICE PERSONNEL


As all Australians know, one suicide is one too many. Tragically, suicide affects all areas of our community—around seven Australians a day will tragically take their own life and it remains the greatest cause of death for men between the ages of 14 and 44.


Veterans and members of our Australian Defence Force (ADF) are sadly not immune. In the latest official figures available from the Australian Institute of Health and Wellbeing (AIHW), which I have detailed to the Parliament, between 2001 and 2015, 325 veterans took their own lives.


Sadly, it appears the number has increased over time. In 2014, the figure was 31. In 2015, this rose to 33.


The Government is committed to addressing suicide in our community. We must understand that everyone including the Government has a role to play if we are to address the incidence of suicide in Australia.


The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee's report on the Inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, The Constant Battle: Suicide by Veterans, was tabled in Parliament on 15 August 2017.


The work of the Committee in preparing this report has been significant and the Government has carefully considered all recommendations that it made.


The Committee's report states:


'The aspirational target rate for suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel should be zero. However, it would be misleading to represent that the recommendations in this report will achieve that goal. Any effective measures to decrease the rate of suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel will require a long-term multifaceted approach involving government, business, non-government and ex-service organisations and the wider Australian community. Change is likely to take a substantial period of time.'


Today, I table the Government's response and outline the measures that we will put in place to reduce suicide and self-harm in the veteran community.


The Government has agreed to all of the recommendations made by the Committee. Today I announce a package of $31.0 million and provide new programs that will deliver better support for veterans and their families.


Jesse Bird—Review


Through its work in its Inquiry, the Senate Committee has drawn on many individual stories. As the Committee notes in the Report, 'bereaved widows, partners, parents, friends and advocates have shared stories which have often ended in tragic loss.' Sadly, the Government has seen examples where the current support services were not good enough.


One such veteran was Jesse Bird. With the approval of his family, today I will show how Jesse's case highlights the need for us to continue to improve the current system.


Jesse Bird took his own life on 27 June this year, at the age of 32. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge his parents Karen and John Bird, his siblings Brendan, Kate and David and their partners, who I have gotten to know since Jesse's regrettable death. I would also like to acknowledge his extended family and extensive network of friends, many of which he served with in the ADF. I would like to reiterate my commitment to them that this Government will continue to drive the reforms necessary to improve the support and care available to veterans and reduce the risk of suicide in the veteran community.


Jesse joined the Australian Army as a Rifleman in 2007. His family remembers him as ""an elite level athlete, booming with charisma and self-confidence and proud to be a member of the ADF."" In 2009, Jesse deployed on Operation SLIPPER to Afghanistan. There he faced the challenging and dangerous nature of service. On 18 July 2009, a close friend of Jesse's was killed in an improvised explosive incident. Jesse returned to Australia in 2010 and in 2012 he voluntarily discharged from the Army.


Following Jesse's discharge, he faced the challenge of transition back into civilian life. Due to physical injuries and the deterioration of Jesse's mental health with the impact of PTSD during his time in the Army, Jesse found it increasingly difficult to find meaningful work that gave him the sense of purpose he had during his time serving in the ADF. Departmental processes failed or simply did not exist to offer services to help Jesse. While struggling with all this, Jesse decided to end his life.


Jesse's case highlights the complexity and breadth of the challenge the Department of Veterans' Affairs faces to support our veterans, particularly those with mental health conditions as a result of their service. These Australians have risked themselves in the service of our country. If these people are not receiving the support they need, then we must continue to drive change.


Following Jesse Bird's death, I asked the Departments of Veterans' Affairs and Defence and the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service to thoroughly examine his case. They have conducted a review which looked at his experience with Defence and Veterans' Affairs. This occurred in consultation with his family.


I delivered a report on this investigation to Jesse's family on 15 September. Amongst other findings, the report into the management of Jesse Bird's case shows that while some aspects of process and management were within expectations, others were contrary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs policy and practice. The Department of Veterans' Affairs either did not or could not provide the support or proactive engagement Jesse needed.


In particular, the report highlighted the issue of providing timely compensation and financial assistance to support those veterans suffering mental health conditions. The requirement for mental health conditions to be stable before being considered for compensation needs to be addressed. In addition, the provision of financial assistance when veterans are at their most vulnerable is needed. These issues let Jesse down as he was unable to get financial assistance when he needed it.


The report identified 19 recommendations, which I have accepted on behalf of the Government and will table today. Many of these align with recommendations put forward by the Senate Committee. These recommendations include priority actions to improve current processes and practices in DVA and progressing initiatives already being considered as part of the Veteran Centric Reform program. The implementation of the recommendations will be independently reviewed after 12 months.


It is the Government's commitment to address the shortfalls identified by this investigation and to put in place urgent changes in the provision of support to our veterans, especially those who are vulnerable or at risk. These veterans must have their claims assessed quickly and have case managers to assist them during what can be a difficult process.


The Department of Veterans' Affairs has apologised to the Bird family for the way in which its processes failed their son and brother. Today I put that apology on the public record. The Department of Veterans' Affairs apologises to the Bird family and to Jesse's extended family and friends.


In examining what happened to Jesse Bird, we have developed plans together that will change Defence and Veterans' Affairs.


The lessons from Jesse's case have helped inform the Government's response to the Senate Committee's report.


I want to assure Mr and Mrs Bird and Jesse's family and friends that the Government is committed to making change happen.


The Senate Report


The Senate Committee made 24 recommendations in its Report. These recommendations asked that the Government undertake a number of different reviews and policy changes to address veterans and defence personnel mental health and suicide prevention.


Firstly, the Committee has recommended that the Government undertake wide-ranging reviews of its processes in Defence and Veterans' Affairs.


Amongst others, the Committee recommended that the Productivity Commission should review the legislative framework of compensation and rehabilitation and review other arrangements in the Department of Veterans' Affairs.


The Government has accepted the recommendations and will ask the Productivity Commission to undertake this review. The Treasurer and I will develop the terms of reference for this review, which will be open to submissions from all Australians.


The Government also accepts the Committee's recommendation that the Australian National Audit Office conduct a review into the efficiency of veterans' service delivery by DVA and will write to the Auditor-General to request to include this review in the 2017-18 programme of work.


In its report, the Committee identified a number of measures that the Departments of Defence and Veterans' Affairs should implement without the need for review. They included recommendations that:


the Departments align the provision of mental health care;


the Career Transition Assistance Scheme include an option for external work experience for veterans;


ADF members are provided DVA White Cards on discharge; and


a two-track program be developed for ADF members leaving Defence.


The Government welcomes these recommendations and agrees to implement them. Many are already being implemented.


Throughout the inquiry, the Committee covered a number of issues relating to the current functions of DVA. To address this, the Committee has provided a number of recommendations.


Firstly, the Committee has recommended a continuation of the Veteran Centric Reform program in DVA, while also providing resources to alleviate claims times and resolve complex cases. This is consistent with the Government's commitment in this year's Budget, which provided over $160 million to Veteran Centric Reform. It represents the largest investment in the Department in over a decade.


The Committee has also recommended that the Government establish a formal Bureau of Veterans' Advocates with the capacity to commission legal representation and training for veteran advocates.


There is an opportunity to improve the regulation of veterans' advocacy to increase quality and consistency of services to veterans. The Government agrees with the Committee in principle that the current advocacy system needs to change.


We will consider the Committee's recommendation for a Bureau of Veterans' Advocates alongside other advocacy models and will consult the veteran community about future directions in veteran advocacy.


Most importantly, the Committee has identified measures that can help us provide support to those who need it today. The Government knows that mental health treatments work best when intervention is early.


This is why we have put in place a system that provides free and immediate treatment for all mental health conditions for anyone with one day's full time service in the military.


As the Committee noted, 'there was almost universal praise from stakeholders regarding the extension of non-liability health care for all mental health conditions.' This reform over the past 18 months has been revolutionary. It has meant treatment for veterans without the need to prove it was linked to service, cutting the administration and processing burden.


However, the Committee has recommended the expansion of a number of services and systems to support this:


1. The development of specific suicide prevention programs targeted towards at-risk groups and a pilot of a case management service for at risk veterans;


2. The expansion of online engagement with younger veterans; and


3. The funding of a trial program to provide assistance animals for veterans with PTSD.


I am pleased to say that work on these recommendations has begun or is about to begin.


Finally, the Committee recommended that the Government should maintain a National Veteran Suicide Register. The Government commissioned the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to provide the first accurate, robust data ever produced on suicide among the serving and ex-serving populations. This data was published last year. The Government has asked the AIHW to continue to independently track this data.


To achieve all of the Committee's recommendations, the Government will put forward a package of $31.0 million. This package will include:


A new Veteran Payment;


Extended Support for Veterans' Families;


GP Health Assessments for the First Five Years Post Discharge;


A Case Management Pilot; and


A Scoping Study to Professionalise Veterans' Advocacy.


This package is part of around $550 million of new programs and money this Government has provided over the last 18 months to veterans and their families.


Conclusion


In closing, I want to reiterate to the entire Australian Defence Force and ex-service community that this Government will continue to prioritise mental health support for our veterans.


Please remember, help is available. Help can make a difference.


If you, your family, or friends are worried about how you are coping or feeling, please reach out. The Defence All-hours support line, VVCS and Lifeline are there for you at any time of the day or night.


The Government would like to thank the Senators who participated in this inquiry and the Secretariat. In particular it would like to thank the work of the Chair Senator Alex Gallacher, and the Deputy Chairs Dr Chris Back and Senator Bridget McKenzie.


The Government would like to thank the individuals and organisations who made a submission to the inquiry or gave evidence at the public hearings for their contribution to this important issue.


Their evidence helped shape this report and will add further to the Government's understanding of how to serve veterans and their families.


As the Prime Minister has said, in this Centenary of Anzac period, we best honour the diggers of over a century ago by caring for the current and former service men and women of today.

The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee's report on the Inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, The Constant Battle: Suicide by Veterans, was tabled in Parliament on 15 August 2017.


The work of the Committee in preparing this report has been significant and the Government has carefully considered all recommendations that it made.


The Committee's report states:


'The aspirational target rate for suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel should be zero. However, it would be misleading to represent that the recommendations in this report will achieve that goal. Any effective measures to decrease the rate of suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel will require a long-term multifaceted approach involving government, business, non-government and ex-service organisations and the wider Australian community. Change is likely to take a substantial period of time.'


Today, I table the Government's response and outline the measures that we will put in place to reduce suicide and self-harm in the veteran community.


The Government has agreed to all of the recommendations made by the Committee. Today I announce a package of $31.0 million and provide new programs that will deliver better support for veterans and their families.


Jesse Bird—Review


Through its work in its Inquiry, the Senate Committee has drawn on many individual stories. As the Committee notes in the Report, 'bereaved widows, partners, parents, friends and advocates have shared stories which have often ended in tragic loss.' Sadly, the Government has seen examples where the current support services were not good enough.


One such veteran was Jesse Bird. With the approval of his family, today I will show how Jesse's case highlights the need for us to continue to improve the current system.


Jesse Bird took his own life on 27 June this year, at the age of 32. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge his parents Karen and John Bird, his siblings Brendan, Kate and David and their partners, who I have gotten to know since Jesse's regrettable death. I would also like to acknowledge his extended family and extensive network of friends, many of which he served with in the ADF. I would like to reiterate my commitment to them that this Government will continue to drive the reforms necessary to improve the support and care available to veterans and reduce the risk of suicide in the veteran community.


Jesse joined the Australian Army as a Rifleman in 2007. His family remembers him as ""an elite level athlete, booming with charisma and self-confidence and proud to be a member of the ADF."" In 2009, Jesse deployed on Operation SLIPPER to Afghanistan. There he faced the challenging and dangerous nature of service. On 18 July 2009, a close friend of Jesse's was killed in an improvised explosive incident. Jesse returned to Australia in 2010 and in 2012 he voluntarily discharged from the Army.


Following Jesse's discharge, he faced the challenge of transition back into civilian life. Due to physical injuries and the deterioration of Jesse's mental health with the impact of PTSD during his time in the Army, Jesse found it increasingly difficult to find meaningful work that gave him the sense of purpose he had during his time serving in the ADF. Departmental processes failed or simply did not exist to offer services to help Jesse. While struggling with all this, Jesse decided to end his life.


Jesse's case highlights the complexity and breadth of the challenge the Department of Veterans' Affairs faces to support our veterans, particularly those with mental health conditions as a result of their service. These Australians have risked themselves in the service of our country. If these people are not receiving the support they need, then we must continue to drive change.


Following Jesse Bird's death, I asked the Departments of Veterans' Affairs and Defence and the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service to thoroughly examine his case. They have conducted a review which looked at his experience with Defence and Veterans' Affairs. This occurred in consultation with his family.


I delivered a report on this investigation to Jesse's family on 15 September. Amongst other findings, the report into the management of Jesse Bird's case shows that while some aspects of process and management were within expectations, others were contrary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs policy and practice. The Department of Veterans' Affairs either did not or could not provide the support or proactive engagement Jesse needed.


In particular, the report highlighted the issue of providing timely compensation and financial assistance to support those veterans suffering mental health conditions. The requirement for mental health conditions to be stable before being considered for compensation needs to be addressed. In addition, the provision of financial assistance when veterans are at their most vulnerable is needed. These issues let Jesse down as he was unable to get financial assistance when he needed it.


The report identified 19 recommendations, which I have accepted on behalf of the Government and will table today. Many of these align with recommendations put forward by the Senate Committee. These recommendations include priority actions to improve current processes and practices in DVA and progressing initiatives already being considered as part of the Veteran Centric Reform program. The implementation of the recommendations will be independently reviewed after 12 months.


It is the Government's commitment to address the shortfalls identified by this investigation and to put in place urgent changes in the provision of support to our veterans, especially those who are vulnerable or at risk. These veterans must have their claims assessed quickly and have case managers to assist them during what can be a difficult process.


The Department of Veterans' Affairs has apologised to the Bird family for the way in which its processes failed their son and brother. Today I put that apology on the public record. The Department of Veterans' Affairs apologises to the Bird family and to Jesse's extended family and friends.


In examining what happened to Jesse Bird, we have developed plans together that will change Defence and Veterans' Affairs.


The lessons from Jesse's case have helped inform the Government's response to the Senate Committee's report.


I want to assure Mr and Mrs Bird and Jesse's family and friends that the Government is committed to making change happen.


The Senate Report


The Senate Committee made 24 recommendations in its Report. These recommendations asked that the Government undertake a number of different reviews and policy changes to address veterans and defence personnel mental health and suicide prevention.


Firstly, the Committee has recommended that the Government undertake wide-ranging reviews of its processes in Defence and Veterans' Affairs.


Amongst others, the Committee recommended that the Productivity Commission should review the legislative framework of compensation and rehabilitation and review other arrangements in the Department of Veterans' Affairs.


The Government has accepted the recommendations and will ask the Productivity Commission to undertake this review. The Treasurer and I will develop the terms of reference for this review, which will be open to submissions from all Australians.


The Government also accepts the Committee's recommendation that the Australian National Audit Office conduct a review into the efficiency of veterans' service delivery by DVA and will write to the Auditor-General to request to include this review in the 2017-18 programme of work.


In its report, the Committee identified a number of measures that the Departments of Defence and Veterans' Affairs should implement without the need for review. They included recommendations that:


the Departments align the provision of mental health care;


the Career Transition Assistance Scheme include an option for external work experience for veterans;


ADF members are provided DVA White Cards on discharge; and


a two-track program be developed for ADF members leaving Defence.


The Government welcomes these recommendations and agrees to implement them. Many are already being implemented.


Throughout the inquiry, the Committee covered a number of issues relating to the current functions of DVA. To address this, the Committee has provided a number of recommendations.


Firstly, the Committee has recommended a continuation of the Veteran Centric Reform program in DVA, while also providing resources to alleviate claims times and resolve complex cases. This is consistent with the Government's commitment in this year's Budget, which provided over $160 million to Veteran Centric Reform. It represents the largest investment in the Department in over a decade.


The Committee has also recommended that the Government establish a formal Bureau of Veterans' Advocates with the capacity to commission legal representation and training for veteran advocates.


There is an opportunity to improve the regulation of veterans' advocacy to increase quality and consistency of services to veterans. The Government agrees with the Committee in principle that the current advocacy system needs to change.


We will consider the Committee's recommendation for a Bureau of Veterans' Advocates alongside other advocacy models and will consult the veteran community about future directions in veteran advocacy.


Most importantly, the Committee has identified measures that can help us provide support to those who need it today. The Government knows that mental health treatments work best when intervention is early.


This is why we have put in place a system that provides free and immediate treatment for all mental health conditions for anyone with one day's full time service in the military.


As the Committee noted, 'there was almost universal praise from stakeholders regarding the extension of non-liability health care for all mental health conditions.' This reform over the past 18 months has been revolutionary. It has meant treatment for veterans without the need to prove it was linked to service, cutting the administration and processing burden.


However, the Committee has recommended the expansion of a number of services and systems to support this:


1. The development of specific suicide prevention programs targeted towards at-risk groups and a pilot of a case management service for at risk veterans;


2. The expansion of online engagement with younger veterans; and


3. The funding of a trial program to provide assistance animals for veterans with PTSD.


I am pleased to say that work on these recommendations has begun or is about to begin.


Finally, the Committee recommended that the Government should maintain a National Veteran Suicide Register. The Government commissioned the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) to provide the first accurate, robust data ever produced on suicide among the serving and ex-serving populations. This data was published last year. The Government has asked the AIHW to continue to independently track this data.


To achieve all of the Committee's recommendations, the Government will put forward a package of $31.0 million. This package will include:


A new Veteran Payment;


Extended Support for Veterans' Families;


GP Health Assessments for the First Five Years Post Discharge;


A Case Management Pilot; and


A Scoping Study to Professionalise Veterans' Advocacy.


This package is part of around $550 million of new programs and money this Government has provided over the last 18 months to veterans and their families.


Conclusion


In closing, I want to reiterate to the entire Australian Defence Force and ex-service community that this Government will continue to prioritise mental health support for our veterans.


Please remember, help is available. Help can make a difference.


If you, your family, or friends are worried about how you are coping or feeling, please reach out. The Defence All-hours support line, VVCS and Lifeline are there for you at any time of the day or night.


The Government would like to thank the Senators who participated in this inquiry and the Secretariat. In particular it would like to thank the work of the Chair Senator Alex Gallacher, and the Deputy Chairs Dr Chris Back and Senator Bridget McKenzie.


The Government would like to thank the individuals and organisations who made a submission to the inquiry or gave evidence at the public hearings for their contribution to this important issue.


Their evidence helped shape this report and will add further to the Government's understanding of how to serve veterans and their families.


As the Prime Minister has said, in this Centenary of Anzac period, we best honour the diggers of over a century ago by caring for the current and former service men and women of today.

The speeches read as follows—



MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT (NATIONAL DISABILITY INSURANCE SCHEME FUNDING) BILL 2017


With this Bill, this Government is instituting landmark reform to protect Australians in need through fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).


This Government does not just talk big when it comes to protecting our most vulnerable, but delivers decisively for the benefit of future Australian generations.


Sustainably funding our most important programs — such as the NDIS — is real tangible reform; not just empty promises and hot air.


We also know that Australians support this reform because they believe in looking after their mates, no matter their circumstances.


Australians place great faith in our government's range of essential services. However, the burden is still too great on those living with a disability or caring for a family member. No one can truly prepare for the hardship or cost of these responsibilities.


By funding the NDIS, we are working to lighten their load and provide a quality of care that they deserve; to give Australians living with a disability the absolute certainty that high-quality care will be provided for them, both now and into the future.


This is about properly caring for people with disabilities. It has nothing to do with the politics of envy or debates about inequality. Such debates should not be an excuse to do the wrong thing, which is what Labor is sadly doing, despite using the same means to provide NDIS funding themselves when they were in government.


With this Bill, the Government is protecting the essential disability support services that Australians rely upon daily.


With this Bill, the Government is providing certainty. Certainty for people with a disability. Certainty for their families and carers. And certainty to all Australians who may find themselves in a situation that requires these services. Certainty that the NDIS will be fully funded for the long term.


Today, we can give that assurance to all Australians with permanent and significant disability and those who care for them that this vital service will be there for them into the future.


Let me now turn to the detail of the Bill.


The Medicare Levy Amendment (National Disability Insurance Scheme Funding) Bill 2017 is part of a package of measures to secure the Commonwealth's contribution to funding the NDIS.


This Bill will increase the Medicare levy rate by half a percentage point, from 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent, from 1 July 2019.


Following this increase in the Medicare levy rate, one fifth of the revenue raised by the Medicare levy will be credited to the NDIS Savings Fund Special Account. The NDIS Savings Fund Special Account will also hold NDIS underspends, selected saves across the Government, and uncommitted funds from the Building Australia Fund and the Education Investment Fund. Along with the Commonwealth's share of the DisabilityCare Australia Fund and the repurposing of existing Commonwealth disability-related expenditure, this meets the Commonwealth's contribution to the NDIS.


Low-income earners will continue to receive relief from the Medicare levy through the low-income thresholds for singles, families, seniors and pensioners.


People who are exempt from the Medicare levy, such as blind pensioners and people who are entitled to full free medical treatment for all conditions under defence force arrangements or Veterans' Affairs Repatriations Health Card (Gold Card), will continue to be exempt.


A number of other tax rates that are linked to the top marginal rate and the Medicare levy will also increase in line with this change — these include increases in the rate of fringe benefits tax and superannuation excess non-concessional contributions tax.


Bills to give effect to these amendments will also be introduced today and further details of these consequential increases are set out in the Explanatory Memorandum.


With the decision to increase the Medicare levy rate from 1 July 2019, this Government is asking Australians to contribute – according to their capacity – to funding the NDIS and ensure it is guaranteed and secure for current and future generations.


A few years ago, the Opposition Leader asked Australians to do the very same thing, and contribute to the NDIS through a 0.5 per cent increase in the Medicare Levy.


The Opposition Leader voted 'yes' then, and now he wants to vote 'no' to suit his political agenda, pitting Australians against Australians.


When Labor left office in 2013, they also left a $55.7 billion funding shortfall for the NDIS. Now is the time to finally rectify that shortfall. This is why I now appeal to all in this Parliament to put aside partisan squabbles about funding, and do the right thing by our most vulnerable fellow Australians.


By fully funding the NDIS, Australians with permanent and significant disability can be assured of access to vital care and support.


Let us not forget that the NDIS has had bipartisan support from the very beginning. Together, the Commonwealth and the States and Territories are committed to delivering the NDIS across the country and the NDIS is on track to be fully rolled out from 2020.


There must be no turning back on this commitment. There must be no more playing politics with disability. Now is the time to fully fund the NDIS once and for all and, with this Bill, we will finally achieve that objective.


Full details of the measure are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:03):  I won't hold up the Senate up for long. The government opposes the disallowance motion. The Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code provides:


Citizenship ceremonies are non-commercial, apolitical, bipartisan and secular. They must not be used as forums for political, partisan or religious expression …


In August, the Darebin and Yarra city councils passed motions cancelling their Australia Day citizenship ceremonies to protest the practice of holding Australia Day on 26 January. They also endorsed the #changethedate campaign and defied a warning from the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection that their motions seriously breached the code. Assistant Minister Hawke responded by revoking the councils' authority to preside over citizenship ceremonies. We believe, in all of the circumstances, this disallowance motion is inappropriate and should not be supported by the Senate.

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (18:04):  I note for the record that this is also not my first speech. I speak in support of this disallowance motion by Senator McKim. This is an extraordinary act of political censorship by this government. It likes occasionally to talk about freedom of speech when the speech it wants to be free is its own and that of those who want to racially vilify others, but when others in the community want to speak out and elected representatives want to make decisions on behalf of and having listened to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in their community and around the nation, this government tries to gag them. Talk about political correctness; talk about trying to stop legitimately-elected local government councillors from being able to make decisions reflecting the views of their local communities. The way democracy is supposed to work is that, if their local community doesn't like the decision they made, they vote them out the next time around. We don't have Big Brother sitting up in the ministerial wing in Parliament House just saying, 'I'm going to put a gag on this entire community because I don't like what you've decided.' That's the attitude of this government on so many things when it comes to the basic freedoms of people in our community. 


We heard from the minister just then that somehow or other this is seen as a political or partisan action by the council. If you're elected representatives, pretty much everything you do can be framed as political. I had cause to reflect on this just today. As senators will be well aware but others listening might not be, I was sworn into the Senate just today. I spent nearly 11 years in the Senate last decade—stretching back into last century, if I want to remind myself how old I am. When we started out today, in the formal part of proceedings we had prayers, as we have always had, and we had an acknowledgement of country. That is just sitting there on the order of business for the start of proceedings every day. When I left this place in 2008 there was no acknowledgement of country. It was only just at the opening of that final parliament I was involved in when the Rudd government was first elected that we had a formal welcome to country for the new parliament conducted by elders of the local Aboriginal community here in Canberra. That was a very moving ceremony, and I think everybody there from all parts of the political spectrum felt what a positive and valuable act of reconciliation that was. It was recognition that the traditional owners, the first people of the land that Parliament House is built on, still have an ongoing living culture that deserves respect and acknowledgement, as does the graciousness of their providing that welcome to us as a new parliament at that time.


These procedures were proposed by the second Aboriginal person elected to this parliament some time back, Senator Aden Ridgeway, following on from Queensland's Neville Bonner. I think we might have had a Senate inquiry into them, and they were opposed as being political—having an acknowledgement of country or a welcome to country was seen as political: 'You can't politicise the parliament; how terrible!' Now, thankfully, not all that much later, we have that welcome to country at the start of every new parliament after an election and we have the acknowledgement of country as part of proceedings every single day in this chamber. That is a welcome development but one that would have been attacked as being partisan, as being political, as politicising the supposedly non-political operations of this chamber and this parliament. It just shows how reactionary and how blinkered and how bullying the approach of the Turnbull government is on this, as it is on so many other issues. 


In my home city of Brisbane the Brisbane City Council similarly have an acknowledgement of the traditional owners before council meetings start in that local government authority—the largest local government authority in this country, as people may be aware. At the last election, in 2016, Jonathan Sri became the first Green to be elected to that local government authority. He put forward that proposal and, to the credit of the LNP, which currently has the numbers on that council, they agreed to it. Just one person putting forward that proposal shows the difference it makes when you get even one Green representative into a chamber, whether it is local council or let's hope in the state parliament in Queensland in the next couple of weeks. 


What we're seeing here is a government that is resisting the tide of history, as the Liberal Party and the National Party tend to do more and more, digging in with that worn-out reactionary, destructive, divisive political agenda, defending their own power, even against what would often be seen as symbolic shifts to recognise others in the community and particularly when we're talking about recognising the original inhabitants of this land. How miserly and how pathetic that they can't just let a democratically elected local council make such a simple decision, and there is debate and discussion that goes around it.


I accept it's fine for the government at the federal level to say, 'We don't support changing the date.' Fine, they can argue that case and others can argue an alternative case, as the Greens are doing. The Greens and others on the local councils in the places in question—Yarra City Council, Darebin City Council and Fremantle City Council, which I'm sure my colleague Senator Steele-John will talk about shortly—have been part of movements in the community and supported movements in the community, including the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, to promote the cause of changing the date. The Liberal Party and the National Party don't have to support that position, but they should not be crushing the views and decisions of the people who have an alternative view, particularly the democratically elected representatives.


I am confident to predict that the change-the-date movement will succeed, that this date will change. There will come a time. It may be 10 years down the track, as it was from when Senator Ridgeway first proposed having a welcome to country at the start of parliament to when it was first implemented. Perhaps it will take 10 years. Who knows? The Greens and others in the community will continue to push for that change, promote that change and support the views of many people in the community, particularly, essentially and necessarily those of first nations people in this country. I said a number of times in this chamber some years back that the one area this institution of federal parliament has failed more than any other is in regard to the first nations people of this country. It has been on so many levels but even on the most basic level of just listening to their views and seeing even just simple things we can do. 


We saw this again recently—and I know Senator Dodson has already had a lot to say on this issue—after so much energy by so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country, partly on the urging of this government, to come together and say: 'This is what we want. Not 100 per cent of us agree, but we've come as close as we can get with the Uluru Statement from the Heart.' They couldn't have put it more simply. This isn't a hard-bitten ideological position; this is a statement from the heart. They put that statement from the heart. They put a lot of heart into and had difficult conversations in providing that statement, and this government couldn't even be bothered to tell them their decision on it. They just dismissed it and they dismissed something as fundamental as that by misrepresenting it atrociously. That's on the big scale. 


On the small scale at a local community and a local council level, again people were acting from the heart. You might not agree with their decisions—I certainly do, but others may not—but you cannot dispute that they're acting out of goodwill, acting from the heart and acting from having listened. They are trying to do something to acknowledge and to take some steps to move this nation towards listening to and acting in response to the wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country.


It is so disappointing to have such a reaction. It was such a sledgehammer, bullying and speech-crushing approach from this government. That shows me, frankly, that, apart from being bullies, they are scared of the community movement on this and so many other issues. That is why it is so important for the Senate to support this disallowance motion to say that we won't stand for this sort of rubbish—this sort of appalling, pathetic, petty, Nazi nonsense that we're getting now.


It is worth noting in the context of the change-the-date movement, which the government, through the minister, have expressed their opposition to, that three or four days ago in the SA Music Awards the song 'Change the Date' by AB Original and Dan Sultan won best song. It is a song that has captured the imagination of young people and not so young people, like me, around the country because they see what it taps into. Again, it taps into the heart, and maybe that's why this government doesn't get it—because it has no heart. The heart is long gone; whatever was there has been bought off by its corporate donors. But Australians get it. So many Australians get that we need to change the date, and we need to change our approach, as a parliament and as a wider community, to one that just listens—listens to what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people want.


This parliament—through this government and previous governments—is a signatory to, and has given its commitment on the international stage to, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and its simple components. It's not a particularly long document and it's not full of complex legalese; it's about some very basic and important principles. Australia, among many other nations around the world, unfortunately, has some of the worst records when it comes to the treatment of its indigenous peoples—and I won't catalogue all of them here now. Within that declaration, which this parliament and its government has said on the international stage that it supports, is a simple fact about ensuring that there is free, prior and informed consent with regard to indigenous peoples on issues that concern them.


It should be pretty obvious to everybody what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people think about Australia Day and the debate around it. I does concern Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people—and it concerns many of them deeply. Of course, there is not a 100 per cent universal view across every single Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person in the country; there never is with any group in the community. But there is clearly very widespread and, in many cases, very deep concern and a lot of hurt about Australia Day as it operates today and some of the jingoism and other symbolism, statements and actions that attach to it.


If we as a parliament, in particular, and at the local level can't listen to our own communities, particularly those communities who have been most harmed by past actions and often by current actions, what hope do we have for the future if we cannot listen to something as simple as this? Local government is often dismissed, particularly at the federal level, as being a small matter, and it's a matter of great disappointment to me and the Greens that what seemed like a window of opportunity under the Gillard government to finally get constitutional recognition of local government—to recognise its importance; something that was agreed to as a commitment by the Gillard government—never came about and the question was never put to a referendum. So local government once again was left dismissed as not significant enough. But it is of course the area of government that is closest to the community.


The councils that I mentioned previously—the Yarra City Council and the Darebin City Council—are closest to the community and, at the local level, are listening to the people about something as basic as a citizenship ceremony. I'm sure all of us here have been to citizenship ceremonies and recognise what beautiful, lovely ceremonies they are. As I and many others have said many times, alongside the clearest failure of Australia as a nation, which has been the failure to properly work with, engage with and listen to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the first nations people, one of the great successes and positives, one of the things that has built the real positives of this nation, has been the migrant communities and their willingness to engage with and build on the nation as it continues to evolve.


In my experience, it's often those recent arrivals and new citizens who are the ones that are most open to listening to the views of the nation's original inhabitants. Their hearts are still open when they come to this new land and sign on and commit as citizens in an explicit act that those of us that were born here haven't had to do. For those of us that are born here, it's just an accident of history that we're citizens. We're talking about people who've come here and have made a positive decision to become a citizen of this country. In my experience, in so many cases, those people are the ones who are most open to wanting to hear more about not just the history but also the living cultures of the original inhabitants of the entire continent of Australia and their local communities.


It's wonderful how citizenship ceremonies have started to build in more and more involvement of representatives from the original inhabitants of the areas where the ceremonies are held. That is another thing that has evolved over time. If councils had tried to do that in the past, they probably would have been attacked for trying to be political by involving Aboriginal representatives and traditional owners in citizenship ceremonies. Now it's seen as not only acceptable; I think it would be seen as inappropriate if there was no involvement of traditional owners or Aboriginal representatives in citizenship ceremonies. So why not allow individual councils to explore progressing further in this regard? Why not try it out? Why not see how it works? Why not give a local council that basic freedom to decide how they want to welcome people into their community? It frankly baffles me.


The only reason I can see that we would have such nasty pettiness is that that is what the Liberal and National parties are now reduced to. All they are now capable of is instantly reacting in such a mean, nasty, bullying, heartless, cruel, pathetic way. I really hope that everyone else in this chamber is not signing themselves up to that agenda and that they will ensure that Australia continues to be a welcoming, open-hearted, open-minded country that looks to continually progress and evolve—one that, if we ever hope to move beyond the colonial era, which we still haven't really done, properly listens to and works with as well as supports and acts in response to the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

"Steele-John, Sen Jordon",AG,2017-11-13,"



Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (18:21):  Before speaking to this disallowance motion, I would first like to acknowledge and pay my respects to the traditional owners of the land on which we meet—the Ngunnawal peoples. It is upon their ancestral lands that this parliament is built, and I believe every occupant of this chamber would do well to remember that in all that they do.


I would also like to acknowledge and recognise that 26 January is a day of mourning for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and that the Greens support them in their call for the date of Australia Day to be changed. We in the Greens recognise this call; however, I am sorry to say that this chamber and the other place do not. It is also the case that our states and territories of Australia also do not at this point recognise that call, so it has been left to local governments to act in this space and to show the leadership which is so sadly lacking in so many of our other democratic institutions.


I am proud to say, as a senator from Western Australia, that it was in fact the City of Fremantle which first put this on the national agenda last year when they, as a community, consulted with the Whadjuk people, who are the traditional owners of that area, and decided that they would take the first national step in bringing attention to the fact that 26 January is not viewed by our traditional owners as a day upon which you can simply kick back and have a beer and that it is in fact a day on which it is remembered that these lands, which we call our own, were and remain the lands of others, that they were forcibly taken and that dispossession and murder were commonplace and formed the foundation of this country.


I am very sad to see that Senator Cormann has decided to suggest that any council which seeks to recognise this reality of our history is in fact playing politics in an area where politics does not belong. I would caution anybody on either side of this chamber from making such an argument. I would ask them to reflect deeply upon the company in which they are placing themselves when they suggest that this is something which should not and cannot be done. It was once—and in this place and in others and at other points in time—suggested that it could not be done in relation to leaving Aboriginal children with their parents. It was once suggested that there could not and should not be reconciliation processes in this country. It is, sadly, still suggested that there is no place for a dedicated voice of our first nations people in this chamber. But, as we have seen, and as history shows with those first two examples, such views prove themselves not to last well in the stark sunlight of history. Movements rose up and said no. They said no to segregation. They said no to a nonexistence in terms of voting rights. They said no to the stealing of children. And they said no to the hiding of that reality.


Today, I take my seat in a chamber which was opened alongside the traditional owners of this place, and Senator Bartlett is right to note that it is only recently that this has become the case. I do not believe it will be too long before we look back upon discussions such as this and think to ourselves: how could we ever have suggested that a day which has only been a national holiday since the year in which I was born, 1994, should be held as such a sacred moment of national unity that it should be continued with at the expense of our first nations people and their profound traumatic experiences.


I speak to this motion as a proud Western Australian, as a proud member of the Australian Greens and as someone who hopes to see a little more leadership in this place in the future. Thank you.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Thank you, Senator Steele-John. I take it—




Senator Steele-John:
  It's not my first speech.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, we're on the same wavelength. That's fine.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-11-13,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:27):  I rise to sum up.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Sorry, Senator McKim, I've been informed that you have spoken before.




Senator McKIM:
  My advice is that, as the mover of the motion, I'm entitled to respond to the speeches given.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  As the mover of the motion, yes, that's correct.




Senator Cormann:
  So you're closing the debate.




Senator McKIM:
  If no-one else wishes to contribute, then, yes, Senator Cormann, I presume I will be closing the debate and, in doing so, I thank everyone for their contributions. I particularly thank the last two speakers, Senator Bartlett and Senator Steele-John, for outstanding contributions to this debate. I thank the Labor Party for its support for this disallowance motion and I take this opportunity to condemn, with absolutely no surprise at all, the culture warriors in the Liberal Party who, once again, have prevailed in this debate, who, once again, have exercised their muscle internally inside the Liberal and National parties and who, once again, are demonstrating, as Senator Bartlett just went through in fine detail, their pettiness and their refusal to listen to the most important people in this debate: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia, our first peoples, the people who had this land stolen from them, at the point of a musket, when Europeans arrived just over 200 years ago. They are the people who—at least in my home state in Tasmania—have faced an attempted genocide, and I do use that term advisedly, in the full knowledge and understanding of what it means in law to say that there was an attempted genocide in Tasmania not long after European people arrived.


I remember attending the first Invasion Day—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, I'm sorry to interrupt, but it being 6.30, the Senate now shall suspend until 7.30.




Sitting suspended from 18:30 to 19:30





Senator McKIM:
  As I was about to refer to before we suspended, I attended the first Invasion Day march in Hobart a number of years ago. From memory, there were about 50 people at that march. I have attended most, if not all, of the Invasion Day marches in Hobart since that day. I have watched the crowds grow and grow in number. I am proud to say that at the Invasion Day march in Hobart this year, on Invasion Day, there were well over—and I do mean 'well over'—1,000 people. In fact, there were potentially as many as 1,500 people at that rally. They were rallying to say that this is not a day that can be celebrated by them because it is a day that unfortunately symbolises for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country the day that their land was taken from them at the point of a musket.


It is worth pointing out that senators who will vote against this disallowance motion today—the Liberal Party, National Party, One Nation and, sadly, Nick Xenophon Team senators in this place—will find themselves on the wrong side of history, because the day will change. The date of Australia Day will change. It will change so that all Australians can celebrate Australia Day. Tragically, that is not the case at the moment because many, many Australians—including, of course, the first peoples, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country, but also many non-Indigenous Australians, me and my Greens colleagues included—find that we can't genuinely celebrate Australia Day on the date on which it is currently marked because of the dark history that is associated with that day. It will be a great day for our country when the date is changed.


I remember when I had the honour to be sworn in as a minister in the Labor-Green government in Tasmania which existed between 2010 and 2014. One of the first portfolios that I held was the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio in Tasmania. One of the first actions I took as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in Tasmania was to write to the then federal Aboriginal affairs minister, Ms Macklin, and ask her to support me as the Tasmanian Aboriginal affairs minister in moving to change the date on which Australia Day is marked. I remember how disappointed I was when Ms Macklin declined my offer and indicated by return letter that, in fact, Labor at that time supported—and they still do, unfortunately—the current date of Australia Day.


This disallowance motion obviously relates to the actions of two councils in Victoria that quite appropriately and after deep consultation with their local communities made a decision not to conduct citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day. Now, citizenship ceremonies, and I'm sure all senators would agree, are amongst the most joyous events that we get to attend. They are events at which people take the ultimate step to become Australians. Many people who do that have come to our country fleeing persecution, fleeing war, fleeing trauma and fleeing dispossession, and they go through the lengthy and onerous process that exists to become Australian citizens. They're fantastic events, and I'm sure that I'm not the only person in this place who gets the odd tear in their eye at citizenship ceremonies throughout the year. But these two councils, Yarra and Darebin, made a decision, on the basis of the dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, that they could not in good conscience continue to hold citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day. I would like to congratulate all the councillors in those two councils who supported those decisions.


What was the government's response? Well, the government's response was vindictive. It was petty. It was mean-spirited. It took the biggest sledgehammer it could find to one of the smallest walnuts you would ever like to see. It is as big a storm in as small a teacup as I have seen. This government came into this place and brought in a disallowable instrument that means, if it passes, that the capacity of those councils to conduct any citizenship ceremonies at all will be removed. And that's what we are debating today, whether that instrument should pass through this Senate, and therefore the parliament, or whether it should be disallowed. The Greens, by moving this disallowance motion, have made our position abundantly clear. Again, I want to thank the Labor Party for their support for this motion.


A number of arguments from Liberal and National party senators, both in this place and in the public conversation in our country, have attempted to rationalise their petty and vindictive decision by reference to the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code—in particular, that part of the code in chapter 3 which goes to the holding of citizenship ceremonies themselves. They are relying on the following words to justify their pettiness and vindictiveness. Page 6 in chapter 3 of the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code says:


Citizenship ceremonies are non-commercial, apolitical, bipartisan and secular. They must not be used as forums for political, partisan or religious expression or for the distribution of material which could be perceived to be of a commercial, political or religious nature.


When you look at those words in context, their meaning is clear. Their meaning is abundantly clear. What they mean is that the citizenship ceremonies ought not be conducted in a commercial way, a political way or a partisan way. They, as the words explicitly state, ought not be used as forums for political, partisan or religious expression. When taken in context, these words clearly relate to the conducting of citizenship ceremonies—that is, what happens within citizenship ceremonies that are conducted.


The Greens agree absolutely that citizenship ceremonies should not be political. They should not contain political matter or political material. They should not contain commercial matter or commercial material. They ought not contain religious matter or religious material. Any of those things occurring within a citizenship ceremony would be grossly inappropriate, but on no reasonable construction of those words can they be read to mean that councils cannot make a decision on which date to hold a citizenship ceremony for political reasons. Yet that is what the government is arguing here. 


The government is arguing that the Yarra and Darebin councils are in breach of the code. Well, I say piffle and hogwash to that. Those councils are not in breach of the code at all, because the code clearly goes to how citizenship ceremonies should be conducted. It is a heroic interpretation of this code to suggest that the words that I just read out can reasonably be taken to mean that councils cannot make decisions on which date to hold citizenship ceremonies for political reasons. Yet that heroic interpretation of the code is the only foundation that the government is relying on to support its view that two councils in Melbourne ought to have their capacity to hold citizenship ceremonies stripped away from them because they have made an entirely reasonable and entirely justifiable decision not to hold citizenship ceremonies on Invasion Day. 


It's a sad reality in this place—and something that I hadn't come across in large part in my time in the state parliament of Tasmania—that so many members of the Liberal and National parties did not come into this place to make a difference to how we manage our environment, to make a difference in terms of creating jobs, to make a difference in terms of infrastructure investment, or to advance human rights; they came here to fight the culture wars. When you distil everything that has been done and said in this debate, when you evaporate away all of the hot air, what you are left with is a small rump inside the Liberal and National parties whose sole reason for coming to this place was to fight the culture wars and who again are flexing their muscle and delivering riding instructions to the Prime Minister and the rest of the LNP party room in this place. It's a sad, sad reality that in fact it is that small rump who are responsible for the motion that this disallowance motion seeks to disallow. 


Of course we can't forget, and we ought never forget, who is actually pulling the strings here. Although this motion to strip away the powers of two Melbourne councils to hold citizenship ceremonies is in the name of Mr Hawke, never forget who his boss is—Mr Dutton, the man who boycotted the apology to the stolen generations, an out-and-out racist. He's the one who is pulling the strings here. He's the one who instructed Mr Hawke to bring into the parliament this motion that the Greens are seeking to disallow. He's one member, if not the most powerful member, of that small cabal inside the Liberal and National parties who have come into this place with one aim and one aim alone: to make progressive change in this country more difficult and slow and, where possible, to wind back progressive changes that have been made. We are seeing that today, and never more starkly, in regard to marriage equality. We have a bill that achieved consensus support through a committee process and yet we have got representatives like Senator Paterson, the agent of the IPA in this place, and others who are in that cabal inside the Liberal and National parties coming out with their own piece of legislation which if passed would actually increase discrimination faced by LGBTIQ people. 


Just as that is a front in the culture wars, so is the motion that we are seeking to disallow today a front in the culture wars. Well, I have got some news for that cabal, and that is that the Australian Greens are prepared to take on that rump, that cabal, inside the Liberal and National parties at every step. We have taken them on over their desire to water down the protections against race-based hate speech in this country, section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. We took them on and we won. We took them on on their divisive and hateful citizenship legislation. We took them on and we beat that, and thanks to a Greens motion that was recently discharged from the Notice Paper. That was legislation designed to make it more difficult for non-English-speaking people to become citizens in this country. Again, they were taken on and they were defeated. We are going to take them on every step of the way because we believe in multiculturalism as a foundation of our country. We believe that people from diverse cultures right around the world have made an epic contribution to our country and have helped us to build this country into what it is today. We want to work with anyone from any party in this place towards more progressive change in this area, towards a treaty with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, towards stronger protections against race-based hate speech and racism in our country. We want to see citizenship made available to those who genuinely deserve it without their having to pass tertiary-level English language tests to achieve it. Make no mistake, that citizenship legislation risks taking our country back to the White Australia policy because of course it was language tests that gave effect to the White Australia policy back in the day. 


In summary, again I thank the Australian Labor Party for indicating their support for this disallowance motion. I just want to leave senators with one final thought: when the date on which Australia Day falls is moved—and that will come in the future—the date it is moved to will genuinely be a day we can all join together as a country and celebrate Australia Day as it should be celebrated. (Time expired)

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:03):  I won't hold up the Senate up for long. The government opposes the disallowance motion. The Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code provides:


Citizenship ceremonies are non-commercial, apolitical, bipartisan and secular. They must not be used as forums for political, partisan or religious expression …


In August, the Darebin and Yarra city councils passed motions cancelling their Australia Day citizenship ceremonies to protest the practice of holding Australia Day on 26 January. They also endorsed the #changethedate campaign and defied a warning from the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection that their motions seriously breached the code. Assistant Minister Hawke responded by revoking the councils' authority to preside over citizenship ceremonies. We believe, in all of the circumstances, this disallowance motion is inappropriate and should not be supported by the Senate.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2017-11-13,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (18:04):  I note for the record that this is also not my first speech. I speak in support of this disallowance motion by Senator McKim. This is an extraordinary act of political censorship by this government. It likes occasionally to talk about freedom of speech when the speech it wants to be free is its own and that of those who want to racially vilify others, but when others in the community want to speak out and elected representatives want to make decisions on behalf of and having listened to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in their community and around the nation, this government tries to gag them. Talk about political correctness; talk about trying to stop legitimately-elected local government councillors from being able to make decisions reflecting the views of their local communities. The way democracy is supposed to work is that, if their local community doesn't like the decision they made, they vote them out the next time around. We don't have Big Brother sitting up in the ministerial wing in Parliament House just saying, 'I'm going to put a gag on this entire community because I don't like what you've decided.' That's the attitude of this government on so many things when it comes to the basic freedoms of people in our community. 


We heard from the minister just then that somehow or other this is seen as a political or partisan action by the council. If you're elected representatives, pretty much everything you do can be framed as political. I had cause to reflect on this just today. As senators will be well aware but others listening might not be, I was sworn into the Senate just today. I spent nearly 11 years in the Senate last decade—stretching back into last century, if I want to remind myself how old I am. When we started out today, in the formal part of proceedings we had prayers, as we have always had, and we had an acknowledgement of country. That is just sitting there on the order of business for the start of proceedings every day. When I left this place in 2008 there was no acknowledgement of country. It was only just at the opening of that final parliament I was involved in when the Rudd government was first elected that we had a formal welcome to country for the new parliament conducted by elders of the local Aboriginal community here in Canberra. That was a very moving ceremony, and I think everybody there from all parts of the political spectrum felt what a positive and valuable act of reconciliation that was. It was recognition that the traditional owners, the first people of the land that Parliament House is built on, still have an ongoing living culture that deserves respect and acknowledgement, as does the graciousness of their providing that welcome to us as a new parliament at that time.


These procedures were proposed by the second Aboriginal person elected to this parliament some time back, Senator Aden Ridgeway, following on from Queensland's Neville Bonner. I think we might have had a Senate inquiry into them, and they were opposed as being political—having an acknowledgement of country or a welcome to country was seen as political: 'You can't politicise the parliament; how terrible!' Now, thankfully, not all that much later, we have that welcome to country at the start of every new parliament after an election and we have the acknowledgement of country as part of proceedings every single day in this chamber. That is a welcome development but one that would have been attacked as being partisan, as being political, as politicising the supposedly non-political operations of this chamber and this parliament. It just shows how reactionary and how blinkered and how bullying the approach of the Turnbull government is on this, as it is on so many other issues. 


In my home city of Brisbane the Brisbane City Council similarly have an acknowledgement of the traditional owners before council meetings start in that local government authority—the largest local government authority in this country, as people may be aware. At the last election, in 2016, Jonathan Sri became the first Green to be elected to that local government authority. He put forward that proposal and, to the credit of the LNP, which currently has the numbers on that council, they agreed to it. Just one person putting forward that proposal shows the difference it makes when you get even one Green representative into a chamber, whether it is local council or let's hope in the state parliament in Queensland in the next couple of weeks. 


What we're seeing here is a government that is resisting the tide of history, as the Liberal Party and the National Party tend to do more and more, digging in with that worn-out reactionary, destructive, divisive political agenda, defending their own power, even against what would often be seen as symbolic shifts to recognise others in the community and particularly when we're talking about recognising the original inhabitants of this land. How miserly and how pathetic that they can't just let a democratically elected local council make such a simple decision, and there is debate and discussion that goes around it.


I accept it's fine for the government at the federal level to say, 'We don't support changing the date.' Fine, they can argue that case and others can argue an alternative case, as the Greens are doing. The Greens and others on the local councils in the places in question—Yarra City Council, Darebin City Council and Fremantle City Council, which I'm sure my colleague Senator Steele-John will talk about shortly—have been part of movements in the community and supported movements in the community, including the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, to promote the cause of changing the date. The Liberal Party and the National Party don't have to support that position, but they should not be crushing the views and decisions of the people who have an alternative view, particularly the democratically elected representatives.


I am confident to predict that the change-the-date movement will succeed, that this date will change. There will come a time. It may be 10 years down the track, as it was from when Senator Ridgeway first proposed having a welcome to country at the start of parliament to when it was first implemented. Perhaps it will take 10 years. Who knows? The Greens and others in the community will continue to push for that change, promote that change and support the views of many people in the community, particularly, essentially and necessarily those of first nations people in this country. I said a number of times in this chamber some years back that the one area this institution of federal parliament has failed more than any other is in regard to the first nations people of this country. It has been on so many levels but even on the most basic level of just listening to their views and seeing even just simple things we can do. 


We saw this again recently—and I know Senator Dodson has already had a lot to say on this issue—after so much energy by so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country, partly on the urging of this government, to come together and say: 'This is what we want. Not 100 per cent of us agree, but we've come as close as we can get with the Uluru Statement from the Heart.' They couldn't have put it more simply. This isn't a hard-bitten ideological position; this is a statement from the heart. They put that statement from the heart. They put a lot of heart into and had difficult conversations in providing that statement, and this government couldn't even be bothered to tell them their decision on it. They just dismissed it and they dismissed something as fundamental as that by misrepresenting it atrociously. That's on the big scale. 


On the small scale at a local community and a local council level, again people were acting from the heart. You might not agree with their decisions—I certainly do, but others may not—but you cannot dispute that they're acting out of goodwill, acting from the heart and acting from having listened. They are trying to do something to acknowledge and to take some steps to move this nation towards listening to and acting in response to the wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country.


It is so disappointing to have such a reaction. It was such a sledgehammer, bullying and speech-crushing approach from this government. That shows me, frankly, that, apart from being bullies, they are scared of the community movement on this and so many other issues. That is why it is so important for the Senate to support this disallowance motion to say that we won't stand for this sort of rubbish—this sort of appalling, pathetic, petty, Nazi nonsense that we're getting now.


It is worth noting in the context of the change-the-date movement, which the government, through the minister, have expressed their opposition to, that three or four days ago in the SA Music Awards the song 'Change the Date' by AB Original and Dan Sultan won best song. It is a song that has captured the imagination of young people and not so young people, like me, around the country because they see what it taps into. Again, it taps into the heart, and maybe that's why this government doesn't get it—because it has no heart. The heart is long gone; whatever was there has been bought off by its corporate donors. But Australians get it. So many Australians get that we need to change the date, and we need to change our approach, as a parliament and as a wider community, to one that just listens—listens to what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people want.


This parliament—through this government and previous governments—is a signatory to, and has given its commitment on the international stage to, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and its simple components. It's not a particularly long document and it's not full of complex legalese; it's about some very basic and important principles. Australia, among many other nations around the world, unfortunately, has some of the worst records when it comes to the treatment of its indigenous peoples—and I won't catalogue all of them here now. Within that declaration, which this parliament and its government has said on the international stage that it supports, is a simple fact about ensuring that there is free, prior and informed consent with regard to indigenous peoples on issues that concern them.


It should be pretty obvious to everybody what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people think about Australia Day and the debate around it. I does concern Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people—and it concerns many of them deeply. Of course, there is not a 100 per cent universal view across every single Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person in the country; there never is with any group in the community. But there is clearly very widespread and, in many cases, very deep concern and a lot of hurt about Australia Day as it operates today and some of the jingoism and other symbolism, statements and actions that attach to it.


If we as a parliament, in particular, and at the local level can't listen to our own communities, particularly those communities who have been most harmed by past actions and often by current actions, what hope do we have for the future if we cannot listen to something as simple as this? Local government is often dismissed, particularly at the federal level, as being a small matter, and it's a matter of great disappointment to me and the Greens that what seemed like a window of opportunity under the Gillard government to finally get constitutional recognition of local government—to recognise its importance; something that was agreed to as a commitment by the Gillard government—never came about and the question was never put to a referendum. So local government once again was left dismissed as not significant enough. But it is of course the area of government that is closest to the community.


The councils that I mentioned previously—the Yarra City Council and the Darebin City Council—are closest to the community and, at the local level, are listening to the people about something as basic as a citizenship ceremony. I'm sure all of us here have been to citizenship ceremonies and recognise what beautiful, lovely ceremonies they are. As I and many others have said many times, alongside the clearest failure of Australia as a nation, which has been the failure to properly work with, engage with and listen to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the first nations people, one of the great successes and positives, one of the things that has built the real positives of this nation, has been the migrant communities and their willingness to engage with and build on the nation as it continues to evolve.


In my experience, it's often those recent arrivals and new citizens who are the ones that are most open to listening to the views of the nation's original inhabitants. Their hearts are still open when they come to this new land and sign on and commit as citizens in an explicit act that those of us that were born here haven't had to do. For those of us that are born here, it's just an accident of history that we're citizens. We're talking about people who've come here and have made a positive decision to become a citizen of this country. In my experience, in so many cases, those people are the ones who are most open to wanting to hear more about not just the history but also the living cultures of the original inhabitants of the entire continent of Australia and their local communities.


It's wonderful how citizenship ceremonies have started to build in more and more involvement of representatives from the original inhabitants of the areas where the ceremonies are held. That is another thing that has evolved over time. If councils had tried to do that in the past, they probably would have been attacked for trying to be political by involving Aboriginal representatives and traditional owners in citizenship ceremonies. Now it's seen as not only acceptable; I think it would be seen as inappropriate if there was no involvement of traditional owners or Aboriginal representatives in citizenship ceremonies. So why not allow individual councils to explore progressing further in this regard? Why not try it out? Why not see how it works? Why not give a local council that basic freedom to decide how they want to welcome people into their community? It frankly baffles me.


The only reason I can see that we would have such nasty pettiness is that that is what the Liberal and National parties are now reduced to. All they are now capable of is instantly reacting in such a mean, nasty, bullying, heartless, cruel, pathetic way. I really hope that everyone else in this chamber is not signing themselves up to that agenda and that they will ensure that Australia continues to be a welcoming, open-hearted, open-minded country that looks to continually progress and evolve—one that, if we ever hope to move beyond the colonial era, which we still haven't really done, properly listens to and works with as well as supports and acts in response to the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

"Steele-John, Sen Jordon",AG,2017-11-13,"



Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (18:21):  Before speaking to this disallowance motion, I would first like to acknowledge and pay my respects to the traditional owners of the land on which we meet—the Ngunnawal peoples. It is upon their ancestral lands that this parliament is built, and I believe every occupant of this chamber would do well to remember that in all that they do.


I would also like to acknowledge and recognise that 26 January is a day of mourning for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and that the Greens support them in their call for the date of Australia Day to be changed. We in the Greens recognise this call; however, I am sorry to say that this chamber and the other place do not. It is also the case that our states and territories of Australia also do not at this point recognise that call, so it has been left to local governments to act in this space and to show the leadership which is so sadly lacking in so many of our other democratic institutions.


I am proud to say, as a senator from Western Australia, that it was in fact the City of Fremantle which first put this on the national agenda last year when they, as a community, consulted with the Whadjuk people, who are the traditional owners of that area, and decided that they would take the first national step in bringing attention to the fact that 26 January is not viewed by our traditional owners as a day upon which you can simply kick back and have a beer and that it is in fact a day on which it is remembered that these lands, which we call our own, were and remain the lands of others, that they were forcibly taken and that dispossession and murder were commonplace and formed the foundation of this country.


I am very sad to see that Senator Cormann has decided to suggest that any council which seeks to recognise this reality of our history is in fact playing politics in an area where politics does not belong. I would caution anybody on either side of this chamber from making such an argument. I would ask them to reflect deeply upon the company in which they are placing themselves when they suggest that this is something which should not and cannot be done. It was once—and in this place and in others and at other points in time—suggested that it could not be done in relation to leaving Aboriginal children with their parents. It was once suggested that there could not and should not be reconciliation processes in this country. It is, sadly, still suggested that there is no place for a dedicated voice of our first nations people in this chamber. But, as we have seen, and as history shows with those first two examples, such views prove themselves not to last well in the stark sunlight of history. Movements rose up and said no. They said no to segregation. They said no to a nonexistence in terms of voting rights. They said no to the stealing of children. And they said no to the hiding of that reality.


Today, I take my seat in a chamber which was opened alongside the traditional owners of this place, and Senator Bartlett is right to note that it is only recently that this has become the case. I do not believe it will be too long before we look back upon discussions such as this and think to ourselves: how could we ever have suggested that a day which has only been a national holiday since the year in which I was born, 1994, should be held as such a sacred moment of national unity that it should be continued with at the expense of our first nations people and their profound traumatic experiences.


I speak to this motion as a proud Western Australian, as a proud member of the Australian Greens and as someone who hopes to see a little more leadership in this place in the future. Thank you.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle

Senator Steele-John:
  It's not my first speech.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, we're on the same wavelength. That's fine.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-11-13,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:27):  I rise to sum up.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Sorry, Senator McKim, I've been informed that you have spoken before.




Senator McKIM:
  My advice is that, as the mover of the motion, I'm entitled to respond to the speeches given.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  As the mover of the motion, yes, that's correct.




Senator Cormann:
  So you're closing the debate.




Senator McKIM:
  If no-one else wishes to contribute, then, yes, Senator Cormann, I presume I will be closing the debate and, in doing so, I thank everyone for their contributions. I particularly thank the last two speakers, Senator Bartlett and Senator Steele-John, for outstanding contributions to this debate. I thank the Labor Party for its support for this disallowance motion and I take this opportunity to condemn, with absolutely no surprise at all, the culture warriors in the Liberal Party who, once again, have prevailed in this debate, who, once again, have exercised their muscle internally inside the Liberal and National parties and who, once again, are demonstrating, as Senator Bartlett just went through in fine detail, their pettiness and their refusal to listen to the most important people in this debate: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia, our first peoples, the people who had this land stolen from them, at the point of a musket, when Europeans arrived just over 200 years ago. They are the people who—at least in my home state in Tasmania—have faced an attempted genocide, and I do use that term advisedly, in the full knowledge and understanding of what it means in law to say that there was an attempted genocide in Tasmania not long after European people arrived.


I remember attending the first Invasion Day—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, I'm sorry to interrupt, but it being 6.30, the Senate now shall suspend until 7.30.




Sitting suspended from 18:30 to 19:30





Senator McKIM:
  As I was about to refer to before we suspended, I attended the first Invasion Day march in Hobart a number of years ago. From memory, there were about 50 people at that march. I have attended most, if not all, of the Invasion Day marches in Hobart since that day. I have watched the crowds grow and grow in number. I am proud to say that at the Invasion Day march in Hobart this year, on Invasion Day, there were well over—and I do mean 'well over'—1,000 people. In fact, there were potentially as many as 1,500 people at that rally. They were rallying to say that this is not a day that can be celebrated by them because it is a day that unfortunately symbolises for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country the day that their land was taken from them at the point of a musket.


It is worth pointing out that senators who will vote against this disallowance motion today—the Liberal Party, National Party, One Nation and, sadly, Nick Xenophon Team senators in this place—will find themselves on the wrong side of history, because the day will change. The date of Australia Day will change. It will change so that all Australians can celebrate Australia Day. Tragically, that is not the case at the moment because many, many Australians—including, of course, the first peoples, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country, but also many non-Indigenous Australians, me and my Greens colleagues included—find that we can't genuinely celebrate Australia Day on the date on which it is currently marked because of the dark history that is associated with that day. It will be a great day for our country when the date is changed.


I remember when I had the honour to be sworn in as a minister in the Labor-Green government in Tasmania which existed between 2010 and 2014. One of the first portfolios that I held was the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio in Tasmania. One of the first actions I took as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in Tasmania was to write to the then federal Aboriginal affairs minister, Ms Macklin, and ask her to support me as the Tasmanian Aboriginal affairs minister in moving to change the date on which Australia Day is marked. I remember how disappointed I was when Ms Macklin declined my offer and indicated by return letter that, in fact, Labor at that time supported—and they still do, unfortunately—the current date of Australia Day.


This disallowance motion obviously relates to the actions of two councils in Victoria that quite appropriately and after deep consultation with their local communities made a decision not to conduct citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day. Now, citizenship ceremonies, and I'm sure all senators would agree, are amongst the most joyous events that we get to attend. They are events at which people take the ultimate step to become Australians. Many people who do that have come to our country fleeing persecution, fleeing war, fleeing trauma and fleeing dispossession, and they go through the lengthy and onerous process that exists to become Australian citizens. They're fantastic events, and I'm sure that I'm not the only person in this place who gets the odd tear in their eye at citizenship ceremonies throughout the year. But these two councils, Yarra and Darebin, made a decision, on the basis of the dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, that they could not in good conscience continue to hold citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day. I would like to congratulate all the councillors in those two councils who supported those decisions.


What was the government's response? Well, the government's response was vindictive. It was petty. It was mean-spirited. It took the biggest sledgehammer it could find to one of the smallest walnuts you would ever like to see. It is as big a storm in as small a teacup as I have seen. This government came into this place and brought in a disallowable instrument that means, if it passes, that the capacity of those councils to conduct any citizenship ceremonies at all will be removed. And that's what we are debating today, whether that instrument should pass through this Senate, and therefore the parliament, or whether it should be disallowed. The Greens, by moving this disallowance motion, have made our position abundantly clear. Again, I want to thank the Labor Party for their support for this motion.


A number of arguments from Liberal and National party senators, both in this place and in the public conversation in our country, have attempted to rationalise their petty and vindictive decision by reference to the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code—in particular, that part of the code in chapter 3 which goes to the holding of citizenship ceremonies themselves. They are relying on the following words to justify their pettiness and vindictiveness. Page 6 in chapter 3 of the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code says:


Citizenship ceremonies are non-commercial, apolitical, bipartisan and secular. They must not be used as forums for political, partisan or religious expression or for the distribution of material which could be perceived to be of a commercial, political or religious nature.


When you look at those words in context, their meaning is clear. Their meaning is abundantly clear. What they mean is that the citizenship ceremonies ought not be conducted in a commercial way, a political way or a partisan way. They, as the words explicitly state, ought not be used as forums for political, partisan or religious expression. When taken in context, these words clearly relate to the conducting of citizenship ceremonies—that is, what happens within citizenship ceremonies that are conducted.


The Greens agree absolutely that citizenship ceremonies should not be political. They should not contain political matter or political material. They should not contain commercial matter or commercial material. They ought not contain religious matter or religious material. Any of those things occurring within a citizenship ceremony would be grossly inappropriate, but on no reasonable construction of those words can they be read to mean that councils cannot make a decision on which date to hold a citizenship ceremony for political reasons. Yet that is what the government is arguing here. 


The government is arguing that the Yarra and Darebin councils are in breach of the code. Well, I say piffle and hogwash to that. Those councils are not in breach of the code at all, because the code clearly goes to how citizenship ceremonies should be conducted. It is a heroic interpretation of this code to suggest that the words that I just read out can reasonably be taken to mean that councils cannot make decisions on which date to hold citizenship ceremonies for political reasons. Yet that heroic interpretation of the code is the only foundation that the government is relying on to support its view that two councils in Melbourne ought to have their capacity to hold citizenship ceremonies stripped away from them because they have made an entirely reasonable and entirely justifiable decision not to hold citizenship ceremonies on Invasion Day. 


It's a sad reality in this place—and something that I hadn't come across in large part in my time in the state parliament of Tasmania—that so many members of the Liberal and National parties did not come into this place to make a difference to how we manage our environment, to make a difference in terms of creating jobs, to make a difference in terms of infrastructure investment, or to advance human rights; they came here to fight the culture wars. When you distil everything that has been done and said in this debate, when you evaporate away all of the hot air, what you are left with is a small rump inside the Liberal and National parties whose sole reason for coming to this place was to fight the culture wars and who again are flexing their muscle and delivering riding instructions to the Prime Minister and the rest of the LNP party room in this place. It's a sad, sad reality that in fact it is that small rump who are responsible for the motion that this disallowance motion seeks to disallow. 


Of course we can't forget, and we ought never forget, who is actually pulling the strings here. Although this motion to strip away the powers of two Melbourne councils to hold citizenship ceremonies is in the name of Mr Hawke, never forget who his boss is—Mr Dutton, the man who boycotted the apology to the stolen generations, an out-and-out racist. He's the one who is pulling the strings here. He's the one who instructed Mr Hawke to bring into the parliament this motion that the Greens are seeking to disallow. He's one member, if not the most powerful member, of that small cabal inside the Liberal and National parties who have come into this place with one aim and one aim alone: to make progressive change in this country more difficult and slow and, where possible, to wind back progressive changes that have been made. We are seeing that today, and never more starkly, in regard to marriage equality. We have a bill that achieved consensus support through a committee process and yet we have got representatives like Senator Paterson, the agent of the IPA in this place, and others who are in that cabal inside the Liberal and National parties coming out with their own piece of legislation which if passed would actually increase discrimination faced by LGBTIQ people. 


Just as that is a front in the culture wars, so is the motion that we are seeking to disallow today a front in the culture wars. Well, I have got some news for that cabal, and that is that the Australian Greens are prepared to take on that rump, that cabal, inside the Liberal and National parties at every step. We have taken them on over their desire to water down the protections against race-based hate speech in this country, section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. We took them on and we won. We took them on on their divisive and hateful citizenship legislation. We took them on and we beat that, and thanks to a Greens motion that was recently discharged from the Notice Paper. That was legislation designed to make it more difficult for non-English-speaking people to become citizens in this country. Again, they were taken on and they were defeated. We are going to take them on every step of the way because we believe in multiculturalism as a foundation of our country. We believe that people from diverse cultures right around the world have made an epic contribution to our country and have helped us to build this country into what it is today. We want to work with anyone from any party in this place towards more progressive change in this area, towards a treaty with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, towards stronger protections against race-based hate speech and racism in our country. We want to see citizenship made available to those who genuinely deserve it without their having to pass tertiary-level English language tests to achieve it. Make no mistake, that citizenship legislation risks taking our country back to the White Australia policy because of course it was language tests that gave effect to the White Australia policy back in the day. 


In summary, again I thank the Australian Labor Party for indicating their support for this disallowance motion. I just want to leave senators with one final thought: when the date on which Australia Day falls is moved—and that will come in the future—the date it is moved to will genuinely be a day we can all join together as a country and celebrate Australia Day as it should be celebrated. (Time expired)



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator McKim to disallow two instruments to the Australian Citizenship Act be agreed to.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2017-11-13,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (20:04):  Thank you, Mr President, and can I also extend my congratulations on your new appointment today. Labor will not oppose the passage through the parliament of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. The Parliamentary Library does a very helpful report on all bills that come before this chamber. The report on these bills states that their purpose is to do three things: firstly, to ensure that travel expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income from residential premises is not deductible and not recognised in the cost base of the property for capital gains tax purposes; secondly, to deny income tax deductions for the declining value of 'previously used' depreciating assets used in producing assessable income from the use of residential premises as residential accommodation; and, thirdly, to amend the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 to provide that an annual vacancy fee is payable by foreign owners of residential real estate where property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months in a 12-month period.


The government indicated at budget time that these measures were their crackdown on negative gearing in relation to the two aspects I have already mentioned and that the measures were about reducing pressure on housing affordability. Whilst I've said we won't oppose these bills through the parliament, we certainly don't believe that these measures, in isolation of a broader housing response, will reduce the pressure on housing affordability that is needed, particularly in certain markets. It's typical of the Orwellian way the government likes to operate that these measures are being put together in a bill and put forward as initiatives to reduce pressure on housing affordability. I don't think anyone should operate under the illusion that these measures will do that. This government, which has now been in power for five years, has failed to have a minister responsible for housing, has failed to have a housing strategy, has failed to renegotiate a national housing agreement and has failed in any way to respond to the genuine pressures that are affecting particularly those on lower incomes, those who are renting and those who are struggling to enter the housing market to deal with some of the distortions that we have seen in recent years.


In contrast, from opposition, Labor has put forward—reconfirmed by Senator Cameron as the shadow minister responsible and the leader this year—a comprehensive plan to deal with pressure on housing affordability, including genuine reform of negative gearing. We are not dealing at the fringes but actually reforming negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount as a central focus of our policy. I think it's genuinely understood, even by the government, that any housing affordability package that does not deal with these concessions in a serious way—where the majority of those benefits, those tax concessions, that revenue forgone, are going to high-income earners—is a sham. We know that 50 per cent of the benefit of negative gearing goes to the top 10 per cent of income earners and that 70 per cent of the benefit of capital gains tax concessions goes to the top 10 per cent of income earners. This is where action needs to be taken, and it's not just the Labor Party saying this; there is strong support across groups with expertise in housing and with expertise in tax. Prominent senior economists in this country understand this. The government's own financial systems inquiry drew attention to this. It is not just the Labor Party saying this.


These bills seek to introduce three measures that the government announced in the budget, which I alluded to: disallowing the deduction of travel expenses for residential rental property, limiting plant and equipment deductions to outlays actually incurred by investors, and introducing an annual charge on foreign owners of underutilised residential property. The reform to these arrangements is the reform that you do when you're not really serious about the reform that needs to be done. The government, in this bill, proposes to disallow deductions for travel expenses related to inspecting, maintaining or collecting rent for a residential property. The amendments also do not affect deductions for travel expenditure incurred in carrying on a business of providing property management services. The government estimates this will raise $540 million over the forward estimates.


We're all for ensuring that tax concessions are targeted. I don't think anyone would suggest that Labor haven't been very vocal in this debate—in fact, leading the debate, particularly in relation to negative gearing. But this is not a housing affordability measure. In fact, Treasury in answer to a question on notice about this even said so. It said this was a tax integrity measure, which is an important thing on its own, but this is an acknowledgement from those who have been involved in drafting this bill and advising government that this measure is not something that will reduce pressure on housing affordability.


The second measure involves limiting deductions for assets in residential premises, denying deductions for the decline in the value of previously used depreciating assets used in gaining or producing assessable income from the use of residential premises for the purposes of residential accommodation. The government estimates that this will raise $260 million over the forward estimates. Again, as I said on the previous measure, we are absolutely here for the debate and for supporting ensuring that tax concessions are targeted. That's why we've been arguing for genuine reform on negative gearing. But this on its own, limiting deductions, is not a housing affordability measure. Again, Treasury also accepted in an answer to a question on notice that this is an integrity measure.


The government estimates that the third measure, the charge on foreign owners of residential property where the property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months per year, will generate $16.3 million in revenue over the forward estimates. Again, we don't have any objection to this measure. After all, as part of our plan for housing affordability in the announcements which were made earlier this year, we announced we could facilitate a COAG process to introduce a uniform vacant property tax across all major cities. It's notable that Treasury admitted in an answer to a question on notice that the states and territories were not consulted in relation to this measure. This appears to be the style and practice of this government. We've seen it play out recently, with the government introducing legislation around the national housing agreement that they've put before the parliament without seeking to legislate an agreement that was previously negotiated through COAG or through housing ministers for agreement by COAG. States and territories were not consulted on that either. That would raise the issue of whether the Commonwealth is actually serious about reaching national agreements on areas of such importance, particularly when it relates to some of our community's most vulnerable citizens in relation to homelessness and in relation to the provision of public housing, or social housing, when this is the approach that it's taken. Treasury also confirmed in that answer to the question on notice that there wasn't a direct assumption about how many foreign owners of residential properties would decide to make their properties available to rent. So that is something that is clearly unknown, and perhaps we'll need to wait for this legislation to be amended and to watch it in operation.


I think everyone in this chamber knows that Australia is in the midst of a housing affordability and homelessness crisis. House prices in many major cities have skyrocketed, home ownership rates have plummeted and many vulnerable Australians have limited or no access to housing. The housing crisis is only getting worse. Since the government came to office in September 2013, capital city house prices have soared by 30 per cent, with increases of nearly 50 per cent in Sydney and over 30 per cent in Melbourne. Home ownership is at a 60-year low, and home ownership rates for 25- to 34-year-olds have collapsed from around 60 per cent to less than 40 per cent in the last 30 years. Rental stress is also on the rise, with the proportion of low-income households experiencing rental stress now at more than 40 per cent.


That great Australian dream of home ownership has really turned into a nightmare for many, and it has done so on this government's watch. In stark contrast to the approach that the government has taken, the Labor Party, from opposition, has been the only one genuinely engaged on the reforms and the cooperation needed nationally to tackle this and to ensure that, despite the varied nature of the pressures on particular housing markets—and they are different across the country—we have a suite of policies that look to improve housing affordability, increase financial stability, reduce homelessness and, at the same time, boost jobs. This is all work that has been done from opposition. Indeed, if I were the government, I would be looking at some of these, because these are definitely areas where they will need to move, and should move.


Top of the list is to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. This is a big area of expenditure and revenue forgone to the budget and it's growing exponentially. The large part of that concession is going to high-income earners, often to very high-income earners. We've also outlined a plan to limit direct borrowing by self-managed super funds for property. This is another area that returns some savings to the budget. We've talked about facilitating a COAG process to introduce the uniform vacant property tax across all cities. That's in recognition of the fact that not one level of government can solve the pressures that we're seeing on housing, the provision of housing and the affordability of housing. It is something that is going to have to be worked on through COAG. It is something that will have to be dealt with through council-level government, state and territory governments and the Commonwealth government, because every level of government has a lever available to it that, if coordinated, could significantly reduce pressures and be localised to the pressures in individual regions.


A focus for Labor is very much on how to ensure that there's increased investment in affordable housing, and I'm sure my colleague Senator Cameron will talk more about this when he speaks in this debate. This is an issue that Labor, when last in government, worked hard at, with policies which were very successful, like NRAS, the National Rental Affordability Scheme. If you talk to people who are operating those properties now they will tell you that the fact that it was just cut off and stopped sent a big shock to those who were considering investing in Australian affordable housing supply. It seems that even good ideas get ripped up when governments change. But there does need to be some way of ensuring there is increased investment in affordable housing. I see the government have come lately to this, once they'd ripped up NRAS and taken away all the infrastructure that was actually investing in this type of housing. They are trying to rework it and recreate a system that will deliver it. I know that Senator Cameron has been doing a lot of work around a bond aggregator, and this forms part of our policy.


Regarding homelessness support, the fact that the homelessness agreement has been rolled over for one year at a time creates enormous uncertainty. I know the government likes to blame former Labor governments for everything. We see you do it on absolutely every area of policy, but at some point you have to accept that this is the fifth year you've been in government and you are responsible, and the fact is that homelessness services have been going cap in hand every year without any certainty of funding from this government. In fact, not only is there no certainty of funding but funding has also been cut, because the capital infrastructure funding that was to have gone along with that homelessness agreement was cut, which meant that homelessness services couldn't invest in the extra capacity that they needed to deliver extra services. That is something that we have already announced that we would provide more funding for. That situation needs to be sorted, but the approach being taken by this government, essentially to bully the states and territories by putting legislation into the House and presumably passing it without any discussion with the states and territories, who have a key responsibility in funding public housing and ensuring an adequate supply of affordable housing product, is testament to this government's inability to deliver on anything that requires cooperation. We agree that there need to be better results from the National Affordable Housing Agreement. There is a lot of money that goes into that agreement from federal taxpayer dollars, and there should be more accountability for how that money is spent and what it actually delivers. 


The other area we need to focus on—and, again, this is something that housing and finance stakeholders have talked about—is getting the National Housing Supply Council back in place, to have a body that's responsible for monitoring housing supply and for making recommendations to government. Since it was abolished, the data is lacking, the planning is lacking, the recommendations aren't there. Reinstating a minister for housing—there's a novel idea. How about we have a federal housing minister that actually takes responsibility for this area of government? It's clear that whilst it's shared across portfolios—and it might be the Treasurer who is actually in charge of it, but there are other ministers who come and go, depending on what area they're talking about—it means there is no coordination and there is no leadership within the cabinet, with the sole focus on a national housing strategy. That's what is needed. It's needed to look at not only the taxation arrangements around owner-occupier but how you work with states to deliver adequate supply whilst you're looking at the taxation arrangements. It's about looking at what's happening for renters across Australia—the growing population of families and individuals who will be renters for a long period of time, if not for life. It's about having a look at how that works nationally. There's no focus on that and no leadership on it at all. Looking at how we deal with the constant demands that are faced in the homelessness sector is another area that needs a genuine focus from this government.


But for five years they have been denying there actually is a problem or denying that they have to do something about the problem, or blaming the problem on the previous Labor government or blaming it on the states and territories. At some point, you have to accept that it's the responsibility of a Commonwealth government to have a housing strategy—to have a housing policy, perhaps—and, we would argue, to have a housing minister. Without it, we're going to see these continued minor efforts to tinker at the edges to make it look like you can stand up and say you've got a bill that's actually doing something, especially if you name it as 'this is a bill to reduce pressure on housing affordability,' even if it does nothing of the sort—even if it's a tax integrity measure. I doubt that any of these three changes are going to make one bit of difference for someone saving for a housing deposit at this point in time. I don't think they will have to save any less money to get into the housing market. For someone who is trying to move from renting to owning a house, I don't think this will make the slightest bit of difference.


As I said at the beginning, Labor is not going to stand in the way of the bill—the tax integrity measure. We're supportive of it. It will raise a small amount of money across the forward estimates to assist with budget repair. But Labor is very, very cynical that this bill will do anything to reduce pressure on housing affordability.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (20:23):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. I'm pleased to speak on this legislation because housing affordability is a very serious issue. We have a housing affordability crisis in this country and have had for a number of years. As a serious issue, it requires our serious attention. It requires a real, effective, comprehensive and serious policy response from this chamber and this parliament. While the Greens will be supporting this legislation before us tonight, let me say very clearly that this is not an effective, comprehensive, serious policy response to a critical issue for so many Australians, particularly young Australians who may never get to buy their own home, and who certainly feel that's the case at the moment, and particularly for a number of struggling low-income Australians for whom also the thought of owning their own home is still a dream. This is fiddling around the edges—that is the best term I can come up with. Nevertheless, we'll be supporting it. 


This is a very good opportunity for all of us to debate in here tonight what an effective and comprehensive plan would look like. As luck would have it, I happen to have one in front of me, and it's called The Greens housing plan—everyone needs a home. You may have heard me at Senate estimates, every chance I get, asking the Treasury secretary and the departments what they're doing about housing affordability. I'm very pleased to have been part of a party that over the years has led on a national discussion about a comprehensive plan to fix this issue. But all it's going to take is a spine and some political courage to tackle these issues. I do feel that we've come some way in recent years. I remember in 2013 the Greens discussing internally, amongst ourselves, a policy to scrap negative gearing and capital gains tax. Although we implemented that policy, it was considered a politically risky thing to do. Nevertheless we did it. Having had Labor fall across the line and adopt the same policy as us has been very pleasing. I'm glad that Senator Gallagher outlined that Labor are looking at changing at least the perverse incentives in place in this country that don't give us a level playing field, that make it extremely difficult for young Australians and lower income Australians to compete with wealthy investors who own multiple properties and who go to auctions and bid up property prices. We've seen a housing bubble in this country, and I got the Treasury secretary, Mr Fraser, to admit it was a bubble when I brandished an avocado—it was a shameless prop that I took to Senate estimates but it got his attention and the attention of the Treasury and the media about what our Treasury was going to do to tackle this issue. All it took was an avocado. I don't want to give the false impression that we have made progress when we haven't, but we are at least having a debate about a measure to tackle part of the negative gearing incentive, which we should be removing. There's still a long way to go. 


The purpose of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 is to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. We will ensure that travel expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income from residential premises is not deductible and not recognised in the cost base of the property for capital gains tax purposes, and we're planning to deny income tax deductions for the declining value of previously used depreciation assets used in producing assessable income from the use of residential premises as residential accommodation. In addition, the housing tax bill amends the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 to provide that an annual vacancy fee is payable by foreign owners of residential real estate where property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months in a 12-month period, and we'll be imposing a vacancy fee as a tax when this legislation passes this place. 


What evidence have we got before us that we do have a housing affordability crisis in this country? Even though our Treasury haven't put together comprehensive research, even metrics they can measure or benchmarks they can assess this issue against, we know from speaking to young Australians in our electorate that this is a serious issue for them. I'm looking forward to hearing the contributions of our new senator from Queensland, Senator Bartlett, and of our new senator from Western Australia, Senator Steele-John, who is going to be talking about the specific effect on young Australians of housing affordability and the crisis that we have around this country.


But one set of data that we do have is the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, commonly referred to as the HILDA. Someone pressed the emergency button when this was released. This data was only released a few months ago. It is a five-year survey and is the best data that we have on the dynamics around housing affordability in this country. It looks at a lot of the key issues that we should be assessing in our policy responses. The picture that it painted was very troubling indeed, especially for young Australians. It said:


As documented in the 2016 edition of this report, home ownership has been declining in Australia for some years now. This decline has been particularly concentrated among young adults.


In 2014 approximately 25 per cent of men and women aged 18 to 39 were homeowners. That's down from nearly 36 per cent in 2002. So, over 12 years, home ownership amongst that category of Australians has fallen by nearly a third; it is nearly a third less than it was in 2002. There is a lot of data in the 2017 report about why that is the case. It said:


The decline in home ownership primarily occurred between 2002 and 2006 and between 2010 and 2014. This pattern is very much consistent with movements in house prices as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics over the 2002 to 2014 period, with house price growth particularly strong in the mid-2000s and since 2012.


So there is a high correlation between rising house prices and a collapse in home ownership amongst young Australians.


In the HILDA Survey they go further than highlighting a correlation; they draw qualitative assessments about causation. They talk about the recent decline in home ownership amongst those aged between 18 to 39 as being a very important economic and social issue for this country, and go on to explain the dire consequences of the impact to our economy if we don't fix this. They clearly say the broad pattern is that home ownership is greater the higher your income. The most striking comparison is the large decline for the second lowest quartile. In 2002, 37 per cent of people aged between 18 to 39 who were in this quartile were homeowners, but this fell in 2014 to 16 per cent. So it halved over that time period of 12 years—half as many young Australians had home ownership in that quartile. The survey went on to say that it's worse in Sydney and Melbourne—something that we probably could have drawn from our own anecdotal conclusions about housing prices—and it talked about debt and the problem with indebtedness, especially for young Australians in these categories of income. It said:


Home owners aged 18 to 39 are likely to be particularly susceptible to rising debt in an environment of rising house prices, since most are relatively new entrants to the housing market.


And it went on to explore that in some detail.


We have a situation in our country where the number of young Australians owning their own house has fallen by a third in 12 years, because of the boom that we've seen in housing prices. Why do we have perverse incentives in this country that give investors tax deductions? The Australian taxpayer is actually giving deductions to wealthy investors and wealthy Australians to buy their second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh investment property in some cases. We've all have seen the TV programs encouraging flippers and investors to get into the market. But what have we done to actually help those who may never have their dream of owning their own home?


I asked Mr John Fraser, the Treasury secretary, a different question about wages growth only a few weeks ago at Senate estimates. I wasn't expecting the answer that I got from the Treasury secretary. I said to him that there seems to be a global crisis, which is particularly evident here in Australia, and that there are a lot of theories around why workers aren't necessarily pushing for higher wages. There were discussions about technology changes and international labour competing with them in the markets—things that were making workers reticent to push for pay rises. The question I asked the Treasury secretary was:


It makes sense to me that, following the GFC, businesses would be concerned about credit risk and these kind of things. From a workers' point of view, and collectively from a union's point of view, who may represent workers, what is going on in terms of the decoupling of wages growth and high employment numbers?


He said:


I will pass to Dr Grant, who's written some very good stuff on this. From my own point of view, because of the higher levels of debt—


household debt—


people are more concerned about job security than may have been the case in the past.


That's all he said. I thought that was very telling—that the Treasury secretary was saying that that is one of the reasons that we've got a problem with wages growth in this country. The Treasury's introduction to estimates highlighted it as one of the key issues that we need to address. It has underperformed relative to expectations. No-one's quite sure when we're going to have a wages breakout in this country and we're going to see workers' wages rising in line with corporate profits, but here's the Treasury secretary saying household indebtedness is one of the key issues why workers are reticent to push for pay rises. In other words, he's saying that household debt is a key issue for job security and insecurity in this country. That's the conclusion I draw from this, which I think is a pretty reasonable conclusion to draw.


We have ABS data on high vacancy rates. Following the 2016 census, in relation to the number of houses that were apparently empty, it was reported that in Australia 200,000 more homes were sitting empty than a decade ago. New figures show that, despite the country grappling with a housing supply shortage that is pushing the cost of a first home beyond many of our residents, especially young Australians, we have nearly 200,000 houses that don't have people in them. On the night of the 2016 census 1,039,874 dwellings were empty—11.2 per cent of all Australian dwellings. That's extraordinary, when we have a housing supply crisis in this country. I wonder how many of those would be held by investors. My guess—and I didn't actually follow it up—is that a lot would be held by investors.


So what do we do about this occupancy problem? What do we do about the fact that investors are pushing up housing prices and outcompeting young and low-income Australians who want to own their first home? Our comprehensive package is actually fairly simple, if we had the courage. We'd remove negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions and, while we're fixing an economic problem that goes to the heart of inequality in this country, we would raise tens of billions of dollars in revenue to help pay for schools and hospitals. It's a no-brainer. Rather than charging foreign investors a meagre fee, which is what this bill does, why don't we have a comprehensive plan to swap what is, I think, undoubtedly the most inefficient and hated of all taxes, stamp duty, and swap it for a broad-based land tax? It is one of the most efficient and popular taxes. We did this in the ACT. The Greens have suggested this and a way forward on how to do it, whereby the federal government would loan the states to compensate them for a loss of revenue in an off-balance sheet transaction. It would be self-funding by 2030 and it would lead to what we believe would be a comprehensive change in behaviour.


Don't just take it from the Greens. I am proud that we have led this debate for a number of years now, but the Productivity Commission, which are not always an organisation that agree with the Greens, recently put out a paper where they dealt with this same issue. Before I get to what their paper said, I will talk about a question I put them at estimates about their report on land tax and swapping stamp duty for land tax, because they thought that that wasn't a bad thing to consider. I can't read their full response, but at the end of it Mr Harris said:


We see, from time to time, a lot of fiddling at the margin with propositions around how to make first home buyers' lives easier—


'a lot of fiddling at the margin'—



which appear substantially to just drive up the price of property rather than deal directly with the issue.



What we were proposing was substantive. I encourage anyone who wants to read the productivity review to read pages 28 to 31. There is a summary there of a shift from stamp duties to taxes based on land value, and why this would be really good for the country and why this would help tackle many issues, including the housing affordability crisis in this country. That's one comprehensive policy that the Greens have put forward. While I'm at it—Mr Fraser again—Treasury's paper Re:think, on pages 23 and 25, also raises the possibility of a broader based discussion around broad-based land taxes, such as municipal rates, and how they have a low economic cost (and they bundle municipal rates and land tax in the same category in their analysis) and why it actually might be worth exploring this policy outcome.


I'm also pleased to announce that when we released our policy on swapping stamp duty for land tax—may I say, years after we had been campaigning on getting rid of taxpayer funded concessions for the wealthy in this country, like negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions—we got a good rap from many journalists and many economists. I will read out some comments from Peter Martin, who we all know in here, who is a very good economist and very well-respected writer. He says:


… the government will have an opportunity to actually do something that will last; something far more important, and more transformative, than the apparently doomed plan to cut the rate of company tax.


He then says:


It's an idea from the Greens, but that's a plus. It gives it a good chance of getting through the Senate.


There's no doubt about what's the worst tax in Australia, and no doubt about the best bang-for-your-buck tax swap—


which is swapping stamp duty for a broad-based land tax. He goes on to say:



It means that a stamp duty for land tax swap could boost the economy by a massive 82c for each dollar swapped. There's no bigger benefit imaginable from rejigging tax.



We all know—and I especially know, as an economist—that models are useful for helping to make decisions. They don't always dial down to the exact detail, nevertheless we're talking about billions of dollars in productivity gains from this policy alone. Of course, we've had all of that fully costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office.


To summarise, we'll be supporting these measures tonight, but let's not kid ourselves: this is not any attempt at a holistic approach to tackling the crisis in this country, especially for young Australians, of housing affordability. There's a role for government in our lives, a role for correcting market failures. Let's take away the perverse incentives that have been in place now for a number of years that give property investors a chance to use taxpayer funded concessions to buy more properties while young Australians who are struggling on the lowest income brackets are paying their tax. They don't get the same taxpayer concessions. They don't have the same opportunities to go into the market. Let's fix this. Let's get on with holistic reform.

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (20:43):  I rise today to speak on the government measures to improve housing tax integrity, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. The Turnbull coalition government is committed to improving housing affordability for all Australians and ensuring that investors, both from Australia and from abroad, cannot abuse our tax system and claim tax deductions that are inappropriate or invalid. Indeed, this bill goes to the core of the government's budget announcements highlighting our commitment to reduce pressure on housing affordability. The Turnbull coalition government is committed to ensuring that all Australians have an opportunity to own an Australian home. These measures are designed to make that more accessible.


As many senators in this chamber and members in the other place have said before, there is something uniquely Australian about the idea and the ideal of home ownership. This is by no means a 21st century phenomenon. Considering the Australian housing affordability crisis is part of the lexicon of commentators, academics and politicians, I think it is worth bearing in mind the historical context of how we reached this place. I read recently something that suggested that Australians' obsession for home ownership began at the turn of the 20th century when Australian houses not only housed people but also fed them. While other countries would place their farmland just outside town centres, Australians grew their food in their backyards, and so saw the rise of the quarter-acre block, a truly Australian phenomenon. This was very significant during wartime in particular when there was rationing.


Postwar there was a new challenge, and that was the scourge of communism. During the Cold War home ownership was actually seen as a way to quell revolutionary tendencies. People with mortgages, jobs, families and responsibilities tend not to be the type of people who want to storm the Winter Palace. The waves of postwar migrants who came to Australia saw home ownership as an opportunity that wasn't available in Britain and Europe. By the mid-1970s home ownership in Australia had reached a high point of about 70 to 75 per cent. Financial deregulation in the 1980s changed things up again. It saw the levelling of the playing field between owner-occupiers and investors. Of course the system had been geared around those owner-occupiers. With 17 per cent interest rates and the recession we had to have in the early 1990s seared on people's brains, and on their bank balances in particular, and only a nascent compulsory retirement saving system at that stage, the moment property markets started to rise faster than inflation investors came back into the market, attracted by the idea of being landlords. So housing moved beyond becoming sort of a democratic ideal. Its value then was seen in dollars as well as in dreams.


These sorts of seismic shifts we have seen in the Australian housing market have brought us to where we are today. Home ownership is still very much part of the Australian dream, and the Turnbull government recognises this. It recognises that there is a part for the government to play in assisting Australians to realise this dream. I hate to ever admit that Senator Whish-Wilson is right about anything, but this time he in fact is. The measures detailed in these bills at hand are only one small part of the solution, but they are a very important part. They form a very important part of a greater suite of policy measures designed to ease the burden of housing affordability.


These measures also reinforce the Turnbull coalition government's commitment to removing significant abuses of the tax system. There are three significant measures in these bills that, for the benefit of the chamber, I would like to examine in more detail. While no-one on my side of politics would deny the right of businesses and individuals to legitimately claim on their tax return expenses incurred, it is always incumbent upon the government to ensure that the tax code adequately reflects the reasonable and legitimate degree to which these deductions are accessed. Inappropriate use of tax deductions is essentially tantamount to stealing from the public purse. We have said many times in this place that this is a government that realises the imperative of budget repair to this nation's future economic prosperity. We are committed to ensuring that all taxpayers contribute fairly. There are some deductions that are simply inappropriate and are currently being used to game the system. For instance, travel that is essentially a leisure trip shouldn't be considered wholly tax deductible simply on account of a single viewing of a potential investment property. To claim such a deduction is entirely inappropriate. The phrase used so often in this chamber is, 'It doesn't pass the pub test.' As such, the bills before the chamber tonight go straight to the heart of addressing such abuses of tax deductions for residential property investment.


The Australian Taxation Office has identified areas which constitute excessive and incorrect claims for travel expenses, and it now falls to the government to take a comprehensive and considered approach to clarifying and legislating rules around what actually constitutes excessive and incorrect claims, and to spell out to both current and potential residential real estate investors what is and is not an appropriate deduction. By employing a comprehensive approach, as demonstrated in this legislation, the government goes part of the way to meeting our budget night commitments to strengthen the residential investment property domain as well as ensure a fairer tax system for all.


From 1 July 2017, travel deductions for an individual investor with residential investment properties, including travel costs associated with inspecting and maintaining properties, will no longer be deductible. This denial of deductible status will limit the excessive and inappropriate claims and will send a very strong message that residential property investor status does not confer special privileges. The tax system is not there for people to pay for holidays by claiming travel costs as a rental expense. As the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer, the Hon. Michael Sukkar MP, outlined in his speech to the other place on 7 September this year:


The existing law allows deductions for travel relating to income produced or gained from residential investment properties. When a property is used for a mixed purpose, such as a holiday home and rental; or where the travel is for a mixed purpose, such as travelling to maintain an investment property and simultaneously go on a family holiday; travel expenses need to be split between income-producing and private purposes.


The problem here is there has been widespread abuse around excessive travel expense claims relating to residential investment properties.


As a result of these changes, travel costs for individual investors inspecting and maintaining residential investment properties will no longer be deductible.


For the sake of clarity, it's important to note that the government understands that third parties, such as real estate agents, may inevitably from time to time need to provide property management services, and of course these activities will remain deductible expenses. These measures are in no way an assault on the nature of our tax deduction expenses, which allows for a reasonable deduction of expenses incurred in earning an assessable income.


Other inappropriate deductions also fall within the net of this legislation. Depreciation is another area of ambiguity that is potentially open to abuse. The tax system currently creates opportunities for plant and equipment to be depreciated by not one but multiple owners of a property, in excess of their actual value. Both previous and subsequent owners of a property can make deductions on the same pieces of plant and equipment. According to the Australian Taxation Office, abuses of residential investment tax deductions for depreciation are very widespread. The legislation before the chamber tonight specifically targets plant and equipment depreciation deductions for investors in residential properties, limiting depreciation claims only to assets that have not been previously used—that is, assets not previously claimed upon by the previous purchaser. 


Depreciation is a very important accounting concept for residential investors, and, claimed appropriately, it recognises the allocation of cost of an asset over its useful life. But, in residential property investment, we must consider the use of such deductions on such things as dishwashers or air-conditioning systems, claimed not once to their actual value but well in excess of the asset's actual value, by multiple successive owners of the same property. So you can see how the changes proposed to deal with this interpretation of successive ownership and depreciation will actually improve the integrity of the tax system. Importantly, too, however—and I think this is an extremely salient issue—this means that investors who have purchased a newly-built residential investment property are not, in fact, disadvantaged when no other person has claimed a depreciation deduction.


So, while it may seem on face value to be a purely administrative amendment, I cannot overemphasise the importance of these measures. The government knows that part of the equation to ease the burden of housing affordability is to encourage investment and growth in the market for new residential property—not existing but new residential property. The measures specified in this bill ensure that deductions for assets in residential investment properties are consistently and fairly treated.


The other major component of these measures is the so-called ghost tax, where a penalty is raised on foreign owners of properties who leave their properties vacant. I had no idea how common this was, but apparently 11.2 per cent of houses on census night were recorded as unoccupied. That is one in 10 properties. I find that quite extraordinary. That's more than one million dwellings. In a period of apparent housing crisis, such a statistic is, indeed, startling. So, once again, the Turnbull coalition government has listened to public concerns and is taking appropriate action. This year's budget papers announced:


To discourage foreign investors from buying residential properties and leaving these vacant, the Government will now charge foreign owners of residential properties an annual charge if the property is not occupied or available to rent for at least six months in each year.


…      …   …


Where a foreign-owned residential property is left vacant for more than six months in a year, a charge will be levied on the foreign owner equivalent to the foreign investment application fee which was paid at the time of application.


The new charge builds on the Government's existing foreign investment regime which seeks to increase the number of houses available for Australians to live in. The charge provides a financial incentive for the foreign owner to make their property available on the rental market if they do not intend to reside there.


This regime, the ghost tax, will be ably administered by the ATO, the Australian Taxation Office, and is expected not only to increase the number of homes available to Australians who wish to rent but also to generate revenue of over $20 million over the forward estimates. That's a very significant contribution to budget repair. This is clearly a supply-side measure and it will also effectively increase the available housing stock.


The Turnbull coalition government understands Australia's housing affordability issues. It has deep dived into this issue, and this is just one component of a suite of measures. Housing affordability is not something that has occurred overnight. It's occurred through a series of economic phenomenon and political decisions, many of which have been fundamental to the prosperity of our nation over many, many decades, but some have had unintended consequences. Australia's housing affordability issues are not something that can be fixed with easy answers, a glib response or ill-considered or populist policy that will inevitably create a cure that is potentially far worse than the symptoms. Also, it is not a universal phenomenon; it is something that occurs far more in our capital cities and, in particular, in Sydney and in Melbourne. It is not a nationwide issue. No-one has yet articulated what the objective of a successful housing affordability policy looks like. There is a reason for this. The reason for this is that the answer is different for everyone on the continuum—and the continuum is what is so important here. The continuum starts with homelessness, and it moves beyond homelessness to social housing, beyond social housing to first home buyers, on to investors, to downsizers and eventually those moving into aged care. This is the spectrum of housing affordability. A successful housing affordability solution looks different to those in Sydney and Melbourne than to those in Adelaide or Hobart, and it looks very different to those in Shepparton or Moree. While the answer is very different to everyone, it remains an important issue to thousands of Australians.


The government is targeting the whole of the housing spectrum. As the federal Treasurer, the Hon. Scott Morrison, said in his budget address in May:


There are no silver bullets to make housing more affordable. But by adopting a comprehensive approach, by working together, by understanding the spectrum of housing needs, we can make a difference.


There is so much more to this issue than just a knee-jerk reaction on capital gains tax or negative gearing. There is so much more than just dealing with homelessness or just dealing with social housing or just dealing with first home buyers and the demand side of the equation. There are no silver bullets. Most importantly, there is no city-centric solution; it has to be a solution that covers the regional areas as well and covers things like decentralisation of services and infrastructure investment. The measures that have been outlined in the legislation tonight go some way to addressing the issue of housing affordability. It is one part of a much broader suite of policy objectives.


I can only implore my colleagues opposite and on the crossbench—and I was very pleased to hear Senator Whish-Wilson's support for these measures tonight—to support the legislation. Housing accessibility and affordability, as well as a fairer tax system, are truly important matters for this chamber to consider. It is not just one issue—not just first home buyers, not just homelessness, not just social housing, not just downsizing. It's so important to address the whole spectrum of housing affordability issues. I urge my colleagues opposite to consider this legislation seriously and support these changes that have been put to the chamber tonight.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (21:02):  I must say, having to implore those opposite to reach a saving of $16.3 million beggars belief. This legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017, is an absolutely minuscule contribution to dealing with any housing issue. It goes nowhere near dealing with the problems that young families have. It goes nowhere near dealing with the problem of first home buyers having to front up against wealthy investors. It goes nowhere near that. Labor will support this, but it's more out of pity for a government that just does not get it, a government that does not understand the issues facing young people trying to get into a home, never mind those at the bottom of the housing market, who can't access social housing, who can't access public housing, who are left on the street every night in this country—105,000 at the last census. We will see far more when the most recent census announces the homeless figures in this country. Senator Hume tries to paint this as a core aspect of the budget—$16.3 million over the forward estimates. What would that buy? It might buy a couple of houses in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. That's about all. It's not going to help families in this country.


What Labor is proposing is to deal with the fundamental issue of disadvantage: capital gains tax and negative gearing allowing wealthy investors to outbid young couples trying to buy their first home in this country. What we are proposing would deliver $32.1 billion over 10 years and $565 million over the forward estimates. That is $32.1 billion currently going to wealthy investors predominantly to outbid young people trying to get into their first home. That's where Labor sees the core issues. Senator Hume stands here and talks about the coalition being committed to improving housing affordability. 'This is the core of the budget plan on housing affordability,' says Senator Hume—$16.3 million, an absolute pittance. For any senator to get up here and say that this is a really good thing on housing affordability shows just how out of touch the Turnbull government is, not only on housing affordability but on living standards for the working people of this country. To give us a little lecture about the quarter acre block—I don't think there are many quarter acre blocks left around where I live, in the lower Blue Mountains, or out in the western suburbs of Sydney. They're all getting chopped up by investors to make more money for builders, more money for investors and more money for those that fund the coalition's re-election campaigns.


Senator Hume talked about the scourge of communism—what a load of rot we have just heard! If this government were really interested in dealing with housing affordability, it would adopt the policy that we have said the alternate government—I think the next government—will implement: negative gearing and capital gains tax changes. Senator Hume talked about this being an important part of the suite of policy measures. What did the experts on this in the Grattan Institute say about the coalition's housing policies? They said that you would need an electron microscope to see any difference from all of their housing policies combined, including this one on housing affordability. The government just doesn't get it; it just doesn't understand. And the reason that they are so supportive of continuing the rort that is negative gearing and capital gains tax is that most of the money goes to Liberal electorates—to wealthy professionals and high-end income earners. That's where this money goes to. I say, and Labor says, that that $32.1 billion is better off in government funds, being spent on the issues that are important for the working class in this country, instead of continuing the inequality in this country that this type of policy delivers, the policy supported by the coalition.


Senator Hume talked about the imperative of budget repair. Well, the budget has gone out of control under this mob. They have not improved the budget one iota. They just live in fantasy land on the other side of this chamber. The Turnbull government are so out of touch, so arrogant, so unconcerned about the real issues that face Australians. They say that they're sending a strong message that people can't pay for their holidays by this change that they're proposing. We agree. But don't stand here and say that $16.3 million over the forward estimates is some fantastic gain, some fantastic fix for those who can't afford to ever think about buying a home in this country. She spoke about the ATO. One of the first things that the government did was cut the funding for the ATO. They cut the funding for the tax office so that their wealthy mates who put the money into their election coffers can continue to rip the tax system off in this country. What a pathetic rabble of a government this lot are. Senator Hume said that they understand the issues. Well, if this is how they understand the issues—and this is what she calls deep diving in to fix the problem—this is just complete nonsense. And they said they're going to target the whole continuum, meaning that they're going to deal with public housing, social housing, rent, private rentals, helping people to buy a home. This will not make a mark on that.


We think that this is appropriate to do this, but, as I've said, we do it more out of pity for a government that's completely lost its way. We will support these. But, if you really want to know what's going on, go out and talk to young people that are fronting up at auctions in the majority of the major cities around this country and see what they would think of this. My view is they would not think much of it at all. Go out and talk to the young couples that are moving down the housing chain for rentals so that they can try and afford to put a deposit together. As they move down that housing continuum, as Senator Hume talks about, they are pushing the working poor and pushing social security recipients out of housing at the bottom and onto the streets. That's what is happening under the government—a government that in the budget made all these proposals about how they were going to reconstitute the national housing agreement. They renamed it, they have met with the states and they are delivering nothing on reform. We're nearly at the end of the year. From May till now, they have not delivered one agreement with the states on how to deal with housing affordability or the crisis that is there for young people and many older people getting into housing.


What did they do? In the first budget, supported by every one of the Liberals that are over there who were in the chamber at the time of the first Liberal budget, they took $44 million a year out of support for emergency housing for disadvantaged people. They took that money out and made sure that women threatened with domestic violence would get less access to support, comfort and security. That was their first thing. We didn't hear Senator Hume talk about that. We didn't hear her talk about that first Liberal budget. We didn't hear her say anything about the austerity budget that was going to rip away security and support from some of the poorest people in this country but hand over $65 billion in tax cuts to multinational corporations and businesses, including the banks, which are making massive profits and sacking thousands of workers. Did we hear anything about that from Senator Hume? Not a word.


Let me tell you about the other area that many working people in this country depend on to ever be able to access their own home or even to be able to afford rental accommodation—the growth area for accommodation in this country—and that is access to penalty rates. I needed my penalty rates to be able to buy my first house. If I hadn't had access to penalty rates, I would never ever have been able to get on the housing ladder. My penalty rates and my capacity to have a decent job with a decent union that provided decent rights on the job gave me the capacity to access the first house that I ever bought. But this mob want to cut penalty rates. They support cuts to the penalty rates of 700,000 Australian workers, most of whom are the working poor, the real battlers, and those that need their penalty rates to actually put food on the table and a roof over their heads. We never heard anything about that from Senator Hume.


If we're really talking about doing something in relation to housing and homelessness and housing affordability, we are saying, 'Yes, we'll cop this—this miniscule proposition. We'll cop it. We'll support it.' But what we are saying is that you actually need to do something about negative gearing and capital gains tax. You also need to do more than mouth off, which is basically what the government have done about doing anything more substantive. What we are saying is that we will deal with negative gearing, we will deal with capital gains tax and we will also make sure that there is a plan in place to try to increase housing stock in this country. The Productivity Commission recently came out with a report that said that one of the ways that you can deal with in regard to housing is to give people in public housing a choice. We have a situation where 4.4 per cent of housing in this country is public housing and social housing. How can anyone ever get choice if that's the level of public housing and social housing that we have in this country? It's a nonsense.


In Glasgow, where I come from, I was brought up in what were called the prefabs. In Scotland, they were basically big caravans without wheels. That was the transitional housing after the war until a major government investment went into housing. They were stinking hot in the summer—and it does happen in Scotland; now and again you it gets hot—and freezing cold in the winter, which was most of the time. I can tell you that that is not the way forward. We need decent housing. We need environmentally sustainable housing. We need to do what the UK government's doing. It is a conservative government that is looking at how it can increase the stock of public and social housing. It has undertaken what's called the Farmer review. The Farmer review is looking at how they can actually create an industry in the UK with fabricated off-site homes of high quality and high environmental sustainability, create jobs and make it cheaper to build quality homes and erect them around the country. They need to look at these issues rather than trying to come in here and say that $16.3 million over the forward estimates is a great example of the coalition doing something about housing. It is absolute nonsense. 


The coalition refuse to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax. They closed the National Rental Affordability Scheme that provided 38,000 new affordable housing units and was on track to achieve its target of 50,000. They scrapped the first home saver accounts scheme, which was helping people save for their first home, and they're trying to put a copycat proposal in this non-delivery of their budget proposals. They closed their ears and their eyes to the growing evidence of a housing affordability crisis by abolishing the National Housing Supply Council, and the Prime Minister's Council on Homelessness. That is their record on the other side with housing and homelessness—absolutely pathetic: a pathetic government, a pathetic budget, a pathetic response to housing and homelessness. They cut $44 million a year out of capital funding for homelessness services. That meant that young kids, coming out of home care, ended up on the streets, and that is why the NGOs are telling me that one of the key issues that has to be dealt with is young people coming out of home care, especially young women, ending up on the street and being groomed by some of the hard-heads out there. It's absolutely ridiculous. They cut out $44 million a year. Older women who end up with no superannuation, lose their husband and have nowhere to live have nowhere to go on housing and homelessness under this government. 


The speeches those opposite were making a couple of years ago suggested that this was not a federal government responsibility; it was the states' responsibility. But Labor sees putting a roof over people's head as a fundamental responsibility of a federal government. That's why we will have a housing minister, that's why we will have someone there dealing with the states in a proper way. That's why we will reform the housing agreement nationally and why we will be saying to state governments and local governments that inclusionary zoning should be considered. If the business community is going to make squillions out of housing, some of it must go back into housing for the poorer people in this country. This mob do not have a clue. They think that two or three or four per cent inclusionary zoning will fix it. They think a bond aggregator without further government support will fix it. They have rocks in their head, they are an absolute rabble and they just don't get it.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-11-13,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (21:23):  In a way, the legislation before us today converts our income tax into a turnover tax and our capital gains tax into a wealth tax. It is also set to extract about $800 million extra from taxpayers over the next four years. It's the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017. As the name suggests, the government is moving towards a turnover tax and a wealth tax for those individuals who do the reprehensible act of investing in housing. Under standard income tax rules, travel to and from a residential property investment that is owned for the purpose of generating assessable income is deductible. But it won't be once this bill passes. By denying deductions, this bill is effectively making people pay tax on their turnover instead of their income. Turnover taxes are a terrible idea, even worse than income taxation, but the government is going ahead regardless. 


Travel costs to generate assessable income may also form part of the cost base of the residential property investment under standard capital gains tax rules. This ensures that capital gains tax is on the gains, not the entire value of the capital. But once this bill passes it will no longer be possible to include these travel costs in the cost base, so for the affected people capital gains tax will move more towards a tax on the entire capital—in other words, a wealth tax. Wealth taxes are a terrible idea, even worse than capital gains taxation, but the government is going ahead regardless. But wait, there's more. Under standard income tax rules the decline in the value of previously used depreciating assets used to earn assessable income is deductible, but, under this bill, if you are earning assessable income by investing in residential property, you will now be denied these deductions. This is a further step away from income taxation towards a turnover tax. All of this will shift investment away from residential property, and rents will go up as a result. This is pure folly. The government's willingness to remove standard tax features just to attack individual investors in residential property begs the question: what is stopping the government from going completely anti investment and completely anti rental housing and scrapping negative gearing for investment in residential property? 


This bill demonstrates, once again, that the coalition and Labor are cut from the same cloth, and the small policy differences they maintain are mostly for show. In any case, housing affordability is a state issue. Labor or Liberal, the Commonwealth government should not be pretending it has any role to play. 


Before I finish, don't let me forget that this teeming chamber of reasoned debate and insight is also debating a second bill, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. This bill introduces a tax on foreign owners of residential real estate whenever the property is not occupied or genuinely available for rent for six months in a year. It is an example of government micromanagement and intrusion—telling property owners what do with the property they own. Protection of property rights is the most important function of any government. Yet, here we have this government seriously eroding them. Even worse, much of the revenue generated from this new tax will be eaten up by the cost of administering the tax. With nonsense policies like this we're on the road to Venezuela, getting closer with each sitting day of parliament. I condemn these bills to this near empty chamber.

Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (21:27):  You would be surprised if I didn't say it was an absolute delight to rise tonight to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. I'm pleased to be following Senator Leyonhjelm. I'm not sure I share his negative outlook on this legislation; I tend to think these are positive steps in the right direction. I'm not sure I would agree, either, with Senator Cameron's characterisation of Senator Hume's contribution: that this bill was the be-all and end-all of dealing with the issue of housing affordability—which, of course, is a significant issue. No-one in this place can deny it. No-one in this place has to struggle with it either, frankly. All of us are on in excess of $200,000 a year, and I hope the seven people listening across the country don't forget that fact: anyone who has made a contribution to this debate is doing very well out of the taxpayer, thank you very much. So for us to sit here and lecture one another on housing affordability is a bit rich, I suppose. But those of us who do get out into the community and listen to those we seek to represent would, hopefully, have an understanding of the problems we face when it comes to ensuring that we have a supply of affordable housing that is accessible to those in the community who need it, in all parts of the country. 


It's not a simple issue. It's not one that can be dealt with by one pull of a policy lever and then hopefully it's all okay tomorrow. I don't think it is as simple as has been made out by previous contributions in this debate, and it's something that we need to take very seriously. In reflecting on what I was going to say tonight in my contribution, I had a bit of a look at the previous considerations of Senate committees on the particular issue of housing affordability. In the last parliament, the Economics References Committee considered this very issue. It published a report entitled Out of reach? The Australian housing affordability challenge, which aptly set out some of the challenges that are faced. That report states:


… no single measure can capture the diversity of Australian experiences of housing affordability … most indicators point toward a deterioration of affordability in recent decades. This decline is keenly felt by a broad array of people, including people wanting to become homeowners, renters and people living in community and public housing. Homelessness, meanwhile, is a tremendously complex problem, and it would be reductive to suggest it is simply a corollary of housing affordability and nothing more besides. Nonetheless … poor housing affordability creates pressures throughout the housing system …


I think that's an important point for us to take on board as we consider what is, as this report states, a very complex issue. To suggest it is simple, to suggest that we can just fix it by tweaking one set of tax arrangements or creating an incentive for affordable housing to the exclusion of any other policy measure, is naive, to be frank. So I think the report in that sense is a very helpful one to consider before moving to exactly what's being talked about in the bills we are considering today.


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017, the principal bill that we are considering tonight, at its heart, is about housing affordability. In the Australian way of life, having access to housing and housing that you can afford is fundamental to wellbeing. To be able to provide shelter for your family and for yourself, to ensure good health, and to be warm in winter and cool in summer and the like is so incredibly important. Having access to those things, either by way of home ownership or being a renter, is so incredibly important.


Home ownership, or having access to reasonable standards of accommodation at an affordable level, is a driver of social and economic opportunities in this country. We all know it. I heard Senator Cameron in his contribution —and I'm sure I'll refer to this a little later on—refer to getting onto the housing ladder when he was talking about the need for penalty rates. When he bought his first home, he needed that money to afford that property. That's the reality of home ownership in this country and has been for time immemorial. People buy homes, and—hopefully, for anyone who does so—they increase in value. That is what we want so that that increased value can be translated into assets that we can realise the value of and we can invest in something else—a smaller home, a holiday, things like that. That's what we do with home ownership. We save for the future to pay for our kids' education, to pay for the things we need in life. It is about those social and economic opportunities, which are really a part of the Australian dream that we often talk about in this place.


The need to deal with the rising cost of housing across the country has long been talked about. My home state of Tasmania, particularly the southern half, with the city of Hobart, is no exemption. If I look at some of the recent examples of housing prices in the city of Hobart, various real estate agents, including representatives of the Real Estate Institute of Tasmania, have talked about the fact that, although a decade or even five years ago, houses rarely reached the $1 million or $1.5 million mark, it's now quite common to see houses selling for that price or well in excess of it. In recent years, one house in our little city of Hobart, which has a population not far in excess of 250,000, sold for $6½ million and another one for $8 million. They are record-breaking prices and they are certainly outliers, but it indicates that, when the market is hot, the prices go up. That has a flow-on to the other parts of the market which are more within the reach of most of the people that occupy this chamber.


In her contribution a little earlier, Senator Hume did talk about the government's plan to try and tackle this matter, and the bills that we have before us today are just part of that. It's not the whole thing, as Senator Cameron tried to characterise it as; it is just part of it. We also need to look at increasing the supply of affordable housing, which is something that many states and territories, if not all of them, are doing ardently. State and territory governments, who have responsibility for social housing and for many of the policies that relate to the supply of housing in each of their jurisdictions, are looking after this policy as well.


I know it was acknowledged by previous speakers in this debate that it is a matter that comes up at ministers meetings or COAG meetings. We can't ignore that. To assume in this debate that housing affordability is purely the domain of the federal government is naive and just plain wrong. It is a priority for this government. I'm sure it is also a priority for all Australians—particularly for those of us who have children who I hope will be growing up in this country—to be able to access affordable housing, to make sure that their kids can live, as I referred to before, the Australian dream, and to have a home with a yard and whatever else they need to raise their kids. That's what we need to be able to provide for.


The bill itself, as has been referred to by previous contributors in this debate, has a couple of measures that will go some way to dealing with this issue. First of all it will limit foreign ownership in new developments—in other words, there will effectively be a cap. We will see foreign ownership in new developments being limited through a 50 per cent cap on the number of properties that can be sold to foreign investors through developer pre-approvals and as a condition on New Dwelling Exemption Certificates for new property developments where an application was made after budget night. We are talking about reserving the supply of new houses, with at least half the level being made available to local buyers, preventing them going, as seems to be the popular belief for the most part, to foreign investors.


There is also, as I heard Senator Hume talking about earlier on, the penalty for properties being left vacant. I think that is an important step in addressing the matter relating to the cost of rentals in this country. An annual charge of at least $5,000 on foreign owners of residential real estate will be applied where Australian residential property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months of the year. The measure is designed to free up more dwellings for Australian renters, and this measure builds on the government's existing foreign investment regime by seeking to increase the number of houses available for Australians to live in. These are just two parts of the bill, with the other one being the tightening of tax rules to reduce the use of the current taxation arrangements to the advantage of some property owners. This will ensure that we actually receive revenue on these investments, which can then go towards investment in essential services across this country. 


I will just briefly go back to the Tasmanian experience and look at some recent reports from the last 12 months—the year of 2017—about what's been going on in Tasmania. I think we'd all have to agree that Tasmania is probably one of the more affordable states when it comes to housing, notwithstanding the two examples I gave earlier on. Saul Eslake, who is a respected economist that some of you may be familiar with, has commentated on this issue. He said on 24 June 2017 that 'Tasmania is now getting net migration from the mainland after a period of out-migration' and pointed to the issue of housing affordability as one of the things that is attracting people to Tasmania. Obviously people will make decisions about where they live and the occupations they pursue based on how affordable buying a house is. 


Real estate agents in Tasmania are increasingly noticing that young families are moving back, drawn by affordable housing. 'It's happening more over the last 12 months', said Ant Manton from Ray White real estate in Tasmania. He pointed to the markets in Melbourne and Sydney as being factors that are driving people out of these mainland major cities to places like Tasmania, which I think is a great thing. That, in turn, has a flow-on effect for places like the state of Tasmania. Let's reflect on home prices in Tasmania. In Hobart, for instance, home prices jumped 5.8 per cent to the year ending 31 May of this year to a median of $350,000, while Sydney and Melbourne each added more than 11 per cent, with medians of $872,300 and $665,000 respectively, as reported by CoreLogic. These are significant differences in the affordability of housing in this country.


It takes me to another point I want to make in relation to this debate—that is, reflecting on the difference in housing prices between major metro cities on the mainland and the prices we have in Tasmania. There has been a lot of discussion about trying to attract people to these regional cities and regional communities. Part of that, of course, is the decentralisation process being undertaken. It was being led by the former senator and former minister—a very good minister too—Fiona Nash. It is about getting Public Service agencies out of Canberra and into our regional communities. I would think that, for many of the people who work in these agencies, it would be a great thing to be able to unlock the value of your home here in Canberra, Sydney or Melbourne and head out to somewhere beautiful like Hobart and invest probably one-fifth of the price and snare yourself a five-bedroom mansion down on the waterfront somewhere.


Reflecting further on some of the experiences in Tasmania more recently: on 3 November it was reported that Tasmania is breaking records with regard to the housing market. It passed $4 billion for one year of sales in the state. The interesting thing about this article, which appeared on news.com.au and also in The Mercury newspaper in Hobart, was that first home buyers purchased 220 properties, at the median price of $275,000, and they remain steady at 13 per cent of the market. There were only 13 sales to foreign investors, blowing out of the water this notion that all of our properties are being snapped up by foreign investors. The majority of homes sold to interstate buyers were to interstate buyers moving to Tasmania to live, not to investors who wanted to buy a home to rent out and to prop up their bank balances, as those opposite would claim. Vacancy rates in the rental market continue to tighten, with Hobart now at historical lows below two per cent. Of course, that does lead to the problem we've talked about previously—the affordability of rental properties in Tasmania.


I do just want to briefly touch on what the Tasmanian government is doing with regard to housing affordability. Every state and territory does have its own housing affordability strategy and programs that address this issue. In Tasmania, their strategy is a significant one. It is a 10-year strategy which will improve access in all sectors of the housing market. It runs from 2015—so it has been going for two years—until 2025. It's supported by an action plan which provides $73½ million over a number of years. It will see 1,600 vulnerable Tasmanian households housed. It is supported by the construction of 900 new homes. It is a significant number for a small state the size of Tasmania. Of course, that policy, that action plan and that strategy have all been developed after exhaustive consultation with stakeholders, social services, peak groups and those who actually need the services as well. I commend the Tasmanian government for the various initiatives they have, including the home-share initiative, which will develop 250 homes for people on low to moderate incomes. The Streets Ahead incentive program is a deposit incentive program, offering $12,000 to people looking to purchase Tasmanian dwellings. There are supply initiatives where we are seeing nearly 30 homes developed by private developers. And there are community housing stock leverage programs which will see 172 new homes in addition to 31 upgraded homes. That's just the tip of the iceberg in the little old state of Tasmania.


I will reflect briefly on the contributions made by a couple of others in this debate. I was listening to what both Senator Gallagher and Senator Cameron had to say about the issue of housing affordability. It seems to be that it's all care and no responsibility in opposition. I heard Senator Gallagher say that this government has had five years to fix it and, 'You've just got to do it.' The last time I checked, those in opposition have a responsibility to provide serious policies that would help to address issues that this nation faces. I didn't hear one utterance from either Senator Gallagher or Senator Cameron on how they would deal with these issues. All they want to do is stand on the sidelines and throw stones. They don't actually want to be constructive. They don't want to talk about ways and measures that might tangibly and properly improve the situation we face as a country when it comes to housing affordability. They, we can't forget, are the aspiring government. They are the people who want to be on this side of the chamber, and they owe it to the Australian people to provide and explain their policies and be subject to the scrutiny that the government is.


One thing that we did hear was mention of a minister for housing. I'm not a firm believer in creating new bureaucracies or new ministries just to solve a problem—in fact, quite the opposite. The last time I checked, if you went out onto the main street of any of the towns I represent, the creation of a new political position or a new ministry would not inspire anyone, and it certainly won't fix the problems that our country faces. The centrepiece for the Labor policy seems to be the creation of this new minister for housing. I look forward to seeing what this new minister for housing would ever do if, one day, this mob ever got into government.


I go back to my starting point: the position of privilege that most of the people in this chamber occupy. All of us are on a good income and many of us in this place own multiple properties. So it is interesting to listen to Senator Cameron talk about the working-class individuals, the people who really struggle. I don't know how many homes Senator Cameron owns. I know he has one in New South Wales and a very, very nice one in Hobart.




Senator Pratt:
  I think that was two.




Senator DUNIAM:
  Two; he may have more. In fact, on his register of interests entry I think there are more, but I'm not going to go into that now.




Senator Dastyari:
  Oh!




Senator DUNIAM:
  And I don't know how many you have, Senator Dastyari. But the point is this: it's great to hear people talk about how important it is to solve this issue and how awful those who haven't solved it are, but, when you consider the position of privilege we all live in, it's a bit rich to just throw stones the way Senator Cameron has been. As I said, I didn't hear anything by way of an alternative, other than the creation of a new portfolio for the ministry of housing, which I think is ridiculous, although I did have a look at Labor's Positive plan to help housing affordability and I did see this:


… Labor has been working and acting. In March 2015 Labor held a Housing Affordability Roundtable.


I love a good roundtable. It's good to talk. It's good to get through the issues. But it does matter where the rubber hits the road and where action actually comes to the fore and, again, I'm not seeing any of that.


I don't think there's much more to say other than I looked at the Greens' policy, The Greens housing plan: everyone needs a home, which says it is going to generate $51 billion of economic returns to the nation. It is two pages long and there is not much in it. This is an important issue and it is disappointing to hear the lack of substance from those on the other side of the chamber. I commend the bills to the House.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (20:04):  Thank you, Mr President, and can I also extend my congratulations on your new appointment today. Labor will not oppose the passage through the parliament of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. The Parliamentary Library does a very helpful report on all bills that come before this chamber. The report on these bills states that their purpose is to do three things: firstly, to ensure that travel expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income from residential premises is not deductible and not recognised in the cost base of the property for capital gains tax purposes; secondly, to deny income tax deductions for the declining value of 'previously used' depreciating assets used in producing assessable income from the use of residential premises as residential accommodation; and, thirdly, to amend the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 to provide that an annual vacancy fee is payable by foreign owners of residential real estate where property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months in a 12-month period.


The government indicated at budget time that these measures were their crackdown on negative gearing in relation to the two aspects I have already mentioned and that the measures were about reducing pressure on housing affordability. Whilst I've said we won't oppose these bills through the parliament, we certainly don't believe that these measures, in isolation of a broader housing response, will reduce the pressure on housing affordability that is needed, particularly in certain markets. It's typical of the Orwellian way the government likes to operate that these measures are being put together in a bill and put forward as initiatives to reduce pressure on housing affordability. I don't think anyone should operate under the illusion that these measures will do that. This government, which has now been in power for five years, has failed to have a minister responsible for housing, has failed to have a housing strategy, has failed to renegotiate a national housing agreement and has failed in any way to respond to the genuine pressures that are affecting particularly those on lower incomes, those who are renting and those who are struggling to enter the housing market to deal with some of the distortions that we have seen in recent years.


In contrast, from opposition, Labor has put forward—reconfirmed by Senator Cameron as the shadow minister responsible and the leader this year—a comprehensive plan to deal with pressure on housing affordability, including genuine reform of negative gearing. We are not dealing at the fringes but actually reforming negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount as a central focus of our policy. I think it's genuinely understood, even by the government, that any housing affordability package that does not deal with these concessions in a serious way—where the majority of those benefits, those tax concessions, that revenue forgone, are going to high-income earners—is a sham. We know that 50 per cent of the benefit of negative gearing goes to the top 10 per cent of income earners and that 70 per cent of the benefit of capital gains tax concessions goes to the top 10 per cent of income earners. This is where action needs to be taken, and it's not just the Labor Party saying this; there is strong support across groups with expertise in housing and with expertise in tax. Prominent senior economists in this country understand this. The government's own financial systems inquiry drew attention to this. It is not just the Labor Party saying this.


These bills seek to introduce three measures that the government announced in the budget, which I alluded to: disallowing the deduction of travel expenses for residential rental property, limiting plant and equipment deductions to outlays actually incurred by investors, and introducing an annual charge on foreign owners of underutilised residential property. The reform to these arrangements is the reform that you do when you're not really serious about the reform that needs to be done. The government, in this bill, proposes to disallow deductions for travel expenses related to inspecting, maintaining or collecting rent for a residential property. The amendments also do not affect deductions for travel expenditure incurred in carrying on a business of providing property management services. The government estimates this will raise $540 million over the forward estimates.


We're all for ensuring that tax concessions are targeted. I don't think anyone would suggest that Labor haven't been very vocal in this debate—in fact, leading the debate, particularly in relation to negative gearing. But this is not a housing affordability measure. In fact, Treasury in answer to a question on notice about this even said so. It said this was a tax integrity measure, which is an important thing on its own, but this is an acknowledgement from those who have been involved in drafting this bill and advising government that this measure is not something that will reduce pressure on housing affordability.


The second measure involves limiting deductions for assets in residential premises, denying deductions for the decline in the value of previously used depreciating assets used in gaining or producing assessable income from the use of residential premises for the purposes of residential accommodation. The government estimates that this will raise $260 million over the forward estimates. Again, as I said on the previous measure, we are absolutely here for the debate and for supporting ensuring that tax concessions are targeted. That's why we've been arguing for genuine reform on negative gearing. But this on its own, limiting deductions, is not a housing affordability measure. Again, Treasury also accepted in an answer to a question on notice that this is an integrity measure.


The government estimates that the third measure, the charge on foreign owners of residential property where the property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months per year, will generate $16.3 million in revenue over the forward estimates. Again, we don't have any objection to this measure. After all, as part of our plan for housing affordability in the announcements which were made earlier this year, we announced we could facilitate a COAG process to introduce a uniform vacant property tax across all major cities. It's notable that Treasury admitted in an answer to a question on notice that the states and territories were not consulted in relation to this measure. This appears to be the style and practice of this government. We've seen it play out recently, with the government introducing legislation around the national housing agreement that they've put before the parliament without seeking to legislate an agreement that was previously negotiated through COAG or through housing ministers for agreement by COAG. States and territories were not consulted on that either. That would raise the issue of whether the Commonwealth is actually serious about reaching national agreements on areas of such importance, particularly when it relates to some of our community's most vulnerable citizens in relation to homelessness and in relation to the provision of public housing, or social housing, when this is the approach that it's taken. Treasury also confirmed in that answer to the question on notice that there wasn't a direct assumption about how many foreign owners of residential properties would decide to make their properties available to rent. So that is something that is clearly unknown, and perhaps we'll need to wait for this legislation to be amended and to watch it in operation.


I think everyone in this chamber knows that Australia is in the midst of a housing affordability and homelessness crisis. House prices in many major cities have skyrocketed, home ownership rates have plummeted and many vulnerable Australians have limited or no access to housing. The housing crisis is only getting worse. Since the government came to office in September 2013, capital city house prices have soared by 30 per cent, with increases of nearly 50 per cent in Sydney and over 30 per cent in Melbourne. Home ownership is at a 60-year low, and home ownership rates for 25- to 34-year-olds have collapsed from around 60 per cent to less than 40 per cent in the last 30 years. Rental stress is also on the rise, with the proportion of low-income households experiencing rental stress now at more than 40 per cent.


That great Australian dream of home ownership has really turned into a nightmare for many, and it has done so on this government's watch. In stark contrast to the approach that the government has taken, the Labor Party, from opposition, has been the only one genuinely engaged on the reforms and the cooperation needed nationally to tackle this and to ensure that, despite the varied nature of the pressures on particular housing markets—and they are different across the country—we have a suite of policies that look to improve housing affordability, increase financial stability, reduce homelessness and, at the same time, boost jobs. This is all work that has been done from opposition. Indeed, if I were the government, I would be looking at some of these, because these are definitely areas where they will need to move, and should move.


Top of the list is to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. This is a big area of expenditure and revenue forgone to the budget and it's growing exponentially. The large part of that concession is going to high-income earners, often to very high-income earners. We've also outlined a plan to limit direct borrowing by self-managed super funds for property. This is another area that returns some savings to the budget. We've talked about facilitating a COAG process to introduce the uniform vacant property tax across all cities. That's in recognition of the fact that not one level of government can solve the pressures that we're seeing on housing, the provision of housing and the affordability of housing. It is something that is going to have to be worked on through COAG. It is something that will have to be dealt with through council-level government, state and territory governments and the Commonwealth government, because every level of government has a lever available to it that, if coordinated, could significantly reduce pressures and be localised to the pressures in individual regions.


A focus for Labor is very much on how to ensure that there's increased investment in affordable housing, and I'm sure my colleague Senator Cameron will talk more about this when he speaks in this debate. This is an issue that Labor, when last in government, worked hard at, with policies which were very successful, like NRAS, the National Rental Affordability Scheme. If you talk to people who are operating those properties now they will tell you that the fact that it was just cut off and stopped sent a big shock to those who were considering investing in Australian affordable housing supply. It seems that even good ideas get ripped up when governments change. But there does need to be some way of ensuring there is increased investment in affordable housing. I see the government have come lately to this, once they'd ripped up NRAS and taken away all the infrastructure that was actually investing in this type of housing. They are trying to rework it and recreate a system that will deliver it. I know that Senator Cameron has been doing a lot of work around a bond aggregator, and this forms part of our policy.


Regarding homelessness support, the fact that the homelessness agreement has been rolled over for one year at a time creates enormous uncertainty. I know the government likes to blame former Labor governments for everything. We see you do it on absolutely every area of policy, but at some point you have to accept that this is the fifth year you've been in government and you are responsible, and the fact is that homelessness services have been going cap in hand every year without any certainty of funding from this government. In fact, not only is there no certainty of funding but funding has also been cut, because the capital infrastructure funding that was to have gone along with that homelessness agreement was cut, which meant that homelessness services couldn't invest in the extra capacity that they needed to deliver extra services. That is something that we have already announced that we would provide more funding for. That situation needs to be sorted, but the approach being taken by this government, essentially to bully the states and territories by putting legislation into the House and presumably passing it without any discussion with the states and territories, who have a key responsibility in funding public housing and ensuring an adequate supply of affordable housing product, is testament to this government's inability to deliver on anything that requires cooperation. We agree that there need to be better results from the National Affordable Housing Agreement. There is a lot of money that goes into that agreement from federal taxpayer dollars, and there should be more accountability for how that money is spent and what it actually delivers. 


The other area we need to focus on—and, again, this is something that housing and finance stakeholders have talked about—is getting the National Housing Supply Council back in place, to have a body that's responsible for monitoring housing supply and for making recommendations to government. Since it was abolished, the data is lacking, the planning is lacking, the recommendations aren't there. Reinstating a minister for housing—there's a novel idea. How about we have a federal housing minister that actually takes responsibility for this area of government? It's clear that whilst it's shared across portfolios—and it might be the Treasurer who is actually in charge of it, but there are other ministers who come and go, depending on what area they're talking about—it means there is no coordination and there is no leadership within the cabinet, with the sole focus on a national housing strategy. That's what is needed. It's needed to look at not only the taxation arrangements around owner-occupier but how you work with states to deliver adequate supply whilst you're looking at the taxation arrangements. It's about looking at what's happening for renters across Australia—the growing population of families and individuals who will be renters for a long period of time, if not for life. It's about having a look at how that works nationally. There's no focus on that and no leadership on it at all. Looking at how we deal with the constant demands that are faced in the homelessness sector is another area that needs a genuine focus from this government.


But for five years they have been denying there actually is a problem or denying that they have to do something about the problem, or blaming the problem on the previous Labor government or blaming it on the states and territories. At some point, you have to accept that it's the responsibility of a Commonwealth government to have a housing strategy—to have a housing policy, perhaps—and, we would argue, to have a housing minister. Without it, we're going to see these continued minor efforts to tinker at the edges to make it look like you can stand up and say you've got a bill that's actually doing something, especially if you name it as 'this is a bill to reduce pressure on housing affordability,' even if it does nothing of the sort—even if it's a tax integrity measure. I doubt that any of these three changes are going to make one bit of difference for someone saving for a housing deposit at this point in time. I don't think they will have to save any less money to get into the housing market. For someone who is trying to move from renting to owning a house, I don't think this will make the slightest bit of difference.


As I said at the beginning, Labor is not going to stand in the way of the bill—the tax integrity measure. We're supportive of it. It will raise a small amount of money across the forward estimates to assist with budget repair. But Labor is very, very cynical that this bill will do anything to reduce pressure on housing affordability.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-11-13,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (20:23):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. I'm pleased to speak on this legislation because housing affordability is a very serious issue. We have a housing affordability crisis in this country and have had for a number of years. As a serious issue, it requires our serious attention. It requires a real, effective, comprehensive and serious policy response from this chamber and this parliament. While the Greens will be supporting this legislation before us tonight, let me say very clearly that this is not an effective, comprehensive, serious policy response to a critical issue for so many Australians, particularly young Australians who may never get to buy their own home, and who certainly feel that's the case at the moment, and particularly for a number of struggling low-income Australians for whom also the thought of owning their own home is still a dream. This is fiddling around the edges—that is the best term I can come up with. Nevertheless, we'll be supporting it. 


This is a very good opportunity for all of us to debate in here tonight what an effective and comprehensive plan would look like. As luck would have it, I happen to have one in front of me, and it's called The Greens housing plan—everyone needs a home. You may have heard me at Senate estimates, every chance I get, asking the Treasury secretary and the departments what they're doing about housing affordability. I'm very pleased to have been part of a party that over the years has led on a national discussion about a comprehensive plan to fix this issue. But all it's going to take is a spine and some political courage to tackle these issues. I do feel that we've come some way in recent years. I remember in 2013 the Greens discussing internally, amongst ourselves, a policy to scrap negative gearing and capital gains tax. Although we implemented that policy, it was considered a politically risky thing to do. Nevertheless we did it. Having had Labor fall across the line and adopt the same policy as us has been very pleasing. I'm glad that Senator Gallagher outlined that Labor are looking at changing at least the perverse incentives in place in this country that don't give us a level playing field, that make it extremely difficult for young Australians and lower income Australians to compete with wealthy investors who own multiple properties and who go to auctions and bid up property prices. We've seen a housing bubble in this country, and I got the Treasury secretary, Mr Fraser, to admit it was a bubble when I brandished an avocado—it was a shameless prop that I took to Senate estimates but it got his attention and the attention of the Treasury and the media about what our Treasury was going to do to tackle this issue. All it took was an avocado. I don't want to give the false impression that we have made progress when we haven't, but we are at least having a debate about a measure to tackle part of the negative gearing incentive, which we should be removing. There's still a long way to go. 


The purpose of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 is to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. We will ensure that travel expenditure incurred in gaining or producing assessable income from residential premises is not deductible and not recognised in the cost base of the property for capital gains tax purposes, and we're planning to deny income tax deductions for the declining value of previously used depreciation assets used in producing assessable income from the use of residential premises as residential accommodation. In addition, the housing tax bill amends the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 to provide that an annual vacancy fee is payable by foreign owners of residential real estate where property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months in a 12-month period, and we'll be imposing a vacancy fee as a tax when this legislation passes this place. 


What evidence have we got before us that we do have a housing affordability crisis in this country? Even though our Treasury haven't put together comprehensive research, even metrics they can measure or benchmarks they can assess this issue against, we know from speaking to young Australians in our electorate that this is a serious issue for them. I'm looking forward to hearing the contributions of our new senator from Queensland, Senator Bartlett, and of our new senator from Western Australia, Senator Steele-John, who is going to be talking about the specific effect on young Australians of housing affordability and the crisis that we have around this country.


But one set of data that we do have is the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, commonly referred to as the HILDA. Someone pressed the emergency button when this was released. This data was only released a few months ago. It is a five-year survey and is the best data that we have on the dynamics around housing affordability in this country. It looks at a lot of the key issues that we should be assessing in our policy responses. The picture that it painted was very troubling indeed, especially for young Australians. It said:


As documented in the 2016 edition of this report, home ownership has been declining in Australia for some years now. This decline has been particularly concentrated among young adults.


In 2014 approximately 25 per cent of men and women aged 18 to 39 were homeowners. That's down from nearly 36 per cent in 2002. So, over 12 years, home ownership amongst that category of Australians has fallen by nearly a third; it is nearly a third less than it was in 2002. There is a lot of data in the 2017 report about why that is the case. It said:


The decline in home ownership primarily occurred between 2002 and 2006 and between 2010 and 2014. This pattern is very much consistent with movements in house prices as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics over the 2002 to 2014 period, with house price growth particularly strong in the mid-2000s and since 2012.


So there is a high correlation between rising house prices and a collapse in home ownership amongst young Australians.


In the HILDA Survey they go further than highlighting a correlation; they draw qualitative assessments about causation. They talk about the recent decline in home ownership amongst those aged between 18 to 39 as being a very important economic and social issue for this country, and go on to explain the dire consequences of the impact to our economy if we don't fix this. They clearly say the broad pattern is that home ownership is greater the higher your income. The most striking comparison is the large decline for the second lowest quartile. In 2002, 37 per cent of people aged between 18 to 39 who were in this quartile were homeowners, but this fell in 2014 to 16 per cent. So it halved over that time period of 12 years—half as many young Australians had home ownership in that quartile. The survey went on to say that it's worse in Sydney and Melbourne—something that we probably could have drawn from our own anecdotal conclusions about housing prices—and it talked about debt and the problem with indebtedness, especially for young Australians in these categories of income. It said:


Home owners aged 18 to 39 are likely to be particularly susceptible to rising debt in an environment of rising house prices, since most are relatively new entrants to the housing market.


And it went on to explore that in some detail.


We have a situation in our country where the number of young Australians owning their own house has fallen by a third in 12 years, because of the boom that we've seen in housing prices. Why do we have perverse incentives in this country that give investors tax deductions? The Australian taxpayer is actually giving deductions to wealthy investors and wealthy Australians to buy their second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh investment property in some cases. We've all have seen the TV programs encouraging flippers and investors to get into the market. But what have we done to actually help those who may never have their dream of owning their own home?


I asked Mr John Fraser, the Treasury secretary, a different question about wages growth only a few weeks ago at Senate estimates. I wasn't expecting the answer that I got from the Treasury secretary. I said to him that there seems to be a global crisis, which is particularly evident here in Australia, and that there are a lot of theories around why workers aren't necessarily pushing for higher wages. There were discussions about technology changes and international labour competing with them in the markets—things that were making workers reticent to push for pay rises. The question I asked the Treasury secretary was:


It makes sense to me that, following the GFC, businesses would be concerned about credit risk and these kind of things. From a workers' point of view, and collectively from a union's point of view, who may represent workers, what is going on in terms of the decoupling of wages growth and high employment numbers?


He said:


I will pass to Dr Grant, who's written some very good stuff on this. From my own point of view, because of the higher levels of debt—


household debt—


people are more concerned about job security than may have been the case in the past.


That's all he said. I thought that was very telling—that the Treasury secretary was saying that that is one of the reasons that we've got a problem with wages growth in this country. The Treasury's introduction to estimates highlighted it as one of the key issues that we need to address. It has underperformed relative to expectations. No-one's quite sure when we're going to have a wages breakout in this country and we're going to see workers' wages rising in line with corporate profits, but here's the Treasury secretary saying household indebtedness is one of the key issues why workers are reticent to push for pay rises. In other words, he's saying that household debt is a key issue for job security and insecurity in this country. That's the conclusion I draw from this, which I think is a pretty reasonable conclusion to draw.


We have ABS data on high vacancy rates. Following the 2016 census, in relation to the number of houses that were apparently empty, it was reported that in Australia 200,000 more homes were sitting empty than a decade ago. New figures show that, despite the country grappling with a housing supply shortage that is pushing the cost of a first home beyond many of our residents, especially young Australians, we have nearly 200,000 houses that don't have people in them. On the night of the 2016 census 1,039,874 dwellings were empty—11.2 per cent of all Australian dwellings. That's extraordinary, when we have a housing supply crisis in this country. I wonder how many of those would be held by investors. My guess—and I didn't actually follow it up—is that a lot would be held by investors.


So what do we do about this occupancy problem? What do we do about the fact that investors are pushing up housing prices and outcompeting young and low-income Australians who want to own their first home? Our comprehensive package is actually fairly simple, if we had the courage. We'd remove negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions and, while we're fixing an economic problem that goes to the heart of inequality in this country, we would raise tens of billions of dollars in revenue to help pay for schools and hospitals. It's a no-brainer. Rather than charging foreign investors a meagre fee, which is what this bill does, why don't we have a comprehensive plan to swap what is, I think, undoubtedly the most inefficient and hated of all taxes, stamp duty, and swap it for a broad-based land tax? It is one of the most efficient and popular taxes. We did this in the ACT. The Greens have suggested this and a way forward on how to do it, whereby the federal government would loan the states to compensate them for a loss of revenue in an off-balance sheet transaction. It would be self-funding by 2030 and it would lead to what we believe would be a comprehensive change in behaviour.


Don't just take it from the Greens. I am proud that we have led this debate for a number of years now, but the Productivity Commission, which are not always an organisation that agree with the Greens, recently put out a paper where they dealt with this same issue. Before I get to what their paper said, I will talk about a question I put them at estimates about their report on land tax and swapping stamp duty for land tax, because they thought that that wasn't a bad thing to consider. I can't read their full response, but at the end of it Mr Harris said:


We see, from time to time, a lot of fiddling at the margin with propositions around how to make first home buyers' lives easier—


'a lot of fiddling at the margin'—



which appear substantially to just drive up the price of property rather than deal directly with the issue.



What we were proposing was substantive. I encourage anyone who wants to read the productivity review to read pages 28 to 31. There is a summary there of a shift from stamp duties to taxes based on land value, and why this would be really good for the country and why this would help tackle many issues, including the housing affordability crisis in this country. That's one comprehensive policy that the Greens have put forward. While I'm at it—Mr Fraser again—Treasury's paper Re:think, on pages 23 and 25, also raises the possibility of a broader based discussion around broad-based land taxes, such as municipal rates, and how they have a low economic cost (and they bundle municipal rates and land tax in the same category in their analysis) and why it actually might be worth exploring this policy outcome.


I'm also pleased to announce that when we released our policy on swapping stamp duty for land tax—may I say, years after we had been campaigning on getting rid of taxpayer funded concessions for the wealthy in this country, like negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions—we got a good rap from many journalists and many economists. I will read out some comments from Peter Martin, who we all know in here, who is a very good economist and very well-respected writer. He says:


… the government will have an opportunity to actually do something that will last; something far more important, and more transformative, than the apparently doomed plan to cut the rate of company tax.


He then says:


It's an idea from the Greens, but that's a plus. It gives it a good chance of getting through the Senate.


There's no doubt about what's the worst tax in Australia, and no doubt about the best bang-for-your-buck tax swap—


which is swapping stamp duty for a broad-based land tax. He goes on to say:



It means that a stamp duty for land tax swap could boost the economy by a massive 82c for each dollar swapped. There's no bigger benefit imaginable from rejigging tax.



We all know—and I especially know, as an economist—that models are useful for helping to make decisions. They don't always dial down to the exact detail, nevertheless we're talking about billions of dollars in productivity gains from this policy alone. Of course, we've had all of that fully costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office.


To summarise, we'll be supporting these measures tonight, but let's not kid ourselves: this is not any attempt at a holistic approach to tackling the crisis in this country, especially for young Australians, of housing affordability. There's a role for government in our lives, a role for correcting market failures. Let's take away the perverse incentives that have been in place now for a number of years that give property investors a chance to use taxpayer funded concessions to buy more properties while young Australians who are struggling on the lowest income brackets are paying their tax. They don't get the same taxpayer concessions. They don't have the same opportunities to go into the market. Let's fix this. Let's get on with holistic reform.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-11-13,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (20:43):  I rise today to speak on the government measures to improve housing tax integrity, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. The Turnbull coalition government is committed to improving housing affordability for all Australians and ensuring that investors, both from Australia and from abroad, cannot abuse our tax system and claim tax deductions that are inappropriate or invalid. Indeed, this bill goes to the core of the government's budget announcements highlighting our commitment to reduce pressure on housing affordability. The Turnbull coalition government is committed to ensuring that all Australians have an opportunity to own an Australian home. These measures are designed to make that more accessible.


As many senators in this chamber and members in the other place have said before, there is something uniquely Australian about the idea and the ideal of home ownership. This is by no means a 21st century phenomenon. Considering the Australian housing affordability crisis is part of the lexicon of commentators, academics and politicians, I think it is worth bearing in mind the historical context of how we reached this place. I read recently something that suggested that Australians' obsession for home ownership began at the turn of the 20th century when Australian houses not only housed people but also fed them. While other countries would place their farmland just outside town centres, Australians grew their food in their backyards, and so saw the rise of the quarter-acre block, a truly Australian phenomenon. This was very significant during wartime in particular when there was rationing.


Postwar there was a new challenge, and that was the scourge of communism. During the Cold War home ownership was actually seen as a way to quell revolutionary tendencies. People with mortgages, jobs, families and responsibilities tend not to be the type of people who want to storm the Winter Palace. The waves of postwar migrants who came to Australia saw home ownership as an opportunity that wasn't available in Britain and Europe. By the mid-1970s home ownership in Australia had reached a high point of about 70 to 75 per cent. Financial deregulation in the 1980s changed things up again. It saw the levelling of the playing field between owner-occupiers and investors. Of course the system had been geared around those owner-occupiers. With 17 per cent interest rates and the recession we had to have in the early 1990s seared on people's brains, and on their bank balances in particular, and only a nascent compulsory retirement saving system at that stage, the moment property markets started to rise faster than inflation investors came back into the market, attracted by the idea of being landlords. So housing moved beyond becoming sort of a democratic ideal. Its value then was seen in dollars as well as in dreams.


These sorts of seismic shifts we have seen in the Australian housing market have brought us to where we are today. Home ownership is still very much part of the Australian dream, and the Turnbull government recognises this. It recognises that there is a part for the government to play in assisting Australians to realise this dream. I hate to ever admit that Senator Whish-Wilson is right about anything, but this time he in fact is. The measures detailed in these bills at hand are only one small part of the solution, but they are a very important part. They form a very important part of a greater suite of policy measures designed to ease the burden of housing affordability.


These measures also reinforce the Turnbull coalition government's commitment to removing significant abuses of the tax system. There are three significant measures in these bills that, for the benefit of the chamber, I would like to examine in more detail. While no-one on my side of politics would deny the right of businesses and individuals to legitimately claim on their tax return expenses incurred, it is always incumbent upon the government to ensure that the tax code adequately reflects the reasonable and legitimate degree to which these deductions are accessed. Inappropriate use of tax deductions is essentially tantamount to stealing from the public purse. We have said many times in this place that this is a government that realises the imperative of budget repair to this nation's future economic prosperity. We are committed to ensuring that all taxpayers contribute fairly. There are some deductions that are simply inappropriate and are currently being used to game the system. For instance, travel that is essentially a leisure trip shouldn't be considered wholly tax deductible simply on account of a single viewing of a potential investment property. To claim such a deduction is entirely inappropriate. The phrase used so often in this chamber is, 'It doesn't pass the pub test.' As such, the bills before the chamber tonight go straight to the heart of addressing such abuses of tax deductions for residential property investment.


The Australian Taxation Office has identified areas which constitute excessive and incorrect claims for travel expenses, and it now falls to the government to take a comprehensive and considered approach to clarifying and legislating rules around what actually constitutes excessive and incorrect claims, and to spell out to both current and potential residential real estate investors what is and is not an appropriate deduction. By employing a comprehensive approach, as demonstrated in this legislation, the government goes part of the way to meeting our budget night commitments to strengthen the residential investment property domain as well as ensure a fairer tax system for all.


From 1 July 2017, travel deductions for an individual investor with residential investment properties, including travel costs associated with inspecting and maintaining properties, will no longer be deductible. This denial of deductible status will limit the excessive and inappropriate claims and will send a very strong message that residential property investor status does not confer special privileges. The tax system is not there for people to pay for holidays by claiming travel costs as a rental expense. As the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer, the Hon. Michael Sukkar MP, outlined in his speech to the other place on 7 September this year:


The existing law allows deductions for travel relating to income produced or gained from residential investment properties. When a property is used for a mixed purpose, such as a holiday home and rental; or where the travel is for a mixed purpose, such as travelling to maintain an investment property and simultaneously go on a family holiday; travel expenses need to be split between income-producing and private purposes.


The problem here is there has been widespread abuse around excessive travel expense claims relating to residential investment properties.


As a result of these changes, travel costs for individual investors inspecting and maintaining residential investment properties will no longer be deductible.


For the sake of clarity, it's important to note that the government understands that third parties, such as real estate agents, may inevitably from time to time need to provide property management services, and of course these activities will remain deductible expenses. These measures are in no way an assault on the nature of our tax deduction expenses, which allows for a reasonable deduction of expenses incurred in earning an assessable income.


Other inappropriate deductions also fall within the net of this legislation. Depreciation is another area of ambiguity that is potentially open to abuse. The tax system currently creates opportunities for plant and equipment to be depreciated by not one but multiple owners of a property, in excess of their actual value. Both previous and subsequent owners of a property can make deductions on the same pieces of plant and equipment. According to the Australian Taxation Office, abuses of residential investment tax deductions for depreciation are very widespread. The legislation before the chamber tonight specifically targets plant and equipment depreciation deductions for investors in residential properties, limiting depreciation claims only to assets that have not been previously used—that is, assets not previously claimed upon by the previous purchaser. 


Depreciation is a very important accounting concept for residential investors, and, claimed appropriately, it recognises the allocation of cost of an asset over its useful life. But, in residential property investment, we must consider the use of such deductions on such things as dishwashers or air-conditioning systems, claimed not once to their actual value but well in excess of the asset's actual value, by multiple successive owners of the same property. So you can see how the changes proposed to deal with this interpretation of successive ownership and depreciation will actually improve the integrity of the tax system. Importantly, too, however—and I think this is an extremely salient issue—this means that investors who have purchased a newly-built residential investment property are not, in fact, disadvantaged when no other person has claimed a depreciation deduction.


So, while it may seem on face value to be a purely administrative amendment, I cannot overemphasise the importance of these measures. The government knows that part of the equation to ease the burden of housing affordability is to encourage investment and growth in the market for new residential property—not existing but new residential property. The measures specified in this bill ensure that deductions for assets in residential investment properties are consistently and fairly treated.


The other major component of these measures is the so-called ghost tax, where a penalty is raised on foreign owners of properties who leave their properties vacant. I had no idea how common this was, but apparently 11.2 per cent of houses on census night were recorded as unoccupied. That is one in 10 properties. I find that quite extraordinary. That's more than one million dwellings. In a period of apparent housing crisis, such a statistic is, indeed, startling. So, once again, the Turnbull coalition government has listened to public concerns and is taking appropriate action. This year's budget papers announced:


To discourage foreign investors from buying residential properties and leaving these vacant, the Government will now charge foreign owners of residential properties an annual charge if the property is not occupied or available to rent for at least six months in each year.


…      …   …


Where a foreign-owned residential property is left vacant for more than six months in a year, a charge will be levied on the foreign owner equivalent to the foreign investment application fee which was paid at the time of application.


The new charge builds on the Government's existing foreign investment regime which seeks to increase the number of houses available for Australians to live in. The charge provides a financial incentive for the foreign owner to make their property available on the rental market if they do not intend to reside there.


This regime, the ghost tax, will be ably administered by the ATO, the Australian Taxation Office, and is expected not only to increase the number of homes available to Australians who wish to rent but also to generate revenue of over $20 million over the forward estimates. That's a very significant contribution to budget repair. This is clearly a supply-side measure and it will also effectively increase the available housing stock.


The Turnbull coalition government understands Australia's housing affordability issues. It has deep dived into this issue, and this is just one component of a suite of measures. Housing affordability is not something that has occurred overnight. It's occurred through a series of economic phenomenon and political decisions, many of which have been fundamental to the prosperity of our nation over many, many decades, but some have had unintended consequences. Australia's housing affordability issues are not something that can be fixed with easy answers, a glib response or ill-considered or populist policy that will inevitably create a cure that is potentially far worse than the symptoms. Also, it is not a universal phenomenon; it is something that occurs far more in our capital cities and, in particular, in Sydney and in Melbourne. It is not a nationwide issue. No-one has yet articulated what the objective of a successful housing affordability policy looks like. There is a reason for this. The reason for this is that the answer is different for everyone on the continuum—and the continuum is what is so important here. The continuum starts with homelessness, and it moves beyond homelessness to social housing, beyond social housing to first home buyers, on to investors, to downsizers and eventually those moving into aged care. This is the spectrum of housing affordability. A successful housing affordability solution looks different to those in Sydney and Melbourne than to those in Adelaide or Hobart, and it looks very different to those in Shepparton or Moree. While the answer is very different to everyone, it remains an important issue to thousands of Australians.


The government is targeting the whole of the housing spectrum. As the federal Treasurer, the Hon. Scott Morrison, said in his budget address in May:


There are no silver bullets to make housing more affordable. But by adopting a comprehensive approach, by working together, by understanding the spectrum of housing needs, we can make a difference.


There is so much more to this issue than just a knee-jerk reaction on capital gains tax or negative gearing. There is so much more than just dealing with homelessness or just dealing with social housing or just dealing with first home buyers and the demand side of the equation. There are no silver bullets. Most importantly, there is no city-centric solution; it has to be a solution that covers the regional areas as well and covers things like decentralisation of services and infrastructure investment. The measures that have been outlined in the legislation tonight go some way to addressing the issue of housing affordability. It is one part of a much broader suite of policy objectives.


I can only implore my colleagues opposite and on the crossbench—and I was very pleased to hear Senator Whish-Wilson's support for these measures tonight—to support the legislation. Housing accessibility and affordability, as well as a fairer tax system, are truly important matters for this chamber to consider. It is not just one issue—not just first home buyers, not just homelessness, not just social housing, not just downsizing. It's so important to address the whole spectrum of housing affordability issues. I urge my colleagues opposite to consider this legislation seriously and support these changes that have been put to the chamber tonight.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (21:02):  I must say, having to implore those opposite to reach a saving of $16.3 million beggars belief. This legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017, is an absolutely minuscule contribution to dealing with any housing issue. It goes nowhere near dealing with the problems that young families have. It goes nowhere near dealing with the problem of first home buyers having to front up against wealthy investors. It goes nowhere near that. Labor will support this, but it's more out of pity for a government that just does not get it, a government that does not understand the issues facing young people trying to get into a home, never mind those at the bottom of the housing market, who can't access social housing, who can't access public housing, who are left on the street every night in this country—105,000 at the last census. We will see far more when the most recent census announces the homeless figures in this country. Senator Hume tries to paint this as a core aspect of the budget—$16.3 million over the forward estimates. What would that buy? It might buy a couple of houses in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. That's about all. It's not going to help families in this country.


What Labor is proposing is to deal with the fundamental issue of disadvantage: capital gains tax and negative gearing allowing wealthy investors to outbid young couples trying to buy their first home in this country. What we are proposing would deliver $32.1 billion over 10 years and $565 million over the forward estimates. That is $32.1 billion currently going to wealthy investors predominantly to outbid young people trying to get into their first home. That's where Labor sees the core issues. Senator Hume stands here and talks about the coalition being committed to improving housing affordability. 'This is the core of the budget plan on housing affordability,' says Senator Hume—$16.3 million, an absolute pittance. For any senator to get up here and say that this is a really good thing on housing affordability shows just how out of touch the Turnbull government is, not only on housing affordability but on living standards for the working people of this country. To give us a little lecture about the quarter acre block—I don't think there are many quarter acre blocks left around where I live, in the lower Blue Mountains, or out in the western suburbs of Sydney. They're all getting chopped up by investors to make more money for builders, more money for investors and more money for those that fund the coalition's re-election campaigns.


Senator Hume talked about the scourge of communism—what a load of rot we have just heard! If this government were really interested in dealing with housing affordability, it would adopt the policy that we have said the alternate government—I think the next government—will implement: negative gearing and capital gains tax changes. Senator Hume talked about this being an important part of the suite of policy measures. What did the experts on this in the Grattan Institute say about the coalition's housing policies? They said that you would need an electron microscope to see any difference from all of their housing policies combined, including this one on housing affordability. The government just doesn't get it; it just doesn't understand. And the reason that they are so supportive of continuing the rort that is negative gearing and capital gains tax is that most of the money goes to Liberal electorates—to wealthy professionals and high-end income earners. That's where this money goes to. I say, and Labor says, that that $32.1 billion is better off in government funds, being spent on the issues that are important for the working class in this country, instead of continuing the inequality in this country that this type of policy delivers, the policy supported by the coalition.


Senator Hume talked about the imperative of budget repair. Well, the budget has gone out of control under this mob. They have not improved the budget one iota. They just live in fantasy land on the other side of this chamber. The Turnbull government are so out of touch, so arrogant, so unconcerned about the real issues that face Australians. They say that they're sending a strong message that people can't pay for their holidays by this change that they're proposing. We agree. But don't stand here and say that $16.3 million over the forward estimates is some fantastic gain, some fantastic fix for those who can't afford to ever think about buying a home in this country. She spoke about the ATO. One of the first things that the government did was cut the funding for the ATO. They cut the funding for the tax office so that their wealthy mates who put the money into their election coffers can continue to rip the tax system off in this country. What a pathetic rabble of a government this lot are. Senator Hume said that they understand the issues. Well, if this is how they understand the issues—and this is what she calls deep diving in to fix the problem—this is just complete nonsense. And they said they're going to target the whole continuum, meaning that they're going to deal with public housing, social housing, rent, private rentals, helping people to buy a home. This will not make a mark on that.


We think that this is appropriate to do this, but, as I've said, we do it more out of pity for a government that's completely lost its way. We will support these. But, if you really want to know what's going on, go out and talk to young people that are fronting up at auctions in the majority of the major cities around this country and see what they would think of this. My view is they would not think much of it at all. Go out and talk to the young couples that are moving down the housing chain for rentals so that they can try and afford to put a deposit together. As they move down that housing continuum, as Senator Hume talks about, they are pushing the working poor and pushing social security recipients out of housing at the bottom and onto the streets. That's what is happening under the government—a government that in the budget made all these proposals about how they were going to reconstitute the national housing agreement. They renamed it, they have met with the states and they are delivering nothing on reform. We're nearly at the end of the year. From May till now, they have not delivered one agreement with the states on how to deal with housing affordability or the crisis that is there for young people and many older people getting into housing.


What did they do? In the first budget, supported by every one of the Liberals that are over there who were in the chamber at the time of the first Liberal budget, they took $44 million a year out of support for emergency housing for disadvantaged people. They took that money out and made sure that women threatened with domestic violence would get less access to support, comfort and security. That was their first thing. We didn't hear Senator Hume talk about that. We didn't hear her talk about that first Liberal budget. We didn't hear her say anything about the austerity budget that was going to rip away security and support from some of the poorest people in this country but hand over $65 billion in tax cuts to multinational corporations and businesses, including the banks, which are making massive profits and sacking thousands of workers. Did we hear anything about that from Senator Hume? Not a word.


Let me tell you about the other area that many working people in this country depend on to ever be able to access their own home or even to be able to afford rental accommodation—the growth area for accommodation in this country—and that is access to penalty rates. I needed my penalty rates to be able to buy my first house. If I hadn't had access to penalty rates, I would never ever have been able to get on the housing ladder. My penalty rates and my capacity to have a decent job with a decent union that provided decent rights on the job gave me the capacity to access the first house that I ever bought. But this mob want to cut penalty rates. They support cuts to the penalty rates of 700,000 Australian workers, most of whom are the working poor, the real battlers, and those that need their penalty rates to actually put food on the table and a roof over their heads. We never heard anything about that from Senator Hume.


If we're really talking about doing something in relation to housing and homelessness and housing affordability, we are saying, 'Yes, we'll cop this—this miniscule proposition. We'll cop it. We'll support it.' But what we are saying is that you actually need to do something about negative gearing and capital gains tax. You also need to do more than mouth off, which is basically what the government have done about doing anything more substantive. What we are saying is that we will deal with negative gearing, we will deal with capital gains tax and we will also make sure that there is a plan in place to try to increase housing stock in this country. The Productivity Commission recently came out with a report that said that one of the ways that you can deal with in regard to housing is to give people in public housing a choice. We have a situation where 4.4 per cent of housing in this country is public housing and social housing. How can anyone ever get choice if that's the level of public housing and social housing that we have in this country? It's a nonsense.


In Glasgow, where I come from, I was brought up in what were called the prefabs. In Scotland, they were basically big caravans without wheels. That was the transitional housing after the war until a major government investment went into housing. They were stinking hot in the summer—and it does happen in Scotland; now and again you it gets hot—and freezing cold in the winter, which was most of the time. I can tell you that that is not the way forward. We need decent housing. We need environmentally sustainable housing. We need to do what the UK government's doing. It is a conservative government that is looking at how it can increase the stock of public and social housing. It has undertaken what's called the Farmer review. The Farmer review is looking at how they can actually create an industry in the UK with fabricated off-site homes of high quality and high environmental sustainability, create jobs and make it cheaper to build quality homes and erect them around the country. They need to look at these issues rather than trying to come in here and say that $16.3 million over the forward estimates is a great example of the coalition doing something about housing. It is absolute nonsense. 


The coalition refuse to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax. They closed the National Rental Affordability Scheme that provided 38,000 new affordable housing units and was on track to achieve its target of 50,000. They scrapped the first home saver accounts scheme, which was helping people save for their first home, and they're trying to put a copycat proposal in this non-delivery of their budget proposals. They closed their ears and their eyes to the growing evidence of a housing affordability crisis by abolishing the National Housing Supply Council, and the Prime Minister's Council on Homelessness. That is their record on the other side with housing and homelessness—absolutely pathetic: a pathetic government, a pathetic budget, a pathetic response to housing and homelessness. They cut $44 million a year out of capital funding for homelessness services. That meant that young kids, coming out of home care, ended up on the streets, and that is why the NGOs are telling me that one of the key issues that has to be dealt with is young people coming out of home care, especially young women, ending up on the street and being groomed by some of the hard-heads out there. It's absolutely ridiculous. They cut out $44 million a year. Older women who end up with no superannuation, lose their husband and have nowhere to live have nowhere to go on housing and homelessness under this government. 


The speeches those opposite were making a couple of years ago suggested that this was not a federal government responsibility; it was the states' responsibility. But Labor sees putting a roof over people's head as a fundamental responsibility of a federal government. That's why we will have a housing minister, that's why we will have someone there dealing with the states in a proper way. That's why we will reform the housing agreement nationally and why we will be saying to state governments and local governments that inclusionary zoning should be considered. If the business community is going to make squillions out of housing, some of it must go back into housing for the poorer people in this country. This mob do not have a clue. They think that two or three or four per cent inclusionary zoning will fix it. They think a bond aggregator without further government support will fix it. They have rocks in their head, they are an absolute rabble and they just don't get it.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-11-13,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (21:23):  In a way, the legislation before us today converts our income tax into a turnover tax and our capital gains tax into a wealth tax. It is also set to extract about $800 million extra from taxpayers over the next four years. It's the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017. As the name suggests, the government is moving towards a turnover tax and a wealth tax for those individuals who do the reprehensible act of investing in housing. Under standard income tax rules, travel to and from a residential property investment that is owned for the purpose of generating assessable income is deductible. But it won't be once this bill passes. By denying deductions, this bill is effectively making people pay tax on their turnover instead of their income. Turnover taxes are a terrible idea, even worse than income taxation, but the government is going ahead regardless. 


Travel costs to generate assessable income may also form part of the cost base of the residential property investment under standard capital gains tax rules. This ensures that capital gains tax is on the gains, not the entire value of the capital. But once this bill passes it will no longer be possible to include these travel costs in the cost base, so for the affected people capital gains tax will move more towards a tax on the entire capital—in other words, a wealth tax. Wealth taxes are a terrible idea, even worse than capital gains taxation, but the government is going ahead regardless. But wait, there's more. Under standard income tax rules the decline in the value of previously used depreciating assets used to earn assessable income is deductible, but, under this bill, if you are earning assessable income by investing in residential property, you will now be denied these deductions. This is a further step away from income taxation towards a turnover tax. All of this will shift investment away from residential property, and rents will go up as a result. This is pure folly. The government's willingness to remove standard tax features just to attack individual investors in residential property begs the question: what is stopping the government from going completely anti investment and completely anti rental housing and scrapping negative gearing for investment in residential property? 


This bill demonstrates, once again, that the coalition and Labor are cut from the same cloth, and the small policy differences they maintain are mostly for show. In any case, housing affordability is a state issue. Labor or Liberal, the Commonwealth government should not be pretending it has any role to play. 


Before I finish, don't let me forget that this teeming chamber of reasoned debate and insight is also debating a second bill, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. This bill introduces a tax on foreign owners of residential real estate whenever the property is not occupied or genuinely available for rent for six months in a year. It is an example of government micromanagement and intrusion—telling property owners what do with the property they own. Protection of property rights is the most important function of any government. Yet, here we have this government seriously eroding them. Even worse, much of the revenue generated from this new tax will be eaten up by the cost of administering the tax. With nonsense policies like this we're on the road to Venezuela, getting closer with each sitting day of parliament. I condemn these bills to this near empty chamber.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-11-13,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (21:27):  You would be surprised if I didn't say it was an absolute delight to rise tonight to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. I'm pleased to be following Senator Leyonhjelm. I'm not sure I share his negative outlook on this legislation; I tend to think these are positive steps in the right direction. I'm not sure I would agree, either, with Senator Cameron's characterisation of Senator Hume's contribution: that this bill was the be-all and end-all of dealing with the issue of housing affordability—which, of course, is a significant issue. No-one in this place can deny it. No-one in this place has to struggle with it either, frankly. All of us are on in excess of $200,000 a year, and I hope the seven people listening across the country don't forget that fact: anyone who has made a contribution to this debate is doing very well out of the taxpayer, thank you very much. So for us to sit here and lecture one another on housing affordability is a bit rich, I suppose. But those of us who do get out into the community and listen to those we seek to represent would, hopefully, have an understanding of the problems we face when it comes to ensuring that we have a supply of affordable housing that is accessible to those in the community who need it, in all parts of the country. 


It's not a simple issue. It's not one that can be dealt with by one pull of a policy lever and then hopefully it's all okay tomorrow. I don't think it is as simple as has been made out by previous contributions in this debate, and it's something that we need to take very seriously. In reflecting on what I was going to say tonight in my contribution, I had a bit of a look at the previous considerations of Senate committees on the particular issue of housing affordability. In the last parliament, the Economics References Committee considered this very issue. It published a report entitled Out of reach? The Australian housing affordability challenge, which aptly set out some of the challenges that are faced. That report states:


… no single measure can capture the diversity of Australian experiences of housing affordability … most indicators point toward a deterioration of affordability in recent decades. This decline is keenly felt by a broad array of people, including people wanting to become homeowners, renters and people living in community and public housing. Homelessness, meanwhile, is a tremendously complex problem, and it would be reductive to suggest it is simply a corollary of housing affordability and nothing more besides. Nonetheless … poor housing affordability creates pressures throughout the housing system …


I think that's an important point for us to take on board as we consider what is, as this report states, a very complex issue. To suggest it is simple, to suggest that we can just fix it by tweaking one set of tax arrangements or creating an incentive for affordable housing to the exclusion of any other policy measure, is naive, to be frank. So I think the report in that sense is a very helpful one to consider before moving to exactly what's being talked about in the bills we are considering today.


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017, the principal bill that we are considering tonight, at its heart, is about housing affordability. In the Australian way of life, having access to housing and housing that you can afford is fundamental to wellbeing. To be able to provide shelter for your family and for yourself, to ensure good health, and to be warm in winter and cool in summer and the like is so incredibly important. Having access to those things, either by way of home ownership or being a renter, is so incredibly important.


Home ownership, or having access to reasonable standards of accommodation at an affordable level, is a driver of social and economic opportunities in this country. We all know it. I heard Senator Cameron in his contribution —and I'm sure I'll refer to this a little later on—refer to getting onto the housing ladder when he was talking about the need for penalty rates. When he bought his first home, he needed that money to afford that property. That's the reality of home ownership in this country and has been for time immemorial. People buy homes, and—hopefully, for anyone who does so—they increase in value. That is what we want so that that increased value can be translated into assets that we can realise the value of and we can invest in something else—a smaller home, a holiday, things like that. That's what we do with home ownership. We save for the future to pay for our kids' education, to pay for the things we need in life. It is about those social and economic opportunities, which are really a part of the Australian dream that we often talk about in this place.


The need to deal with the rising cost of housing across the country has long been talked about. My home state of Tasmania, particularly the southern half, with the city of Hobart, is no exemption. If I look at some of the recent examples of housing prices in the city of Hobart, various real estate agents, including representatives of the Real Estate Institute of Tasmania, have talked about the fact that, although a decade or even five years ago, houses rarely reached the $1 million or $1.5 million mark, it's now quite common to see houses selling for that price or well in excess of it. In recent years, one house in our little city of Hobart, which has a population not far in excess of 250,000, sold for $6½ million and another one for $8 million. They are record-breaking prices and they are certainly outliers, but it indicates that, when the market is hot, the prices go up. That has a flow-on to the other parts of the market which are more within the reach of most of the people that occupy this chamber.


In her contribution a little earlier, Senator Hume did talk about the government's plan to try and tackle this matter, and the bills that we have before us today are just part of that. It's not the whole thing, as Senator Cameron tried to characterise it as; it is just part of it. We also need to look at increasing the supply of affordable housing, which is something that many states and territories, if not all of them, are doing ardently. State and territory governments, who have responsibility for social housing and for many of the policies that relate to the supply of housing in each of their jurisdictions, are looking after this policy as well.


I know it was acknowledged by previous speakers in this debate that it is a matter that comes up at ministers meetings or COAG meetings. We can't ignore that. To assume in this debate that housing affordability is purely the domain of the federal government is naive and just plain wrong. It is a priority for this government. I'm sure it is also a priority for all Australians—particularly for those of us who have children who I hope will be growing up in this country—to be able to access affordable housing, to make sure that their kids can live, as I referred to before, the Australian dream, and to have a home with a yard and whatever else they need to raise their kids. That's what we need to be able to provide for.


The bill itself, as has been referred to by previous contributors in this debate, has a couple of measures that will go some way to dealing with this issue. First of all it will limit foreign ownership in new developments—in other words, there will effectively be a cap. We will see foreign ownership in new developments being limited through a 50 per cent cap on the number of properties that can be sold to foreign investors through developer pre-approvals and as a condition on New Dwelling Exemption Certificates for new property developments where an application was made after budget night. We are talking about reserving the supply of new houses, with at least half the level being made available to local buyers, preventing them going, as seems to be the popular belief for the most part, to foreign investors.


There is also, as I heard Senator Hume talking about earlier on, the penalty for properties being left vacant. I think that is an important step in addressing the matter relating to the cost of rentals in this country. An annual charge of at least $5,000 on foreign owners of residential real estate will be applied where Australian residential property is not occupied or genuinely available on the rental market for at least six months of the year. The measure is designed to free up more dwellings for Australian renters, and this measure builds on the government's existing foreign investment regime by seeking to increase the number of houses available for Australians to live in. These are just two parts of the bill, with the other one being the tightening of tax rules to reduce the use of the current taxation arrangements to the advantage of some property owners. This will ensure that we actually receive revenue on these investments, which can then go towards investment in essential services across this country. 


I will just briefly go back to the Tasmanian experience and look at some recent reports from the last 12 months—the year of 2017—about what's been going on in Tasmania. I think we'd all have to agree that Tasmania is probably one of the more affordable states when it comes to housing, notwithstanding the two examples I gave earlier on. Saul Eslake, who is a respected economist that some of you may be familiar with, has commentated on this issue. He said on 24 June 2017 that 'Tasmania is now getting net migration from the mainland after a period of out-migration' and pointed to the issue of housing affordability as one of the things that is attracting people to Tasmania. Obviously people will make decisions about where they live and the occupations they pursue based on how affordable buying a house is. 


Real estate agents in Tasmania are increasingly noticing that young families are moving back, drawn by affordable housing. 'It's happening more over the last 12 months', said Ant Manton from Ray White real estate in Tasmania. He pointed to the markets in Melbourne and Sydney as being factors that are driving people out of these mainland major cities to places like Tasmania, which I think is a great thing. That, in turn, has a flow-on effect for places like the state of Tasmania. Let's reflect on home prices in Tasmania. In Hobart, for instance, home prices jumped 5.8 per cent to the year ending 31 May of this year to a median of $350,000, while Sydney and Melbourne each added more than 11 per cent, with medians of $872,300 and $665,000 respectively, as reported by CoreLogic. These are significant differences in the affordability of housing in this country.


It takes me to another point I want to make in relation to this debate—that is, reflecting on the difference in housing prices between major metro cities on the mainland and the prices we have in Tasmania. There has been a lot of discussion about trying to attract people to these regional cities and regional communities. Part of that, of course, is the decentralisation process being undertaken. It was being led by the former senator and former minister—a very good minister too—Fiona Nash. It is about getting Public Service agencies out of Canberra and into our regional communities. I would think that, for many of the people who work in these agencies, it would be a great thing to be able to unlock the value of your home here in Canberra, Sydney or Melbourne and head out to somewhere beautiful like Hobart and invest probably one-fifth of the price and snare yourself a five-bedroom mansion down on the waterfront somewhere.


Reflecting further on some of the experiences in Tasmania more recently: on 3 November it was reported that Tasmania is breaking records with regard to the housing market. It passed $4 billion for one year of sales in the state. The interesting thing about this article, which appeared on news.com.au and also in The Mercury newspaper in Hobart, was that first home buyers purchased 220 properties, at the median price of $275,000, and they remain steady at 13 per cent of the market. There were only 13 sales to foreign investors, blowing out of the water this notion that all of our properties are being snapped up by foreign investors. The majority of homes sold to interstate buyers were to interstate buyers moving to Tasmania to live, not to investors who wanted to buy a home to rent out and to prop up their bank balances, as those opposite would claim. Vacancy rates in the rental market continue to tighten, with Hobart now at historical lows below two per cent. Of course, that does lead to the problem we've talked about previously—the affordability of rental properties in Tasmania.


I do just want to briefly touch on what the Tasmanian government is doing with regard to housing affordability. Every state and territory does have its own housing affordability strategy and programs that address this issue. In Tasmania, their strategy is a significant one. It is a 10-year strategy which will improve access in all sectors of the housing market. It runs from 2015—so it has been going for two years—until 2025. It's supported by an action plan which provides $73½ million over a number of years. It will see 1,600 vulnerable Tasmanian households housed. It is supported by the construction of 900 new homes. It is a significant number for a small state the size of Tasmania. Of course, that policy, that action plan and that strategy have all been developed after exhaustive consultation with stakeholders, social services, peak groups and those who actually need the services as well. I commend the Tasmanian government for the various initiatives they have, including the home-share initiative, which will develop 250 homes for people on low to moderate incomes. The Streets Ahead incentive program is a deposit incentive program, offering $12,000 to people looking to purchase Tasmanian dwellings. There are supply initiatives where we are seeing nearly 30 homes developed by private developers. And there are community housing stock leverage programs which will see 172 new homes in addition to 31 upgraded homes. That's just the tip of the iceberg in the little old state of Tasmania.


I will reflect briefly on the contributions made by a couple of others in this debate. I was listening to what both Senator Gallagher and Senator Cameron had to say about the issue of housing affordability. It seems to be that it's all care and no responsibility in opposition. I heard Senator Gallagher say that this government has had five years to fix it and, 'You've just got to do it.' The last time I checked, those in opposition have a responsibility to provide serious policies that would help to address issues that this nation faces. I didn't hear one utterance from either Senator Gallagher or Senator Cameron on how they would deal with these issues. All they want to do is stand on the sidelines and throw stones. They don't actually want to be constructive. They don't want to talk about ways and measures that might tangibly and properly improve the situation we face as a country when it comes to housing affordability. They, we can't forget, are the aspiring government. They are the people who want to be on this side of the chamber, and they owe it to the Australian people to provide and explain their policies and be subject to the scrutiny that the government is.


One thing that we did hear was mention of a minister for housing. I'm not a firm believer in creating new bureaucracies or new ministries just to solve a problem—in fact, quite the opposite. The last time I checked, if you went out onto the main street of any of the towns I represent, the creation of a new political position or a new ministry would not inspire anyone, and it certainly won't fix the problems that our country faces. The centrepiece for the Labor policy seems to be the creation of this new minister for housing. I look forward to seeing what this new minister for housing would ever do if, one day, this mob ever got into government.


I go back to my starting point: the position of privilege that most of the people in this chamber occupy. All of us are on a good income and many of us in this place own multiple properties. So it is interesting to listen to Senator Cameron talk about the working-class individuals, the people who really struggle. I don't know how many homes Senator Cameron owns. I know he has one in New South Wales and a very, very nice one in Hobart.




Senator Pratt:
  I think that was two.




Senator DUNIAM:
  Two; he may have more. In fact, on his register of interests entry I think there are more, but I'm not going to go into that now.




Senator Dastyari:
  Oh!




Senator DUNIAM:
  And I don't know how many you have, Senator Dastyari. But the point is this: it's great to hear people talk about how important it is to solve this issue and how awful those who haven't solved it are, but, when you consider the position of privilege we all live in, it's a bit rich to just throw stones the way Senator Cameron has been. As I said, I didn't hear anything by way of an alternative, other than the creation of a new portfolio for the ministry of housing, which I think is ridiculous, although I did have a look at Labor's Positive plan to help housing affordability and I did see this:


… Labor has been working and acting. In March 2015 Labor held a Housing Affordability Roundtable.


I love a good roundtable. It's good to talk. It's good to get through the issues. But it does matter where the rubber hits the road and where action actually comes to the fore and, again, I'm not seeing any of that.


I don't think there's much more to say other than I looked at the Greens' policy, The Greens housing plan: everyone needs a home, which says it is going to generate $51 billion of economic returns to the nation. It is two pages long and there is not much in it. This is an important issue and it is disappointing to hear the lack of substance from those on the other side of the chamber. I commend the bills to the House.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (21:48):  I rise this evening to put some remarks on the record with regard to genetic testing. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which I am deputy chair, is inquiring into the life insurance industry, and it has been quite concerning to hear evidence of insurers discriminating against those who undertake genetic testing. Certainly, it's a very live issue. 


Life insurance is a risk-based industry, so life insurers need to be able to assess risk accurately for each applicant on the basis of what information is available to them. But life insurance also spreads risk across a pool of individuals. Currently, insurers can ask if an applicant has undertaken or is considering undertaking a genetic test. This information is then used by insurers to determine risk. Now, let's be clear: genetic testing does not mean somebody will develop a condition; it's about the likelihood of having that condition. Importantly, the point has been made many times in the course of this inquiry that the reliability of tests is somewhat varied. 


Evidence presented to the committee indicates that if someone receives an adverse result based on a genetic test, insurers undertake a number of options. Perhaps they might charge a higher premium causing access issues by effectively pricing the applicant out of the market. Indeed, when that has occurred, we have heard evidence that that needs to be disclosed to the next insurer and the person then is unable to secure insurance from any source. The other option that we have heard is an exclusion of insurance cover for certain conditions, particularly issues that are common in the Australian population such as cancer. This is despite individuals being able to actually take practical and proactive steps to detect any early possible signs of cancer and to adjust their lifestyle. The other option, which is all too common, sadly, is the refusal of insurers to cover completely—no cover—leaving individuals and their families financially vulnerable.


If someone undertakes a genetic test, that's a good thing. It signals that they are taking proactive steps to better inform their health. It's a new technology that we need to engage with. Following getting the results, people tend to respond very vigilantly and take further steps to minimise their chance of developing a condition, or they take steps to ensure early detection is more likely. Given that reality of positive health response to genetic testing, why are individuals and their families left worried about their financial status and their financial situation following this sort of action?


Pricing risk is a fundamental and necessary dimension of life insurance, particularly to make sure that this is a long-time and sustainable industry, and I appreciate this. We all appreciate this. The value of proper insurance is a critical part of a stable economic life for Australians. The life insurance industry plays a critical role in the lives of everyday Australians. I particularly acknowledge the important role that group insurance inside superannuation is playing for what was, prior to that, a very uninsured Australian population. Life insurance must remain viable, but it also must serve its purpose. Risk is spread across an entire pool of individuals. We can't see that continue to reduce as people undertake testing. I don't accept that individuals and their families have to make decisions where they're trading off financial stability, which could be secured through life insurance, against their health, which could be better informed by genetic testing.


The way life insurers use the result of genetic testing also has an impact on the broader community through innovation and through research and development. Increasingly, I am hearing reports that people do not want to be part of trials that require genetic testing because of concerns this will adversely impact on their life insurance cover either through higher premiums or no cover at all. In fact, we heard evidence that indicated ethics boards at universities were now advising researchers that they need to let potential participants in their trials know that by participating in a genetic test there might be negative financial impacts for them and that they would need to go and see their financial adviser or check with their insurer. This is not a sustainable practice. Evidence presented to the committee indicated that in one study when people were asked the reason for them not participating in research, insurance concerns were the reason for over 50 per cent of all of the people who said no.


Just last week, a 7.30 program on Channel 2 brought this issue to light again. We saw a story of a young father taking reasonable steps to check whether he had a genetic mutation called Lynch syndrome, which carries an increased risk of bowel and other cancers. What happened to him was something familiar. He provided the results of his genetic test to an insurance company and he was refused life insurance for cancer. But this young father, because he is aware of his genetic mutation, has the regular check-ups and cautiously monitors his health in this way, thanks to the information provided by the genetic test. Doctors tell him that the risk of cancer that he actually has, according to the professionals, is the same as the rest of the population. He just has more information about it than somebody who hasn't had the test and isn't disclosing the information. This is a real and pressing problem that we need to deal with in this country. Sadly, this father continued to struggle to gain life insurance.


Similarly, we heard the story of a young woman who has a genetic mutation which increases her risk of breast and ovarian cancer. She was told she'd only get life insurance if she undertook preventive surgery to remove her breasts and ovaries. Some stressful months later she was finally insured.


This problem is not just restricted to adults; it's also a problem facing children. I have had correspondence from a family who've had a child diagnosed with autism. There is increasing opportunity for a test for developmental delay and there are proposals about gene deletion and duplication matters for research that should be able to be undertaken. Information is available, and I understand from the correspondence that I received that this is starting to impact on people in terms of exclusion from insurance. There are proposals to do broader tests to get a better dataset, but increasingly people are saying, 'It is too risky for my child to be a part of this trial because it will impact on their capacity to get insurance later in life.' We are talking about young children who are looking at a lifetime of not being able to get insurance simply because their parents are taking, on their behalf, positive health action to improve their wellbeing, prevent their illness and improve their quality of life.


In the future, genetic testing is only going to increase in frequency as genetic technology is becoming cheaper and developments are ensuring it is more advanced. It must always be remembered, though, that genetic tests vary in quality, and current interpretations of results can be the subject of intense debate amongst clinicians. As more and more people rightly undertake genetic testing for health reasons, the way in which life insurers use genetic testing is only going to grow in prominence. At the moment, the use of genetic testing for life insurance is self-regulated through the Financial Services Council's Life Insurance Code of Practice. The code currently does not pressure individuals to have genetic testing undertaken, and I think that's a good thing. Other countries, though, have seen this problem. Countries such as the UK and Canada have protected consumers by restricting or banning the use of genetic information for insurance altogether—with certain limits, varying from country to country.


The inquiry of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the life insurance industry is due to report to parliament soon, and we will make recommendations in due course. I look forward to recording these concerns of our time. It is important that we have this issue on the table so that people can take reasonable steps to check their health and not end up being locked out of insurance. We took evidence from Dr Simon Longstaff, the Executive Director of the Ethics Centre. He said at one stage of the committee public hearings: 'If you could get to the point where you had absolute certainty about the particular fate of a particular individual based on their genome, there would no longer be insurance in the sense that we understand it. All of the communal benefits that come from insurance would progressively be lost.' We are not at that point. We do not want to get to that point. But we need to manage the reality that those who take proactive steps to better health cannot continue to be locked out of the life insurance market and dissuaded from taking positive health action. There needs to be a sensible balance achieved for the benefit of Australians more broadly and for the industry as well.
