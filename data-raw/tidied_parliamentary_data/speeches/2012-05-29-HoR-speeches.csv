Is the Prime Minister aware that Brindabella Airlines are about to cease their Canberra-Albury and Brisbane-Armidale air services? Its chief operating officer said that the imposition of the carbon tax was a major factor and 'the final nail in the coffin for us'.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I am advised by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport that Rex is in fact expanding its operations and number of flights. Once again we have the Leader of the Opposition in this place seeking—



Opposition members:  Wrong airline!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order!




Ms GILLARD:
  If I can finish my sentence, Madam Deputy Speaker, once again we have got the opposition in this place trying to mislead about the impact of carbon pricing. They are trying to create a fear in the Australian community about the impact of carbon pricing on regional airlines. As I have just indicated, the minister for transport has advised me that Rex is expanding.


On the impact on Brindabella and on air travel generally, as we have canvassed—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Riverina, the Prime Minister has the call and will be heard in silence.




Ms GILLARD:
  On regional airlines, Brindabella—the question that the Leader of the Opposition asked—we have in the past canvassed in this parliament the modest impact of carbon pricing on air travel. We have also in this parliament discussed how this impact—




Mr Abbott:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Brindabella's chief operating officer says the carbon tax was the 'final nail in the coffin'—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.




Ms GILLARD:
  No. 1, I remind the Leader of the Opposition that carbon pricing does not start till 1 July. No. 2, I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the impact on air travel is in the order of a few dollars per flight. No. 3, I remind the Leader of the Opposition that that impact has been modelled into the assistance that families and households are receiving. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that 3.2 million pensioners are, as we speak, receiving the first round of additional assistance in their bank accounts, which will be followed up next March and be ongoing; that 1.5 million families around the country are receiving assistance into their bank accounts as well. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he is a man who has made many false claims about carbon pricing, all of which will be shown to be untrue on 1 July. He said prices rises will be unimaginable; he will be shown to be wrong. He said power bills will jump by 30 per cent; he will be shown to be wrong. He said the coal industry will shut down; he will be shown to be wrong. He said entire towns like Whyalla will be wiped off the map. So, when the sun sets on 1 July and none of those things has come to pass, then this destructive negativity from the Leader of the Opposition will be revealed to the Australian people for what it has always been—him trying to run a political fear campaign and prepared to engage in any level of distortion to do so.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:08):  To the shadow Treasurer's question let me first say this: you never accept a purported fact from the opposition when it is brought into this parliament during question time, because you always find out on analysis that what is being said is not right—part of a fear campaign. For example, I have just been given the media release of Aeropelican and Brindabella Airlines, who talk about—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, a point of order.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The Manager of Opposition Business is rising on a point of order of relevance. I was actually going to ask the Prime Minister to answer the question before her. The Prime Minister has the call and will be relevant to the question.




Ms GILLARD:
  Yes, I will, Deputy Speaker. I know, of course, that you cannot in front of this opposition bring a fact into the building—they get hysterical. So we will deal with their misleading about Brindabella Airlines at the end of question time. But I do draw people's attention to the press release.


On the question that I have been asked—which, when we look into it, I am sure will turn out to be equally misleading, because that is what the opposition does on carbon pricing—as the shadow Treasurer would be aware, we have spoken to the Australian people about local government and carbon pricing: about the very, very modest impact and about how the impact on rates has been modelled into the anticipated price rises of 0.7 per cent. That is less than a dollar in a $100. 


Of course, what the shadow Treasurer does not want to tell Australians is that the assistance that is being made available—the payments for 3.2 million pensioners, the family payment increases for 1.5 million, the tax reduction, and the shadow Treasurer has been very clear about this—all of these things will be taken away by the shadow Treasurer. Money ripped out of the hands of working Australians raising children; money ripped out of the hands of Australians who are benefiting from a triple tax-free threshold; money ripped out of the hands of pensioners, and many of them better off as a result of the assistance that is being received.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order?




Mr Abbott:
  Yes, Madam Deputy Speaker. A million dollars increase for Sydney council, a half a million dollars for Wollongong and other councils.



Government members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Leader of the Opposition will sit down! The Leader of the Opposition has made his point of order. It is relevance. Points of order are not opportunities for debate. If they continue to be abused I will exclude people from the chamber. The Prime Minister has the call and will be relevant to the question before her.




Ms GILLARD:
  Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker, and on relevance it is relevant that the price impact is 0.7 per cent, less than a cent in a dollar; it is relevant that families are receiving assistance; and it is relevant that the Leader of the Opposition wants to take every dollar of that assistance away from hardworking Australian families and from Australian pensioners.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:20):  To the member for Menzies: I believe it is a good idea to benefit 1.3 million families with the costs of getting the kids to school. I do believe that. I also believe that it is appropriate that there is welfare conditionality when people, despite assistance and despite work, are not putting their kids in school. That is why we introduced the school attendance measure. I note that, for all of the cant on the other side, it is this government that has got on with the hard jobs of welfare reform in the interests of children, like ensuring that weekly benefits are contingent on kids being in school. It is one of our proud reform measures.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order. The Prime Minister was asked a very straightforward question about whether she agreed that parents who have had their welfare payments suspended and whose kids do not go to school should get the schoolkids bonus. That is the question she has to answer.

Ms GILLARD:
  Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker. I am answering the member for Menzies' question. On the member for Menzies' question, I believe that weekly welfare benefits should be contingent if people are not getting their kids to school, and it is this government that has introduced it, not those over there, despite all their cant and hypocrisy on the question. This government has introduced it. On the schoolkids bonus, I believe that 1.3 million families should have the benefit of additional resources to help get their kids to school, and I know that the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip that money out of their hands.


A little bit earlier today, the Leader of the Opposition was in his party room referring to me, and for once he got it right.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (15:10):  Over the life of this government we have seen them declare war on all sorts of issues, as the shadow Treasurer has reminded us on other occasions: on obesity, on binge drinking, on pokies, on inflation—




Mr Hunt:
  On Kevin!




Mr MORRISON:
  And on the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd—of course! But in the budget the Treasurer and the Prime Minister opened up a new war: a war on their fellow Australians. It was a cheap shot, and it was a pathetic attempt in seeking to demonise Australians for their wealth, for their innovation, for their entrepreneurship, for their investment, for taking a risk and for backing their own country's future. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer, in engaging in this class war rhetoric, demean themselves and, indeed, their office.


But we learned this past week that this government cannot even get a class war right. The Prime Minister and this Treasurer have outed themselves in the course of the past week as double agents in their own phony class war, earning the rebuke of Mr Howes, who has now lost his way. He is no longer sure who he is supposed to be hating anymore and who he should be demonising. Now, I have great confidence that Mr Howes will find his way very, very soon on these things—no-one hates like the Labor Party. Just ask the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, about that.


But Labor's class war has been exposed as a phony war; a phony war that tries cynically to pitch Australians against each other to drive political advantage for an embattled Prime Minister, who will do whatever it takes to get herself out of the latest mess she has landed herself in by her own hand. The handling of the Roy Hill mine enterprise migration agreement announcements has been yet another panicked decision from a Prime Minister whose poor judgment has dropped her in yet another self-made mess.


Even when the government has the support of the coalition—the opposition—for a policy, as it has on this occasion, she still cannot get anything right. The Prime Minister and caucus have today issued a vote of no confidence in the minister at the table, Minister Bowen. There are plenty of reasons why I would normally join such a vote on those matters of no confidence in Minister Bowen, but on this occasion Minister Bowen has been hung out to dry yet again by his Prime Minister. It is not the first time that this minister has been hung out to dry by his Prime Minister; as we all recall, last year he was hung out to dry over the cabinet decision regarding Nauru and opposing that policy.


The question for the Prime Minister that I have today is: what has changed since a year ago? What has changed since over a year ago, when the enterprise migration agreement policy was put into place, that has so shocked this Prime Minister—that has so disturbed her—that she thinks that these arrangements that are now presented for the Roy Hill mine project are anything different to what would have been conceived of more than a year ago? What has changed? This policy was announced more than a year ago. Protections were built into the model for this policy: the department had to negotiate agreements within three months and the decision as to whether a project would have access to the MA was entirely at the minister's discretion, which is now compromised by the additional oversight and the lack of confidence expressed by his caucus and his Prime Minister today.


Rather than each subcontractor having to negotiate their own labour agreement, they fall under the umbrella agreement of this arrangement through the bulk negotiation that has occurred with the project owner. There is a need to develop a comprehensive training plan demonstrating how the project will invest in the upskilling of Australians to meet future skill needs in the resources sector. They have to set measurable targets for training that develop skills and occupations where there are known or anticipated shortages. Overseas labour will only be supplementary, with resources projects required to demonstrate effective and ongoing local recruitment efforts. Occupations that are not eligible for standard migration programs can be sponsored provided the project can justify a genuine need that cannot be met from the Australian labour market. Direct employers will need to comply with sponsorship obligations, including paying Australian market salary rates. Overseas workers sponsored under an EMA will hold 457 visas and will be subject to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2009. Where there is evidence of widespread abuse, contractual sanctions in an EMA will allow the department to suspend or cancel an EMA and associated arrangements. Overseas workers will need to demonstrate English language proficiency and the skills and experience necessary to perform the occupation in Australia. Relevant licensing or registration requirements will also apply.


These protections were in the original policy. It is a policy that has had the support of members on this side of the House. It is a policy that was designed to produce the type of arrangement that is now before this minister and this government in terms of the Roy Hill mine project. So what has changed since that policy was announced to have this Prime Minister go to water at the time of announcement and seek to hang her minister out to dry and pretend that she knew nothing of this until last week, when all of a sudden these arrangements were somehow not going to support projects, not going to support Australian jobs and not going to be in the national interest?


The Roy Hill application was submitted before Christmas, as the minister said today. Prior to that time they had been engaged in discussion with the department to ensure that their submission was compliant. The discussion and consultation included unions—extensively—the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, and ministers, and this went on for months. Is the Prime Minister seriously asking the Australian people to believe that she knew nothing about this until last week? If that is her testimony—that the Prime Minister of this country did not know about a project that was worth $10 billion and that is going to generate at least 6,000 Australian jobs—then she is damned by her own testimony and she should resign for that reason alone, because she does not know what is going on in her government. This is a Prime Minister who should stand condemned by her own words if that is the myth that she is trying to put on the Australian people and on members of this House—a Prime Minister so distracted by her constant bungles and self-made crises that she could not be aware of this significant project. The Prime Minister needs to get her story straight. Either she did not know and is incompetent, or she did know, has sought to mislead Australians yet again and has demonstrated that not even her own ministers can trust her, let alone the Australian people. The ministers that especially cannot trust her are the ones who voted against her and for the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in their last leadership ballot.


It is clear that the Prime Minister did know. That is shown by the evidence put forward in the answer to the question today by the minister, confirming his briefings both to the productivity committee of the cabinet and generally through that process. Of course she knew. I may have many criticisms of this minister, but I suspect strongly that he did his job on this occasion and he did keep people informed of this. This Prime Minister has gone to water on him at the critical moment and has shamed him. She has hung him out there like a shag on a rock. Frankly, it is time for this minister to seriously take up his own advice, get an improvement in the quality of his own life and go into exile on the back bench with the former Prime Minister Mr Rudd. They can sit over there in their exiled government, because clearly this is a divided and dysfunctional government, and the events around this case purely demonstrate this.


What is the big deal here? It is not uncommon for people not to trust this Prime Minister. That is not something that is brought to this House with any sort of freshness about it in terms of the news. It is not uncommon for those on that side of the House to know that they cannot trust this Prime Minister, as this minister at the table has learnt too bitterly on too many occasions. The big deal here is this: what next? What is the impact on investor certainty and confidence in this government's ability to make a decision and stick to it? The actions of the Prime Minister have created uncertainty—not those of the minister for immigration, who on this rare occasion seems to have got something right. The minister should go into exile, as I said. I will long argue that there are many reasons he should do so, but the uncertainty created by the Prime Minister's actions is the cause here. It has created an own goal for this government, and the damage is not over yet.


As a result of the histrionics of this government and the Prime Minister in recent days, what further restrictions will now be placed on these arrangements? What additional conditions will be demanded as a result of the going to water by this Prime Minister at a critical moment when the country needed her to be strong? When will the deed to give effect to the agreement be finalised? Because, as the minister knows, that deed is still unsigned. What impact will additional conditions and delays have on this project? If it survives to that level, what will the unions do when it is time for a construction agreement to be put together for the site? Will they use this agreement—as they could—as a secondary bar to negate the impact of this agreement by once again, through that arrangement, locking out the workers that are provided for under this agreement? That is what is at risk through the Prime Minister's bungling of yet another issue. What will this Prime Minister do if the unions take that stand, and what confidence can Australians have when she so easily folded when presented with the histrionics of Mr Howes from the AWU when unions met in this place last week and went into meltdown?


What of the other projects? What will these investors and financiers now be saying about these other projects that remain in the queue, with a mining tax, a carbon tax, withholding tax increases, and increased taxes on living-away-from-home allowances for those on 457 visas, and a Prime Minister who simply cannot be trusted not to change the rules once an agreement and an investment have been made?


This all adds up to one thing, and it is called sovereign risk. Sovereign risk is the other name this Prime Minister goes by, because this Prime Minister has done more than any in this place at any time to damage the sovereign risk assessment of this nation with the measures she has brought into this place and with her bungling, constantly, of these measures. That is the risk in the way this Prime Minister has dealt with these matters.


Take another project: Chevron's Gorgon project, which I am sure the shadow minister at the table will speak about, adds a $64 billion net boost to Australia's gross domestic product in 10,000 direct and indirect jobs. That is one of the other agreements that sits in the queue, that will now be held up by this Prime Minister's histrionics. The anticipated state and federal government revenue is about $40 billion.


But it is not just investor confidence that is shot. Australians do not have confidence in this government to run an immigration program with integrity. The government's inability to get anything right, especially on our borders, demonstrates that, when the Prime Minister says that Australians will get the jobs first, the Australian people do not believe her, because they do not believe this Prime Minister can implement policy.


We have had the debacles from day one with this Prime Minister and her predecessor, and this country does not trust this government to get things as important as this right. Australians are not confident that this government can implement the agreement. That is what caucus themselves have resolved today as to this minister, this policy and this government's ability to deliver that policy—a vote of no confidence in the government's ability to meet this agreement. I only have to refer to the ACTU fact sheet itself, which I would table, which goes into great detail about the government's inability, already, to police the overseeing of 457s and abuses that occur.


The other promise the Prime Minister made was that there would be increased scrutiny for these arrangements. Yet that does not gel with what the minister knows and what the department's officials said at Senate estimates last week. When Senator Waters asked:


You said that that existing monitoring program will be extended to EMAs. Will there be any additional officers or resources to cover that new area of responsibility?


the answer was:


That will be covered within the existing number of inspectors and resources.


There are no additional resources, additional staff, that the minister has allocated in this budget, in this process, to monitor the implementation of this agreement. Yet the Prime Minister is standing before the Australian people and promising that there will be increased scrutiny. But that is not backed up. It is just more hollow words. Is it any wonder that investors are increasingly looking at this country, and this government—there is nothing wrong with this country; but there is everything wrong with this government—and seeing one thing: sovereign risk, and that will not change until this government is voted out of office and we can have investors investing in this country with confidence, knowing the rules will not be changed.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (15:25):  I welcome this MPI because it is actually an opportunity to talk about something positive. As I said at question time, at last we have the opportunity, the occasion, where the opposition support a government policy—and yet they cannot bring themselves to be positive about it.


This is about managing the strength in the Australian economy. We hear a lot from the opposition, talking down the economy, and we just heard it again from the shadow minister, which I will come to in a second. Remember the minerals resource rent tax? It was 'a dagger to the heart' of the Australian minerals industry—'a dagger to the heart', we were told, of the Australian economy. And then there is the carbon price. That is going to end Australia being a first-world economy, according to the opposition. That is going to end Whyalla, and we are no longer going to be a developed economy.


Now we have the member for Cook saying it is 'sovereign risk'. Well, perhaps sovereign risk is the reason why we have a half-a-trillion-dollar investment pipeline in the Australian resources sector. Perhaps sovereign risk is the reason why Skills Australia estimates we will need 89,000 more workers in the resources sector by 2016 compared to 2010.


This does provide some challenges for managing this economy. Many of these projects of course will be built in the next couple of years—as the member for Groom, who is at the table, very well knows, as the shadow minister for resources. Many of these will be built in just the next few years: 2012, 2013, 2014. So the demands on our labour force will be very strong indeed.


It is important we get this right. The resources sector contributes 39 per cent of Australia's exports—eight per cent of GDP. Each additional job in the resources sector creates three more jobs. Every job created in the resource sector creates three indirect jobs. So if skill shortages put a handbrake on any of these projects, if skill shortages mean that one of these projects cannot proceed, then the ramifications are very significant indeed.


Let us go through how we got to this point. The National Resources Sector Employment Taskforce, chaired by the now Special Minister of State, recommended enterprise migration agreements in 2010. The budget announced them in 2011 and, in September 2011, I announced the guidelines. I said earlier that Roy Hill made its submission late last year or early this year; the member for Cook said 'pre-Christmas'. Discussions began last year. It was submitted formally in February. So that is in relation to Roy Hill.


The biggest challenge in this investment pipeline is not the carbon price; it is not the mineral resource rent tax; it is not sovereign risk. The biggest challenge in ensuring these projects proceed is access to labour, to ensure that they finish on time and on budget.


Take the Roy Hill project. This $9.5 billion project will employ, in construction, over 8,000 people. It will produce 55 million tonnes of iron ore each year for 20 years. Its current financing is the largest debt financing occurring on the planet this year. When people are looking at this project and deciding whether to finance it, deciding whether to be involved, they look at things like whether it can be finished on time and on budget. What they look at is whether there is some assurance about the skilled labour they need to finish it on time and on budget. EMAs are designed to manage this risk upfront. Any business can apply to sponsor a 457 worker, and if that application is in order it will be granted. Large construction projects regularly sponsor 457 workers. This is well known throughout the economy.


Enterprise migration agreements are designed to manage workforce needs upfront after rigorous labour force analysis to determine what the project will need, how many extra workers it may need and an agreed way forward. The principle of an enterprise migration agreement is to say to a firm, in this case Roy Hill, or to a project: if you cannot find enough workers we will give you these 457 visas. In relation to this project we have said: if you cannot find enough workers you will get 1,700 457 visas over three years. That means they must employ at least 6,700 Australians on this project. They must employ that number of people under this enterprise migration agreement. That is why this is a big win for the Australian economy and a big win for Australians looking for work in the resources sector. In addition, if this project fell over—if the financiers said, 'We can't be guaranteed of its ability to be completed on time and on budget'—there could be 2,000 ongoing jobs lost. In return for the certainty that the government has provided through the enterprise migration agreement, we have required Roy Hill to agree to 2,000 traineeships, 200 apprenticeships and 100 Indigenous training places. 


This is a very substantial win, not only for jobs but also for training in the Australian resources sector. Two thousand Australians will have the opportunity to get trained in the resources sector, and 100 Indigenous people will have the opportunity for training in construction. We have negotiated a particular emphasis on mature-aged workers for the apprenticeships so that people who are affected by structural adjustment elsewhere in the economy—whether they be in the eastern states or Western Australia—or have lost their jobs can have a chance at a new career, a new opportunity to work in the resources sector.


It is important that this 1,700 figure be put in some context—1,700 is a lot of people, but we need to put it in context. There are at the moment, give or take, 90,000 457 visa holders in Australia. There have been 13,250 granted in Western Australia this year. So, these 1,700 people need to be seen in the context of 457 visas that are issued every day. Those 90,000 457 workers in Australia make up 0.8 per cent of the 11.5 million workers in Australia. I make these points because they go to the relevance of the 1,700 figure. For 1,700 457 visas we have been able to guarantee a project of 8,000 employees. This is a $9.5 billion project, a project which will produce 55 million tonnes of iron ore each year and produce those export earnings each year for Australia. That is good news and you think the opposition would welcome it. You would think the opposition would support this being implemented and not be so negative at every opportunity.


This is something the government has been working on since the Special Minister of State made that recommendation in 2010. Guidelines were issued, consultations occurred with trade unions and the sector about the guidelines, and then, of course, there was an investigation of this particular project. Let me make it very clear, because the opposition goes to the old who dunnit—the old question of who knew what, when and what did you know and when did you know it? That is all they are interested in—the intrigue, the politics, the point scoring. Let me make this clear—



Opposition members interjecting—



Government members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  Members will be quiet and the minister will be heard in silence.




Mr BOWEN:
  The opposition wants to hear this, but they don't really want to hear it. It is important. I made it very clear. I said it in question time and I will say it again. I will say this: of course, there was consultation across offices; of course, my office worked with other offices. The first detailed briefing for the Prime Minister was early in the week of 21 May. The first detailed briefing from my office for the Prime Minister on the details of the Roy Hill application was early last week and I am advised that she was provided with that on Wednesday. Those are the facts. So if you want to know when the Prime Minister first knew the details of the Roy Hill application, it was early last week. Very, very clearly that is a fact. The opposition can run all sorts of conspiracy theories and all sorts of claims, but that is a fact. The first time the Prime Minister of Australia was briefed in detail was early last week. I have said it; she has said it; and that is the fact. They can run any sort of argument they like, they can make any sort of claim they like, that is the fact.



Mr Morrison interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Cook will cease interjecting.




Mr BOWEN:
  It is not important who knew what when, what is more important is that 8,000 jobs are being created in the Pilbara. People who work in Western Australia or anywhere in Australia will have the first opportunity to apply for those jobs. Those 1,700 jobs will only be available for 457 visa holders if the operators have not been able source Australian employment.


My department will regularly audit Roy Hill. It will conduct six-monthly reviews to ensure that local recruitment activity is emphasised as the first opportunity. And why wouldn't Roy Hill want to employ Australians? Under the EMA, employing 457 holders is more expensive than employing Australians. We stipulate that market rates must apply and that the employer must pay the airfare to Australia and the airfare home when the 457 visa holder leaves. We make sure that that is not the course of least resistance. We make sure that employing 457 visa holders is available—it is an option—but it is not cheaper than employing Australians. That would be wrong. We are proud of the reforms we have made to the 457 visa program. We have increased worker protection. We have ensured that exploitation ceases. When those opposite were in office none of those protections applied. 


I note the Leader of the Opposition made a speech a couple of weeks ago where he said that this government has made it harder to employ 457 visa holders. He is wrong. We have not made it harder, but we have made it fairer. We have ensured that protections apply. When the Leader of the Opposition says, 'We'll make it easier,' I want to know which protections is he going to rip up. Is it the English language requirements? Is it the protections against exploitation? Is it the requirement that market rates be paid? What are the conditions that this government has put on 457 visa holders that the opposition is going to rip up? 


If the member for Cook is the minister for immigration one day, what proposal is he going to make to change the policy on 457 visa holders? That is what the Australian people deserve to know. There is great interest in 457 visas. People want to know what protections are in place. They know what protections are in place under this government. They know what measures are in place to ensure that Australians are employed first and that 457s are only used as a last resort. Let's see what they would be under the opposition. Let's make that clear. You have plenty of time: tell us what your policy is. 


Enterprise migration agreements are something the opposition do not like because it is good news—good news for Australian workers, good news for the Australian economy. They do not like talking about good news; they have always got to go to the political pointscoring.



Mr Ian Macfarlane interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  The member for Groom says he's loving it. I'm glad, because he is loving the creation of Australian jobs, if that is the case, because we are seeing a big project proceed that otherwise would not proceed.


This government will continue to ensure that a well-managed skilled migration program, whether it be permanent or temporary, creates jobs. A skilled migrant to Australia, whether they be permanent or temporary, can create jobs, not take jobs away from Australians. But it is important that we get the program right. It is important the program be well managed. It is important that an enterprise migration agreement be carefully considered. That is what this government did over many months. That is why the guidelines were issued in September, after consultation with the trade union movement and with the minerals sector.


There are some people who say that the enterprise migration agreements have too many protections in them. There are some people in the resources sector who say that. There are some people in the resources sector who say that I and the Minister for Resources and Energy have put in too many protections for workers. I do not agree. If they do not think that the enterprise migration agreement is for them, that is their right. It is available to them. But this government has ensured that protections are in place, that the enterprise migration agreement must be justified and that the enterprise migration agreement is calibrated to ensure Australian jobs are created. That will continue to be the case under this government. We will continue to negotiate with resources projects to deliver enterprise migration agreements which ensure that these projects can proceed and that unemployed people or people looking for an opportunity for a career in the resources sector—whether they be in the western suburbs of Sydney that I represent, whether they be in Queensland or Victoria, whether they be in Western Australia—have an opportunity for those jobs. It is an opportunity for the nation which we cannot afford to let go to waste. That is why we will continue to proceed with enterprise migration agreements and that is why we are very pleased that we have been able to announce in-principle agreement on the first enterprise migration agreement. For the opposition to talk about sovereign risk when we have delivered this enterprise migration agreement shows that they are only interested in political pointscoring when we are interested in creating jobs for Australians.

"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom) (15:40):  I am greatly heartened by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship's closing comments that other EMAs will proceed. It will be great when he actually delivers this one, despite the efforts of others on that side of the House this week and of those who support those on that side of the House.


The energy and resources sector is a crucial sector for Australia. It is crucial to the economy but, just as importantly, it is crucial for creating employment. It employs tens of thousands of Australians not just in Western Australia, not just in Queensland, not just in New South Wales, not just in Tasmania or South Australia or the Northern Territory, but also in Victoria. Many of those workers participate in the resources industry directly by flying in and out or by living in the resource regions, but almost as many if not more people—and the minister has said that for every one resource job there are three others, and I suppose that is right—actually benefit from the resource industry by creating services and goods for the industry to use.


So I was heartened when I heard on Friday morning that this EMA was being put in place. I thought, 'Finally the Labor Party are delivering something for the resources sector.' They have introduced a mining tax and, just as the industry was starting to digest that, they introduced a carbon tax—bigger than any other mining industry anywhere else in the world will have to face. Then just recently in the budget they introduced a withholding tax. I thought: 'Despite the fact that the government have done more to break down Australia's sovereign risk profile and done more to make sure we get less of our share of the investment dollar'—and we have seen Australia fall under the government, from getting 22 per cent of world investment in the resources sector to 15 per cent, and there is a very clear reason for that—'this time they had got it right.' Well, I would never want to play football with these guys. I played a bit of football in my younger days. There they were, the try line is wide open, the minister passes the ball to the Prime Minister, she drops it on the ground, they form a maul and then she kicks it into touch! There is a golden opportunity blown. 


What we did not know at the time was that in that maul were the unions and the members of the Labor Party on the backbench who were not happy with this good news story. They wanted to see these projects stopped. They did not understand that these 1,500 workers would create jobs for 6½ thousand Australian workers. Because without these 1,500 people with those special skills that we cannot supply in Australia this project just will not happen. So, again, we saw something that could have been good for Australia completely messed up. That opportunity to improve the sovereign risk profile of Australia, once in this government's lifetime, was blown completely. We heard the assurance from the minister at the dispatch box that this is only the first of many EMAs, and I hope he is right. I hope so for the sake of Australian industry and for the resources sector and for Australians themselves who will rely on these EMAs to ensure that other projects—whether it is the Galilee Basin or another iron ore project or Gorgon—get up. This minister, though, has yet to deliver his first; he is yet to actually get it put in place.


Today we see from the caucus that the Labor Party has formed yet another committee as it seeks to portray the resources sector as something separate from the rest of Australia and as something that has to be harnessed in and tightly controlled—to form more committees and more oversights as if the resources sector is some sort of competitor to the rest of Australia. In actual fact, it complements Australia, it supports Australia, it creates wealth, it creates jobs and it gives this government money to spend. But I must admit I should have said 'waste', because that is the way Labor parties are: tax and spend, tax and spend.


We need the resources sector to continue growing. There is a window of opportunity out there. There are literally hundreds of billions of dollars worth of projects that need to proceed. They are getting jarred by a series of bad decisions by this government—




Ms Owens:
  Like this piece of nonsense.




Mr IAN MACFARLANE:
  Sorry, I did not hear that.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  Order! The member for Parramatta will not interject and the member for Groom will not encourage interjections either.




Mr IAN MACFARLANE:
  I think the member for Parramatta is suggesting that the EMA is a piece of nonsense. I am supporting the EMA. I am supporting the minister. I know there are some on that side, and maybe the member for Parramatta is one of them, that do not support the EMA, that actually want it stopped—there are a whole stack of them over there. If the member for Parramatta wants this stopped, perhaps she will stand up and at least out herself.


The reality is that the Labor Party generally see the resources sector as simply a cash cow, something that can be taxed at every opportunity. When they had the chance to actually do something right, the Prime Minister bungled it again—a simple, straightforward EMA announcement. She knew all about it. I knew all about it and I am not even in government. I knew what was happening. I had been briefed by the company. I had read it in the newspaper. I have seen the terms of reference. I knew what was going on. She knew what was going on. Yet in a meeting with the unions she got completely spooked and rattled and destroyed a golden opportunity for this government to give one crumb of confidence to the resources sector in 4½ years. One little crumb to demonstrate that they, the government, knew exactly what they needed to do if these projects were going to succeed—and they absolutely blew it.


We now have ourselves in a situation where, whilst the minister says this agreement will be finalised and implemented, we are not sure because we do not understand the oversight role of the committee that has been announced today. We are not sure that, if there is another EMA put forward, the conditions will be the same. There has been no deed signed for the EMA that was announced last week, and the confidence of the sector is slowly ebbing away.




Ms Saffin:
  Rubbish!




Mr IAN MACFARLANE:
  The member for Page says this is rubbish. I suggest that she spend a little bit more time with the resources sector, like I do. Every week I talk to the resources sector. I respect her knowledge on a number of subjects but I suggest she needs to spend more time talking to the resources sector and hearing what they say.


What we need is a government that can not only manage the economy, which we know it cannot, but can actually manage policy. This government cannot manage policy. The moment they get one policy that is almost right, that is what the resources sector is asking for, the interference comes into play and the confidence of the resources sector is sapped away. We see on one hand the minister trying to support a great Australian in her project, and the affiliates she has in that project, while we see the Treasurer of Australia trying to tear that person down as some sort of elitist. If that is not a confusing message I do not know what is. This class warfare that the Labor Party engages in simply is another knock—



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr IAN MACFARLANE:
  I am waiting for your interjection—I can easily build on that.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Chifley will not interject.




Mr IAN MACFARLANE:
  It would be good if he could do a decent interjection, but he is not contributing to the debate so I am going to proceed. The knocks that those on that side of the House continue to make to the resources sector—a carbon tax, a mining tax, a withholding tax, class warfare—are continual hurdles to the Australian resources industry moving forward. What we need to see is the Labor Party actually get one thing right for the resources sector. Just one thing: put it in place, stand by it, sign the deed and say, 'The conditions for the next EMA will be exactly the same as this one,' so that there is some certainty, some predictability, some confidence for a sector which underpins the Australian economy and provides wealth for all Australians.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (15:51):  I always enjoy the contributions of the member for Groom. His final thoughts remind me of the day the Leader of the Opposition came to my electorate—it was the Monday after the government announced the detail of its carbon price and all that goes with it including the compensation. He decided he would visit Wambo mine, owned and operated by Peabody, in my electorate. He was there to tell the whole world, including those who live in my electorate, that the carbon price was going to bring the coalmining industry to a halt—it would destroy the coalmining industry—only to learn that while he was on his feet scaring the workers Peabody in the United States was announcing a multibillion-dollar takeover of Macarthur Coal. That is how concerned they were about the future of the coalmining industry in this country.


People listening to this debate this afternoon, whether they be in the gallery or listening on the radio in the car or at home—and I am told that there are still some masochists around that do these things—may have thought that this was a debate about the resources sector and the use of foreign workers at the Roy Hill mine in the Pilbara. But of course it is not, and anyone who listened to either the member for Cook or the member for Groom would know that now only too well. All they really said were two things. First of all, they said they agree with our policy. They agree that enterprise migration agreements are a good thing for the resources sector and a good thing for the country. That is unequivocal. They made that very, very clear.


Second, they attacked the Prime Minister over process. That is the big point they were trying to make today. In other words, they are not here talking about opportunities for the nation; they are talking about opportunities for them. I am not here to talk about political opportunism; I do want to talk about opportunities for the nation, opportunities that are presented to us by the mining boom and, just as importantly, how we maximise and capitalise on them and of course how we spread the opportunity of that boom and how we make sure that all Australians have the opportunity to benefit from what is happening in the resources sector in particular. And that is of course what the 2012 budget was all about.


EMAs, the enterprise migration agreements, were announced in the 2011 budget without much fuss. The announcement got very good publicity because everyone agreed, including the opposition, that that was exactly the sort of thing we need to be doing in the face of the resources boom to manage the capacity and constraints we are up against, particularly in skills and labour. They are ensuring that we can cater for that peak demand when the labour market just cannot provide all the workers the resources sector needs from time to time. It makes sure that valuable resources projects can proceed regardless of those capacity constraints. 


Of course 457 visas, the visas used to bring in foreign workers when it can be demonstrated that the skilled labour simply is not available at any given time in Australia, can be used with or without these migration agreements. But these agreements allow us to better manage the process. They allow us to talk to the company before the applications are made about how many 457s they might need but, more particularly, about the basis on which they will be used to ensure that the pay and other conditions of the workers involved are exactly the same as those which apply to Australian workers so that companies cannot exploit the situation and bring in foreign workers at the expense of Australian workers to save money. They allow us to manage these peaks in demand well ahead of time. 


In the case of Roy Hill, it is a very simple proposition. They are developing a $9.5 billion project which will require 8,000 workers, most of them skilled—engineers, electricians, plumbers, you name it—creating 8,000 job opportunities. But the company says, 'We do not believe, having tested the labour market and as much as we will try, that we are going to be able to get 8,000 people.' So based on sound advice and research, the government says, 'We will let you apply for up to 1,700 or thereabouts 457s to allow you to meet that peak demand.' What that means for anyone in this chamber—at least on this side who can do the simple maths—is that there are still more than 6,000 jobs which will go to Australians. So you can not have the project and have no jobs, or you can have the project and allow temporarily 1,700 foreign workers to come in while creating 6,000 Australian jobs and, in addition, 2,000 training places, including, I think, 200-odd apprenticeships and of course opportunities for Indigenous Australians. It sounds like a pretty good idea, but I do not really need to labour on it because the opposition have made it abundantly clear that they think this is a good idea, and we welcome their support for it.


Of course we are not just doing that in terms of our planning and management for the mining boom; we are also investing $3 billion in addition in skills to ensure that we do not have another decade like we had under the former Tory government when we did not anticipate and plan for the mining boom. If John Howard had properly anticipated and planned for the mining boom, we would probably not be bringing in 1,700 workers, because we would have taken the opportunity many years ago to skill enough people for these sorts of resources projects. But we are doing this concurrently to ensure that those mistakes are not made again.


Both the member for Cook, and the member for Groom to a lesser extent, spent a lot of time talking about sovereign risk. It was a bit offensive, because they were talking about it as if no-one on this side knew what that meant. I know who is causing the sovereign risk here. It is those who sit on that side who are trying to undermine the very agreements which they support, again, for no other reason than political opportunism. 


I suspect the member for Groom in particular, and of course the member for Cook, have probably never had to raise in excess of $9 billion for a resources project, or any other sort of business for that matter. But if they have a think about it for a while they will see that it is not just a matter of picking up the phone to the local bank manager. It is far more complex and far more difficult than that. When you go to the equity funds, the banks, the private investors or whoever it might be, they do almost excessive due diligence. If you are going to invest big money in these projects, you want to know what the risks are. You do not have to be an award-winning economist—like we have on this side of course, and I do not name him because I can never remember whether he is the member for Canberra or Fraser; he is member for Fraser—to know that if you are sitting in London or New York and looking at Australia you know straightaway to ask, 'Aha, it is a $9 million project requiring 8,000 workers. Where are they going to get them from?' They will identify immediately that there is a big risk involved in this project unless those presenting the project have already taken that into account, can prove that they have taken that into account, and can prove that they have found a way of dealing with this problem. Big tick. That is what this is all about.


Gina Rinehart and others can much more easily provide peace of mind for those with concerns if they have one of these agreements. They no longer have to say, 'Well, we think that we will be able to apply for and secure 457 visas.' They no longer have to rely on a lick and a promise. They can now present one of these migration agreements to the potential investors and say: 'It's signed off. The government has agreed. We'll provide 6,000 Australian jobs, but they'll let us temporarily bring in 1,700 foreign workers so that this $9.5 billion project can proceed.' It does not get any simpler than that.


Very quickly, the member for Groom wanted to know what the caucus committee is going to do. The government decision is made. It is a done deal. The caucus committee want to participate in these matters, and so they should; they want to be diligent to make sure these things keep working well and make sure Australian workers are protected and that is exactly what the caucus committee will do.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:01):  I am very pleased speak on this matter of public importance about the uncertainty created by this Gillard government on handling the Roy Hill enterprise migration agreement. It is interesting that I should follow such a garbled response by the member for Hunter. I will endeavour to make it far clearer to the people who might be listening to this exercise out there. 


As a proud Western Australian, the resource rich state that my electorate of Canning lies in, I spend a lot of time flying back and forth across the Nullarbor. Sadly, it is one of the downsides of the job. But a curious thing happened on the plane going back to Perth last Thursday night. I was sitting on the plane amongst my colleagues and others, as I often do, and there was the Minister for Resources and Energy, the Hon. Martin Ferguson, sitting just behind me to the right, busily engrossed in paperwork. I thought this was a bit strange. Why would we have the member for Batman coming to Western Australia, seemingly unannounced, deep in the study of his paperwork, particularly when there was a reasonable movie on about whales trying to break through the ice at the North Pole, which was what most other people were watching? The member for Batman, the Minister for Resources and Energy, was sitting there with the member for Brand. Of course, there were other ministers in this government on that plane.


It did not dawn on me until I read the paper and saw the news the following day why the minister for resources was in Western Australia. It was all very secretive to us, of course. The information eventually was revealed. There was one of the anti-Gillard supporters, a Rudd supporter, over in Western Australia on behalf of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, colluding to make an announcement which would embarrass the Prime Minister. The member for Brand, Gary Gray, who I think is a very honourable fellow and liked by both sides of this House, was also there as part of the announcement. And why would the member for Brand not be there, Mr Deputy Speaker? He is on the record, as reported in the West Australian yesterday in an article headed 'Labor urged to stand by worker scheme', as saying:


Mr Gray, the Special Minister of State, conceded yesterday that failure to communicate the arrangement to Ms Gillard had undermined the selling of the policy.


The article went on:


Mr Gray said EMAs were needed because there were not enough skilled workers.


Those were his own words.


Why is the member for Brand so behind this budget? We know he was behind this before it was announced in the 2011 budget. In fact, he was part of the organisation of these EMAs from 2010 on. But why is he so interested in seeing these EMAs working in the Pilbara? Let us have a look. There are two reasons. Firstly, unlike most of those people on that side of the parliament, he has actually had a working life in business. He was a consultant to Woodside before he came into this place, so he understands the resources sector and the constrictions and the foot on the throat that is put on the ability to get some of these projects up. He is somebody who understands very well. And, secondly, the member for Brand has the highest number of fly-in fly-out workers in a metropolitan electorate in Western Australia. How do I know that? Because I have the second highest number of fly-in fly-out workers in a metropolitan electorate in Western Australia. It is very important to us that we look after our constituents, and that is exactly what the member for Brand is doing. 


Why are EMAs important? As the member for Brand has said, we cannot get enough skilled workers. One reason we cannot get enough skilled workers is the Rudd government in 2007 and pressure from the unions. The details are all there. This government in 2007 said to the union movement, 'We know you don't like 457 visas, so we will allow you to inject yourself into the approval of 457 visas and the whole policy behind 457 visas so that you can take some control of it.' Why would they do that? Because the 457 visas are not unionised. They do not belong to the unions that they would like to have in the North-West, so the unions did all they could to knock them off and stop them coming into this country. The unions are essentially the gateway: they had to pass the unions before they were given permission to sign on. 


The problem is Western Australia is desperately short of workers. To give you an idea, in my electorate at the Newmont Boddington goldmine—which is going to be the largest goldmine in Australia, even bigger than the open cut in Kalgoorlie where they produce 850,000 ounces of gold a year—the mine manager, Tony Esplin, the other day said to me that on any week they are short 200 skilled workers to fill vacancies in their mine. They are not fly-in fly-outs, they are drive-in drive-outs from around my electorate and other parts of Perth. So there is a huge shortage of skilled workers in this country. Have a look in the North-West. Why are there fly-in fly-out people? 


I will give you an example. Today I was informed that every couple of years around Karratha they have a land lottery. Anybody who builds a house up there has to build the most basic of houses because of the shortage of land and the cost of building houses, which is well over $1 million, and you can get $5,000 a week for a four by two in Karratha. It is just prohibitively costly to house people up there.


I am a person who began his working life in a mining town called Wickham. I was a school teacher in the mining town of Wickham, which has the Cliffs Robe River port and ore refinery. In those days, people came from all over Australia and many people came from the rest of the world, but they did not have to go through this restrictive practice of getting through the union gateway. At the moment, there are many projects up there where they are not only short of workers but the cost is becoming prohibitive. The other day we heard Jac Nasser from BHP say that Australia is becoming one of the dearest places to do business for a whole range of reasons, and one of them was not only the industrial laws but the supply of skilled workers. This was backed up by Labor's own consultant in Rod Eddington, who said exactly the same thing. He thought that the Labor Party's policy on providing skilled workers and the industrial relations laws were stopping development in this country.


In the last few minutes I have available to me, I will look at how the Labor Party has bungled this. We see this as a great scheme. We have so many other projects throughout the north-west that desperately need these sorts of workers. These projects qualify for the program: the $43 billion Gorgon project, the $14 billion Pluto project, the $18 billion Wheatstone project, the $5.4 billion Sino ore project, the $5.2 billion Oakajee port and rail infrastructure project, the $2½ billion Extension Hill magnetite project and the $2.3 billion Worsley refinery growth project in my own electorate. These, and more, would all qualify under this scheme.


We are talking about this today not because we disagree with EMAs but because of the bungled way that this Prime Minister has handled the issue. First of all, she denied it. Michelle Grattan said in her article yesterday:


In Parliament, Ms Gillard did not deny she had told union officials on Friday she did not support the agreement for 1700 foreign workers for the Roy Hill development and that she had not been informed about it.


Depending on which day you get to the Prime Minister, you get a different story. The board that is now going to be created through cabinet is policy on the run. This is symptomatic of a dysfunctional government. Everybody, including those on the other side, is questioning the judgment of this Prime Minister to tell the truth, to get it right and to reflect the policies and the will not only of her party but of the Australian people.


Why am I getting phone calls from a whole range of people saying: when can we get something done about removing this dysfunctional Prime Minister from the parliament? We know that the member for Hunter, the immigration minister and the resources minister are all part of a cabal who want to see this Prime Minister off. This was just a tricky little ploy to undermine the Prime Minister. They have been caught out and she has been snookered by the whole affair. (Time expired)

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:11):  This debate should be about opportunity. This is a $9.5 billion project, requiring the single largest raising of funds on the planet. It is part of a massive investment in the Australian economy. It will create close to 7,000 Australian jobs—2,000 of which will be permanent, high-paying jobs for the 20 years plus life of this project—with billions of dollars of locally sourced construction investment and $20 million spent on training. That is the opportunity we should be discussing today. There is opportunity for Australians, for businesses, for workers and for the country.


But, for those opposite, there is only one opportunity that they are interested in, and that is their own. This MPI reflects their own opportunism. It is always about them; it is not about average Australians. This is not an opportunity to undermine confidence and it is not an opportunity to spread mistruths. It is important to outline some facts concerning the total number of 457 visas in this country. In the 2011-12 financial year, there were 56,010 457 visas granted to 30 April 2012. In Western Australia, this figure is 13,250. I understand from the department that, on current trends, WA will have the highest number of 457 visa grants out of any state or territory.


On Friday, the minister announced that the first enterprise migration agreement, EMA, would go to the Roy Hill project for up to 1,700 out of 8,500 jobs attached to the construction phase of that site. That 1,700—it is worth noting—equates to 12.8 per cent of the 457 visas in Western Australia and three per cent of 457 visas for the entire country. It is important to put that into context.


Regarding the whole process itself, in July 2010, as has been outlined to the chamber, the now Special Minister of State brought down the National resources sector employment taskforce report, which made a recommendation for enterprise migration agreements. In March, Ministers Evans and Ferguson tabled the government's response, which included in-principle support. This has been worked upon for some period of time. The Treasurer outlined in his budget speech last year that the government would implement EMAs. It was welcomed at the time as being a common-sense and important policy for the country. In September last year, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship released the guidelines and consulted with key stakeholders, including the ACTU. In November, there were active consultations with the Roy Hill project and unions about the shape of the EMA. It is important to recognise that this EMA will address skill challenges that are confronting the country. Skills Australia predicts that an additional 89,000 workers will be required in the mining sector by 2016. It is worth noting that we heard a lot from those opposite about sovereign risk and about how this agreement would undermine the mining sector in this country. Yet, if this were a sector under risk, if this were a sector that was worried about its future, how could it plan for nearly 100,000 people to be employed in a sector which is ready to invest $450 billion in the resources sector? If you think that that is risk, I do not know what your definition of risk is when you look at how strong the resources sector is for this country.


I have to declare an interest. My dad came to Australia, in part, as a result of a sort of EMA. He was part of the post-war migration where Australia was hungry for skills. There were big projects on the boil which placed major labour demands on the country, and he got to work on the Snowy Mountains Scheme. I am a big fan of EMAs. I have seen the way that they have worked in this country by providing for local jobs and by bringing in skills and talent to make our economy and our country strong, and this approach makes sense. Most people get the common sense very quickly. Projects like this one, worth $9.5 billion, will create big labour demands of their own. Big projects will provide a massive jobs boost for many locals. Over 6,700 will get the opportunity to work. But what happens when you cannot get people to fill the spots and what happens when a $9.5 billion project cannot find people to fill the spots—




Mr Perrett:
  When capital is scarce.




Mr HUSIC:
  and when capital is scarce, as the member for Moreton rightly raises? As has been pointed out, you set up a project-wide labour agreement, custom designed for a particular project like this one, negotiated with the project owner as this was, which sets the terms by which overseas workers will be engaged as they should be. It will be available to resource projects with capital expenditure of more than $2 billion and a peak workforce of more than 1,500. It is all set out in the facts sheet available on Immigration's website. It is all spelt out there. I thank the member for Parramatta, who brought this to our attention today. I follow her Twitter account and that is where she posted it today. You are able to see for yourself, in fact, what we have been doing, and it has been out there for ages. It is straightforward stuff.


I want to draw the House's attention to what the opposition said a few days ago. The member for Cook was talking to Andrew Bolt and said:


Well this project needed to get a guarantee of supply of labour in order to secure its funding. So the first 6,000 jobs, remember this is going to create about 8,000 jobs—


The member for Cook is actually selling this project quite well—


6,000 of those will go to Australians under the agreement the government has approved. So we have never had a problem with Enterprise Migration Agreements—


never had a problem—


and ensuring that our mining and resources sector has the certainty …


And then, in a couple of days things changed. When they sniffed that there might be an opportunity to cause mischief, suddenly the member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition, created all sorts of attempts to jump on this issue.


It is worth making the House aware of—and the member for Cook should probably pay attention—the previous government's 457 rules. Remember, they brought in 457s because the RBA had been saying for ages that the economy was threatened by capacity constraints, particularly skill shortages, which the opposition—the then government—did nothing about. So they put together the 457 process because they could not actually deal with skill shortages in this country. Remember this: under their rules, Roy Hill would have been able to sponsor semiskilled workers without consultation—no consultation with unions—without paying market wages and without formal skills assessments. That was their 457 approach.


Do the coalition actually intend to reverse our reforms? Will they retain market wages safety nets that are a feature of our regime and will they provide a guarantee against foreign workers undermining working conditions and competing unfairly against workers? These are important questions, which I suspect will never get answered because they are never interested in policy; they are only ever interested in politics. As I said, they think that this is an opportunity for them to find division instead of solution and to bag and carp instead of coming up with their own ideas. They only ever really want to create mischief by seizing on the concerns of unions.


As I said, the member for Warringah was talking about Aussie jobs but, when they needed to actually support Aussies in getting trained and meeting the skills need, they were not there. The architects of Work Choices are now the defenders of Aussie conditions. I have seen it all! It is like Colonel Sanders defending Weight Watchers. I love seeing the way these guys operate.


I certainly get that unions would want detail and would want protections. I will draw the House's attention to the comment of the CEPU's National Secretary Peter Tighe, who said:


We have to accept that there are massive projects in the pipeline, worth $300 billion to $400bn, and this country has shortages in filling the skills needs. … Australia has been bringing in people to fill skills shortages since World War II.


As a union our job is to ensure we have a say—


which they will get—


that the people coming in are properly tested—


that is right—


accredited and that we have agreements that also guarantee apprenticeships and the upskilling of the existing workforce.


EMAs are terrific for our economy and country and should not be the subject of political opportunism. (Time expired)

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2012-05-29,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (16:21):  I rise today to talk about the uncertainty that is being created by this government in the handling of the Roy Hill enterprise migration agreement. I believe this is another classic example of just how divided and dysfunctional this government is. We like the EMA. We like the thought that 8,000 new jobs will be created in Western Australia. We like the fact that $9.5 billion is going to be created. Keep in mind, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I come from a very robust area in Central Queensland, where we have $70 billion worth of gas projects going on at this stage. We are bringing in workers on 457s from Ireland, New Zealand and many other countries in the world, including Germany, France and England, so we are well used to having overseas workers doing jobs in our state of Queensland.


But a lot of these projects that are on the drawing board are exactly that—on the drawing board. They cannot wait until our side of the House gets into government so that we can rid of this noxious carbon tax and the MRRT. They know that we are only around the corner from being in government, and they have put just about everything on hold and are waiting for the next 12 months until they go.



Mr Lyons interjecting—




Mr O'DOWD:
  Do you know what? The way you blokes are going, it might not even be 12 months. Keep in mind that we did not cause the mischief over this EMA; it was you blokes yourselves who caused it.



Government members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  Order! Members on my right will cease interjecting.




Mr O'DOWD:
  Let me get on with it, please! Do not take the resources industry for granted. It may not always be there. In only 2002 you could have bought a house in Blackwater for about $7,000 or $8,000—if you had the guts, but a lot of people did not, including me. The coal days were numbered then. That same house today would probably be worth about $500,000 or would be getting you at least $2,000 a week in rent. That is how things can change.


I had to laugh at the member for Hunter talking about how we go about borrowing money on big projects, as though we would not know. But it is all overseas money on big projects. When you are talking about $8 billion, $10 billion and $70 billion, it is not Australian money; it is overseas money and normally Chinese money. On a lesser scale, our banks even today borrow 30 per cent of their money from overseas to look after housing and small business. Small business is getting a bit of a hiding at the moment too, and they are finding it very hard to borrow money. Just ask the cattle man if he got to borrow money for buying stock. It is very hard to get money. You need very good cash flow and you need assets to back it.


The mining industry is faced with a lot of uncertainties today. We in Australia are the largest exporters of coal. Going back to 18 years ago, would you believe that our neighbour Indonesia did not export any coal? Today Indonesia is the biggest exporter of coal in the world. It exports well over 30 per cent and we have dropped to under 30 per cent. Our miners in Australia today face a lot of hurdles. It is not only the MRRT and the carbon tax. We are now looking down the barrel of these new shipping costs. We are an island nation, and of course we have to ship most of our products by sea. This really pertains to Rio Tinto in Gladstone, Weipa, Tasmania and New Zealand. If the shipping costs on top of each other break them down, not only does the Gladstone production break down but Weipa breaks down, Bell Bay in Tasmania breaks down and so does New Zealand.


So that is what the industry is facing today. There must be certainty. If you talk to big mining companies who look like coming to Australia—and I have recently spoken to a big company, the second biggest company in the world—they say, 'We can give you a list of 10 good reasons we could come to Australia, but we can also give you a list of 30 reasons why we shouldn't'. That is what we mean about certainty. They want certainty before they will come to Australia because there are big development costs involved in setting up, whether it be for gas, iron ore or coal, and this government has not been able to deliver it.


That was in the Prime Minister's statement. She is trying to run with the hounds and hunt with the fox. She is trying to run with the union but, on the other hand, she wants to keep in with those big miners—the Rineharts, the Twiggy Forrests and the Clive Palmers. Two weeks ago in this House, the government were saying what horrible people the big miners were. They were shockers; they were out there. Clive Palmer actually saved 1,000 jobs in Townsville, in the refinery. Gina Rinehart, one of the most successful women in the world—probably the most successful—invested her dollars wisely, worked hard and has been very successful. But they were no good. All the big industries that come to Australia, companies like Queensland Alumina in Gladstone and Queensland Cement, now Cement Australia, are the worst polluters in the world—and the government tell them that.


How do we give these industries coming to Australia confidence that we do want them? They create good jobs and they create well paying jobs. Our miners are the best paid miners in the world. Our gas workers are the best paid gas workers in the world. I wish someone from the other side of the House would go up to my area today and sort out the dispute between BMA and the unions, who are on strike in six coalmines. BMA have actually closed down Norwich Park in the last month. Five hundreds job there have gone. What are the government doing? Have they gone to sleep at the post? I think they might have.


As I have stated before in this place, Australia is becoming less and less attractive to investors, and this is what we have to do something about. We are all for the migration scheme itself. We are all for giving jobs. In fact, in my area we could not exist without the immigration of skilled workers and also unskilled workers. Unskilled workers play just as big a role in my area as skilled workers do. There is a citrus plantation in Emerald which employs 500 South Pacific islanders in a year. That plantation could not operate without those workers from overseas; I am talking about Tongans, Fijians and Samoans. They do a fantastic job. Without them it would not work.


Pig farmers currently bring in 457 visa holders to work in the pig industry. Mundubbera and Gayndah use Pacific Island workers and also backpackers. Backpackers play a very big part in our economy all around Australia. When I had a pub I used to rely mainly on backpackers for workers. I went to a very remote pub in my electorate, a place called Cracow. I walked in there thinking I was going to find the publican, but I found two Irish girls. They had been running the pub for 10 months and they looked like being there for another 10 months. That was the only staff that publican could get because in the meantime he had bought another pub not too far away.


It is essential that we have these migrant worker programs. To say we are against jobs is just wrong. We love to see people working. We love to see industry thriving. We like to get out of their way, get our hands out of their pocket and let them get on with getting the resources out of the ground and getting them sold overseas.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (16:30):  Once again, I am rising to speak on one of the more unusual matters of public importance that you would see in this parliament, an MPI about something both sides of the House agree on and an MPI about something that the government committed to over a year ago and has worked for in consultation with unions and business.


The opposition themselves said earlier today they were widely briefed on the enterprise migration agreements and that they agreed with them. The government has just announced one. There is a government commitment to it and yet we have an MPI about it. It is not an MPI about how good it is—and it is a good thing—but an MPI about somehow there is uncertainty about something both sides agree on and something that the government has committed to and spent a year developing.


This should be quite unusual but, unfortunately, it is not. The only uncertainty that comes into this issue comes from this MPI itself where, once again, we have the opposition getting up and trying to spread as much fear as they can, trying to give the impression that things are not as they should be and that people have the right to feel afraid. Again, let me repeat: the enterprise migration agreements are something both sides of this House agree on, something that has been worked on since Gary Gray chaired the National Resources Sector Employment Taskforce back in 2010 and something that was announced in May 2011. Now, a year later, the first of the major enterprise migration agreements has been announced. The government is committed to it and we have an MPI of this nature.


But the silliness goes further than that. The first speaker, the member for Cook, was talking as if he had discovered a whodunnit. Who did it? Did the butler do it? But there is no body here. It is hard to have a whodunnit when there is no body. You can speculate as much as you like about who might have done what to whom but there is no body here. The enterprise migration agreements are government policy. We have announced the first one. We are committed to it. It was an absolute nonsense of a speech.


The member for Groom introduced a whole new conspiracy, that somehow the fact that the resources minister was flying to Western Australia must be something to do with a leadership challenge. That is one of the most extraordinary ones I have ever heard yet. The resources minister flying to Western Australia—where there are mines, where there is gas, where there is iron ore, where there is coal, where there are resources—might be something to with something other than the fact that he is Minister for Resources and Energy and Western Australia is full of resources. What nonsense. And then the member said that the minister was flying to Perth on a public plane in the seat behind the member for Groom, in secret. A secret flight on a public plane in full view of everyone to a state with lots of resources? Wow, it must be a conspiracy. There must be something wrong going on here. But this is the length that the opposition has to go to in trying to make this MPI stick. Both sides of politics agree on this enterprise migration agreement issue. In order to make the MPI stick, they have to invent a whole range of things. They have also said that we have been happily abolishing 457 visas, and yet there has been 56,000 of them to April this year.


This is a ridiculous MPI. It is absolutely ridiculous, particularly when we are absolutely the government of jobs, absolutely the government of growth. There is a pipeline of half a trillion dollars in investment flowing into this country. It is the biggest flow of investment into this country that we have ever seen. It is of massive proportions, extraordinary proportions, and the opposition says that is a sign of how badly we are doing. We are doing so badly that we have got the biggest investment pipeline that we have ever seen flowing into this country. That brings with it absolute challenges.


A resources boom has within it its own barrier to growth because it grows to a point that it needs skilled labour that it can no longer get. It actually eats up the available skilled labour quite quickly. It has its own capping mechanism if governments do not work with the various sectors to ease the way for growth. This government has been doing that. We are the government that created over 700,000 new training places. We are the government that has been investing in trade training schools. We are the government that is making it possible for people to go to TAFE and to get HECS style funding. We are the ones that have given additional funding to universities. In my electorate alone, we have seen a 17 per cent increase in the enrolment of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. We are the government that did this.


I sat on that side of this chamber for the last three years of the Howard government and I listened time after time to the reports of the Governor of the Reserve Bank about the fact that the previous government did not invest sufficiently in skills. I sat there and watched the Howard government introduce the 457 visas without the appropriate protections. I saw the exploitation. I heard from people in my electorate who had been employed on those visas as they were, who were being paid near slave wages, who had their passports confiscated and who were in fear of being immediately deported if they complained. I saw that. We all saw that. We saw how badly the Howard government responded to the resources boom and the needs that there were for a skilled workforce.


They failed to train Australians, and they failed to respond to the needs of the sector; instead they allowed a 457 regime that was so easily exploited and which, in parallel to Work Choices—which drove down Australian wages—allowed the standards of Australians to be undermined by underpayment and by low standards under the 457. We are the government who are committed to making the 457 visa system work. We are the ones who sat down and made sure that businesses employing workers from overseas were doing so on the same conditions as Australians. We were the ones who introduced the rules that made that system work. And we are the ones who realised early on that for these extremely large-scale projects you need a one-on-one approach to negotiating how the workforce issues will be dealt with in the long term.


The enterprise migration agreements are incredibly good at that. They recognise that in boom times like this we have massive construction needs, which are essentially short-term jobs, and that the need for skilled workers will peak extraordinarily but then, as the project is completed, will settle into a lower number of long-term, good-quality operational jobs. We are the ones who recognised that we need to negotiate one-on-one to smooth those bumps out for companies for projects like the Roy Hill.


This enterprise migration agreement does all of the things that we would expect it to do. It ensures that the Roy Hill project provides training for Australians—real training for real jobs—for the long-term jobs of Australians. It ensures that Indigenous people are catered for, that there are real jobs for the Indigenous people living locally. It ensures that there are over 6,000 Australian jobs on this project—that is a lot of jobs. But it does allow the Roy Hill project to bring in the workers for the construction phase, within a certain band of skill level so that the construction can go ahead, because that needs a massive 8½ thousand workers.


This is a good agreement. It is an agreement that protects the interests of Australians. It is an agreement that makes sure that workers who come in from elsewhere in the world are employed on the market rate and at the same conditions and standards that Australian workers are working on. It ensures that the company pays the costs for those workers to get to and from Australia. But it also guarantees that the company is investing in training Australian workers for the future, and making sure that the local Indigenous people have a place to share the benefits of this project.


It is a good agreement, and both sides agree that it is a good agreement.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2012-05-29,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (16:41):  As I was saying yesterday evening, when I was abruptly terminated, the committee has the ability to publish options on improving the consistency of research in the area and information on developing leading standards in the protection of water resources from the impacts of coal seam gas and large coalmining developments. This is probably the big issue in being able to protect the aquifers, and at the same time allowing agriculture to continue doing what it does very well and the gas to be extracted. The committee provides the environment minister and relevant state or territory ministers with expert scientific advice on coal seam gas and large coalmining development proposals that may have a significant impact on water resources, and it provides other advice in whatever circumstances.


The background of it all is that while the technology to extract gas from coal seams has been long in existence, it has only been in the last decade and a half or so that development has actually occurred in our country of Australia. Currently, around 90 per cent of Queensland gas is supplied from CSG operations, and it represents approximately 10 per cent of Australia's total gas production. The industry is in the process of growing; in Queensland alone it is expected to deliver 18,000 jobs and around $850 million in royalties per year.


The federal government will also benefit from a substantial increase in income and in company taxes. There has been considerable public debate, as there would be, around CSG operations and the environmental impact, with groundwater resources being a key concern. But issues relating to water table preservation and the protection and integrity of aquifers need to be addressed. That is the prime issue. The establishment of the committee would add independent expert input into the debate. The coalition believes the committee is a positive step towards improving public confidence in the environmental integrity of the industry.


There is one proposed amendment to the bill. The bill states that each member of the committee except the chair is to be appointed on the basis that they possess scientific qualifications that the minister considers relevant to the performance of the committee's functions, including but not limited to ecology, geology, hydrology, hydrogeology, natural resource management and health. The coalition proposes that, as the committee's fundamental reason for being is to advise on scientific issues relating to water associated with CSM and coalmining, the bill should require a majority of the members to have advanced qualifications and expertise in the key fields of geology, hydrology or hydrogeology. That is a very important issue.


While this bill is about the establishment of a committee to provide scientific advice to governments on relevant coal seam gas and large coalmining projects, access to land by CSG operators is a very significant issue to the farmers on that land. In addition, there is a significant concern that farmers are not receiving fair compensation for access to their land and a share of any profits. Obviously farmers must get compensation for surface interference and everything that goes with it, but this is very different to ordinary mining, where the company tends to buy at a very good price the land the mine is actually on and buys a buffer zone around it. Ordinary mining tends to resolve itself, but coal seam is different because they do not buy the land. They are probably there for 15 years, or maybe 20, so they are not going to buy it. So the interference is permanent. It is there for 15 years or so. It is very real.


There are three priorities which we need to balance. One is the water. We have to get it right. We have to make sure that coal seam gas is not going to have a major impact on our water resources and destroy the environmental and practical values of our productive capacity. We know there is still much about our underground water that we do not know, so we have to not make hasty decisions that we will regret. We need to look at the impact on farmers and farming land. On the water, I have spoken to the drillers—not the exploration companies. I mean the people whose livelihood revolves around their ability to drill and pass that information back to their employer. The drillers believe they actually can preserve the aquifers by their knowledge and their actions, and we certainly need that to be the case. Many of the farmers who are outspoken in the media just want the coal industry to stop; they just do not want it to happen. Yet in widespread consultation with farmers it is apparent that many are happy to accommodate the coal seam gas industry as long as their interests are not compromised and they are compensated. I believe they need to get a share in the profits.


The third and final issue is that Australia has ongoing energy needs which must be met and that coal seam gas, if handled properly, can help reduce our emissions, amongst other things, but at the same time we are talking about agricultural land that cannot be replaced. They are not making any more of it. They are making a lot more people, and agricultural land needs to be here forever.


None of these issues is easy, and good policy to address them will take time and continue to be refined, but we are abrogating our responsibilities if we just say no or yes because it is too hard to actually solve the issues. Hopefully this committee is a step in the right direction and can lead to a robust policy outcome, but it will not actually solve the issue. At the end Australia needs both farmers and exploration, but farmers must have their water protected and they must have a say in how that happens.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-05-29,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (16:49):  I listened with interest as the shadow minister for climate action, environment and heritage delivered a compelling and thoughtful speech on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill 2012 last Wednesday. With even greater interest I watched the reaction to the address by the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, who was at the table. The minister nodded with seriousness. He appeared as if he cared about and agreed with what the shadow minister said. It is a serious matter. There is bipartisan acceptance of the establishment of this coal seam gas committee. There is an amendment to this bill calling for members of the committee, except the chair, to be appointed on the basis that they have scientific qualifications that the minister deems appropriate to the performance of the committee's functions. This is a sound proposal.


I have previously seen Minister Tony Burke give a performance similar to last Wednesday's. I saw him listen and nod in the machinery shed of Benerembah farmer John Bonetti on 22 October 2010, just eight days after as many as 7,000 worried Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area residents—men, women and schoolchildren too—turned out at the first big Murray-Darling Basin Authority meeting at the Yoogali Club, Griffith. I saw him do the same, as well as taking copious notes, at the MDBA  community meeting at the same venue on 15 December 2011 after  the unacceptable draft plan had been announced on 28 November. This time, 12,000 people turned up, including the MDBA chairman, Craig Knowles, and the opposition leader. The reception the minister and the MDBA received was vastly different to that afforded Tony Abbott.


The MDBA obviously did not take heed of what was said that day, as only yesterday the states learned that the authority is pressing ahead with its intention to strip 2,750 gigalitres of productive surface water from our farmers. That is a big number. It is an especially high figure for farmers affected by both the basin plan and the contentious coal seam gas issue. But we probably already could and should have guessed that the revised draft basin plan number would be 2,750 gigalitres, equivalent to five Sydney Harbours. We should have figured it out when the Treasurer, who does not know the first thing about either farming or agribusiness and, worse, does not care, announced in his 8 May budget that $941 million of Murray-Darling Basin infrastructure money had been deferred to 2015-16. We should have realised it when money for buybacks was still very much left on the table.


The unacceptable 8 October 2010 basin guide, which became the unacceptable draft, has now morphed into the unacceptable revised draft which has been put to the states. I hope New South Wales and Victoria reject it out of hand for the disgrace that it is and for the contempt it has shown regional people who have put down tools, closed the doors of their businesses and stopped their tractors to attend community information meetings. New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries Katrina Hodgkinson has already rightly labelled the revised draft an insult to all.


The Independent member for New England yesterday queried the 12,000 attendance at that 15 December water rally at Griffith; he could not believe so many turned up. But that was the figure quoted by the local newspaper, the Area News, as well as the Daily Telegraphand the Land and the Mayor of Griffith, Councillor Mike Neville. Given that Griffith's population is 22,000, excluding the villages around the city, that is a remarkable turnout. That so many shut their shops, left their farms and went to show their support says a lot for the passion of this community and their need to have water security into the future.


The minister, who sat in this chamber last Wednesday nodding in agreement with our shadow minister about this legislation, will have the final say on the basin plan. Let us hope that, for the farmers' sake, for the nation's sake and for his sake, he makes the correct decision in the interests of our ability to feed ourselves and others into the future.


There are many in rural areas of northern New South Wales and Queensland who are just as committed to a balanced outcome in the coal seam gas issue. They, too, have turned up in large numbers at various meetings, including one in front of the New South Wales parliament on 1 May this year. Concerns about coal seam gas led members of the Country Women's Association to join thousands of protesters at the rally. NSW CWA President Elaine Armstrong from Oura near Wagga Wagga in my Riverina electorate, said the issues surrounding coal seam gas mining were so important that they had inspired the group to march on Sydney for the first time in its 90-year history.


This bill also has an important water component, one which must be put as the highest priority in any consideration about any coal development for the long-term sustainability of prime agricultural land and the environment. The independent expert scientific committee's role will be to provide scientific advice to governments on relevant coal seam gas and large coalmining projects and to commission and fund water resource assessments for priority regions.


In recent years there has been much public debate around coal seam gas operations and the effect they have on the environment, with groundwater resources being a chief concern. The federal coalition's position is a balanced approach for a coal seam gas industry, which has taken off with support by state authorities, whilst acknowledging that it is imperative to ensure Australian food security and fair rights for landholders. Issues pertaining to watertable preservation and the protection and integrity of aquifers must be addressed.


The environment and water minister has appointed an interim committee to give advice on coal seam gas and large coalmining awaiting its formal establishment by this bill. One sincerely hopes the committee does a far better job than the highly paid members of the independent authority who failed to achieve a Murray-Darling Basin Plan with a triple bottom line. Ask anyone in Griffith, Coleambally, Leeton, Deniliquin or Shepparton today what they think of the MDBA and I am sure you will get an angry response.


The government has allocated $150 million to resource the activities of this coal seam gas committee. An additional $50 million has been reserved for allocation to states by the committee as inducements to implement its recommendations. The committee has wide-reaching powers, as you would expect. These include: advising on research goals; advising on bioregional assessments in areas of high potential risk from coal seam gas and/or large coalmining projects and giving advice to the federal environment minister on priority assessment areas; advising on research and bioregional assessments commissioned by the minister subsequent to the committee's advice; publishing options on bettering the researching in this issue; and information on developing the very best protection of water resources from the effects of coal seam gas and large coalmining developments; providing the minister and the relevant state or territory counterpart with expert scientific advice on coal seam gas and large coalmining project proposals which may have a high and lasting impact on water resources; and providing other advice deemed appropriate and necessary.


The Land's Canberra correspondent Colin Bettles recently wrote an excellent series of articles detailing how Australia could learn from the coal seam gas experience in the United States of America. In the past 15 years thousands of coal seam gas wells have been drilled in the Powder River Basin, home to the US's biggest coal deposits, in southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming. As Bettles reported, for local ranchers it meant a share in rich royalties—if some interruptions to their agricultural operations. But now gas prices have tanked, mining companies are backing off and landowners are left with the legacy.


One of the telling quotes in Bettles' series came from Wyoming farmer Ed Schwartz, whose message for Australian farmers was:


… to get a tight water surface use agreement in place, before any mining activity starts.


“Make sure they reclaim the land, make sure they put up a sufficient bond to protect the water wells and don’t let them dump this water on the ground because if it’s salty like the water is here, it will kill the soil rather than improve it,” he said.


His son Troy said:


… the time it would take to repair the damage to critical land and water assets on his family ranch, caused by coalbed methane mining over the past decade, could take several lifetimes of his children and their grandkids—even with no more salt water running over it.


For many in Australia's coal seam gas regions, the horse has already well and truly bolted. However, this committee, if it undertakes the desired role, will certainly have an important part to play in ensuring environmental concerns are satisfactorily met on future developments. Given the amount of exploration and investment, the committee will—should—indeed be busy.


The economic benefits of the coal seam gas industry are now being realised across Queensland. The industry just gets bigger and bigger, and there is genuine and understandable concern about groundwater systems and surface water systems. We just heard from the shadow minister for agriculture, food security, fisheries and forestry, who made some pertinent points about the growth and value of coal seam gas in Queensland, and about our limited understanding of underground water systems.


Coal seam gas development requires a comprehensive policy approach which addresses the environmental, community and economic impacts of the industry. A measured, rational and balanced approach to the industry and its management is needed and is vital. Managed correctly, with proper safeguards in place, coal seam gas has the potential to revitalise parts of regional Australia. I know my colleague here, the member for Maranoa, is well aware of that, because it has brought great benefits and investment to his region and it delivered a new economic boom. Poorly managed it could become an environmental and social nightmare for the Commonwealth—certainly for the people who live in affected areas—and for the nation's future and that of our Great Artesian Basin. No coal seam gas development should proceed where it poses a real and lasting threat to the quality of groundwater or surface water systems. It must be crystal clear that no coal seam gas development should take place unless it is proven safe for the environment. Prime agricultural land is an increasingly important natural asset. It must be preserved and protected from activities which destroy its capacity to deliver food security not only for Australia but for a hungrier world, particularly in this Asia-Pacific region, for generations to come. Australia can play a key part in feeding the world as Asia booms.


Global food security is sure to be among the top issues most likely to lead to serious international conflicts over the next decade. There is a widening gulf between world food supply and demand. Worldwide demand for food will escalate dramatically in the coming years as the world population hurtles towards and beyond nine billion while limited resources of arable land and fresh water will become even more meagre.


The Prime Minister said in a groundbreaking speech to the Global Foundation Summit in Melbourne on 3 May that 'Australia must be ready to act as the food bowl of Asia' into the future and that we need to 'strengthen irrigation'. To do what the Prime Minister rightly says we need to do as a nation and supporter of Asia and the Pacific Rim, we must not enforce a man-made drought on our farmers through poor water policy decisions and we must get the issue of coal seam gas right.


Coal seam gas development must not be allowed to occur close to existing residential areas. People who have bought a home—their biggest lifetime investment—with a reasonable expectation of being away from mining operations must not have their lives turned upside down by coal seam gas operations springing up on their doorstep. Landowners are entitled to satisfactory pecuniary returns sourced by reason of access to their land. Remuneration for landowners should not be restricted to compensation. The regions which deliver much of the wealth from coal seam gas developments deserve to see a fair share of generated revenues reinvested in their communities.


There is an opportunity to grow our nation and encourage a lasting legacy from finite coal seam gas developments. The environment must be protected, as must the economic development imperatives of regional Australia and the legitimate rights of landowners. Unless regional communities are engaged as partners and have something meaningful to gain from the development of the coal seam gas industry, they will not support it, let alone on their land. Why would they? Without winning widespread support from regional communities, coal seam gas development will not proceed.


The need to earn a social licence is a reality with which the coal seam gas industry and governments must come to terms. State governments have primary responsibility for the approval and supervision of the coal seam gas industry, and the role and efforts of state governments in dealing with this issue are recognised. However, the stakes are so high for regional Australia that federal leadership is mandatory—something the Gillard government has lacked in so many areas, not just coal seam gas.


For regional Australians, it is acknowledged that coal seam gas presents both opportunities and threats. We must ensure the benefits of this emerging boom take into consideration the environment. That means finding a fair and necessary balance between the needs of mining companies, landowners and communities. Meeting those needs and spreading the benefits will smooth the way to underwrite support for the industry and guarantee it delivers regional Australia and, through it, the nation a lasting legacy far beyond the 35-year life of a coal seam gas well.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2012-05-29,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (17:03):  I respect the previous speaker, but doesn't he realise that his party stands for the exact opposite position of all of the moral issues that he raised in his speech? I feel as though I am in a lunatic asylum insofar as the cutbacks in the Murray-Darling are going to reduce a lot of his towns to ghost towns. They were little tiny towns of 300 or 400 people before the irrigation came through. You are going to take eight million megalitres of irrigation and reduce it to five million megalitres. I fear for what is going to happen in inland New South Wales. I went there, and it is very relevant to the coal seam gas issue because the contamination of the underground aquifers is very real.


I think that I am the only person in this place who has ever worked down mines. I worked my own mines. I put my own gelignite at the coalface, blew it up, and mucked out with a shovel. The thing was in the development phase, and you can afford to do that sort of thing in the development phase. I was floating my own mining company before I went sideways into other things. But I worked at the Mount Isa Mines as a labourer at the coalface. I would also like to think that my scientific knowledge is reasonably adequate.


If you release hydrogen sulfide or methane gases, when they mix with water, they become poisonous. I spent half my life looking for copper sulfate. When you are looking for a copper ore body, you look for the ore that is below the watertable. That is invariably sulfides, and copper sulfate is a poison. Every copper ore body in the world is a copper sulfate ore body. There are one or two exceptions, but I think it is a fair call. The watertables that they sit in by definition are contaminants. They are mild acids.


I love to promote my book! People do not know about their own country. Inside the Great Dividing Range there were no kangaroos—there were no Skippys—there were no goannas and there were no people, because there was no surface water. In my homeland in the mid-west of North Queensland, west of Boulia, which is almost on the Northern Territory border, there was a stream that ran for 80 kilometres: Spring Creek. The Great Artesian Basin surfaced there. We dug holes in the ground and took the water out east of Boulia, between Boulia and the Great Dividing Range. So we now have maybe 10,000 or 20,000 kilometres of waterways in that area between the Great Dividing Range and the Northern Territory border. We now do not have an 80-kilometre river out there. It was not much use because it did not rain much and there was nothing much living out there. But when we put that water back this way, where there was rainfall and beautiful soils, we had this highly prolific grazing area which grazed a lot of Australia's sheep and was the biggest grazing area for cattle in the country. But what happens if that aquifer is contaminated? And they are drilling through it as we speak. Let me explain this to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I am probably the only person here who understands this. When you drill down and hit hydrogen sulfate, methane or any of these gases they come up the pipe. There is sheathing when you drill. There might be a bit of contamination. You put bore casing down—whether it be plastic or metal—and it prevents that contamination from getting into the aquifers. They are drilling through the Great Artesian Basin now. It costs a lot of money to drill. These holes cost $2,000 a foot. They would not be doing it without knowing that the methane and other gases are there to access. Righto, it is protected when the sheath is there. But anyone in mining knows that the ground moves—and I am not talking about tectonic plate shifts. When the ground moves, it will wear out or buckle those plastic or metal sheaths. If you have got hydrogen sulfate coming up, then you have got acids coming up. If you have got any sorts of sulfates, you will have acids. No matter what metal the sheath is made of, it will be worn away. If it is made of plastic it will buckle and eventually wear out. So at some stage you are going to contaminate the aquifer.


You might say, 'What's a couple of holes?' Well, in Queensland there are 55,000 applications so far. God gave a wonderful resource to our country. This was a land that no-one wanted. The Portuguese knew about it in 1504 when they were in Timor, and, in 1624, Carstensz wrote a full report about it to the government of Batavia. But it was such a dry, hungry country that no-one wanted to come here. Even when they did come here, all they sent for the first seven years were convicts. The only reason anyone came here was that they found some gold here. Up until 1900, that was the only reason anyone came here.


But when we were drilling for gold and other things, we discovered this underground water supply called the Great Artesian Basin. Without that supply, there would be no cattle or sheep inland from the Great Dividing Range. We would lose it all. Our inland rivers are so inconsistent that we cannot rely upon them to supply water for our stock. So what is now a great resource that feeds maybe 15 million or 20 million people—from the cattle and sheep that come of that area—will be feeding nobody. We will have destroyed that great resource the good Lord has given us. God will say: 'I gave you this resource. What did you do with it?'


The previous speaker spoke about the Prime Minister saying we want to be the food bowl of Asia. I mean, I wish someone would get their feet on the ground here! We will be importing tomatoes from China. Do not talk to me about it. Go and talk to Frank Costa, the biggest seller of fruit and vegetables in Australia. He owns the Essendon Football Club, amongst other things. Go and talk to him. We will be importing tomatoes from China. We import prawns from China. We import seafood from China. We are importing apples from China. We are not going to be the food bowl of Asia; we will be a net importer of food from Asia. But do not listen to me. Go down to the library and get the statistics out.


But how are we husbanding those resources? We had six million hectares of the most beautiful land on earth. You can farm it for seven years and not use any fertilisers. We had a research place at Richmond for about 15 years. For seven years they farmed it. In the final year they had no results whatsoever from putting fertiliser on it. That is how rich this soil is. So what are we doing? Six million hectares has been taken over by the dirty, filthy prickly tree, which was introduced by us. Human beings introduced the prickly tree and it has destroyed everything. The little dunnart—a cute little fella that is like a mini-kangaroo—is doomed because it cannot survive the prickly tree.


Instead of going forward and irrigating on the banks of our rivers to protect them and build them up and stop these terrible seeds from getting away every time there is a flood and being carried out and out and out, we have done absolutely nothing. Our banks are eroding away into the Gulf of Carpentaria—and now we are drilling holes through the greatest asset this nation has! The greatest asset this nation has is not coal. Coal will run out in 30 or 40 years and there will be replacements for it. The greatest asset this nation has is not iron ore. Iron ore will run out in 30 or 40 years and other countries will be producing it anyway so it will not be worth a great deal. The greatest asset this nation has is the artesian aquifer. But nobody is saying, 'Stop, you're not to drill a hole through the artesian aquifer.'


I am the only one here with the experience to know that, if you drill a hole through there, you will pick up poisonous gases all the time. Methane, hydrogen sulfate and all these poisonous gases come up. As long as the plastic sheath, the bore casing, is there it is all right. But the bore casing is not there forever. I mean, nothing is forever anywhere. All the great buildings of the world are ruins today—the Parthenon, the Colosseum and the pyramids. All great buildings wear out eventually. We are dooming and condemning this area and putting it in question. What for? Where is the benefit to this nation?


The previous speaker said that there had been a benefit in the member for Maranoa's area. It is like a sugar fix: you get a lot of energy at the start of the game. But I would not want to be the coach. If your State of Origin team have a sugar hit, they will play terrifically in the first 10 minutes but there will not be much left in the tank for the next 30 or 40 minutes—that is for certain. And that is what is happening here. I have lived with four generations of my family—and, if you include my kids and grandkids, seven generations—in the mining fields of Australia. The Katter side of my family went to these towns before there were towns there. And on the other side of my family they perished chasing gold in the deserts.


Is mining a huge boon to a town? As I get older I wonder about the benefit of that. We have a huge shift, we leap forward and then we have terrible withdrawal symptoms afterwards. What happens afterwards is absolutely critical. Charters Towers was a bigger town than Brisbane. It did not just come down to a normal sized town; it was vanishing completely. A few things happened and we were able to arrest that decline, but the things that we did to arrest the decline vanished because we found gold. Everyone left the meatworks, to quote but one example, or left the railway to go and work in the goldmines. The gold has now run out and I have a town where 10,000 people have lost their jobs and we are in a very critical state. If we had not had the gold we would have been determined to keep open the meatworks and the hospital, and all of the other things we had. But we did not care much about that because we had this quick fix—a quick hit. As the previous speaker, the member for Riverina, referred to, it will not be there in the longer term, but the aquifers have to be there. 


I am all for drilling before you mine coal. The Americans did this. I speak with great authority. As the Minister for Mines and Energy—and, more importantly, as the minister for northern development—in the Queensland government, I heavily researched coal seam gas back in the eighties. Then it was not profitable, although there will be those that argue about that. 


The Americans extracted coal seam gas to make their mining safe—they heavily subsidised it—ahead of the mining, so that the dangers of mining were removed. And most of the coal seam gas in America really comes from that phenomenon of mining. I am all for doing that. If there are no aquifers I find it hard to say that we should not be extracting coal seam gas, but the minute there are aquifers, as the member for Riverina pointed out, the water that comes up is contaminated. Then you have to spread it out somewhere to get rid of it. It is all flat country; you cannot put it in a big hole somewhere, so it is a huge area that becomes contaminated.


Heather Brown, a wonderful Australian and one of our great fighters on this issue, pointed out that in her area there is going to be a huge bowl of dirty, filthy, contaminating, poisonous soup. She went there because this was a beautiful place to live and she was suddenly confronted. The neighbours—his father is one of my three best friends; we went around a lot of the country and the never-never—are in a situation where there is an authority over their land to prospect for coal and for coal seam gas. They cannot go forward. They cannot do anything with it because the banks will not lend any money because they do not know when a mine will open up there. And the miners will not tell them; they said it would be seven years before they make a decision. So the neighbours' lives are destroyed. They cannot sell the land; no-one is going to buy it with authorities to prospect or exploration permits over it. 


I do not want to condemn people or speak badly about people but you cannot get up in this place and speak on behalf of the opposition when you know they have done absolutely nothing and when the incoming Premier in Queensland is in love with coal seam gas. There are 55,000 holes; he is going to put 200,000 holes down. He is in love with it. So do not come in here and say these things, because your party represents the exact opposite view— (Time expired)

"Scott, Bruce, MP",Nats,2012-05-29,"



Mr BRUCE SCOTT
 (Maranoa—Second Deputy Speaker) (17:18):  I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill 2012 and to follow the member for Kennedy, who gave a bit of history of his own family and his background in western and central western Queensland. I welcome the opportunity to follow the member for Riverina, as well.


I can say that I too come to this debate with a great deal of experience, because my family lived in western Queensland long before many of the towns were even gazetted as towns. In fact, in the case of my own home town of Roma, my family went there prior to its being gazetted as a town. They settled there and I certainly grew up with an appreciation of the importance of water. My home town of Roma was where the first oil was discovered in Australia. In fact, it is still a very big hub for the natural gas that was discovered in our region.


So I come to this debate with an enduring interest, not only in the resource sector and what it can do for our regional economies but also in making sure that we get the balance right and get right the legislation and regulations governing the mining operations of the companies that extract this coal seam methane gas.


This Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill is certainly timely. I also acknowledge that it has the bipartisan support of both sides of the House. I acknowledge the member for New England who is here. He was raising these sorts of concerns in his area and, along with other people, I was one of those voicing protests in our own areas. 


I acknowledged, all the time, that it is the state governments that have the overriding constitutional responsibility for the regulation and operation of our resources. The Commonwealth has very limited powers, and one of the powers it has is in the approval process. Our interests are limited really to environment and biodiversity issues associated with mining approvals. 


So I do welcome this bill. It is important that this bill provides the support that we need to give communities confidence that these new developments—such as the open cut coalmining industry and the coal seam methane gas—are safe and that, as it moves into more closely settled areas, as opposed to the vast areas of the Cooper Basin in my electorate, it is sustainable, and that there is a much happier coexistence than we have seen as these industries have become established in the Surat Basin in my electorate. This bill will establish an independent expert scientific committee on coal seam gas and large coal developments. What I want to ensure is that when the panel is established it is not just loaded with scientists, because I can assure this House that if it is just scientists that make up this panel the communities will not have confidence in the committee. As well-meaning, well-resourced and well-credentialed as scientists may be, it is important to get a balance of people on this committee—as I believe it always is. It is important to include people who have an understanding of communities, of the environment, of the way the aquifers work and how they recharge, and, of course, of the importance of them to the people of the outback of Queensland and many parts of Australia. The Great Artesian Basin is not just in Queensland; it crosses into South Australia, the Northern Territory and New South Wales. So, when this panel is established, it is important that it has a balance of people, not just scientists, providing advice to the minister. It is important that we get the confidence of the communities, who have been a very strong voice of protest, and that we get the regulations right for the coal seam methane gas operations, particularly, and for the open coalmining operations as they move into more closely settled areas and prime agricultural land.


The coal seam industry in my region has been growing from the very early trials that they did in about 1995-96. It was Tri-Star, from America, that started to develop the method for identifying whether these coal seams would provide coal seam methane gas and how it would be extracted. Once they had established that it was possible they, Sunshine Star and a lot of other companies onsold a lot of their tenements to larger companies.


The other part of the problem in the establishment of this industry is that companies who had been granted tenements to explore for coal seam methane gas were taking for granted access to landholders' properties. They were cowboys. They were probably $2 shelf companies, with a computer in an office somewhere. They subcontracted to drillers. They believed they had a divine right to go onto landholders' land to look for coal seam methane gas, prove up a particular volume of gas in their tenement and then onsell it for a lot of money to a major company, who would then amalgamate the work that had been done by the subcontractors and cowboys—as we like to describe them in our area.


We had instances where these cowboys would just cut through people's fences and put old cockies' gates behind them, leave gates open and come in night and day, bringing vehicles onto properties that might have had Parthenium weed and other noxious plants that people spent hundreds of thousands of dollars controlling. The Commonwealth spent millions of dollars on control of these invasive weeds, and these cowboys did not have the respect that landholders had for this land.


Largely, I am happy to say, I think we have weeded out the cowboys and the regulations through the voice of protest. But we have seen what the previous government in Queensland and New South Wales have done—more particularly in Queensland, because I believe in Queensland we are much further advanced in the development of the coal seam methane gas industry than the southern states are. We are so much further advanced that quite a lot of the gas now that is used in cooking and power generation in Queensland comes from coal seam methane gas. In fact, 30 per cent of Queensland's gas consumption is from coal seam methane gas. I have two or three coal seam methane gas power stations in my area. One is a 125-megawatt plant at Miles, and another is a 750-megawatt plant in Braemar—combined-cycle, baseload coal power as well as peak-load coal seam methane gas power. It is very clean energy. When I see a coal-fired power station and a gas-fired power station, when it comes to the visual pollution, I would rather have a gas-fired power station than a coal-fired one any day. It is cleaner energy and there is less visual pollution in the landscape. Of course, when it comes to open cut coalmines, with the scar they leave on the landscape, as opposed to gas wells, there is no comparison.


I am certainly a great supporter, providing we get this right. We have to make sure landholders' rights are protected. I have family involved in this who are going to have gas wells on their property. I know their right to negotiate is absolute, but it has not been easy—notwithstanding the new regulations that are in place. So I come to this with family involvement in dealing with gas companies. I come to the debate having to deal with constituents with very real issues with the legacy left behind by the cowboys that were out there earlier, including pumping stations within 100 metres of family homes—things that are no longer allowed.


I will talk a little bit about the Great Artesian Basin because I have had a lot of practical experience in the Great Artesian Basin. On our own property we have had a free-flowing bore. When I was only a small kid we used to ride past this free-flowing bore in the winter on our ponies on our way to school. We would pull up and put our hands under the lovely warm water to warm our hands and then get back on our ponies and ride on to school. It sounds like it was a long time ago, and it was. But, after 56 years of free-flowing bores—the member for Kennedy, to his credit, did mention these free-flowing bores—that one stopped. Why? Because of the 4,500 free-flowing bores that went into the Hutton Sandstone and the Precipice Sandstone. When they were formed, 250 million years ago, the water just flowed down bore drains—98 per cent of the water was lost and two per cent was utilised. But the basin did open up the pastoral industry. It was seen as a way of developing the land out there, and it has done so. I am very pleased to see that since the mid-1990s we have had a program—funded by state and federal governments—to cap many of these bores. I would like to see that accelerated. I would like to think that we have a goal in the next five years of having every free-flowing artesian bore, from the artesian basin, capped. We can then continue to repressurise those bores. It will not run out in the near future but we have seen a third of them stop flowing since the first one went in, in the 1890s, at Bourke in western New South Wales.


The industry is important—if we get it right. This committee will have a huge responsibility in giving confidence to landholders, communities and members of parliament. This committee, this panel of experts and people with practical experience, are going to be a check in the state government's regulatory process for providing extraction permits.


In my electorate, coal seam methane gas extraction throughout the basin is going to produce something like 18,000 jobs. There is going to be something like $800 million worth of royalty money coming in every year to the state government, not the federal government. We need to make sure that this money goes back to development in those regions—for roads, social and health infrastructure or affordable housing. We need to make sure it is not just a transfer of wealth from the Surat Basin to our capital cities east of the dividing range. Those communities out there—local councils and small businesses—are under enormous pressure because of the goldmine mentality out at the moment. It is a boom.


I will describe the boom in another way. My home town of Roma is the epicentre of the Surat Basin at its western end. We have gone from one flight a day, from Brisbane to Roma, to six flights a day. In the last 12 months we have had up to 60,000 people flying through the Roma Airport. In the next 12 months 100,000 people are estimated to fly through that airport. It gives you some idea of the massive growth, the new wealth, that has come in. The subcontractors are getting a start in life. They are coming from many parts of Australia. 


But it has put enormous pressure on existing businesses in affording staff. That is why the 457 visa process for workers sponsored in by companies is an important element. It makes sure that we can keep those small businesses—the traditional businesses—in business and able to afford labour. They should not have to compete with what the resource companies are paying to source labour—so they can drive the coal seam methane gas industry—to get the developments online, on target, delivering LNG out of Gladstone by 2015 and 2016. That has been their imperative, but it has put enormous pressure on our existing industries. Part of the reason we had such a voice of protest from landholders was this imperative; part was the way that landholders were being treated. They wanted to get the job done. It caused a huge division across my communities.


The Longreach Leader today said that out of Blackall we have a mining company opening up the possibility of open-cut coalmines. Blackall and those western Queensland towns are old wool towns and many of them have halved in population since the decline of the wool industry. It is the resource sector that gives those country towns an opportunity and a hope that they can once again be wonderful towns and grow to their former glory of the wool days and get a new growth in population. It will be the resource sector in the Galilee Basin that will give those communities an opportunity to grow. (Time expired)

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2012-05-29,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (17:34):  I support this Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill 2012. I do no support it for plain-English reasons. I support it for making a substantial contribution to better outcomes in natural resource management—productive land protection and establishing science at the centre of planning processes for land use.


I acknowledge Minister Burke in the chair and the work that he has done, along with the member for New England, in getting this bill before the House. This is one of the key agreements to come out of a pretty brutal debate around mineral resource rent taxes and their worth or otherwise. Three agreements between me, the member for New England and government came out of those negotiations. This was one of them, alongside the establishment of a cabinet food, soil and water committee. It considers, through the GST distribution review, mining royalties and how they relate to and talk to tax reform generally and looks at the relationship between the Commonwealth and the state. We are still waiting for the supplementary papers from the GST distribution committee to see progress on that one.


Of the three agreements, this one is the first. This one is very important and talks to the heart of many communities. They are very vocal at the moment and are deeply concerned. They have fears, real or perceived, about the energy gold rush and its impact, both short and long term, on communities as a consequence of that. In my local electorate I have one particular community, the Gloucester Basin, which is being challenged by both coal seam gas and large-scale mining. Mining has been in Gloucester for some time on a relatively small scale. Gloucester has mainly been a farming community. It is a community that is at the head of the Manning River. It has about 300 tributaries in and around the beautiful Gloucester Basin that is at the bottom of the Barrington Range and the Barrington Tops. For environmental, lifestyle and food production reasons many people choose Gloucester as their home. They are deeply challenged, therefore, by proposals with regard to coal seam gas in the area. In the last couple of years, 110 wells have been proposed, with more to come. Of greater concern is a large-scale coalmine, 1½ kilometres from the centre of town. For local council planning purposes, the location of this particular mine is, on local council papers, for local environmental planning purposes. So there is a clash between state government land use planning of extracting a resource if it is there as the basic principle of state based land use planning and a council planning document that says, 'We're going to have a bit of development here, but here is an environmentally protected area.' The situation with completely opposite outcomes proposed by the council and the state is unsatisfactory and has the community deeply concerned.


The Gloucester community probably has about 2½ thousand people in it and nearly half the community turned out on a very cold evening to express their concerns about the New South Wales 'strategic' land use planning changes. A very strong view was expressed that even the new changes under the new government are completely missing the point and are really just embedding the problems that were experienced under the old regime in New South Wales, where, at the heart of planning was the view, as I said before, that if there is a resource it is the obligation of the Crown to extract it. For many communities, that is not what is at the heart of community and, for the long-term economic interests of Australia, that is not sensible nor strategic policy. Many are now seeing that with an expected nine billion people by 2050 there are threats around the world with regard to food security but for Australia enormous opportunities in food production. Whilst there is a recognition of this energy gold rush of the moment, the long-term story for Australia will, quite rightly, see a very strong rebirth of agriculture as an important contribution to the region around us and an important contribution to our standard of living through national economic outcomes. So we cannot 'cook' those productive lands to achieve a short-term benefit and do ourselves damage in the long term—that is the broad principle and starting point.


That is not to deny that there may be locations where mining expansion, coal seam gas, may have a place, but that is where the Commonwealth kicks in, that is where this particular bill kicks in, in making sure that those decisions are not made by vested interests, not made by political interests and not made by a state government of any political persuasion that has the mentality of, 'If there's a resource, we must extract it.' It is all about science, the best possible science we can find, and making decisions with regard to impacts on some pretty sensitive regions, not only the water but also the landscape and also—I am pleased about what we will see over time—issues of public health. All these things need to be taken into real and material consideration in making decisions about how we deal with this very sensitive clash between productive lands and the rush for energy.


I am very pleased that we are now seeing an independent scientific expert panel being put at the heart of decision making. I am also pleased to see the very sensible engagement with the states, and a key part of this is the development of national partnership agreements with the state. As we all know, from a Commonwealth perspective, land use and land use planning has predominantly been state based. They are effectively the owners of the land but the underlying principle of extracted oil costs, regardless of the long-term benefits of potentially not extracting in particular locations, is one that was not being heard. I think, therefore, the role of the Commonwealth in coordinating and enticing state governments to consider food security, water security and the protection of productive lands alongside considerations around energy and the extractive industries is an important step forward.


I am not sure whether we are there yet with all the states but we are pretty close. I am pleased that New South Wales have signed up. I do not see their logic at all, and I suspect they would not be seeing their logic in hindsight, in signing up to what is a pretty simple but effective approach to putting science at the heart of this process yet, within 24 hours, trying to release some other strategic land use planning process that they themselves have tried to establish and control, which, if you have seen any of the protests out the front of the New South Wales parliament, you will know has caused enormous community uproar.


My message to New South Wales once this bill is passed is to keep it simple: just use this. Make this the heart of your policy and the way out of the position you have put yourself in in trying to be, in my view, too clever by half. The protests that I and others have attended outside the New South Wales parliament were extraordinary. To see a coming together of farmers and environmentalists—a whole range of representatives of community interests—expressing deep concern at the loss of community as a consequence of getting this wrong should be a very loud and instructive message for us all. There is a way through and it is this bill. It is making sure that not only New South Wales but all states work very closely in cooperation and in collaboration with what is being attempted at a Commonwealth level. To have the Country Women's Association standing outside the New South Wales parliament for the first time ever in its 90-odd year history should say it all—that New South Wales has got it wrong. This bill has got it right. It is a difficult issue. It is one that has to navigate a path of cooperation through conflict and I congratulate the drafters in pretty well striking the balance.


I would also like to thank the many local organisations in my area who have been involved—the likes of the Manning Alliance, the Manning Clean Water Action Group, the Barrington-Gloucester-Stroud Preservation Alliance, the Gloucester Residents in Partnership and the Camden Haven Anti-fracking Group. It is arguably even more important to acknowledge the many individuals who are not aligned with any particular organisation, who have had signs up on their fences, who have been emailing—the very ordinary ones who do not want to protest and who do not normally want to engage in politics. These very ordinary people have done an extraordinary job in making sure this message is heard loud and clear around the country and have made it a priority issue on the agenda of all parliaments.


This bill reflects the concerns of farmers, homeowners, environmentalists, landholders and many others and, hopefully, now starts to get some sensible public policy. It should not act in isolation. I think public policy has a lot of things to consider deeply. For example, food security and the sort of strategy Australia takes—whether we should chase the idea of trying to feed all or start to shake the top end market of the Asia-Pacific and become a specialist in food security. There are opportunities in our strategy, but we need to think about it a lot.


Likewise, I do not think we have nailed water security and the issues around water yet. The Murray-Darling Basin issue is still up in the air. There are still issues being put up by the National Water Commission which are falling on deaf ears in government. There is more work to be done. The issue of soil protection is one that has not had its place on the public policy landscape as much as it could—probably because soil is a pretty, pardon the pun, dirty topic—but it needs its place. Our loss of topsoils globally is an issue of our time. It is an issue that this parliament needs to start taking seriously and needs to start contributing to not only domestically, but also internationally as we grapple with the loss of topsoil around the world. If science is to be believed and is to be trusted, this is an issue for the next hundred years if we do not deal with it. It is right before us; it is a complementary issue to water and food security. 


I am pleased we have got to this point. Now it is about locking all the states into the national partnership agreement and getting these bioregional assessments up and running. Now it is about securing the place of the independent science at the heart of any development processes from here. And now it is about really trying to get the states—in my case New South Wales—to see the worth of this, to use it for their own benefit and to make this the heart of public policy on this difficult but important issue for the states, including New South Wales, moving forward. I congratulate the minister at the table, Minister Burke, and hopefully now we can get some sensible direction on some challenging policy.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (17:49):  I want to thank everybody who has contributed to what has been an extremely good and a very constructive debate here in the chamber. I have not been able to hear all of it, but I have probably heard close to half of the contributions, either here within the chamber or from my office. There has been a really strong message from this chamber to industry generally and to the public—and this will not be lost on anyone—that the bill before us does not say that nothing should go ahead, but it does say that all decisions should be made on the best possible scientific information and that information should be available independently. 


When I was dealing with some of the environmental decisions on projects in the Darling Downs—the Surat Basin—I felt there was a need for ongoing adaptive management of some of these mechanisms and I established an independent scientific committee that would overlook them. When the mining tax was being discussed, the member for New England and the member for Lyne both argued the case strongly, asking, 'Why can't we provide the best possible information in advance of decisions? Why do we have to wait for the process of decisions having been made and get into adaptive management?' They came up with the suggestion to government that we have an independent scientific committee on an ongoing basis and we provide serious dollars to fund the best possible information. It is one of the best ways of dealing with the obligations that we find we have in our interactions with the states. In this bill we are not telling the states to change their standards. We are not telling them to change their timelines or their laws, but we are saying: 'If we're putting together a framework with the best possible scientific information, then please use it. Use it to inform your decisions, because no-one should be afraid of applying the best quality scientific information to environmental decisions.'


We also need to face the fact that we are dealing with an area that is unbelievably complex and where a lot is not fully known. I have had a number of discussions where I have been told that individual aquifers have no connection to other areas of underground water and then I get told by another set of scientists that they think they might be connected and others who say they definitely are. There is a high degree of uncertainty and a lot of information only becomes available as further research is done. By putting the serious dollars that are on the table attached to this bill and having—




Mr Katter:
  Minister, if I could just say—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  Order! The member for Kennedy!




Mr Katter:
  from Boulia—indicated that those aquifers are connected. There is no way you can get that water to run—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Kennedy!




Mr BURKE:
  I am very glad we allowed the pause. While the interjection might have been long, the point is really well taken. Because if something is not connected then you do not have a risk to underground water. But we do not want to undo all the conversations that are happening about water reform by finding that there is more water in rivers and we are just sucking the water back out through the system by depleting aquifers that are in fact connected. No-one wants that. The best possible scientific information is the best guard against that.


We have had good responses from a number of the state governments. I am disappointed that at this point the WA government is still saying, 'Absolutely no way'. But I am pleased to hear a number of members of the same party in the same state as the WA government—a number of members from the other side—who have spoken strongly in support of this. I hope they take that message to the WA government. No-one should be afraid of getting the best quality information—no-one.


I am also advised there was a contribution by the member for Groom, where he got stuck into decisions that I had made in a project in Queensland.



Mr Ian Macfarlane interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  I did not hear a word of it, but I have been advised to feel very hurt by what he said. So I would simply refer him to a letter to the editor that was published in the Financial Review yesterday where I dealt with similar allegations which had a similar level of accuracy to the ones that were made by the member for Groom. But I am sure the mistakes were entirely well meaning.


Can I commend the bill to the House. Effectively, as a result of what is in front of us today, there will be a much better quality of base level information, a much better quality of information dealing with underground water and the right set of experts across the full range that we would want to see of expertise. It will be well funded. It means future decisions will be well informed as a result of the decisions taken in the parliament this day.

"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom) (17:55):  I move the amendment circulated in my name:


(1) Schedule 1, item 4, page 5 (after line 2), after subsection 505C(5), insert:


(6) The Minister must also ensure that a majority of the members possess scientific qualifications and expertise in one or more of the following areas:


   (a) geology;


   (b) hydrology;


   (c) hydrogeology;


   (d) ecology.


As I said in my comments when I spoke on the bill, the coalition supports the establishment of this expert panel, and the amendment here is being supported by the minister. There is certainly no doubt that, as the member for Lyne just said, science needs to be at the heart of the process. Too much of the debate has been dragged backwards and forwards by statements that are less than accurate, to say the least. 


The most important thing in this process as we exploit those resources—which, as the member for Maranoa said, have the potential not only to provide jobs and income for the economy but just as importantly to provide jobs in communities which have seen an economic decline in the past—is that the community, the custodians of the land, in particular the farmers in Queensland and New South Wales and wherever else this industry expands to, have confidence in the process. There must be confidence in the process. We need to depoliticise the process. We need to take out of the process those things where those who for their own political gain are attempting to confuse the topic.


So establishing an expert panel, establishing the wherewithal behind that panel in the money that the Commonwealth is making available, is all part of ensuring that the community has confidence in this process. We do need to collate an absolute myriad information that is out there. Some of it is peer reviewed, some of it is not. Some of it is, therefore, accurate and some of it may not be accurate. We need to collate that information and where the deficiencies are identified in that information then do the research.


The coalition have moved this amendment, which, as I understand it, will be supported by the government. Our only aim in this is to ensure that that scientific panel has the very best expertise to ensure that it does the very best job for the responsibility that it is charged with. If it does that, everyone will benefit from it. The ability of the two industries to coexist is important—that is, primary industry or agriculture and also the resource or gas industry; the protection, most importantly, of the aquifers to preserve that most precious resource, which is of course water; and at the same time ensure that the land is able to, as much is physically possible at the time, but at the end of the extraction, be returned to its original productivity. It is very important in terms of us not only feeding our nation but our ongoing responsibility we will have to feed the world that we retain the productivity of our land. As an ex-farmer—and, once you are a farmer, you are always going to be a farmer; I still sniff the air when I go out in the bush—I want to see that happen and the coalition want to see that happen.


I commend the amendment to the House. We, as I say, will support the legislation when it comes forward.

Mr WINDSOR
 (New England) (17:59):  I rise to thank members for the support for this legislation. I recognise the member for Groom and the amendment that the opposition is introducing. Essentially, I think the bill incorporates pretty much what you are suggesting, but you are spelling it out a little bit more than maybe the bill does. I hope the minister is supportive because I think it would be a very good thing if this particular piece of legislation got through the parliament with a united approach. It is critical, and the member for Groom made the point that we have appropriate assessment. I take on board what the member for Maranoa said when he suggested that we want to make sure that this is not just a talkfest of scientists, that there is some degree of community input. I thought his contribution was very good as well. This is in stark contrast to the situation some years ago when there was division on this very issue, on the need for independent scientific assessment in terms of risk and knowledge and cumulative impact on landscape. So in a number of years we have come quite a long way.


I remember a similar debate in the Senate, which the member for Groom would also remember, where there was a change of heart overnight and the coalition members, particularly the National Party at the time, recanted their vote the very next day after making glorious speeches about how they had been able to deliver a scientific process to look at these very issues in some of the lands that we are still talking about today. So progress has been made.


The Minerals Council back in 2008—the member for Groom would remember this as well—made the point through their environmental officer, Melanie Stutsel, who is still there, that there should be some form of bioregional assessment process engaged in before exploration licences are granted, so that we have some idea of what the landscape can accept. I think that has been taken up through the national partnerships agreement that the minister and the Prime Minister have been involved with and that is reflected very much in the independent scientific analysis. The money for that analysis, the $200 million that allows this to go forward, is in fact money that has come out of the minerals resource rent tax. In the very kindest of ways, I remind the member for Kennedy that he did not support that funding base. I believe he is going to try to amend it today and I will be interested to listen to his contribution.


The $150 million of funding will go towards the risk assessment process, the cumulative process. I think all of us want to know about that, irrespective of which catchment we live in. I take the point, which I think was made by the member for Groom, that none of us are against development. We just want to make sure that it is risk free or, if there are risks, that we prioritise our better agricultural lands, particularly where water is involved, and that we get it right prior to taking risks.


In relation to gas in New South Wales, the gas companies themselves ran an advertising campaign some months back where they made the point that within New South Wales there was enough gas to power Sydney for 5,000 years. The point I made in relation to that was: well, what's the hurry? Why don't we get this right—get the science right and make the assessment process one where there is a degree of objectivity rather than political platitudes and decision making based on the income of the state or the politics of the day? Five thousand years is a long time. If we lose a few at the start in getting the process right, I think the people in 5,000 years may well thank us.

Mr BURKE

12  Aquifer drilling—12 month moratorium



(1) A person commits an offence if:


(a) the person takes an action; and


(b) the person takes the action for the purposes of, or in connection with, coal seam gas extraction; and


(c) the action is, or results in, drilling through or into an aquifer; and


(d) the drilling occurs within 12 months after the commencement of this item.


Penalty:


(a) for an individual—$200,000; and


(b) for a body corporate—$2,000,000.


(2) Subitem (1) applies only if:


(a) the person is a corporation to which paragraph 51(xx) of the Constitution applies; or


(b) the action is taken for the purposes of trade or commerce:


(i) between Australia and another country; or


(ii) between 2 States; or


(iii) between a State and a Territory; or


(iv) between 2 Territories; or


(c) the action is taken in a Territory.


(3) Subitem (1) does not apply if the action is taken to facilitate safer coal mining.


(4) This item has effect despite any provision of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 or any other Act.


The amendment is pretty simple, really. It says that we should have a year's moratorium. The honourable member for New England has criticised me for opposing the $150 million. I do not mean to be disrespectful but $150 million to do this study is, in my opinion, a waste of taxpayers' money of indecent proportions, to be quite frank with you. If you want to know the science of it, I will explain it to you outside. You laugh, but if you had taken the time to find out a little bit about the gases that are inherent and their effect in an aquifer then you would know that it is inherently dangerous, my friend. And, if you had listened, what I said earlier on is that if you have casing it is only as good as how long it is going to last. You would know, as I do—both of us coming from the country—that bore casing, whether it is plastic or something else, is not going to last all that long because there are movements in the ground all the time.


I think I should have moved for two years rather than one year, and I agree with the criticism from the honourable member behind me on this issue. If you are saying that we need money to do some scientific research, I would agree with the member for New England. I applaud him and thank him, as I have done publicly and privately on the issue. As to whether it should be money of that dimension: no, I am sorry, I have always been a person that is very tight-fisted with government money. My many years in the ministries would attest to my frugality and I will not be apologising to anyone for that. Actually, I am quite proud of it.


As for the amendment being moved here, firstly, it is no use doing the scientific research whilst they are out there drilling holes through the aquifer. You stop the drilling. And until you do stop it for scientific research, whether you consider it necessary to the extent of $150 million or whether you consider it necessary to the extent of a few million dollars, which would be my position, we will argue that. But the thing that should not be argued is that they are out there drilling the holes without the scientific knowledge belonging to the member for New England or the minister or the government. I think that is grossly irresponsible. I fully agree with the honourable member behind me here in saying that there should be a moratorium until that scientific work is done and assessed.


The second issue is that, quite frankly, I just do not think the risks taken by drilling through the aquifers are justified—and we are talking about the artesian aquifers. I take the minister's point that there is great argument about whether the aquifers, which we call the Great Artesian Basin, are interconnected or whether they are not. I put on the table my scientific evidence that Spring Creek runs for 82 kilometres west of Boulia in arguably the hottest, driest place on earth—though San Fernando in California would argue otherwise, and there is another place in South America and one part of Africa. It is as hot and dry as any climate on earth. To be able to get a creek to run for 82 kilometres an awful lot of water has to be coming out. I just do not think that that amount of water would come unless the aquifers were interconnected, and I can present an awful lot of other evidence to that effect. So I just do not believe that we should be drilling through the aquifers.


Quite frankly, the aquifers in my area, the Great Artesian Basin, are at 1,500 feet. Surely you can find a lot of gas without having to go down below 1,500 feet. Also, because it is an aquifer, it has to have an impervious layer above it and an impervious layer below it, otherwise it is not an aquifer. The impervious layer below it is generally accepted as bedrock. I do not know—it is going to cost a lot to go through bedrock, and I would not have thought the chance of finding stuff beneath would be particularly good. We have people out there drilling holes. It looks good on a prospectus, and they will have a lot of gobbledegook scientific jargon in the prospectus. Quite frankly, we have a name for it in the bush but I cannot use that name here.

(b) the person takes the action for the purposes of, or in connection with, coal seam gas mining; and

(4) This item has effect despite any provision of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 or any other Act.


I will speak only briefly to this. When the bill passes to the other place, Senator Larissa Waters, who has been so actively involved in the campaign in Queensland, and Senator Rhiannon from New South Wales are going to speak more fulsomely. I first of all acknowledge the efforts of the member for New England in bringing this legislation to this place. A lot is said about minority parliaments, but one of the reasons that minority parliaments get outcomes is that issues that might otherwise go into the too-hard basket or might not find their way onto the agenda because of the role that certain vested interests have—such as in development, in agriculture and mining—can be brought out and debated. 


Although there are a number of ways the Greens could suggest this bill would be improved—I will go through some of the things we would do, and what we have put before the parliament that we think would be better solution—I just want to acknowledge the debate and the hubbub about this current parliament. People are going to look back on this parliament at the time of the next election and acknowledge it has been a time of great reform and some significant gains. It is good that we are now having a national debate about coal seam gas.


The amendment that I am proposing is to impose a moratorium of sufficient length to allow the scientific research that we have heard about to take its course and to give us the proper base of scientific knowledge that we need to make informed decisions. It is our understanding, based on advice from the department, that the work program of this bill's independent expert scientific committee really needs a full five years to get to a proper level of scientific knowledge. So this amendment proposes a moratorium for that five-year period, with the option of lifting the moratorium should that work program be completed earlier. 


As the Greens, we say that this is exactly the time that the precautionary principle should apply. The industry is expanding rapidly across the east coast, despite a serious lack of knowledge about the risk that CSG drilling, fracking and gas extraction poses, particularly to our groundwater systems. It is simply not acceptable—and we believe that our communities and our environment deserve better—to proceed in the absence of this knowledge. 


The Australian Greens have suggested that there are a number of ways that this industry could be better regulated. Senator Waters has a bill before the Senate proposing that a water trigger be inserted into the EPBC Act—into our federal environmental laws—so that we can ensure that the full impacts on water systems from coal seam gas mining can be considered by the federal environment minister. Senator Waters has also proposed a landholder rights bill to allow people to say no to CSG mining on their land where the risks are still unknown, something that for a brief, fleeting period was supported by others in this place until they changed their position. The Greens have also proposed two motions in the Senate calling for a moratorium on coal seam gas mining.


We will be supporting the bill and debating these issues further when it comes to the Senate, but it would seem to be eminently sensible to use this opportunity, where it is on the national agenda and where we have the opportunity to progress with legislative reform, to say—as we have said before—that if there is 5,000 years worth of gas there, then waiting an extra five years while we work out the state of that e scientific knowledge will not hurt anyone. In fact, it might avoid a great deal of harm. So I commend the amendment to the House.

Mr WINDSOR
 (New England) (18:21):  I will speak briefly to the amendment and the previous amendment, moved by the member for Kennedy, which did not get through the House. Whilst I have great sympathy for the sentiment being expressed by the Greens—and I thank the member for Melbourne for his complimentary remarks—I am not sure that this is the vehicle to drive a moratorium process. There may well be other vehicles within the parliament that could do that. This legislation is essentially about objectivity. It is not picking one side of the debate or the other; it is establishing an independent scientific process that is locked into a national partnerships agreement, which broadens the area.


The suggestion that we have some sort of absolute moratorium until we get the science right does, I think, apply in some areas. If the independent scientific committee and the national partnerships agreement are actually working successfully, that will in fact happen. It will go to risk, particularly in relation to water resources. It will go to the cumulative impact of large coal developments plus others in some catchments—the catchment of the Namoi, for instance. Large developments are being proposed there; there are large developments there now; there are large coal-seam gas companies interested in another layer of extractive activities, all around quite massive areas. It is not in the Great Artesian Basin, as the member for Kennedy kept referring to. The artesian basin does not exist there, but there are quite large groundwater supplies that we do not fully comprehend either for the Murray-Darling plan that is in the parliament at the moment or for the extraction of coal-seam gas. In those cases, if the scientific committee is working effectively, it will delay some of these large developments until effective and fully objective knowledge exists about those catchments.


There are other catchments where we do have a relatively full scientific knowledge and where the water resources are not of the magnitude of either the artesian basin or areas on the Liverpool Plains, for instance. The member for Groom would be well aware of some of the irrigation areas on the Darling Downs. There are other electorates in Queensland where there is a degree of knowledge about the scientific impact on water resources.


For that reason I will not support the amendment. There may well be other vehicles in the parliament by which these issues can be driven, but I do not think this is the right bill for it. Bear in mind that a lot of work has gone into plugging together the national partnerships agreement with the states. If this amendment were passed, we would run the risk of the whole process fracturing and undoing a lot of good work that has been done by a lot of people over a number of years.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (18:25):  I seek some clarification from the minister. Wherever a project, either coal-seam gas or large-scale coalmining, is on the spectrum of planning—even at the exploration stage through to the development application stage—my understanding is that every step along the way as of now the science decides whether we progress in a planning sense to the next stage. That is my understanding. I seek some clarification from the minister. If I am correct and the science now is at the heart of every gateway in the planning process, a one-year or five-year moratorium, in my view, is unnecessary. The science is here; the science is now. It is the law as of today. For those reasons, I think a moratorium is not necessary and, if anything, we should be celebrating the success of this bill in finally injecting much needed science into the planning process at all steps along the spectrum of that process.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (18:27):  I have to respond to that in a way that does not prejudge any decisions. The best way I can respond to the points raised by the member for Lyne is to say that environmental decisions are based on what are covered as matters of national environmental significance within our national environmental legislation, known as the EPBC Act. There are some parts of that decision-making process which do not necessarily have science at their core—for example, heritage decisions which are covered under those sections. Where the decisions call for a foundation of scientific information, the best available scientific information is used. As a result of the amendments here today, there will be a continued and rapid improvement in the quality of that scientific information that forms the foundations of those parts of the decision making within the act.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2012-05-29,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (16:41):  As I was saying yesterday evening, when I was abruptly terminated, the committee has the ability to publish options on improving the consistency of research in the area and information on developing leading standards in the protection of water resources from the impacts of coal seam gas and large coalmining developments. This is probably the big issue in being able to protect the aquifers, and at the same time allowing agriculture to continue doing what it does very well and the gas to be extracted. The committee provides the environment minister and relevant state or territory ministers with expert scientific advice on coal seam gas and large coalmining development proposals that may have a significant impact on water resources, and it provides other advice in whatever circumstances.


The background of it all is that while the technology to extract gas from coal seams has been long in existence, it has only been in the last decade and a half or so that development has actually occurred in our country of Australia. Currently, around 90 per cent of Queensland gas is supplied from CSG operations, and it represents approximately 10 per cent of Australia's total gas production. The industry is in the process of growing; in Queensland alone it is expected to deliver 18,000 jobs and around $850 million in royalties per year.


The federal government will also benefit from a substantial increase in income and in company taxes. There has been considerable public debate, as there would be, around CSG operations and the environmental impact, with groundwater resources being a key concern. But issues relating to water table preservation and the protection and integrity of aquifers need to be addressed. That is the prime issue. The establishment of the committee would add independent expert input into the debate. The coalition believes the committee is a positive step towards improving public confidence in the environmental integrity of the industry.


There is one proposed amendment to the bill. The bill states that each member of the committee except the chair is to be appointed on the basis that they possess scientific qualifications that the minister considers relevant to the performance of the committee's functions, including but not limited to ecology, geology, hydrology, hydrogeology, natural resource management and health. The coalition proposes that, as the committee's fundamental reason for being is to advise on scientific issues relating to water associated with CSM and coalmining, the bill should require a majority of the members to have advanced qualifications and expertise in the key fields of geology, hydrology or hydrogeology. That is a very important issue.


While this bill is about the establishment of a committee to provide scientific advice to governments on relevant coal seam gas and large coalmining projects, access to land by CSG operators is a very significant issue to the farmers on that land. In addition, there is a significant concern that farmers are not receiving fair compensation for access to their land and a share of any profits. Obviously farmers must get compensation for surface interference and everything that goes with it, but this is very different to ordinary mining, where the company tends to buy at a very good price the land the mine is actually on and buys a buffer zone around it. Ordinary mining tends to resolve itself, but coal seam is different because they do not buy the land. They are probably there for 15 years, or maybe 20, so they are not going to buy it. So the interference is permanent. It is there for 15 years or so. It is very real.


There are three priorities which we need to balance. One is the water. We have to get it right. We have to make sure that coal seam gas is not going to have a major impact on our water resources and destroy the environmental and practical values of our productive capacity. We know there is still much about our underground water that we do not know, so we have to not make hasty decisions that we will regret. We need to look at the impact on farmers and farming land. On the water, I have spoken to the drillers—not the exploration companies. I mean the people whose livelihood revolves around their ability to drill and pass that information back to their employer. The drillers believe they actually can preserve the aquifers by their knowledge and their actions, and we certainly need that to be the case. Many of the farmers who are outspoken in the media just want the coal industry to stop; they just do not want it to happen. Yet in widespread consultation with farmers it is apparent that many are happy to accommodate the coal seam gas industry as long as their interests are not compromised and they are compensated. I believe they need to get a share in the profits.


The third and final issue is that Australia has ongoing energy needs which must be met and that coal seam gas, if handled properly, can help reduce our emissions, amongst other things, but at the same time we are talking about agricultural land that cannot be replaced. They are not making any more of it. They are making a lot more people, and agricultural land needs to be here forever.


None of these issues is easy, and good policy to address them will take time and continue to be refined, but we are abrogating our responsibilities if we just say no or yes because it is too hard to actually solve the issues. Hopefully this committee is a step in the right direction and can lead to a robust policy outcome, but it will not actually solve the issue. At the end Australia needs both farmers and exploration, but farmers must have their water protected and they must have a say in how that happens.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-05-29,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (16:49):  I listened with interest as the shadow minister for climate action, environment and heritage delivered a compelling and thoughtful speech on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill 2012 last Wednesday. With even greater interest I watched the reaction to the address by the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, who was at the table. The minister nodded with seriousness. He appeared as if he cared about and agreed with what the shadow minister said. It is a serious matter. There is bipartisan acceptance of the establishment of this coal seam gas committee. There is an amendment to this bill calling for members of the committee, except the chair, to be appointed on the basis that they have scientific qualifications that the minister deems appropriate to the performance of the committee's functions. This is a sound proposal.


I have previously seen Minister Tony Burke give a performance similar to last Wednesday's. I saw him listen and nod in the machinery shed of Benerembah farmer John Bonetti on 22 October 2010, just eight days after as many as 7,000 worried Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area residents—men, women and schoolchildren too—turned out at the first big Murray-Darling Basin Authority meeting at the Yoogali Club, Griffith. I saw him do the same, as well as taking copious notes, at the MDBA  community meeting at the same venue on 15 December 2011 after  the unacceptable draft plan had been announced on 28 November. This time, 12,000 people turned up, including the MDBA chairman, Craig Knowles, and the opposition leader. The reception the minister and the MDBA received was vastly different to that afforded Tony Abbott.


The MDBA obviously did not take heed of what was said that day, as only yesterday the states learned that the authority is pressing ahead with its intention to strip 2,750 gigalitres of productive surface water from our farmers. That is a big number. It is an especially high figure for farmers affected by both the basin plan and the contentious coal seam gas issue. But we probably already could and should have guessed that the revised draft basin plan number would be 2,750 gigalitres, equivalent to five Sydney Harbours. We should have figured it out when the Treasurer, who does not know the first thing about either farming or agribusiness and, worse, does not care, announced in his 8 May budget that $941 million of Murray-Darling Basin infrastructure money had been deferred to 2015-16. We should have realised it when money for buybacks was still very much left on the table.


The unacceptable 8 October 2010 basin guide, which became the unacceptable draft, has now morphed into the unacceptable revised draft which has been put to the states. I hope New South Wales and Victoria reject it out of hand for the disgrace that it is and for the contempt it has shown regional people who have put down tools, closed the doors of their businesses and stopped their tractors to attend community information meetings. New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries Katrina Hodgkinson has already rightly labelled the revised draft an insult to all.


The Independent member for New England yesterday queried the 12,000 attendance at that 15 December water rally at Griffith; he could not believe so many turned up. But that was the figure quoted by the local newspaper, the Area News, as well as the Daily Telegraphand the Land and the Mayor of Griffith, Councillor Mike Neville. Given that Griffith's population is 22,000, excluding the villages around the city, that is a remarkable turnout. That so many shut their shops, left their farms and went to show their support says a lot for the passion of this community and their need to have water security into the future.


The minister, who sat in this chamber last Wednesday nodding in agreement with our shadow minister about this legislation, will have the final say on the basin plan. Let us hope that, for the farmers' sake, for the nation's sake and for his sake, he makes the correct decision in the interests of our ability to feed ourselves and others into the future.


There are many in rural areas of northern New South Wales and Queensland who are just as committed to a balanced outcome in the coal seam gas issue. They, too, have turned up in large numbers at various meetings, including one in front of the New South Wales parliament on 1 May this year. Concerns about coal seam gas led members of the Country Women's Association to join thousands of protesters at the rally. NSW CWA President Elaine Armstrong from Oura near Wagga Wagga in my Riverina electorate, said the issues surrounding coal seam gas mining were so important that they had inspired the group to march on Sydney for the first time in its 90-year history.


This bill also has an important water component, one which must be put as the highest priority in any consideration about any coal development for the long-term sustainability of prime agricultural land and the environment. The independent expert scientific committee's role will be to provide scientific advice to governments on relevant coal seam gas and large coalmining projects and to commission and fund water resource assessments for priority regions.


In recent years there has been much public debate around coal seam gas operations and the effect they have on the environment, with groundwater resources being a chief concern. The federal coalition's position is a balanced approach for a coal seam gas industry, which has taken off with support by state authorities, whilst acknowledging that it is imperative to ensure Australian food security and fair rights for landholders. Issues pertaining to watertable preservation and the protection and integrity of aquifers must be addressed.


The environment and water minister has appointed an interim committee to give advice on coal seam gas and large coalmining awaiting its formal establishment by this bill. One sincerely hopes the committee does a far better job than the highly paid members of the independent authority who failed to achieve a Murray-Darling Basin Plan with a triple bottom line. Ask anyone in Griffith, Coleambally, Leeton, Deniliquin or Shepparton today what they think of the MDBA and I am sure you will get an angry response.


The government has allocated $150 million to resource the activities of this coal seam gas committee. An additional $50 million has been reserved for allocation to states by the committee as inducements to implement its recommendations. The committee has wide-reaching powers, as you would expect. These include: advising on research goals; advising on bioregional assessments in areas of high potential risk from coal seam gas and/or large coalmining projects and giving advice to the federal environment minister on priority assessment areas; advising on research and bioregional assessments commissioned by the minister subsequent to the committee's advice; publishing options on bettering the researching in this issue; and information on developing the very best protection of water resources from the effects of coal seam gas and large coalmining developments; providing the minister and the relevant state or territory counterpart with expert scientific advice on coal seam gas and large coalmining project proposals which may have a high and lasting impact on water resources; and providing other advice deemed appropriate and necessary.


The Land's Canberra correspondent Colin Bettles recently wrote an excellent series of articles detailing how Australia could learn from the coal seam gas experience in the United States of America. In the past 15 years thousands of coal seam gas wells have been drilled in the Powder River Basin, home to the US's biggest coal deposits, in southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming. As Bettles reported, for local ranchers it meant a share in rich royalties—if some interruptions to their agricultural operations. But now gas prices have tanked, mining companies are backing off and landowners are left with the legacy.


One of the telling quotes in Bettles' series came from Wyoming farmer Ed Schwartz, whose message for Australian farmers was:


… to get a tight water surface use agreement in place, before any mining activity starts.


“Make sure they reclaim the land, make sure they put up a sufficient bond to protect the water wells and don’t let them dump this water on the ground because if it’s salty like the water is here, it will kill the soil rather than improve it,” he said.


His son Troy said:


… the time it would take to repair the damage to critical land and water assets on his family ranch, caused by coalbed methane mining over the past decade, could take several lifetimes of his children and their grandkids—even with no more salt water running over it.


For many in Australia's coal seam gas regions, the horse has already well and truly bolted. However, this committee, if it undertakes the desired role, will certainly have an important part to play in ensuring environmental concerns are satisfactorily met on future developments. Given the amount of exploration and investment, the committee will—should—indeed be busy.


The economic benefits of the coal seam gas industry are now being realised across Queensland. The industry just gets bigger and bigger, and there is genuine and understandable concern about groundwater systems and surface water systems. We just heard from the shadow minister for agriculture, food security, fisheries and forestry, who made some pertinent points about the growth and value of coal seam gas in Queensland, and about our limited understanding of underground water systems.


Coal seam gas development requires a comprehensive policy approach which addresses the environmental, community and economic impacts of the industry. A measured, rational and balanced approach to the industry and its management is needed and is vital. Managed correctly, with proper safeguards in place, coal seam gas has the potential to revitalise parts of regional Australia. I know my colleague here, the member for Maranoa, is well aware of that, because it has brought great benefits and investment to his region and it delivered a new economic boom. Poorly managed it could become an environmental and social nightmare for the Commonwealth—certainly for the people who live in affected areas—and for the nation's future and that of our Great Artesian Basin. No coal seam gas development should proceed where it poses a real and lasting threat to the quality of groundwater or surface water systems. It must be crystal clear that no coal seam gas development should take place unless it is proven safe for the environment. Prime agricultural land is an increasingly important natural asset. It must be preserved and protected from activities which destroy its capacity to deliver food security not only for Australia but for a hungrier world, particularly in this Asia-Pacific region, for generations to come. Australia can play a key part in feeding the world as Asia booms.


Global food security is sure to be among the top issues most likely to lead to serious international conflicts over the next decade. There is a widening gulf between world food supply and demand. Worldwide demand for food will escalate dramatically in the coming years as the world population hurtles towards and beyond nine billion while limited resources of arable land and fresh water will become even more meagre.


The Prime Minister said in a groundbreaking speech to the Global Foundation Summit in Melbourne on 3 May that 'Australia must be ready to act as the food bowl of Asia' into the future and that we need to 'strengthen irrigation'. To do what the Prime Minister rightly says we need to do as a nation and supporter of Asia and the Pacific Rim, we must not enforce a man-made drought on our farmers through poor water policy decisions and we must get the issue of coal seam gas right.


Coal seam gas development must not be allowed to occur close to existing residential areas. People who have bought a home—their biggest lifetime investment—with a reasonable expectation of being away from mining operations must not have their lives turned upside down by coal seam gas operations springing up on their doorstep. Landowners are entitled to satisfactory pecuniary returns sourced by reason of access to their land. Remuneration for landowners should not be restricted to compensation. The regions which deliver much of the wealth from coal seam gas developments deserve to see a fair share of generated revenues reinvested in their communities.


There is an opportunity to grow our nation and encourage a lasting legacy from finite coal seam gas developments. The environment must be protected, as must the economic development imperatives of regional Australia and the legitimate rights of landowners. Unless regional communities are engaged as partners and have something meaningful to gain from the development of the coal seam gas industry, they will not support it, let alone on their land. Why would they? Without winning widespread support from regional communities, coal seam gas development will not proceed.


The need to earn a social licence is a reality with which the coal seam gas industry and governments must come to terms. State governments have primary responsibility for the approval and supervision of the coal seam gas industry, and the role and efforts of state governments in dealing with this issue are recognised. However, the stakes are so high for regional Australia that federal leadership is mandatory—something the Gillard government has lacked in so many areas, not just coal seam gas.


For regional Australians, it is acknowledged that coal seam gas presents both opportunities and threats. We must ensure the benefits of this emerging boom take into consideration the environment. That means finding a fair and necessary balance between the needs of mining companies, landowners and communities. Meeting those needs and spreading the benefits will smooth the way to underwrite support for the industry and guarantee it delivers regional Australia and, through it, the nation a lasting legacy far beyond the 35-year life of a coal seam gas well.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2012-05-29,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (17:03):  I respect the previous speaker, but doesn't he realise that his party stands for the exact opposite position of all of the moral issues that he raised in his speech? I feel as though I am in a lunatic asylum insofar as the cutbacks in the Murray-Darling are going to reduce a lot of his towns to ghost towns. They were little tiny towns of 300 or 400 people before the irrigation came through. You are going to take eight million megalitres of irrigation and reduce it to five million megalitres. I fear for what is going to happen in inland New South Wales. I went there, and it is very relevant to the coal seam gas issue because the contamination of the underground aquifers is very real.


I think that I am the only person in this place who has ever worked down mines. I worked my own mines. I put my own gelignite at the coalface, blew it up, and mucked out with a shovel. The thing was in the development phase, and you can afford to do that sort of thing in the development phase. I was floating my own mining company before I went sideways into other things. But I worked at the Mount Isa Mines as a labourer at the coalface. I would also like to think that my scientific knowledge is reasonably adequate.


If you release hydrogen sulfide or methane gases, when they mix with water, they become poisonous. I spent half my life looking for copper sulfate. When you are looking for a copper ore body, you look for the ore that is below the watertable. That is invariably sulfides, and copper sulfate is a poison. Every copper ore body in the world is a copper sulfate ore body. There are one or two exceptions, but I think it is a fair call. The watertables that they sit in by definition are contaminants. They are mild acids.


I love to promote my book! People do not know about their own country. Inside the Great Dividing Range there were no kangaroos—there were no Skippys—there were no goannas and there were no people, because there was no surface water. In my homeland in the mid-west of North Queensland, west of Boulia, which is almost on the Northern Territory border, there was a stream that ran for 80 kilometres: Spring Creek. The Great Artesian Basin surfaced there. We dug holes in the ground and took the water out east of Boulia, between Boulia and the Great Dividing Range. So we now have maybe 10,000 or 20,000 kilometres of waterways in that area between the Great Dividing Range and the Northern Territory border. We now do not have an 80-kilometre river out there. It was not much use because it did not rain much and there was nothing much living out there. But when we put that water back this way, where there was rainfall and beautiful soils, we had this highly prolific grazing area which grazed a lot of Australia's sheep and was the biggest grazing area for cattle in the country. But what happens if that aquifer is contaminated? And they are drilling through it as we speak. Let me explain this to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I am probably the only person here who understands this. When you drill down and hit hydrogen sulfate, methane or any of these gases they come up the pipe. There is sheathing when you drill. There might be a bit of contamination. You put bore casing down—whether it be plastic or metal—and it prevents that contamination from getting into the aquifers. They are drilling through the Great Artesian Basin now. It costs a lot of money to drill. These holes cost $2,000 a foot. They would not be doing it without knowing that the methane and other gases are there to access. Righto, it is protected when the sheath is there. But anyone in mining knows that the ground moves—and I am not talking about tectonic plate shifts. When the ground moves, it will wear out or buckle those plastic or metal sheaths. If you have got hydrogen sulfate coming up, then you have got acids coming up. If you have got any sorts of sulfates, you will have acids. No matter what metal the sheath is made of, it will be worn away. If it is made of plastic it will buckle and eventually wear out. So at some stage you are going to contaminate the aquifer.


You might say, 'What's a couple of holes?' Well, in Queensland there are 55,000 applications so far. God gave a wonderful resource to our country. This was a land that no-one wanted. The Portuguese knew about it in 1504 when they were in Timor, and, in 1624, Carstensz wrote a full report about it to the government of Batavia. But it was such a dry, hungry country that no-one wanted to come here. Even when they did come here, all they sent for the first seven years were convicts. The only reason anyone came here was that they found some gold here. Up until 1900, that was the only reason anyone came here.


But when we were drilling for gold and other things, we discovered this underground water supply called the Great Artesian Basin. Without that supply, there would be no cattle or sheep inland from the Great Dividing Range. We would lose it all. Our inland rivers are so inconsistent that we cannot rely upon them to supply water for our stock. So what is now a great resource that feeds maybe 15 million or 20 million people—from the cattle and sheep that come of that area—will be feeding nobody. We will have destroyed that great resource the good Lord has given us. God will say: 'I gave you this resource. What did you do with it?'


The previous speaker spoke about the Prime Minister saying we want to be the food bowl of Asia. I mean, I wish someone would get their feet on the ground here! We will be importing tomatoes from China. Do not talk to me about it. Go and talk to Frank Costa, the biggest seller of fruit and vegetables in Australia. He owns the Essendon Football Club, amongst other things. Go and talk to him. We will be importing tomatoes from China. We import prawns from China. We import seafood from China. We are importing apples from China. We are not going to be the food bowl of Asia; we will be a net importer of food from Asia. But do not listen to me. Go down to the library and get the statistics out.


But how are we husbanding those resources? We had six million hectares of the most beautiful land on earth. You can farm it for seven years and not use any fertilisers. We had a research place at Richmond for about 15 years. For seven years they farmed it. In the final year they had no results whatsoever from putting fertiliser on it. That is how rich this soil is. So what are we doing? Six million hectares has been taken over by the dirty, filthy prickly tree, which was introduced by us. Human beings introduced the prickly tree and it has destroyed everything. The little dunnart—a cute little fella that is like a mini-kangaroo—is doomed because it cannot survive the prickly tree.


Instead of going forward and irrigating on the banks of our rivers to protect them and build them up and stop these terrible seeds from getting away every time there is a flood and being carried out and out and out, we have done absolutely nothing. Our banks are eroding away into the Gulf of Carpentaria—and now we are drilling holes through the greatest asset this nation has! The greatest asset this nation has is not coal. Coal will run out in 30 or 40 years and there will be replacements for it. The greatest asset this nation has is not iron ore. Iron ore will run out in 30 or 40 years and other countries will be producing it anyway so it will not be worth a great deal. The greatest asset this nation has is the artesian aquifer. But nobody is saying, 'Stop, you're not to drill a hole through the artesian aquifer.'


I am the only one here with the experience to know that, if you drill a hole through there, you will pick up poisonous gases all the time. Methane, hydrogen sulfate and all these poisonous gases come up. As long as the plastic sheath, the bore casing, is there it is all right. But the bore casing is not there forever. I mean, nothing is forever anywhere. All the great buildings of the world are ruins today—the Parthenon, the Colosseum and the pyramids. All great buildings wear out eventually. We are dooming and condemning this area and putting it in question. What for? Where is the benefit to this nation?


The previous speaker said that there had been a benefit in the member for Maranoa's area. It is like a sugar fix: you get a lot of energy at the start of the game. But I would not want to be the coach. If your State of Origin team have a sugar hit, they will play terrifically in the first 10 minutes but there will not be much left in the tank for the next 30 or 40 minutes—that is for certain. And that is what is happening here. I have lived with four generations of my family—and, if you include my kids and grandkids, seven generations—in the mining fields of Australia. The Katter side of my family went to these towns before there were towns there. And on the other side of my family they perished chasing gold in the deserts.


Is mining a huge boon to a town? As I get older I wonder about the benefit of that. We have a huge shift, we leap forward and then we have terrible withdrawal symptoms afterwards. What happens afterwards is absolutely critical. Charters Towers was a bigger town than Brisbane. It did not just come down to a normal sized town; it was vanishing completely. A few things happened and we were able to arrest that decline, but the things that we did to arrest the decline vanished because we found gold. Everyone left the meatworks, to quote but one example, or left the railway to go and work in the goldmines. The gold has now run out and I have a town where 10,000 people have lost their jobs and we are in a very critical state. If we had not had the gold we would have been determined to keep open the meatworks and the hospital, and all of the other things we had. But we did not care much about that because we had this quick fix—a quick hit. As the previous speaker, the member for Riverina, referred to, it will not be there in the longer term, but the aquifers have to be there. 


I am all for drilling before you mine coal. The Americans did this. I speak with great authority. As the Minister for Mines and Energy—and, more importantly, as the minister for northern development—in the Queensland government, I heavily researched coal seam gas back in the eighties. Then it was not profitable, although there will be those that argue about that. 


The Americans extracted coal seam gas to make their mining safe—they heavily subsidised it—ahead of the mining, so that the dangers of mining were removed. And most of the coal seam gas in America really comes from that phenomenon of mining. I am all for doing that. If there are no aquifers I find it hard to say that we should not be extracting coal seam gas, but the minute there are aquifers, as the member for Riverina pointed out, the water that comes up is contaminated. Then you have to spread it out somewhere to get rid of it. It is all flat country; you cannot put it in a big hole somewhere, so it is a huge area that becomes contaminated.


Heather Brown, a wonderful Australian and one of our great fighters on this issue, pointed out that in her area there is going to be a huge bowl of dirty, filthy, contaminating, poisonous soup. She went there because this was a beautiful place to live and she was suddenly confronted. The neighbours—his father is one of my three best friends; we went around a lot of the country and the never-never—are in a situation where there is an authority over their land to prospect for coal and for coal seam gas. They cannot go forward. They cannot do anything with it because the banks will not lend any money because they do not know when a mine will open up there. And the miners will not tell them; they said it would be seven years before they make a decision. So the neighbours' lives are destroyed. They cannot sell the land; no-one is going to buy it with authorities to prospect or exploration permits over it. 


I do not want to condemn people or speak badly about people but you cannot get up in this place and speak on behalf of the opposition when you know they have done absolutely nothing and when the incoming Premier in Queensland is in love with coal seam gas. There are 55,000 holes; he is going to put 200,000 holes down. He is in love with it. So do not come in here and say these things, because your party represents the exact opposite view— (Time expired)

Mr BRUCE SCOTT
 (Maranoa—Second Deputy Speaker) (17:18):  I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill 2012 and to follow the member for Kennedy, who gave a bit of history of his own family and his background in western and central western Queensland. I welcome the opportunity to follow the member for Riverina, as well.


I can say that I too come to this debate with a great deal of experience, because my family lived in western Queensland long before many of the towns were even gazetted as towns. In fact, in the case of my own home town of Roma, my family went there prior to its being gazetted as a town. They settled there and I certainly grew up with an appreciation of the importance of water. My home town of Roma was where the first oil was discovered in Australia. In fact, it is still a very big hub for the natural gas that was discovered in our region.


So I come to this debate with an enduring interest, not only in the resource sector and what it can do for our regional economies but also in making sure that we get the balance right and get right the legislation and regulations governing the mining operations of the companies that extract this coal seam methane gas.


This Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill is certainly timely. I also acknowledge that it has the bipartisan support of both sides of the House. I acknowledge the member for New England who is here. He was raising these sorts of concerns in his area and, along with other people, I was one of those voicing protests in our own areas. 


I acknowledged, all the time, that it is the state governments that have the overriding constitutional responsibility for the regulation and operation of our resources. The Commonwealth has very limited powers, and one of the powers it has is in the approval process. Our interests are limited really to environment and biodiversity issues associated with mining approvals. 


So I do welcome this bill. It is important that this bill provides the support that we need to give communities confidence that these new developments—such as the open cut coalmining industry and the coal seam methane gas—are safe and that, as it moves into more closely settled areas, as opposed to the vast areas of the Cooper Basin in my electorate, it is sustainable, and that there is a much happier coexistence than we have seen as these industries have become established in the Surat Basin in my electorate. This bill will establish an independent expert scientific committee on coal seam gas and large coal developments. What I want to ensure is that when the panel is established it is not just loaded with scientists, because I can assure this House that if it is just scientists that make up this panel the communities will not have confidence in the committee. As well-meaning, well-resourced and well-credentialed as scientists may be, it is important to get a balance of people on this committee—as I believe it always is. It is important to include people who have an understanding of communities, of the environment, of the way the aquifers work and how they recharge, and, of course, of the importance of them to the people of the outback of Queensland and many parts of Australia. The Great Artesian Basin is not just in Queensland; it crosses into South Australia, the Northern Territory and New South Wales. So, when this panel is established, it is important that it has a balance of people, not just scientists, providing advice to the minister. It is important that we get the confidence of the communities, who have been a very strong voice of protest, and that we get the regulations right for the coal seam methane gas operations, particularly, and for the open coalmining operations as they move into more closely settled areas and prime agricultural land.


The coal seam industry in my region has been growing from the very early trials that they did in about 1995-96. It was Tri-Star, from America, that started to develop the method for identifying whether these coal seams would provide coal seam methane gas and how it would be extracted. Once they had established that it was possible they, Sunshine Star and a lot of other companies onsold a lot of their tenements to larger companies.


The other part of the problem in the establishment of this industry is that companies who had been granted tenements to explore for coal seam methane gas were taking for granted access to landholders' properties. They were cowboys. They were probably $2 shelf companies, with a computer in an office somewhere. They subcontracted to drillers. They believed they had a divine right to go onto landholders' land to look for coal seam methane gas, prove up a particular volume of gas in their tenement and then onsell it for a lot of money to a major company, who would then amalgamate the work that had been done by the subcontractors and cowboys—as we like to describe them in our area.


We had instances where these cowboys would just cut through people's fences and put old cockies' gates behind them, leave gates open and come in night and day, bringing vehicles onto properties that might have had Parthenium weed and other noxious plants that people spent hundreds of thousands of dollars controlling. The Commonwealth spent millions of dollars on control of these invasive weeds, and these cowboys did not have the respect that landholders had for this land.


Largely, I am happy to say, I think we have weeded out the cowboys and the regulations through the voice of protest. But we have seen what the previous government in Queensland and New South Wales have done—more particularly in Queensland, because I believe in Queensland we are much further advanced in the development of the coal seam methane gas industry than the southern states are. We are so much further advanced that quite a lot of the gas now that is used in cooking and power generation in Queensland comes from coal seam methane gas. In fact, 30 per cent of Queensland's gas consumption is from coal seam methane gas. I have two or three coal seam methane gas power stations in my area. One is a 125-megawatt plant at Miles, and another is a 750-megawatt plant in Braemar—combined-cycle, baseload coal power as well as peak-load coal seam methane gas power. It is very clean energy. When I see a coal-fired power station and a gas-fired power station, when it comes to the visual pollution, I would rather have a gas-fired power station than a coal-fired one any day. It is cleaner energy and there is less visual pollution in the landscape. Of course, when it comes to open cut coalmines, with the scar they leave on the landscape, as opposed to gas wells, there is no comparison.


I am certainly a great supporter, providing we get this right. We have to make sure landholders' rights are protected. I have family involved in this who are going to have gas wells on their property. I know their right to negotiate is absolute, but it has not been easy—notwithstanding the new regulations that are in place. So I come to this with family involvement in dealing with gas companies. I come to the debate having to deal with constituents with very real issues with the legacy left behind by the cowboys that were out there earlier, including pumping stations within 100 metres of family homes—things that are no longer allowed.


I will talk a little bit about the Great Artesian Basin because I have had a lot of practical experience in the Great Artesian Basin. On our own property we have had a free-flowing bore. When I was only a small kid we used to ride past this free-flowing bore in the winter on our ponies on our way to school. We would pull up and put our hands under the lovely warm water to warm our hands and then get back on our ponies and ride on to school. It sounds like it was a long time ago, and it was. But, after 56 years of free-flowing bores—the member for Kennedy, to his credit, did mention these free-flowing bores—that one stopped. Why? Because of the 4,500 free-flowing bores that went into the Hutton Sandstone and the Precipice Sandstone. When they were formed, 250 million years ago, the water just flowed down bore drains—98 per cent of the water was lost and two per cent was utilised. But the basin did open up the pastoral industry. It was seen as a way of developing the land out there, and it has done so. I am very pleased to see that since the mid-1990s we have had a program—funded by state and federal governments—to cap many of these bores. I would like to see that accelerated. I would like to think that we have a goal in the next five years of having every free-flowing artesian bore, from the artesian basin, capped. We can then continue to repressurise those bores. It will not run out in the near future but we have seen a third of them stop flowing since the first one went in, in the 1890s, at Bourke in western New South Wales.


The industry is important—if we get it right. This committee will have a huge responsibility in giving confidence to landholders, communities and members of parliament. This committee, this panel of experts and people with practical experience, are going to be a check in the state government's regulatory process for providing extraction permits.


In my electorate, coal seam methane gas extraction throughout the basin is going to produce something like 18,000 jobs. There is going to be something like $800 million worth of royalty money coming in every year to the state government, not the federal government. We need to make sure that this money goes back to development in those regions—for roads, social and health infrastructure or affordable housing. We need to make sure it is not just a transfer of wealth from the Surat Basin to our capital cities east of the dividing range. Those communities out there—local councils and small businesses—are under enormous pressure because of the goldmine mentality out at the moment. It is a boom.


I will describe the boom in another way. My home town of Roma is the epicentre of the Surat Basin at its western end. We have gone from one flight a day, from Brisbane to Roma, to six flights a day. In the last 12 months we have had up to 60,000 people flying through the Roma Airport. In the next 12 months 100,000 people are estimated to fly through that airport. It gives you some idea of the massive growth, the new wealth, that has come in. The subcontractors are getting a start in life. They are coming from many parts of Australia. 


But it has put enormous pressure on existing businesses in affording staff. That is why the 457 visa process for workers sponsored in by companies is an important element. It makes sure that we can keep those small businesses—the traditional businesses—in business and able to afford labour. They should not have to compete with what the resource companies are paying to source labour—so they can drive the coal seam methane gas industry—to get the developments online, on target, delivering LNG out of Gladstone by 2015 and 2016. That has been their imperative, but it has put enormous pressure on our existing industries. Part of the reason we had such a voice of protest from landholders was this imperative; part was the way that landholders were being treated. They wanted to get the job done. It caused a huge division across my communities.


The Longreach Leader today said that out of Blackall we have a mining company opening up the possibility of open-cut coalmines. Blackall and those western Queensland towns are old wool towns and many of them have halved in population since the decline of the wool industry. It is the resource sector that gives those country towns an opportunity and a hope that they can once again be wonderful towns and grow to their former glory of the wool days and get a new growth in population. It will be the resource sector in the Galilee Basin that will give those communities an opportunity to grow. (Time expired)

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (17:34):  I support this Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development) Bill 2012. I do no support it for plain-English reasons. I support it for making a substantial contribution to better outcomes in natural resource management—productive land protection and establishing science at the centre of planning processes for land use.


I acknowledge Minister Burke in the chair and the work that he has done, along with the member for New England, in getting this bill before the House. This is one of the key agreements to come out of a pretty brutal debate around mineral resource rent taxes and their worth or otherwise. Three agreements between me, the member for New England and government came out of those negotiations. This was one of them, alongside the establishment of a cabinet food, soil and water committee. It considers, through the GST distribution review, mining royalties and how they relate to and talk to tax reform generally and looks at the relationship between the Commonwealth and the state. We are still waiting for the supplementary papers from the GST distribution committee to see progress on that one.


Of the three agreements, this one is the first. This one is very important and talks to the heart of many communities. They are very vocal at the moment and are deeply concerned. They have fears, real or perceived, about the energy gold rush and its impact, both short and long term, on communities as a consequence of that. In my local electorate I have one particular community, the Gloucester Basin, which is being challenged by both coal seam gas and large-scale mining. Mining has been in Gloucester for some time on a relatively small scale. Gloucester has mainly been a farming community. It is a community that is at the head of the Manning River. It has about 300 tributaries in and around the beautiful Gloucester Basin that is at the bottom of the Barrington Range and the Barrington Tops. For environmental, lifestyle and food production reasons many people choose Gloucester as their home. They are deeply challenged, therefore, by proposals with regard to coal seam gas in the area. In the last couple of years, 110 wells have been proposed, with more to come. Of greater concern is a large-scale coalmine, 1½ kilometres from the centre of town. For local council planning purposes, the location of this particular mine is, on local council papers, for local environmental planning purposes. So there is a clash between state government land use planning of extracting a resource if it is there as the basic principle of state based land use planning and a council planning document that says, 'We're going to have a bit of development here, but here is an environmentally protected area.' The situation with completely opposite outcomes proposed by the council and the state is unsatisfactory and has the community deeply concerned.


The Gloucester community probably has about 2½ thousand people in it and nearly half the community turned out on a very cold evening to express their concerns about the New South Wales 'strategic' land use planning changes. A very strong view was expressed that even the new changes under the new government are completely missing the point and are really just embedding the problems that were experienced under the old regime in New South Wales, where, at the heart of planning was the view, as I said before, that if there is a resource it is the obligation of the Crown to extract it. For many communities, that is not what is at the heart of community and, for the long-term economic interests of Australia, that is not sensible nor strategic policy. Many are now seeing that with an expected nine billion people by 2050 there are threats around the world with regard to food security but for Australia enormous opportunities in food production. Whilst there is a recognition of this energy gold rush of the moment, the long-term story for Australia will, quite rightly, see a very strong rebirth of agriculture as an important contribution to the region around us and an important contribution to our standard of living through national economic outcomes. So we cannot 'cook' those productive lands to achieve a short-term benefit and do ourselves damage in the long term—that is the broad principle and starting point.


That is not to deny that there may be locations where mining expansion, coal seam gas, may have a place, but that is where the Commonwealth kicks in, that is where this particular bill kicks in, in making sure that those decisions are not made by vested interests, not made by political interests and not made by a state government of any political persuasion that has the mentality of, 'If there's a resource, we must extract it.' It is all about science, the best possible science we can find, and making decisions with regard to impacts on some pretty sensitive regions, not only the water but also the landscape and also—I am pleased about what we will see over time—issues of public health. All these things need to be taken into real and material consideration in making decisions about how we deal with this very sensitive clash between productive lands and the rush for energy.


I am very pleased that we are now seeing an independent scientific expert panel being put at the heart of decision making. I am also pleased to see the very sensible engagement with the states, and a key part of this is the development of national partnership agreements with the state. As we all know, from a Commonwealth perspective, land use and land use planning has predominantly been state based. They are effectively the owners of the land but the underlying principle of extracted oil costs, regardless of the long-term benefits of potentially not extracting in particular locations, is one that was not being heard. I think, therefore, the role of the Commonwealth in coordinating and enticing state governments to consider food security, water security and the protection of productive lands alongside considerations around energy and the extractive industries is an important step forward.


I am not sure whether we are there yet with all the states but we are pretty close. I am pleased that New South Wales have signed up. I do not see their logic at all, and I suspect they would not be seeing their logic in hindsight, in signing up to what is a pretty simple but effective approach to putting science at the heart of this process yet, within 24 hours, trying to release some other strategic land use planning process that they themselves have tried to establish and control, which, if you have seen any of the protests out the front of the New South Wales parliament, you will know has caused enormous community uproar.


My message to New South Wales once this bill is passed is to keep it simple: just use this. Make this the heart of your policy and the way out of the position you have put yourself in in trying to be, in my view, too clever by half. The protests that I and others have attended outside the New South Wales parliament were extraordinary. To see a coming together of farmers and environmentalists—a whole range of representatives of community interests—expressing deep concern at the loss of community as a consequence of getting this wrong should be a very loud and instructive message for us all. There is a way through and it is this bill. It is making sure that not only New South Wales but all states work very closely in cooperation and in collaboration with what is being attempted at a Commonwealth level. To have the Country Women's Association standing outside the New South Wales parliament for the first time ever in its 90-odd year history should say it all—that New South Wales has got it wrong. This bill has got it right. It is a difficult issue. It is one that has to navigate a path of cooperation through conflict and I congratulate the drafters in pretty well striking the balance.


I would also like to thank the many local organisations in my area who have been involved—the likes of the Manning Alliance, the Manning Clean Water Action Group, the Barrington-Gloucester-Stroud Preservation Alliance, the Gloucester Residents in Partnership and the Camden Haven Anti-fracking Group. It is arguably even more important to acknowledge the many individuals who are not aligned with any particular organisation, who have had signs up on their fences, who have been emailing—the very ordinary ones who do not want to protest and who do not normally want to engage in politics. These very ordinary people have done an extraordinary job in making sure this message is heard loud and clear around the country and have made it a priority issue on the agenda of all parliaments.


This bill reflects the concerns of farmers, homeowners, environmentalists, landholders and many others and, hopefully, now starts to get some sensible public policy. It should not act in isolation. I think public policy has a lot of things to consider deeply. For example, food security and the sort of strategy Australia takes—whether we should chase the idea of trying to feed all or start to shake the top end market of the Asia-Pacific and become a specialist in food security. There are opportunities in our strategy, but we need to think about it a lot.


Likewise, I do not think we have nailed water security and the issues around water yet. The Murray-Darling Basin issue is still up in the air. There are still issues being put up by the National Water Commission which are falling on deaf ears in government. There is more work to be done. The issue of soil protection is one that has not had its place on the public policy landscape as much as it could—probably because soil is a pretty, pardon the pun, dirty topic—but it needs its place. Our loss of topsoils globally is an issue of our time. It is an issue that this parliament needs to start taking seriously and needs to start contributing to not only domestically, but also internationally as we grapple with the loss of topsoil around the world. If science is to be believed and is to be trusted, this is an issue for the next hundred years if we do not deal with it. It is right before us; it is a complementary issue to water and food security. 


I am pleased we have got to this point. Now it is about locking all the states into the national partnership agreement and getting these bioregional assessments up and running. Now it is about securing the place of the independent science at the heart of any development processes from here. And now it is about really trying to get the states—in my case New South Wales—to see the worth of this, to use it for their own benefit and to make this the heart of public policy on this difficult but important issue for the states, including New South Wales, moving forward. I congratulate the minister at the table, Minister Burke, and hopefully now we can get some sensible direction on some challenging policy.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (17:49):  I want to thank everybody who has contributed to what has been an extremely good and a very constructive debate here in the chamber. I have not been able to hear all of it, but I have probably heard close to half of the contributions, either here within the chamber or from my office. There has been a really strong message from this chamber to industry generally and to the public—and this will not be lost on anyone—that the bill before us does not say that nothing should go ahead, but it does say that all decisions should be made on the best possible scientific information and that information should be available independently. 


When I was dealing with some of the environmental decisions on projects in the Darling Downs—the Surat Basin—I felt there was a need for ongoing adaptive management of some of these mechanisms and I established an independent scientific committee that would overlook them. When the mining tax was being discussed, the member for New England and the member for Lyne both argued the case strongly, asking, 'Why can't we provide the best possible information in advance of decisions? Why do we have to wait for the process of decisions having been made and get into adaptive management?' They came up with the suggestion to government that we have an independent scientific committee on an ongoing basis and we provide serious dollars to fund the best possible information. It is one of the best ways of dealing with the obligations that we find we have in our interactions with the states. In this bill we are not telling the states to change their standards. We are not telling them to change their timelines or their laws, but we are saying: 'If we're putting together a framework with the best possible scientific information, then please use it. Use it to inform your decisions, because no-one should be afraid of applying the best quality scientific information to environmental decisions.'


We also need to face the fact that we are dealing with an area that is unbelievably complex and where a lot is not fully known. I have had a number of discussions where I have been told that individual aquifers have no connection to other areas of underground water and then I get told by another set of scientists that they think they might be connected and others who say they definitely are. There is a high degree of uncertainty and a lot of information only becomes available as further research is done. By putting the serious dollars that are on the table attached to this bill and having—




Mr Katter:
  Minister, if I could just say—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  Order! The member for Kennedy!




Mr Katter:
  from Boulia—indicated that those aquifers are connected. There is no way you can get that water to run—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Kennedy!




Mr BURKE:
  I am very glad we allowed the pause. While the interjection might have been long, the point is really well taken. Because if something is not connected then you do not have a risk to underground water. But we do not want to undo all the conversations that are happening about water reform by finding that there is more water in rivers and we are just sucking the water back out through the system by depleting aquifers that are in fact connected. No-one wants that. The best possible scientific information is the best guard against that.


We have had good responses from a number of the state governments. I am disappointed that at this point the WA government is still saying, 'Absolutely no way'. But I am pleased to hear a number of members of the same party in the same state as the WA government—a number of members from the other side—who have spoken strongly in support of this. I hope they take that message to the WA government. No-one should be afraid of getting the best quality information—no-one.


I am also advised there was a contribution by the member for Groom, where he got stuck into decisions that I had made in a project in Queensland.



Mr Ian Macfarlane interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  I did not hear a word of it, but I have been advised to feel very hurt by what he said. So I would simply refer him to a letter to the editor that was published in the Financial Review yesterday where I dealt with similar allegations which had a similar level of accuracy to the ones that were made by the member for Groom. But I am sure the mistakes were entirely well meaning.


Can I commend the bill to the House. Effectively, as a result of what is in front of us today, there will be a much better quality of base level information, a much better quality of information dealing with underground water and the right set of experts across the full range that we would want to see of expertise. It will be well funded. It means future decisions will be well informed as a result of the decisions taken in the parliament this day.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (18:55):  In addressing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and related bills, let me begin with some history about the successes and failures of support for and management of renewable energy in Australia.


It was the coalition which created, developed and implemented the mandatory renewable energy target—successfully. It was the coalition which created, developed and implemented the then equivalent of the solar PV rebate—successfully. It was the coalition which created, developed and implemented the solar hot water rebate—successfully. By comparison, what we have had from this government is the Home Insulation Program, which on any account is arguably Australia's most dramatic policy failure on the domestic front since the Second World War. Two billion dollars were largely wasted, including $500 million simply to fix the roofs—over 70,000 repairs, removals or variations to the work done, and that is still knowing that there are hundreds of thousands of other jobs out there which will never be inspected by this government. There were, of course, 200 house fires, and the link to four of the most terrible tragedies.


But this government also created the Green Start program and the Green Loans program. Green Loans cost over $100 million for barely more than 1,000 loans: $100,000 per loan on average for loans which were literally a few thousand dollars. It was a monumental failure which in any other period of government would be classified as the standout failure of that administration, but it is dwarfed by the failures of the Home Insulation Program.


The Green Start program, which never actually started in any meaningful way, was terminated very shortly after it was announced. The cash-for-clunkers program was announced by this government as their centrepiece of the last election's climate change policy, only to be brought to its knees not that long after the new government was created because it was a policy that was so bad it should never have seen the light of day. The citizens assembly was created to randomly select 150 Australians from the phone book to determine the policy which the government dared not take to the last election.


And now we have potentially the largest waste of money of all, and that is the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the $10 billion clean energy fund which, even if it is successful, creates no net new renewable energy. It beggars belief that this government is proposing to spend $10 billion and there is not one megawatt, not one kilowatt and not one watt more of renewable energy which will be generated by 2020 as a consequence of this $10 billion. Let me look at the deep fundamental and structural flaws at the heart of this bill and explain why, whilst the opposition fully supports the 20 per cent renewable energy target, we believe that this bill is ill conceived, ill constructed and doomed to failure. I will do so in two phases: first by looking at the prospects even if there were the implausible case that all of the investments proposed were successful, and then by looking at the overwhelmingly more likely case of what happens if there are failures. Because, when you look around the world and at the history of investment by this government, this policy is doomed to failure and doomed to waste literally billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. This is money that comes from the work of shop assistants, plumbers, nurses and people who are working each and every day to pay their taxes, and their money will be wasted.


Let us begin with the concept, which is so fundamentally flawed. It would seem that spending $10 billion on renewable energy would get you something. What is proposed here is that the government will spend $10 billion and that therefore that will generate some form of new renewable energy. The problem, however, is that before this bill there was a 20 per cent renewable energy target. After the $10 billion included in this bill is spent, there will still be a 20 per cent renewable energy target. What does this mean? It means that any renewable energy generated as a consequence of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation investments will simply displace other renewable energy which would otherwise have come online between now and 2020. It is unarguable, it is without doubt and it is simply, palpably, absolutely the case that the government will spend $10 billion and, in a best-case, no-failure, no-problem, perfect-delivery scenario, will still produce not one gigawatt, not one megawatt, not one kilowatt and not one watt more actual renewable energy between now and 2020. That is an extraordinary example of conceptual failure.


I wonder if the minister at the table, Minister Shorten, or anybody else around the cabinet table considered the fact that for $10 billion there will not be an additional unit of energy generated at all between now and 2020. It is almost extraordinary that this policy could have been created, delivered and funded. But the answer is very simple. It was, of course, funded as part of the trade-off with the Greens to win their support for the carbon tax. The carbon tax, of course, is an entirely different story. We know that it was conceived in the breach. The Prime Minister famously said the very day before the election, 'I rule out a carbon tax.' On the Monday before the election, the Prime Minister said, now infamously, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' So the price of that betrayal and of winning support for it included this $10 billion fund. But, as I have set out, in the best-case scenario, on the basis of perfect delivery, no new renewable energy will result. Our alternative is very simple. We have a renewable energy target. It is set to achieve 20 per cent by 2020. We support that, we helped negotiate it and it will achieve that. That will be the same result with or without this bill. It is unarguable, and anything else from the government would simply be misleading.


However—and this brings me to the second part of what I wish to say this evening—this bill will not be executed perfectly. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the clean energy fund will not be delivered as the government intends, and history shows us that on three fronts. Firstly, on the government's own performance in this country, as I mentioned at the outset, we have had pink batts, Green Loans, Green Start, cash-for-clunkers, the citizens assembly, the solar bubble and collapse and the solar hot water deception, where $44.7 million was ripped from the budgets of 2011-12 and 2012-13. This was only revealed in its full deception on budget night, and as a consequence we are seeing job losses at Rheem and Dux now. That is a list of seven failures from this government in this space.


Then we go to the broader question of comparable systems around the world. In the United States, we have seen the $700 million failure of Solyndra under the comparable US system. Beacon Power has collapsed. Ener1 has collapsed. Solar Trust of America was given a $2.1 billion line of credit from the US Department of Energy and has collapsed. It makes you think that perhaps there may be some systemic problems. The comparable program in the United States is the source of enormous division, enormous conflict and an ongoing scandal in relation to its administration, according to the Republicans in the way that they have presented. So, far from being a unifying program in the United States, it is a program which has had significant failures and is a source of deep, clear and ongoing division within the US congress.


What about Australia? Are there any comparable programs? There are. Let me point to two similar examples. The first is the ZeroGen project, which had over $100 million of co-financing from the Queensland government, delivered by Peter Beattie and, from the Australian federal government, by the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. At the time that the ZeroGen project was proposed, Ian Macfarlane, who was the relevant spokesperson for the coalition, said that it would fail. He was clear on this front. The then Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie, famously said that Ian Macfarlane was on drugs—that, of course, was false. It also turned out that Ian Macfarlane was absolutely right: the ZeroGen project collapsed. It is gone; it is finished. The public money was done. Nothing was built. There is no low-carbon, let alone zero-carbon, ZeroGen project in Queensland. The money is gone. The project is gone. The idea was flawed from the beginning. It was not well executed. Therefore, we were not surprised when that which we had warned of came to pass.


But let me explain that that $100 million was money which came from everyday Australians. It was the taxes of everyday Australians, from all walks of life. It could be from members of the Health Services Union who are cleaning hospital wards and emptying bedpans. Their taxes go directly towards a project such as ZeroGen. It collapsed and failed. So all of that work and the payment of those taxes were wasted. So let us never forget that this is nothing hypothetical. When the government wastes somebody's money, it is real, because there is a shop assistant, an orderly or a small business person who has worked to pay that money. We hold their money in trust and we have a sacred responsibility to guard it carefully.


Let us also look at the Solar Flagships program: $700 million was announced over three years ago and yet no project has been successful. We have seen the Central Queensland project effectively collapse. We saw the Moree project collapse. I hope some success comes out of them. But many days, many months and three years have passed since the world's biggest solar array was proudly announced by the once and future Prime Minister. So that is another example.


We see the litany of failures of general environmental programs: pink batts, green loans, Green Star, cash for clunkers, citizens assembly, the solar bubble and the solar hot water bubble. We see the US examples of Solyndra, Beacon Power, Ener1 and Solar Trust of America, and we see the Australian examples of ZeroGen and also Solar Flagships where nothing has come to pass. The lessons must be fairly strong.


Let us, then, come to the costs of this bill. What we have seen is that, even on the government's own modelling, even in the explanatory memorandum, there is an expected loss, out of the first $6 billion, of $1.346 billion, or $1,346.4 million. That extrapolates out, over a five-year period, to more than a $2 billion loss—that is a combination of operating costs, write-downs for commercial failures and interest forgone for the government.


Let us understand that that is a best-case scenario—$2 billion being wasted over five years. That is a profound amount of money. And that is from a government which has not been highly successful in its other predictions in relation to comparable programs or allied environmental programs. Huge amounts of money have been wasted, to no effect. So, on its own best-case scenario, over five years we are looking at $2 billion of public money gone—written off; wasted.


Finally, we come to the fact that there is an impact on existing projects. It changes the financing regimes. It changes the competitive regimes. It changes the merit order. So it has a sovereign risk impact on existing investments in the space because, if they are displaced by subsidised projects, it has an impact on their ability to compete on level terms in the renewable energy space. That is another example of ill-thought-through consequences. I have a respect for the individuals involved who have sought to assist in this. But it is the fundamental design at the heart of government from people who have repeatedly shown an inability to apply government programs to the commercial environment with disastrous consequences.


Against all that background, what we saw yesterday was quite extraordinary: a two-hour hearing for $10 billion—$5 billion an hour—for a parliamentary inquiry. That inquiry was called on Friday. It was delivered on Monday. There was no ability for the public to have input. It was carried out over two days, and my understanding is that it will report tomorrow. What we had was not a parliamentary inquiry but a show trial. So that was an abuse of parliament and an abuse of the confidence of the public, and it is likely to be a fatal abuse of taxpayers' money.


In opposing this bill and the three related bills which extend the scope of the carbon tax to cover LPG, LNG and CNG, let me be clear on behalf of the opposition: the Clean Energy Finance Corporation $10 billion slush fund is destined to fail. Even in the unlikely event that it succeeds, what we will see is not one watt of additional renewable energy between now and 2020. In its design and its concept, this structure, this system will, on a best-case scenario, spend $10 billion and Australia will not have an additional watt of renewable energy between now and 2020. For those reasons, we oppose this bill and these allied bills, and we do so with every ounce of vigour.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (19:13):  I rise to voice my strong support for the clean energy bills before the House with a little bit more vigour than those opposite and than was evident in the member for Flinders's speech. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012 and Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012 are all part of the Gillard Labor government's commitment to move Australia towards a clean energy future.


Obviously, we have seen bipartisan support for these endeavours at the 2007 and 2010 elections—the same targets in terms of combating dangerous climate change gases, and the same clean energy targets of 20 per cent, on both sides of the chamber. It is good to see this bipartisan support in acting to ensure that our grandchildren and great-grandchildren have a world to inherit. I welcome the creation of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation as part of a raft of government initiatives designed to support the way we combat the impacts of dangerous and costly climate change. Investment in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will go a long way towards delivering major new private investment in clean energy projects and the supply chains that feed into these projects.


The bills outline numerous measures that serve to improve the Carbon Farming Initiative, enhance the security of the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units—which I think might have flowed from some Howard government initiatives from 2007—and develop working relationships with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Clean energy is a concept that has been much debated in this chamber, despite that bipartisan support for the same targets. Time and time again, the Labor government has taken action to set Australia on a course to a clean energy future, a gentle change in direction, but an important economic change of direction in terms of the glide path of where we will end up. As everybody knows, there are lower costs if we act now rather than later, but unfortunately time and time again the coalition has tried to sabotage these efforts in an attempt to score cheap political points rather than considering the nation's interests.


Today I went on the web to have a look at the coalition's direct action plan on environment and climate change—I presume the policy came out before the 2010 election—to get an idea of the details embraced by those opposite. I will be generous and say that the direct action plan is probably a little bit outdated, but it does seem to be very costly—over $3.2 billion forecast over four years. I am not quite sure whether that has moved on or whether it is going to be compressed, but it is the current policy as seen on the Liberal Party webpage. It is a little bit unrealistic, outdated and perhaps even counter-productive. I would be gravely concerned for our nation's environmental legacy and our economic preparedness under an Abbott-led coalition government. 


A nation's environmental legacy is what these clean energy bills before the chamber are all about—that is, what we leave behind for our children. The decisions we make in this chamber and the decisions voters make at the ballot box shape this nation for our descendants to inherit. I want my sons and their children and grandchildren to live in an Australia that did what was needed and when it was needed, even if it meant losing a bit of political skin. We need to do this to preserve the environment and work with the rest of the world in addressing climate change. Australia, while a young nation, has always had a proud record of being a good global citizen, whether it be Billy Hughes' actions after World War I—there was a lot of skin in that game after 60,000 Australians died in that conflict—or Doc Evatt in the first days of the United Nations. More recently, we can look to the former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and his actions in Antarctica or to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Griffith, with his endeavours in Libya. As a nation we do our bit and a little bit more, I would suggest. That is why this nation is putting a price on carbon in 30 or so days. It is about cutting pollution, creating clean energy jobs and making sure our economy is ready for this transformation that the world is undertaking. We proudly play our role in reducing global greenhouse emissions, and we will be well positioned to compete in a world moving to lower carbon technologies. 


As a Queenslander, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, you know that we as a state, the worst per capita polluter in the world, are taking some action to prepare our economy. We will not be alone. We are joining many countries around the world that are already taking action. In fact, 89 countries have already committed, and many are acting right now to take steps to address climate change. We saw the courage of the Koreans, one of our major trading partners—I have certainly heard the member for North Sydney talk a lot about Korea—which overnight committed to putting a price on greenhouse gases by 2015. Globally, more money is now invested in renewable power than in conventional high-pollution energy generation. The rest of the world is acting, and we must act with them and, more importantly, not be left behind. 


We are doing the right things for the right reasons, but it has not been easy. As anyone would know, there is a big scare campaign that is confusing and frightening many Australians with exaggerated cost estimates and exaggerated claims and hyperbole about what is going to happen. It suggests that the sky will fall in at midnight on 30 June and the world as we know it will end. That is not the reality. We are talking about a gentle change in direction, a glide path that will gently shape the Australian economy. This fear mongering, I would suggest, will be proved a foolish fallacy, come 1 July. In 20 years or in 50 years we will see just how stupid it was, just as if we look back 20 years ago to how people reacted to the High Court's decision on 3 June about Mabo. At the time there was hysteria—backyards were going to be taken—but, 20 years on, we look back and see that it was the appropriate thing to do at the time. It was a tough thing for Prime Minister Keating to do at the time, and perhaps he did not reach the decision as easily as he might have, but he then had the courage to lead the nation into doing the right thing. 


The honourable member for Warringah has neglected to mention that many vulnerable Australians, including many pensioners, will end up coming out ahead after the carbon price starts in little over a month from now. In Moreton alone, 16,000 pensioners—I note Minister Macklin at the table—will receive a cash payment over the coming weeks ahead of the introduction of the carbon price. All full and part pensioners in Moreton will receive a lump-sum payment of $250 if they are single and $380 for couples. Local pensioners will get another boost with an ongoing increase to their fortnightly payments from March 2013. In total, local pensioners will get around $338 extra a year for singles and $510 extra for couples. About 93 per cent of all pensioner households will be at least 20 per cent better off because of these new payments. We are talking about a gentle tax to change behaviour. If they are like many seniors that I know—people who do know where to find their jumpers, do know where to turn the lights switches off—they will find that it will not be the fear and doom and gloom, the jeremiad that those opposite would suggest. And, obviously, the money that the member for Jagajaga is putting in their pockets will be a reward for their years of service to the Australian community.


The member for Warringah does not want to hear about that and he certainly does not want to admit this to the Australian public. He more than any other member of parliament at the moment can hear the clocks in this House ticking loudly, because he knows that, as the days tick down towards 1 July, his campaign, his house of cards, the flimflam attack, the flimflam man, will find out that the world is different. His continued negativity on tackling climate change unfortunately has created a little bit of uncertainty in some markets, particularly the electricity market, which has hurt our economy and damaged the efficient functioning of the NEM and our energy markets. He has come a long way from his 2009 Lateline statement, where he supported an emissions trading scheme. He said:


We don't want to play games with the planet. So we are taking this issue seriously and we would like to see an ETS.


I agree with him. It would have been great to have an ETS. Obviously, that was before the member for Warringah knocked off the member for Wentworth in the leadership change early in December 2009 on that climate change sceptic ticket. I think the votes were 42 to 41, from memory. One person was absent, so did not actually vote, and one person could not bring themselves to vote for either of them, so I am not sure what their intentions were, even with two people on the ticket. Unfortunately we have not seen that sort of commitment from the opposition leader. As I said, the direct action plan that I have had a look through is quite different.


Like many other MPs I do have serious questions about Mr Abbott's direct action plan, particularly in the context of our shared Renewable Energy Targets. I have a lot of concerns about how this will impact on investment in solar, because I do believe as a Queenslander that we have great opportunities in solar. I was a bit disappointed to see one of the solar programs of the Queensland government scrapped the other day. I also think we have great potential in geothermal. I look forward to the Queensland government and the federal government working together to develop some of those geothermal resources. I would like to snatch some of those projects away from South Australia, hopefully.


We are only 30 or so days out from the start of our price on greenhouse gases. It is at this moment that I would like to have a look at some of the direct action plan policy. They are talking about creating a band within the Renewable Energy Target which would be reserved for emerging technologies such as big solar. I have a bit of a concern about that. If there were an addition to the 20 per cent target I could see the logic in that. If the coalition were to introduce a banded RET it would see solar built at the expense of other projects that are already in the pipeline—perhaps some of those geothermals, perhaps some of those other renewables like wave. That would create instability for renewable energy investors, and that is not a mature investment sector at the moment, even though, as I said, there is a lot of global money being pumped into this area.


The other policy in the direct action plan is to invest $100 million each year for an additional one million solar energy homes by 2020. As I said, this is the 2010 election policy, so it is slightly out of date. We are already on track for one million rooves by the end of 2014, so this plan as printed today is out of date and behind the times. As at April 2012, we are already in excess of 677,000 solar power systems, whereas the direct action plan estimates 275,000 by the end of 2012. I think they might need to update this document.


In their solar cities program, which I think was touched on by the member for Flinders, projects were announced for Adelaide, Townsville, Blacktown, Alice Springs and Central Victoria, 'providing practical benefits for the community, including PV, solar hot water and smart meters on public and private buildings'. The reality is that these are already solar cities, so I am not sure why we would need to go back and have a policy where we are going to try and take lessons from these. I think we should just let the industry get on with what it is already delivering.


The other surprising commitment is to fund 125 mid-scale solar projects in schools and communities. But we had 784 schools provided with solar power systems in the last funding round of the National Solar Schools Program, and already over 4,000 have been installed. I know this, because it is something I have been trying to push in my electorate. The schools are already ahead of the politicians. When complete next year, 70 per cent of schools will have a solar power system.


I would suggest there are some serious funding questions as well in this direct action plan. That cost of $1,300 per household is too high. It is time for the coalition, obviously, to reconsider this policy. I would ask for it to reconsider the scare campaign, although I would suggest it is going to be ramped up on the shrill factor to 11 in the lead-up to 30 June.


As a parliament everyone agrees—both sides of the chamber—that we need to take climate change seriously. There are really not too many sceptics that have got a voice on that side of the chamber. We need to do more so that we take action. The bills before the House are part of this plan. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012 and the Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012 are another step in the right direction and I commend them to the House.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (19:28):  I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and related bills. Well, I had to go and look at the running order a few minutes ago because I was confused. The member for Moreton did not seem to talk to the bills in any sense. It surprised me because, as the lead speaker for the government on supposedly one of their most significant initiatives, all we heard was 15 minutes of negativity and an avoidance of the big issues in this. There was no attempt to justify this carbon tax and all the related regulations and difficulties and costs that are going to be incurred by businesses and households, by the whole community. All we heard was a whole lot of platitudes intermingled with endless negative abuse of this side of politics.


This Clean Energy Finance Corporation is the product, unfortunately, of grubby politics. It is the product of a desperate last-minute deal, a $10 billion political bribe to win the support of the Greens for a carbon tax—pure and simple. That is what it is. Once again the Prime Minister caved in to the demands of the Greens and once again Australians will pay very heavily for this weakness and this lack of principle in dealing with major policy issues. 


Setting up a government bank with borrowed billions, underwritten by taxpayers, to invest in high-risk ventures should be a thing of the past in this country. Hasn't this government learnt anything from past debacles such as Tricontinental, Western Australia Inc. and the State Bank of South Australia? These were the investments and the types of organisations which helped create the brand image of those on the other side of politics of being unable to manage money—and it was a well-earned reputation. You would think people would learn from their mistakes, but here we go again, just because the Prime Minister sought to save her political skin at any cost to the taxpayer. Has this government not learnt from the US government's costly attempts to pick winners in renewable energy? Names like solar panel manufacturer Solyndra come to mind: it went bankrupt after receiving $500 million in loan guarantees and it cost 1,100 jobs. Others to go under in the US include Evergreen Solar, SpectraWatt and Beacon Power.


This Clean Energy Finance Corporation is the price Labor is happy to pay for Greens backing. It is the Bob Brown bank—the Bob Brown who has dictated so many of the stupid, irresponsible and dangerous decisions that this government has subsequently sought to introduce since the first weeks of this government when it caved in on so many things, and has since proceeded to cave in, in order to placate the Greens. The nation will pay heavily in all sorts of ways, and this Clean Energy Finance Corporation is another one.


Tricontinental was a merchant bank arm of the State of Bank of Victoria, and the State Bank collapsed under the weight of the $3.5 billion in bad loans made to the corporate cowboys of the 1980s by Tricon. The Review Panel of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation says of the CEFC initially that 'it is anticipated that the majority of its investment will be loans'. That reminds us very much of the State Bank and Tricontinental. For the CEFC, the $10 billion of borrowed money will be over five years starting in 2013-14, with the first $2 billion instalment to be paid into a special account in July 2013—in all likelihood, just prior to the election. It is to be invested in projects the banks would not touch with a barge pole. This is the stupidity of this proposal. It is money that will be mostly hidden from the budget bottom line, covering up their mistakes. If you did include this money you would see it eating into the forecast surplus. Over the forward estimates, $6 billion will be pumped into the CEFC. Just $320 million shows up in the underlying cash balance. This supposedly includes a 'prudent recognition that some investments will not be recovered'. Taxpayers will carry both the hidden debt exposure and the interest rate exposure. In Senate estimates, Treasury conceded it had factored in that 7.5 per cent of invested capital would not be recovered. On $10 billion, that is $750 million that is expected to be lost—just a lazy $750 million of borrowed money. This is a government with no sense of the value of money. It sees its value only in what it can deliver in a political sense to the government. It would be the most Pollyanna assumption that it will only lose $750 million. The way this government manages money, it will be billions.


The CEFC along with the National Broadband Network white elephant are reasons debt continues to rise despite Labor claiming to be returning to surplus. They have a $300 billion debt ceiling included in the budget legislation, an increase of $50 billion, and yet they claim they are going to surplus. It is an absolute joke. It is a deliberate deception. It is tens of billions of dollars that should be on the budget bottom line. It should be, but it is not. This is a government which is into deception and spin and irresponsible investment of taxpayers' money. Now they are borrowing billions and billions more, and the taxpayer will have to pay this back at some stage.


There are precedents in the budget papers as to why the CEFC should be on budget. There is an existing program which was announced as a budget measure only 12 months before the last one, in the 2011-12 in budget. At page 304 of Budget Paper No. 2 it is there in black and white:


The Government will provide $108.7 million over 14 years to support the development and commercialisation of renewable energy technologies by making early-stage equity investments that leveraged private funds.


Doesn't it sound very familiar? It sounds exactly like the description of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. I would like the next speaker to explain to the parliament what the difference is. There is no difference, we all know that. This is a cheap political stunt to get money off the bottom line and to try to save the skin of this Prime Minister. The only difference is the scale of the investment. It is an identical fund—one is on the budget; one is off. 


The government says that this corporation will be independent. The Leader of the Greens, Christine Milne, states:


It is an independent authority, it isn't something that's going to have political interference.


These bills make it clear that this will not be independent. The board members—the chair and up to six others—will be appointed and removed by the government. Of course, there is no political interference or political direction! The government's board will appoint the CEO after consulting key ministers, but there is no political interference! There is independence, of course, but they must consult key ministers before they make a decision. The government will inevitably also consult the Greens. These bills also give the responsible ministers 'powers of direction over the broad mandate of the Corporation'. It puts a lie to what Senator Milne had to say. They will say anything in order to justify the unjustifiable. 


The most absurd thing is that the renewable energy target was 20 per cent before this was announced and it is 20 per cent after it was announced. This is the reason this finance corporation should never exist. There is no justification. $10 billion will not increase the level of renewable energy in the grid because the target remains the same. What an absurdity! They bring in a carbon tax which morphs into an emissions trading scheme and they set a target of 20 per cent, and the credits that are issued each year will relate to how well the economy is achieving against that target. All we are seeing with this corporation is that the sale of carbon permits will be adjusted to meet the target and all the CEFC will do is see what would otherwise be cheaper emission reductions replaced by more expensive emission reductions. That is a fact confirmed by so many and yet this government has gone ahead with the scheme. All it will do is increase the cost of achieving an emissions reduction. And this is the government that talks about implementing a market based scheme!


The expert advisory panel, in its report, highlights these inherent risks. It says that a commercial investment filter will be applied to potential projects. The panel says:


The filter will not be as stringent as the private sector equivalent, as the CEFC has a public policy purpose.


Consequently, it has different risk/return requirements. For a given return, the CEFC may take on higher risk and, for a given level of risk, due to positive externalities, may accept a lower financial return.


What all that gobbledegook is saying is that this is a recipe to waste money we do not have. It is a recipe to waste borrowed money which taxpayers will have to repay. It is another symbol of Labor not been able to manage money.


The bill's explanatory material states:


The investment mandate will be in the form of a written legislative instrument. Because the investment mandate represents the policy direction of the Government and has the potential to impact on the Commonwealth Budget, it will be a non-disallowable instrument.


It has just smashed through this parliament and it is indefensible. It will increase dramatically the cost of achieving emissions and it will do nothing to increase the emissions in the country because of the cap.


There is an inexplicable omission. The fund is barred from supporting carbon capture and storage initiatives. The review panel observed:


With the abundance of coal in Australia, our cost of electricity is one of the lowest in the world.


Under a section titled 'Exclusions' it states: The government has announced the CEFC will not invest in Carbon Capture and Storage projects or technology.


Again, this is the Greens lording it over the government and lording it over the community. It is blind ideology. To the Greens, fossil fuels are the devil incarnate. They cannot be used. Irrespective of whether we could make the coal cleaner in order to maintain comparative advantage and our cheap electricity that we have enjoyed for 100-plus years, the CEFC deliberately sets out to erode this. It just shows the extent to which this government and this Prime Minister have so tugged their forelocks to the Greens party, which has been at the centre of so many of the cost increases that have been incurred over the last 18 months to two years, and it is demonstrably and rapidly making many areas of Australian business uncompetitive. When this carbon tax comes in we will see a real manifestation of how our competitive position can be eroded so dramatically on so many fronts.


So who will benefit from this slush fund? We will see the white shoe salesman and the dodgy operators that give the many reputable renewable energy businesses a bad name. This is exactly what happened with the pink batts. We have union funds, of course. It is no coincidence that the super funds are heavily invested in renewable energy projects. It will be a great temptation for the CEFC to give support to many of the investments on a non-commercial basis.


This piece of legislation is extremely dangerous and unnecessary and it should be stopped in its tracks. We should return to managing government money in a sensible and proper fashion.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (19:43):  After that performance I think the House could profit from some information about the bills that we are debating. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 establishes the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It empowers the corporation to invest directly and indirectly in financial assets for the development of Australian based renewable energy technologies, low-emission technologies and energy efficiency projects. The significant thing about this is that it is a measure designed to support, promote and develop Australian industry and to enable us to take advantage of renewable energy technologies, something we have really failed to do, unfortunately, in the years gone by. We have to a considerable degree missed out on what has been an emerging, growing area of technological development and manufacturing jobs. 


The accompanying bills to be passed with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 by 1 July will provide market certainty around the changes. In April the government released the expert review panel's report on the design of the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The government accepted the recommendations of that report and is implementing them through this bill. Clean energy technologies face a range of obstacles in attracting financing: current global financial conditions, the complex nature of Australia's electricity markets, the cost of renewable energy and preference of investing institutions for listed assets inhibit the financing of the clean energy sector. The corporation will invest in financial assets for the development of Australian based renewable energy technologies, low-emission technologies and businesses that supply the required inputs which are critical areas to the transformation of the Australian economy. It will leverage private sector financing.


The bill requires the corporation to have at least half of its investments in renewable energy technology by 30 June 2018 and thereafter. It is expected that the corporation will apply a commercial filter when making its investment decisions, focusing on projects and technologies at the later stages of development. The filter will not be as stringent as the private sector equivalent, as the corporation has a public policy purpose and values any positive externalities that are generated. By using a commercial filter, it is expected the corporation will invest responsibly and manage risk so it is financially self-sufficient and achieves a target rate of return. The government will provide $2 billion of funding to the corporation per annum for five years, starting in 2013-14, with profits—including any capital and interest earned—available for reinvestment. The corporation will make individual investment decisions independently of the government.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is part of a suite of government initiatives designed to transform the Australian economy for a cleaner energy future. The government's $10 billion investment in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will play a vital role in unlocking significant new private investment in clean energy projects and the supply chain that feeds into these projects. Australia's clean energy market is an early stage market, categorised by incomplete knowledge and limited experience of risk. This means that there are barriers inhibiting the effective allocation of capital. 


The expert review chaired by Jillian Broadbent identified a number of common barriers inhibiting financing of the clean energy sector, such as availability and cost of finance. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will make investments and encourage private sector investment in clean energy technologies, but there may still be market barriers that prevent these projects going ahead—for example, if investors are not familiar with emerging technologies. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will have tools at its disposal to tailor investments to address market barriers. These tools include a capacity to provide funds, change the allocation of risk amongst participants and offer a concessional cost of funds. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will act as a catalyst to private investment which is currently not available, and thereby contribute to carbon reduction and cleaner energy. It is not the intention of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to directly compete with the private sector. Rather, it will seek to leverage more private sector investment.


The introduction of a carbon price is the key to changing the underlying economics of clean energy projects and making them more competitive. A carbon price in conjunction with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will build on the government's investments in new renewable technologies and better and more efficient ways of using our energy resources. These efforts will create an incentive to reduce emissions, drive investment in renewable and low-emission technologies, create certainty for business investment and begin the adjustment of our economy to a cleaner energy future.


The member for Goldstein queried the purpose of the legislation and of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We need to say that this is a measure to boost Australian manufacturing. The carbon pricing mechanism and, in the particular, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, will generate additional manufacturing opportunities for Australian firms. Australia could become a world leader in creating green industries, generating up to a million green collar jobs by 2030 and multibillion dollar export opportunities in green technology. Australia is well placed to lead an economic renewal based around clean industries and green jobs, but we will need to act quickly to compete with countries such as Germany and Denmark, which are already greening their workforces and dominating the international green market in solar and wind technology.


The good news is that there has been a great deal of work done to kick-start the structural change geared towards renewable energy development. For example, the company Beyond Zero Emissions has produced a report titled Zero carbon Australia stationary energy plan, which is a 10-year road map for 100 per cent renewable energy generation, with baseload energy supplied by renewable sources at a cost of $8 per household per week, a similar electricity price rise to what may be expected in Australia's business-as-usual electricity market. The plan includes concentrating solar thermal power with molten salt storage supplying 60 per cent of electricity demand, wind supplying 40 per cent, and biomass and hydroelectricity being used as contingency backup for up to two per cent of annual demand.


This comes at a time when the world is currently experiencing a boom in clean energy investment that I think is the beginning of a new industrial revolution. Last year, a record-breaking $260 billion was invested in new renewable energy projects across the globe. In fact, clean energy investment has hit new records in seven of the last eight years, and even the oil giant BP predicts that renewables will be the fastest growing energy sector every year until at least 2030. More staggeringly, the global clean energy and environment sector is now valued at $4.7 trillion, which is three times Australia's annual gross domestic product. Last year was also the first year when clean energy investment exceeded investment in fossil fuels, led by skyrocketing investments in countries like America, China, India and Brazil. These investments now underpin between 2.3 to three million jobs in clean energy industries worldwide. Globally, more renewable energy was built last year than fossil fuel energy. The Chinese solar industry is leading the way, and it is claimed that solar will be cheaper than coal within a decade.


Australia has what it takes to be leading this race: world-class renewable energy resources, a skilled workforce and a proud history of innovation. However, of that $260 billion which I mentioned was being invested last year, only $4.7 billion of it was in Australia. So we have been missing out and I think it is an excellent time for us to be investing in clean energy. Australians overwhelmingly support a renewable energy future for Australia. Close to 90 per cent support greater investment in clean energy and 80 per cent of Australians believe that clean energy investment is good for jobs.


A recently released report by 100% Renewable Energy shows the results of a poll conducted through the first half of this year of 12,000 Australians on their attitudes to solar energy. Ninety-four per cent of the respondents said they wanted to see big solar projects built in Australia and 95 per cent wanted to see governments investing in big solar projects. While respondents understand that the private sector will do the heavy lifting, they do expect governments to lead. Governments in many of the major economies of the world are moving strongly to create jobs in solar industries of the future and to safeguard their environments and energy grids with safe, clean solar power. A number of themes emerged through the comments that were made in this poll, which included the risk of Australia getting left behind, falling costs of solar, the need to move away from coal and gas, the opportunities in jobs and regional development, and the desire for political leadership. The results of this poll show that Australia is ready for its leaders, of all political parties, to embrace the huge opportunities that are out there in renewable energy such as solar power. The community is calling for it, business is ready to invest and we have the resources.


Australia is one of the sunniest countries on earth and yet our largest solar power station is a mere 1.2 megawatts. With the sun drenched landscape so much a part of Australia's identity, it makes sense for us to be using this valuable resource to supply energy for our nation. We are embracing solar panels on our rooftops—and I think that is terrific—but we have so far not grasped the opportunity of large-scale solar power to generate electricity, employment and energy stability into the future. Solar thermal power plants that store the sun's energy after the sun goes down can provide baseload power for our industries, while solar PV at utility scale is expected to be cheaper than coal or gas by the middle of this decade. In combination with other renewable technologies such as wind, solar power can make our power supply cheaper and cleaner and just as reliable as that which we enjoy now. Investment in large-scale solar will also set Australia up to benefit from stable electricity prices for decades to come in a way that coal and gas, with their exposure to volatile international energy markets, can no longer guarantee.


The high level of community support for investment in new solar technology demonstrates the importance of bodies like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Communities are seeking bipartisan support for this kind of investment. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation could deliver five gigawatts of solar PV and two gigawatts of solar thermal by 2020, which is the equivalent of seven large coal fired power stations. I think it comes at exactly the right time to give Australia the leg-up that we need to enter the global renewable energy race. It will overcome the barriers which have stymied our clean energy sector for too long, and unlock significant new investment and jobs in Australia. Despite the uncertain global economy, this sector is set to become one of the biggest industries of tomorrow. In conjunction with our 20 per cent renewable energy target, it will deliver diversity in our mix of energy as 'insurance to Australia securing the lowest cost of energy in a carbon constrained world', and it will create tens of thousands of jobs to underpin a strong future economy. It equips Australia with a suite of policies that can pull emerging clean energy technologies right through the innovation chain, helping turn great Australian innovation into real clean energy projects.


Australians are great innovators. We live in a country endowed with some of the best renewable energy resources of any country in the world: sun, wind, oceans and hot rocks. However, as a nation we have been stumbling along in the global race to take advantage of the global boom in renewable energy. As I mentioned before, it was a $243 billion industry in 2010, and it is expected to attract $5.7 trillion of investment globally over the next 25 years. Countries like China, South Korea, Germany and the US, frankly, have been leaving us for dead, often using technologies that were developed here. We should be winning this race. We have what it takes to lead the world into a renewable energy future. Instead we have allowed other nations with less technological innovation and fewer natural resources to get ahead. Our universities have consistently delivered world-leading innovation in renewable energy, but, when it comes time for commercialising these technologies, a pattern has emerged that sees the innovations going offshore. We can and should put a stop to this. These have been missed opportunities for our manufacturing industries and a failure to capitalise on and maximise our job creation.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is designed to take our best renewable energy innovation to full-scale commercial operation. In conjunction with putting a price on pollution and building on the 20 per cent renewable energy target, the corporation is a critical policy that will deliver Australians clean energy cheaper and sooner. I commend the bills to the House.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (19:58):  Tonight, I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and other associated legislation: the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, the Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012 and the Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012. For the most part, though, my focus tonight will be on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012. I think it is important to understand the genesis of this bill. This bill is very separate to the announcement made by the government to introduce the carbon tax and all of the associated legislation that goes with it. The genesis of this bill was cooked up between the Labor government and the Greens at the direction of the Greens because they wanted to invest $10 billion of taxpayer money into renewable energy projects of their own choosing. At the time Senator Milne commented on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, or as it has colloquially become known 'the Bob Brown bank', and said:


With a legislatively guaranteed stream of funding outside the budget, no future government will be able to undermine it without changing legislation.


That is the point of the legislation that has been brought before this House. This legislation is designed to make it very difficult for any other government to undo. What does it seek to do? According to the government, it seeks to invest in financial assets for the development of Australian based renewable energy technologies, low-emission technologies and energy efficient projects. It has the power to enter into investment agreements and make investments through subsidiaries. It has a duty to ensure that, as of 1 July 2018, half the funds invested at that time for the purposes of its investment function are invested in renewable energy technology.


The legislation also sets out a special account through which it will operate. Into this account $2 billion of taxpayer money per annum will be paid for the next five years, with the first instalment due to be paid on 1 July 2013 and each subsequent year after that, totalling $10 billion. It has the purpose of making payments to the CEFC and to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA. The CEFC, according to the government, is intended to be self-sustaining once it is mature. The funds are meant to be returned to the CEFC for its investments and will be available for re-investment. That is what the government says the objectives of the bill are, and that is what it says the bill will do. However, we know that there is a huge difference between what the government says and what the government actually does.


It is important to note that the consultation on this bill has been negligible. The consultation process has been virtually zip. When you consider that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics is currently still looking at this bill—the report has not even been tabled—yet the government is debating this bill in the House. Let me just outline to you the amount of time that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics has had to look at this bill. The committee was notified on Thursday evening that a meeting was to be called because a referral had been given by the government. The committee met the following Friday morning at around 11 o'clock and it was determined by the government that the bills be referred to the committee. A media release went out that Friday afternoon calling for submissions. Submissions, of course, were closed on the Monday. So, following the weekend, submissions were closed and the only people invited to present for 2½ hours to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics were the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and the Treasury. There was no public consultation, nothing was heard by any market participants and no-one else was invited. It was effectively an in-camera job.


So, we have had one session of 2½ hours for a $10 billion bill. That is about $4 billion an hour. There has been no public consultation with industry or market participants and, as I said, the bill is still being considered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, and the report will not be tabled until tomorrow. But we know, really, that this is all a sham consultation process. Who could deduce otherwise from that timetable? The only conclusion that one could draw is that the government is seeking to avoid scrutiny of this bill because it knows it will be damned by that scrutiny.


Let us take the opportunity to have a look at what little evidence the committee could glean in that 2½ hours. Of course, the committee was shut down from any further scrutiny of the bills despite the fact that there were a number of members who sought to extend the timetable. The mandatory renewable energy target is something that is a bipartisan target of 20 per cent of mandatory renewable energy in Australia. Questions were asked. With this additional funding of $10 billion, will we see additional energy targets increase? Will we actually see more renewable energy as a result of a $10 billion 'investment' of taxpayer dollars into this renewable energy? I am sad to say that, in fact, there will be no change to the mandatory renewable energy target as a result of an additional $10 billion. I would like to quote from the evidence that was provided to the committee. My colleague Steve Ciobo asked this direct question of Treasury:


So, the purpose of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is to drive investment into renewable energy, but it is going to make zero difference to the renewable energy target. Is that correct?


Mr Waslin, who I must say had a very difficult task as a member of the Treasury in having to defend the government's policy, said:


The purpose is to overcome the financial barriers. The renewable energy target affects the pricing of renewable energy and what can be achieved, but the individual projects themselves may still have barriers which inhibit investment. The purpose of the CEFC is to address those barriers and not the target itself.


Unfortunately, the evidence was very clear that there will be no increase in the target despite the enormous expense to taxpayers of $10 billion.


Let us look at the investment mandate of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Who can forget the comments made by Paul Howes last week at the Press Club when he spoke about the need for the government to get back into the business of 'picking winners'? He need not have been too concerned because, of course, the Greens are well ahead of him, except they sort of mixed up the whole picking winners aspect. They want a very different investment mandate. They in fact want the mandate to be about the riskiest types of investment—not the cheapest, not the most efficient, but the riskiest. Again, unfortunately, we heard quite a bit of evidence—and we look to the explanatory memorandum itself—that the CEFC is charged with finding technologies in the market that are effectively unproven, speculative and too risky for commercial financing.


This of course means that not all of those investments will produce a commercial return. The explanatory memorandum states:


The fiscal and underlying cash balance impacts include a prudent recognition that some investments will not be recovered, and interest revenue. The fiscal balance impact also includes the concessional component of loans.


It is very clear from this that the government expects to lose money and a lot of it. When questions were asked of the Treasury about the fact that clearly there needed to be a rate of return for an investment, the Treasury were not able to define what that rate of return was. They speculated it could be the government bond rate, but they could not be certain because this is to be determined by the board. They said that no modelling had in fact been done but they had factored in that they thought that there would be 7.5 per cent a year of investments not recovered. When we consider that there is $2 billion of investment each year, we are talking about $150 million each and every year.


The Treasury said that this was a conservative estimate. When they were pressed on exactly how this was conservative—how 7½ per cent a year of the investment not being recovered, leaving aside the rate of return, was conservative—they had to take on notice how they had actually devised this figure. This is very concerning for everybody on this side of the chamber and it should be concerning to people on the other side of the chamber as well. It is something that we are exercised about, and I want to quote from some of the evidence. My colleague Mr Ciobo asked about the success rate. He said, 'You are predicting a 92.5 per cent success rate, which assumes that 7.5 per cent of the investments are not recovered.' Mr Nicol replied:


At the moment that is our best guess.


I think that is the key word there; it is a 'guess'—nothing more, nothing less. In fact, the government simply does not know.


More than this, the government says that the point of this bill is to have Australian investments in renewable energy. When you actually look at the bill, at clause 61, when they talk about Australian based investments it is very clear that the Australian based investments that are spoken about are investments that are to be determined by guidelines set out by the board itself. I asked a number of questions of the Treasury on this:


What about overseas investment? What about companies that are predominantly owned by foreign or overseas investors?


Mr Waslin from the Treasury replied:


We are talking about where the assets would be located and not the ownership.


I said:


So, so long as the assets are here, for the purpose of this section of the bill, you would say that that makes it an Australian-based investment?


He replied:


Yes.


I said:


Irrespective of the fact that the guidelines have not yet been drafted? 


He replied:


That is what is behind the solely or mainly based. It is a similar approach to what the UK Green Investment Bank is also taking. 


I said:


But it would be up to the board to take a different view? 


And the Treasury had to conclude that in fact it is entirely up to the board.


In the time remaining I would like to point out that there are a number of regulations that would go with this bill, yet these regulations have not been sighted. They are regulations that go to the heart of this bill. It causes us great concern that we have not been able to sight these regulations. We are also very concerned about the appropriation that has been provided to the CEFC for their ongoing costs: around $57.3 million over the forward estimates. This is drastically differently to the operating costs of the Inspector-General of Taxation, at around $1.5 million. When you look closely at the legislation there is nothing to prohibit the board setting very high salaries, for instance, for the CEO. There is no limitation on that amount. Again, it is entirely at the discretion of the board.


We are told by the Treasury, by the government, that the CEFC is going to be totally self-sufficient by 2015-16, yet there is no evidence to support this. It is merely a hope. It is merely something that the government wishes to be. Again, there is no evidence to support the statements that have been made. So what do we know? We know that this is $10 billion of taxpayers' money, $10 billion that has to be borrowed, $10 billion that will have to be paid for by not only this generation of Australians but future generations. What will we get for this? It is totally unclear.


The government has avoided scrutiny at every opportunity because it knows that the bill does not stand up to scrutiny. If those on the other side thought that these investments were so wonderful, they themselves would invest their own money in these investments. The ministers on the other side would put their superannuation funds in the hands of the CEFC. But I bet you they will not, and the reason they will not is that they know what we know: that this is bad legislation. The returns will be negligible, if anything, and it is an indictment on this government that this legislation has been brought forward.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (20:14):  How exciting it is to be able to speak on this visionary bill, and how disappointing it is to hear what should be the bright young future of the Liberal Party lining herself up with the dinosaurs on the front bench. What a giveaway it was to hear the member for Goldstein talk about this bill and lump it in with the NBN. Nothing could explain or illustrate to you better the lack of vision, the lack of imagination, that this coalition demonstrates. It is the sort of issue we face with a party and a coalition that is unable to meet the challenges that confront this country not only in relation to climate change but in relation to the economic needs of this country in being able to diversify our economy into the future. We heard reference to the consultation and development of this project. It makes me laugh when we think back to the Howard government's $10 billion water plan on the beer coaster that did not even go through cabinet compared to the extensive development that went into this project. We also heard the member for Flinders talk about the Howard government's record in introducing a mandatory renewable energy target. The shame of the Howard years was that through that 12-year period we saw our renewable energy generation capacity decline from 10 per cent to nine per cent. That was an incredibly shameful record of lost opportunities.


This bill is not just about climate change. In fact, you do not even have to believe in climate change to support this bill, because this bill is all about tackling those economic challenges we face, the challenges that are generated by the mining boom and the need to have an economy where we are investing in infrastructure, skills and innovation. This bill really addresses the innovation aspect of that trifecta. It also addresses the needs we will have in energy security and the needs we will have to improve the health of our population. We have the health minister here with us tonight. There are significant benefits to be had from cleaning up the air in our major cities and from getting to renewable energy. Remember, this is the move from non-renewable energy—in other words energy that will expire—to renewable energy.


In every development, every technological advancement and market improvement in human history there is always a period where price competitiveness is an issue in the introduction of new technologies. The first time you went out and bought a plasma TV they cost $12,000. They are now pushed out the door for less than $1,000. What we intend to do with measures like these is get that impetus, the strategic weight behind the shift to renewable energy. And then, as the market share increases, the volume increases and the technology improves so the price comes down. In effect, what we are doing for Australians through measures like these is delivering them a future of cheaper energy in the long-term, as renewable energy sources will inevitably be. It is the coalition that would deny them that future security and cheaper power.


It is important we get involved in innovation, as I mentioned. That is the challenge we face. We can see the impacts on our economy of the mining boom. I look to the example of Israel. I have been to visit Israel and looked at the way it has addressed innovation with similar constraints to Australia of not being able to compete with cheap labour from sources such as Asia. Innovation was the way it drove an economy that is leading the world in technological advance. This is a country that, I might point out, is 7,000 square kilometres smaller than my own electorate of Eden-Monaro yet has a venture capital pool of $16 billion. Certainly this has been driven by government policy creating a program very similar to this that stimulated co-investment from the private sector into innovation.


We heard the member for Higgins talk about the risk component of this project. It is precisely the fact that the culture of venture capital and risk-taking in Israel has delivered the economic benefits achieved. There is a need in this country to generate a culture of taking risk in innovation and in start-ups. This Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill will help deliver that. What am I talking about? I have an example in my own backyard of Spark Solar, the company of the wonderful young scientist Michelle McCann, who had done lots of research into more efficient solar cells. Spark Solar had proposals to develop a company in Queanbeyan which would have eventually been looking to export into our region. For the want of $2 million as a final piece of investment in that company, the whole project fell over. We cannot afford to see those sorts of projects fall over. We are seeing over a billion dollars worth of investment in my region in renewable energy projects but it is into these value added, high-tech companies that we also need to diversify. This is critical. We must get behind those entrepreneurs who we have seen bleed overseas in the past.


I am also concerned that this is an aspect of our energy security. When I was in Defence and had the Middle East desk I tracked the sources of funding coming into our region to fund radical madrassas and terrorist movements as coming from some unhealthy sources of petrodollars. We know that our country is currently 80 per cent self-sufficient in fuel supplies but within 15 to 20 years that figure will flop over. We will become 80 per cent dependent on foreign supplies, which means we will be at the mercy of OPEC and conglomerates and cartels such as that, which will add to our balance of payments deficit and fuel the sources of income to some of those unhealthy influences in our region. So it is important for us to get behind transitions as quickly as possible from fossil fuels.


There is a wonderful company near my region in the Shoalhaven called Algae Tec, which is developing brilliant technology for biodiesel fuels, and this very exciting. Projects like that will have a significant boost from these sorts of finance corporation measures. We know that these measures are intended to overcome the financial barriers to commercialising and deploying cleaner energy technologies. To move us through this process we know will take us to a 40 per cent generation figure by 2050. We are on track to achieve our 20 per cent target by 2020. These measures will get us over some of those hurdles we have experienced in investment and the timidity we have seen in investment in these sorts of industries and technologies in the past in this country.


But there are lots of measures in this bill that are to be admired for their elegance. For example, what we see with the requirement to apply a commercial filter is the combination of private sector skills and disciplines married to public policy guidance. With the funds that will be generated and that will be deployed through the appropriations, we will eventually see a self-sustaining finance mechanism. A special account will be created to manage surplus funds and to limit the corporations' need to undertake a cash management function. There will also be a mechanism whereby the board will be governed by an investment mandate from government. This will be where the public policy guidance will emerge even though there will be a high degree of independence. The sorts of directions that will appear in that mandate will deal with the issues of risk and return, eligibility criteria, investments in renewable energy technologies, low-emission technologies and energy efficiency projects, the allocation of investment, limits on concessional investments and types of financial instruments in which the corporation may invest in broad operational matters. And, very importantly, we intend to apply the Australian Industry Participation Plan framework to the corporation through this investment mandate with the objective of ensuring that Australian industry is afforded full opportunity to participate in these projects. And so this investment mandate will be in the form of a legislative instrument.


How is this being received by the business world? We know that a Deloitte study of over 40 senior executives from Australian banks, super funds, venture capital firms and major investors found that they overwhelmingly support this mechanism. Certainly, we have seen comments from the Clean Energy Council, which stated through the chief executive, Kane Thornton, that this will help bridge that gap between early research and development and the commercial rollout of clean energy technologies. The Australian Solar Energy Society said that the CEFC is set to help unlock substantial investment in community-scale, commercial-scale and large-scale solar energy. In fact, they called on the federal opposition to back the CEFC. They said that the CEFC is effectively helping to meet some of the goals that would normally be part of the philosophy of the Liberal Party—a coalition alignment—in relation to tackling climate change through commercial mechanisms and commercial filters. But, of course, we have seen the abandonment of those principles by the coalition and we have seen them so reluctant to adopt measures which actually promote business and investment through all of the propositions that we have put.


But certainly the corporation, through loans, loan guarantees and equity investment support, will begin operation, based in Sydney, in the period from about 2013-14. Of course, there is the potential through the $10 billion that this fund will have at its disposal to leverage something upwards of perhaps $100 billion in private investment through the co-investment strategies and requirements of the scheme.


I would draw the attention of members to an excellent article in the Sydney Morning Herald by the economist Simon O'Connor, who pointed to other mechanisms like these: the UK Green Investment Bank, the German development agency and the China Development Bank's $30 billion clean energy investments. We have been falling behind in this space, and the analysis that he put together is very instructive. Whereas the rest of the world is embracing this method of accelerating renewable energy investment at a time of intense global spending pressures we have been falling behind. He said:


Renewables are one of the few global industries that registered continued growth throughout the GFC. Clean energy investment is up 500 per cent since 2004.


Couple this with longer term energy forecasts and the necessity becomes very apparent. He continued:


Investing now in diverse sources is critical for the holy trinity of power: energy security, insurance against price shocks and lower energy prices.


He also stated:


Most energy analysts believe it is only a matter of time before our cheap fossil fuels inflate to international prices, all because of that very successful LNG and coal export program we've got going.


He points out:


Solar costs dropped by 50 per cent in 2011 alone.


So we are seeing that clean energy can indeed be cheaper, as I highlighted earlier with how we transition from one form of technology to the other. He also pointed out that another reason is the investment case. He stated:


Australians have more than $1 trillion invested in super funds, the majority of which is being battered by overexposure to global and domestic equity markets.


So:


… part of the solution relies on a more diverse asset allocation in pension fund portfolios.


He stated:


Indeed, when the global asset consultant Mercer investigated the overexposure of pension funds to climate risk, it came to the conclusion that 40 per cent of portfolios should be reallocated to climate-sensitive assets—such as clean energy.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation, like its global cousins, responds to these challenges by broadening the energy infrastructure assets accessible to institutional investors. The corporation will help package these clean energy assets into something that a super fund, or other large investors, can finally take a stake in.


Super funds in Australia have shown some desire already to go down this road:


Industry Funds Management owns Pacific Hydro on behalf of the industry super funds, VicSuper seeded the Cleantech Australia Fund and REST super is a cornerstone investor in a major wind farm development in Western Australia.


This, as Simon points out, is a far better mechanism than a so-called direct action policy that would require bureaucrats to pick winners. He states:


… the CEFC is a commercially driven co-investment vehicle, run by independent, financially experienced staff, chaired at this point by the impeccably credentialled Jillian Broadbent—


as he describes her. He describes this as:


… the winning strategy for mums and dads with their money in super and the investors who oversee it.


I would also like to point out, while we are at it, that in relation to the health benefits motor vehicle emissions, for example, are the main cause of outdoor pollution in Australia, accounting for about 75 per cent of that. We know that all of these particulates and pollution from the current source of non-renewable energy cause upper respiratory irritation, chronic respiratory and heart disease, lung cancer, acute respiratory infections in children and chronic bronchitis in adults, aggravating pre-existing heart and lung diseases or asthmatic attacks. In addition, short- and long-term exposures have been linked with premature mortality and reduced life expectancy.


What we can benefit from in this measure is an energy-secure and healthy future, and something that will meet the energy needs of future generations of Australians well into the future. It is this sort of creative solution to stimulate innovation and the diversified economy that this nation must have and which is long overdue. It will provide us with a potent sword to complement the shield of other measures we have introduced to slay our carbon emissions dragon. It will help us to provide the energy security, prosperity and rewarding jobs that our children have the right to expect. And it is within the gift of this generation of Australians to deliver. I commend the bill to the House.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (20:28):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and the related bills. The Rudd-Gillard government has had a lot of bad ideas. It has had a lot of ill-thought-through ideas. It has had a lot of politically motivated ideas. It has had a lot of ideas which have been very hastily put together to meet short-term political objectives without thinking through carefully whether they make good long-term economic or policy sense. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation ranks right up there with some of the very worst ideas the Rudd-Gillard government has brought forward in its deeply undistinguished nearly five-year tenure. The essence of the policy package that this House is considering this evening is that the Commonwealth government should take $10 billion of taxpayers' money, together with some running costs, and put that money into projects that the private sector would not touch. Supposedly this is going to be a commercially successful venture, yet this investment fund is constrained to invest in projects that the private sector would not touch. It is extraordinarily difficult to understand how anybody could imagine that this is going to be anything other than a spectacular financial disaster.


In the brief time available to me, I want to make three points. The first is that the rationale for this measure—the reason the House is considering it—has nothing to do with policy; it is pure politics. It is because of a promise that a desperate Prime Minister Gillard made to the Greens. The second point I want to make is that, to fund this promise, the Gillard government is spending $10 billion that it does not have. All of this is borrowed money, and they have resorted to dodgy accounting to try to hide that fact. The third point I want to make is that this is going to be a dud investment for the Australian taxpayer. Any taxpayer who thinks that we are likely to get back all or even some of the $10 billion is, I fear, going to be facing a very disappointing outcome indeed.


Let me turn to the first proposition. The reason that the House is debating the Clean Energy Finance Corporation proposal this evening is that the Gillard government was desperate to secure the political support of the Greens to cling onto government and, in turn, committed to introduce a carbon tax despite having gone to the 2010 election promising there would be 'no carbon tax under the government I lead'—the famous words of Prime Minister Gillard. In addition, the Gillard government was forced to do something that the Greens insisted on as a political price for supporting the package: the Gillard government was forced to agree to tip $10 billion of taxpayers' money into this ill-considered Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We first heard of it in July 2011 after the package negotiated between the government, the Greens and the Independents was finally announced.


Let me remind the House of the euphoric, giddy words of Greens Senator Milne, who was the co-deputy chair of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. Charged with the euphoria of victory, she said on 10 July 2011:


The Greens welcome the leap forward towards powering Australia with 100% renewable energy secured as part of the agreement to put a price on pollution announced today with the government and the independent MPs.


The Australian community is crying out for renewable energy and I am delighted that we have been able to deliver Australia's biggest ever public investment in renewable energy …


Those were the words of Greens Senator Christine Milne in July 2011 as she ecstatically claimed victory in securing this $10 billion commitment of borrowed taxpayers' money to go into this ill-conceived venture. It is noteworthy that key policy elements of what is coming before the House this evening are elements that were specifically insisted upon by the Greens. Again I go to the statement issued by Senator Milne:


Securing a guarantee of 50% of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation fund for renewable energy … is the biggest single investment in renewable energy Australia has ever made.


In other words, a key design feature of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation—an insistence that 50 per cent of the money go into renewable energy as opposed to other forms of green energy—is something that was specifically required by the Greens party, and the Labor Party and Prime Minister Gillard had no choice but to accede to that. That is the sorry history of the grubby political deal which underpins the $10 billion taxpayers' cheque that this people's House is being asked to write this evening—because that is what we are being asked to do. We are being asked to write a cheque for $10 billion of taxpayers' money with very little comfort and very little reason to believe that we are ever going to see that money again.


I need hardly remind the House that no part of this policy was taken to the last election. The Australian people were never given the opportunity to decide whether they wanted to put $10 billion of their money at risk investing in ventures which the private sector had declined to invest in. That option was never given to them, but the Labor government, in cahoots with the Greens, has decided on their behalf that apparently that is a good idea.


That brings me to the second point I wanted to make this evening. It is curious that on the one hand the government thinks this is a good idea but on the other hand it is desperate to find a way to disguise the true accounting and financial impact of this measure. To achieve the disguising of the true financial impact of this measure, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation have resorted to an accounting trick which they have resorted to several times already in the life of the Rudd-Gillard government. That accounting trick is to pretend that the money which is being spent is an equity investment in a vehicle which is going to generate a commercial return. That is the accounting trick which has been used for the National Broadband Network company, which is going to see some $20 billion, $30 billion or $40 billion—it could be $50 billion or more—of taxpayers' money squandered on an ill-conceived venture. That is the same accounting trick which this government is now using in relation to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which is again going to squander billions of dollars of taxpayers' money.


The consequence of the accounting trick—as I am sure you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Symon—is that, by treating the money as an equity investment, it is not included in what is called the underlying cash balance. The underlying cash balance is the number which is colloquially referred to as the budget bottom line. The Treasurer proudly produced a budget bottom line this year that was, for the year 2012-13, a promised surplus of a bare $1.5 billion—a derisory amount, it might be pointed out, in the context of total Commonwealth expenditure of $364 billion. But he proudly claimed that he was delivering a surplus. The point I make to you, Mr Deputy Speaker—and I am sure that, to you, being the aficionado of government accounting standards that you are, it is not a point I need to underline—is that that number is the underlying cash balance, and the $2 billion a year which is appropriated by the bill before the House this evening into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation does not appear in the underlying cash balance. If those moneys were included then it would make the forward estimates look $10 billion worse than they actually look in the numbers the Treasurer presented to this House just a few weeks ago.


Let me turn to the third point I want to make. I predict that this investment of $10 billion of taxpayers' money is going to turn out very, very badly. I predict that taxpayers are not going to see a good return on the $10 billion which this government has presumed to invest on their behalf in a range of speculative and unproven technologies—technologies so speculative and unproven that they are ones that the private sector has declined to invest in.


Let us be clear here, because there were some points made earlier by the member for Eden-Monaro which seemed designed to give a misleading impression. The coalition has no objection to a venture capital industry. The coalition has no objection to people putting money at risk in innovation, green energy or any other area of new technology. We say good luck to people who do that, and, if you make money out of it, we congratulate you. But what we also say is: that is not a proper function of governments, to put taxpayers' money at risk doing it. That is something which private business people are free to do if they want to put at risk their capital or their shareholders' capital. But the idea that taxpayers' money, collected painstakingly from millions of Australians, many of them of modest means, should be put at risk in speculative ventures where there is very little confidence that the money will ever come back is the height of irresponsibility. And for this government to be doing that in pursuit of a political objective is disgraceful.


Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have noticed, when you read the expert report prepared by Jillian Broadbent and her two eminent colleagues, that there was some very careful wording. I am looking at page 9. After describing the objective that the expert panel recommends for the CEFC, the experts go on to say:


The CEFC will be challenged in achieving this objective as there is a tension between funding the clean energy sector, applying a commercial filter, and maintaining the financial self-sufficiency of the corporation.


That is the understatement of the century. That is code for saying, 'It is extremely unlikely this organisation is ever going to make a buck.'


When officials of the Treasury department appeared before the House Standing Committee on Economics yesterday, I had the opportunity to ask them if they thought this was going to turn out to be a good investment for taxpayers. I took that opportunity to ask the question, but they declined to answer. They said it was a policy decision. And I can understand why an official facing that question would duck it, because anybody who has had any experience in this area and who has seen the sorry track record of governments marching in to invest money in areas where private sector investors have trodden more warily would know that it almost invariably ends in tears.


When we asked some further detailed questions yesterday of Treasury officials about why it was that the government is expected to be able to make money out of these kinds of investments when the private sector has not been able to, the answer that I got from Mr Waslin of the Treasury was as follows:


As I said, the government is prepared to provide funds at a target rate of return which is less than the private sector's but it does also recognise the positive externalities.


Let us put aside 'positive externalities', which is a nice bureaucratic way of saying, 'The fairies at the bottom of the garden—if we hope very, very hard, and close our eyes and hum a bit, then maybe we'll get a nice positive financial return.' Let us focus on what this particular official was really saying to the committee. What he was really saying was, 'The only reason that the government might be able to do this is because the government can live with a lower rate of return than the private sector.'


Let us just understand that point because, if you look through the expert committee report, it refers to a financial target of achieving a return equal to the government bond rate. In other words, the grand financial scheme here is: the government can borrow money at the government bond rate and therefore it can accept a commercial return which is only equal to the government bond rate and no higher. Given that the government bond rate is, by definition, lower than the cost of finance which the private sector has to pay, then, if you took that logic to its extreme, government would carry out every activity in our economy because it has a lower cost of financing. That is essentially what is being proposed in the economic logic of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation: because the government does not need such a high rate of return then it is okay for it to take a risk on investing in risky and speculative technologies in green energy where the private sector has chosen not to take that risk.


There are examples around the world of governments losing a huge amount of taxpayers' money in doing this kind of thing. If I had more time I could speak about Solyndra, a US company which received a US$535 million loan guarantee from the Obama administration in 2009; the money was all lost. I do not have time.


I will conclude by saying this. This is a really bad idea. It is going to lose a bucket of taxpayers' money. And we should reject it.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (20:43):  I would like to thank the member for Bradfield for his very positive and optimistic contribution to this evening's debate. That is the kind of positivity and optimism you might expect from Thomas Hardy or from Dickens—something of that nature—though not really unexpected from those opposite. It is interesting to me that in summary the member for Bradfield's contribution to this evening's debate is all about the inelegance and the inappropriateness of government intervention into a marketplace. It is curious therefore that his side of politics is in fact opposing one of the most significant market mechanisms that this country has seen, through the introduction of a carbon price mechanism. It is extraordinary that his side of politics is this evening so vehemently objecting to intervention in the market through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation by government and yet seeks to impose a $1,300 impost on each household to fund what their side of politics has called a Direct Action Plan, which has been described as a tree in every lounge room. It is a most extraordinary proposition to put forward and then come into this place this evening and oppose the proposition to support the development of renewables in this country through the establishment of an appropriately thought-through mechanism, developed in consultation with experts and as part of an overall clean energy package. It is extraordinary that the opposition come in here this evening, having opposed household assistance, having opposed things like the Carbon Farming Initiative—which indeed will help some to the National Party's constituents, some of their farmers. They oppose that and they manage to oppose household measures and tax cuts. They have presented us with a crude so-called Direct Action Plan to address one of the most significant problems facing not only our country but our globe. It is amateurish that they come in here and present us with these thoroughly inadequate responses to significant policy problems across the globe.


I mentioned optimism earlier on, and it is disappointing once again to come into this place and have the opposition merely say 'no' to a well thought-through, well crafted policy proposal by this government. It is not simply a policy proposal of this government. I was reminded of that this week when I met some of the young people who came in to see me from the 100% Renewable Campaign, which is a community campaign working with over 100 local groups right around Australia, some of which are in my own electorate of La Trobe. They are groups that have been out polling community members right around the country; they have polled around 8,000 people face-to-face and around 4,000 people online, they tell me, about their views on the solar industry and for government investment in the renewables sector as a whole. They tell me that those results show that 94 per cent of people they surveyed support building large scale solar, for instance, in Australia and that 95 per cent support the government's new proposal for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It is compelling to me that there are people who have by their own resources and by their own means—some of them very limited means, I would expect—come to Canberra to speak to members of parliament about their vision for clean energy in this country. The member for Bradfield and I am sure many other opposition members throughout the course of this debate and the broader debate within our community have asked: 'Well, what we do we get back for this investment that is being made in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which in turn will support renewables?' What we get back is the opportunity to establish new industries, the opportunity to establish new jobs for Australians in a country and a globe which is going through economic transition. We get the opportunity to support new industries for Australians. It is not surprising that this is the next step in the government's clean energy package of measures, because our commitment to a clean energy future is absolutely apparent and has been apparent for some time. Whether it is through the carbon price, the Carbon Farming Initiative—that I mentioned as being so disappointingly opposed by people who purport to support farmers in this country and who purport to support people who could well derive an income stream by means of the Carbon Farming Initiative—or whether it is through the establishment of renewables targets or whether it is through the establishment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation this evening, it is simply part of the sequence of events that this government is going through to build a new future for our country, one which is not reliant on old energy and which is not reliant on carbon polluting technologies.


This evening's bill, which contemplates the establishment of a Clean Energy Finance Corporation, is important because it ensures that new renewables technologies get the financial support that they need to become larger operations and to ensure that we have increasing numbers of employees engaged in those new industries. We know that clean energy technologies face a range of obstacles in attracting financing: current global financial conditions, the cost of renewable energy, the complex nature of Australia's electricity markets and the preference of some investing institutions for listed assets all contribute to the inhibiting of the financing of the clean energy sector at present. It is appropriate that we establish a mechanism to counteract that. 


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will make individual decisions about investment which are independent of government. They will be referential-backed to an investment mandate which provides a mechanism for the government to articulate its broad expectations of how that corporation might invest and how it might go about its work. In April this year we released the expert review panel's report on the design of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The government accepted the recommendations of that report and so it is implementing them through this bill. It has taken appropriate advice in a timely way in accordance with the range of measures which we have implemented to respond to the clean energy needs of our country and is implementing this measure through this bill.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will make investments for the development of Australian-based renewable energy technologies—low emission technologies, energy efficiency projects and businesses that supply the required inputs. I might say as someone who not so long ago was in commercial practice and acting in relation to clean energy opportunities that other countries' businesses had taken on, it was disappointing for me to see that the same opportunities were not being taken up by Australian companies. It is a great source of pride to me this evening to be participating in a debate that will try to support Australian-based renewables businesses. The bill before us requires the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to have at least half of the corporation's investments in renewable energy technologies by June 2018. The government will provide around $2 billion of funding to the corporation per annum for five years, starting in 2013-14, with profits being available for reinvestment. But why have a Clean Energy Finance Corporation? The investment of $10 billion in the corporation will mean that we can unlock new and very substantial private investment in clean energy projects and the supply chain that feeds into those projects. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will enable the leveraging of private sector financing for renewable energy, low-emissions and energy efficiency technologies—investments which are critical to the transformation of the Australian economy. It will mean that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation can make investments and encourage private sector investment in clean energy technologies. It is ultimately the key to changing the economics of clean energy projects and making them more competitive in our country. It is necessary so that we can overcome potential market barriers that currently prevent those projects from going ahead—for instance, where investors are not appropriately informed about or familiar with emerging technologies.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will have a number of means available to it to tailor investments to address current and potential market barriers, including the capacity to provide funds, change the allocation of risk amongst participants, and offer a concessional cost of funds. Ultimately it will act as a catalyst to enable private investment which is not currently available and thereby enable a contribution to be made to carbon emissions reduction and cleaner energy.


So this is a unique opportunity this evening and it is part of the broader package of measures being put in place by this government to respond to the needs of our community to develop industry opportunities, to develop employment opportunities in new technologies industries, and ultimately to respond to the challenge of climate change which affects Australia and which affects the globe. I am keenly aware of the impacts of climate change very close to home on things like biodiversity in a very sensitive part of the world—the Dandenong Ranges. I regularly have conservation groups—organisations such as Emerald for Sustainability and other groups which support the promotion of biodiversity and maintaining biodiversity in the Dandenong Ranges. They regularly come to me and remark on how positive they feel that action is now meaningfully being taken by Australia to respond to climate change—that action is not being taken in a piecemeal way through a so-called Direct Action Plan but is being taken in a way which supports industry, which supports those who are landowners and agriculturalists, which supports households while we make the transition, and which ultimately comes back to supporting our environment and protecting that environment for future generations.


This government is strongly committed to reducing Australia's carbon pollution because we know that, if Australia takes no action by 2020, our carbon pollution could be, for instance, 20 per cent higher than in 2000. The Australian government is investing more than $5 billion in developing and commercialising clean energy technologies because we know that they will be crucial to Australia's efforts to reduce its carbon pollution emissions. 


We have set a Renewable Energy Target of 20 per cent by 2020, and this means that by that stage one fifth of Australia's electricity will come from renewable sources such as wind, solar and geothermal power. It is for all those reasons that this important measure being considered this evening—the establishment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation—is necessary. It is for this reason that we are taking steps to not only provide incentives for high-polluting business to alter its practices so that it becomes lower polluting through the carbon price mechanism. It is not only through this mechanism that we seek to change behaviours. It is not only through that but through the Carbon Farming Initiative that we seek to offer opportunities to capture carbon emissions and to offset emissions. And, finally, it is through this measure that we enable a market mechanism to be assisted by the intervention of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to provide business opportunities, to provide employment opportunities, which go to support a properly functioning clean energy economy and our clean energy future.


It is for all of these reasons that this government has acted in a systematic, timely and well thought out way to develop a package of measures which enable our country to most efficiently make the transition to a clean energy future. There is a great deal of work yet to be done and we have engaged some of the best advice through those expert advisers who have provided their review on the operation of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It is through scientific advice and economic advice that we have formulated a range of policies—the carbon price, the Carbon Farming Initiative and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation—to deliver a package of reforms which provide us with a comprehensive means to respond to a clean energy future.


It is disappointing that those opposite have come here tonight once again simply to stymie debate on these issues. It is disappointing in the context of so many young people in my electorate and right around the country who have made their voices clearly known to me not simply through this week but through the course of my term as an MP and far beyond that period about the kind of future they want to see, about the clean energy economy that they want to see, about the opportunities that they want to see for our future. I am not going to squander that opportunity. Those of us on this side are not going to squander it. We are going to take the opportunity to change Australia for the better and we are doing it tonight through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (20:59):  I was interested to hear the last speaker mention the stymieing of debate, when you consider that we have a $10 billion fund for consideration in front of us that was actually only allowed two hours with the economics committee. If you want to talk about stymieing debate, that is certainly where we need to start. 


Tonight we are here to debate the Labor Party's bill to deliver its latest $10 billion slush fund. Of course, that is not what the government is describing this bill as, but then deceiving the Australian community has become business as usual for the Gillard government. We have to look at what this government says and then compare it to what it actually does. We see that yet again with this bill before the House. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill establishes another bureaucracy whose goal is to waste borrowed money that ultimately the taxpayer will be liable for. How many more times is this going to happen in the term of this government? There is a litany of failed wasteful green schemes and failed wasteful green bureaucracy after green bureaucracy. The great tragedy when you look at this fund is that the government does not actually know what to spend the money on, beyond such broad and nebulous directions as 'the corporation is a mechanism to help mobilise investment in renewable energy, low-emissions and energy-efficiency projects and technologies in Australia' and 'the corporation will finance Australia's clean energy sector using financial products and structures to address the barriers that are currently inhibiting investment'. 


Yet Australia already have products and structures that make low emissions and renewable energy attractive options, don't we? We have a bipartisan 20 per cent renewable energy target, which requires all energy suppliers to source one-fifth of their power from renewable sources by the year 2020. Failure to do so will attract penalties of hundreds of millions of dollars, much of which would have to come from state energy utilities. The existing production of around 15,000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy produced nationally is expected to have to increase by an extra 45,000 gigawatt hours over the next eight years, a total fourfold increase. Every unit of renewable energy power that suppliers fall short will cost them money. A penalty of $65 per megawatt hour would equate to $65,000 per gigawatt hour and $65 million per terawatt hour. At this price, if Australia only managed to double instead of quadruple its renewable energy production, our electricity suppliers would be facing annual fines of $1.95 billion. Now, that is an incentive. It is also a coincidence, given that $2 billion is the expected government contribution to the Clean Energy Fund annually as it collects its capital base. Otherwise, I presume, this cost will simply have to be added on to the cost paid by consumers—our Australian families and businesses.


Surely the renewable energy target is a major structure designed to increase low-emission energy production. It appears, however, that some observers think Australia will struggle to quadruple its renewable energy production in the required time, despite the obvious financial incentive. Getting three-quarters of the way to the target will still generate a billion dollars a year in penalties, which is, in effect, the government's second hidden carbon tax. This will be one more cost we can assume will be passed on to Australian energy consumers—to every house, every business and every family. So there already exists a structure to quadruple renewable energy production, yet according to the Gillard government this structure will be either inadequate or incompetent.


On top of the costs of the renewable energy target I have already mentioned, the carbon tax itself is supposed to be another structure the government designed to drive up the price of fossil fuel energy or, by default, subsidise the competitiveness of renewables. With a $23-a-tonne CO2 equivalent across the entire Australian economy, our nation has the most expensive carbon tax in the world. Australia's electricity generators produce nearly 200 million tonnes of CO2equivalent, which is, annually, over a third of our total emissions. At a cost of $23 a tonne, the impost they will have to pass on to consumers and industry is $4.6 billion, rising every year. Of course, free permits reduce the overall cost to some generators, but I note that no assistance is being offered to the Western Australian generators in my electorate, so many will pay the full cost.


Why do these two major pieces of Labor policy not create a sufficient environment for investment in renewable technologies? After all, they come with a billion-dollar revenue-raising capacity. Is the carbon tax a piece of environmental legislation, or is it social welfare and wealth redistribution coming to us stealthily like a wolf in sheep's clothing? I remind members of the explanatory memorandum for the clean energy future bill last year. It said:


A broad-based carbon price is the most environmentally effective and cheapest way to reduce pollution. A carbon price puts a price tag on carbon pollution. Under the mechanism, around 500 of the country's biggest polluters will be required to pay for each tonne of pollution they release into the atmosphere. This will have two effects.


It creates a powerful incentive for all businesses to cut their pollution by investing in clean technology or finding more efficient ways of operating.


A price on carbon will also create economic incentives to reduce pollution in the cheapest possible ways, rather than relying on more costly approaches such as government regulation and—


wait for it—


direct subsidies.


This is what the government said in their own clean energy future bill last year, that that would provide the mechanism so that the government did not have to rely on costly approaches such as direct subsidies. The explanatory memorandum to that legislation went on to say:


These incentives will flow through the economy. The carbon price will make lower-polluting technologies, especially clean energy technologies, more competitive and will boost investment in these technologies. In this way, introducing a price on carbon will trigger the transformation of the economy towards a clean energy future.


Well, what has happened? Why isn't this sufficient? These words should really be viewed through the usual screen of Labor Party distortion. What we do see, again, is the government saying one thing and doing another. That is not what they said in that clean energy futures bill and I hope those words will continue to be examined in the cross-examination of this bill before us now. Either the government misled the Australian people through the clean energy future bill or it is misleading the Australian people through this bill. It has to be one or the other. The government stated that the carbon tax itself would drive renewable energy technologies. So is the bill before the House today, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, an acknowledgment  by the government that the carbon tax will actually fail to deliver renewable technology in its own right—so it is not going to do what the government said it would do? Is this an admission of failure, or, should I say, just the latest admission of failure and wasted borrowed funds and bloated bureaucracy yet again? Or is it instead not related to another government failure but an attempt to develop a separate Labor-Greens slush fund? 


The bill of course establishes the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, whose job it will be to oversee the expenditure and direct the outcomes the money will purchase. I wonder whether it will be more successful and more efficient than Labor's Fair Work Australia, that took four years to deliver a single report. Will there be better administrators than those who mismanaged Labor's disastrous pink batts program? I am particularly interested in this line in the explanatory memorandum:


The Corporation will apply capital through a commercial filter to facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean energy sector thus preparing and positioning the Australian economy and industry for a cleaner energy future.


What exactly will this commercial filter look like? 




Mr Chester:
  The green loans program.




Ms MARINO:
  The green loans program. Is it the same commercial filter through which the government gazed when it pretended to see world action on pricing carbon—even though the world has basically walked away from such moves? Is it the same commercial filter that the government used when it told high-energy-using trade-exposed industries that their carbon tax would have no impact—even though we see job losses, cancelled projects and closures on a daily basis? We really need to know what commercial filter this corporation will apply.


There are already serious concerns that the CEFC may in fact have a distortionary impact on the market and not stimulate tangible, sustainable results for progress in renewable energy projects. It may well undercut finance and investment in existing projects that have had to secure commercial financing—they have had to have a commercial case for large-scale renewable energy projects, and I have no doubt that the $10 billion will not be successfully invested. Irrespective of this, the renewable energy generated will still be 20 per cent—20 per cent before; 20 per cent after—so where is the justification?


I am absolutely appalled at the projected $750 million of taxpayers' money as losses attached to this bill. This is in the government's own papers. The government is admitting upfront that it plans to lose taxpayers' dollars through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill. I find that just appalling. Clearly, $750 million is chickenfeed to what the actual waste will be—$10 billion to pick Labor-Greens winners—and we will simply see questionable initiatives funded to support Labor and Greens ideologies. It will be without any question a Labor left-wing slush fund, aided and abetted by a board that will be appointed by the government and one that must consult with Labor ministers, a direct hands-on process. This is $10 billion being borrowed that Australian taxpayers will ultimately have to pay back. It is not in the government's budget. It is not part of the Labor government's $300 billion increase in the nation's debt ceiling. 


I have actually seen, as other members would have seen, some of the you-beaut schemes that will be pitching for these funds. I have seen some in newspapers and I have heard of some being hawked around the halls of this House. There are all sorts of opportunists rubbing their hands with glee. They know this is a gullible government. They have been down this road before. We have seen billions and billions of borrowed taxpayers' dollars wasted by this government. The opportunists know that the government cannot deliver programs without waste and mismanagement and they cannot wait to get their hands on these taxpayer funds. But it comes at a cost to Australian taxpayers. This government is infamous for coming up with the wrong answers to the questions of the day facing this nation, and this is yet another example of Labor getting it wrong.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (21:11): I am very pleased to support the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and related bills and to welcome the era of new technology development that they surely herald. I welcome this instalment in the government's carefully designed and far-reaching program for addressing carbon pollution, for addressing our reliance on hydrocarbons, and for setting up Australia as a leader when it comes to renewable energy and related technologies. This is a focused, forward-looking reformist Labor government, and we are getting things done, notwithstanding the vicissitudes of a minority parliament and a hostile coalition opposition, and we have just heard an example of that from the member for Forrest.


The policies and decisions of this Labor government, taken hand in hand with the resilience and creativity of Australian individuals and businesses, have made Australia a leader in economic management, and it is from that position of strength that we are leading this country through big-picture reforms in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency, in the areas of health and disability support, and in the areas of marine protection and transport infrastructure and reform. The clean energy legislation is a big part of that broad and deep reform effort, and it is a credit to the minister and the parliamentary secretary, to their staff, and the staff in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency that we stand on the brink of a new and promising trend of technological innovation in Australia.


Every day it seems there are events and challenges, both here in Australia and overseas, that can make it difficult to be optimistic about the world and our place in it. Terrible things happen and wicked problems persist. Economic crises are prompted by short-sightedness, poor regulation and greed. Economic successes are still too often characterised by inequality, selfishness and waste. Maybe that is an unnecessarily dark view, but it is one that can be hard to resist. And it is partly for that reason that we should recognise when we can the good things that we are capable of. In saying that, I strongly believe that the global effort to address the problems we have made for ourselves in the form of carbon pollution and hydrocarbon reliance will draw out some of the best human qualities. Like many people, I find it a bit sad that adversity is sometimes required to provoke the best in us, but I guess the best in us is worth having in any circumstances. The creation of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is a significant development in our history, the point at which a great flourishing of new low-carbon or no-carbon energy sources and other energy efficiency measures will be developed as the mainstay of Australia's electricity needs in the decades to come. 


Australia is far from alone in this effort, and indeed I have spoken before in this place to highlight the massive expansion of renewable energy investment and capacity that is occurring across the globe. As part of that global effort, this legislation is something that should make us all feel more positive and more optimistic about the direction in which we are headed as a nation. As a key component of the clean energy future package of reforms, these bills fit within a worldwide policy effort that gives me renewed hope in the idea of human progress and in the idea that we can learn from our mistakes and even outgrow the historical limitation of governing without enough regard to intergenerational needs or our shared international wellbeing.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation, CEFC, is the part of the clean energy future package that will create an Australian economy that is more responsive to the needs of our burgeoning clean energy and energy efficiency industry. The government's $10 billion investment will play a supercharged enabling role in kick-starting new initiatives and in opening new private investment opportunities for low-carbon and no-carbon renewable energy projects. What is more, the CEFC will have the broader benefits of underwriting the improved design and construction of clean energy technology and the indirect benefit of creating lower cost technology. With the Australian clean energy market still in its early development, major obstacles exist in the currently limited and constrained allocation of capital for such initiatives. A number of these barriers were identified in the expert review chaired by Jillian Broadbent, and the structure and operation of the CEFC respond to the recommendations of that review.


The CEFC will function to stimulate private sector investment and financing for clean energy technologies. It will use a range of mechanisms to overcome the kinds of barriers identified by the expert review. For example, it will have the ability to provide direct funds, offer concessional cost funds, lengthen the available tenure of private sector loans, and favourably alter the allocation of risk amongst lending participants. By taking the lead in clean energy technology investments, the CEFC will act as a catalyst for the industry and for private market funding of new entrants. The corporation is not a grants program and the intention is not to compete with the private sector but, rather, to foster private sector energy growth in the clean energy market and associated industries by acting to overcome those existing private lending obstacles that are not really based on investment viability per se yet are real obstacles nonetheless in the current tight capital lending environment.


The board of the CEFC will be responsible for decision making and investments, and its operations are structured to avoid risks by being both transparent in its processes and of course fully accountable in relation to all individual investment decisions. The dividends from the CEFC earnings will be paid to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The funding provided to the CEFC will be a special appropriation of $2 billion per annum for five years from 1 July 2013. In addition, the corporation will receive operational and start-up funding through the budget of around $60 million over three years. The intention is that the CEFC will become financially self-sufficient, using its earnings to fund its operational expenses without further supplementary funding.


Appropriate capital finance support to underwrite the development of the emerging renewable energy sector is critical. Without such assistance, the huge potential of Australian inventors, innovators and entrepreneurs will be lost or, at best, it will go elsewhere. The importance of support in the form of capital finance is even greater now than it would normally be because capital markets are tight and constrained.


On that point, people need to remember what it is we are seeking to foster here. As Michael Ottaviano, the CEO of Carnegie Wave Energy in my electorate, has pointed out, the existing energy generation technologies and infrastructure that we all rely upon were not only developed with government support but wholly owned and run by government through almost all of the time in which electricity has been provided as a basic service to households and industry.


It is also salient to again emphasise that, where the Clean Energy Finance Corporation provides funding support, it will look to do so in a way that opens up avenues of private investment. This is the right and proper enabling role of government: first, to identify the country's long-term and strategic future needs; second, to recognise that these go above and beyond a much tighter horizon and profit frame in which business operates; and, third, to weigh both the wider costs of market inaction and the wider benefits of carefully rated risk and innovation.


I was very taken with a summary of the renewable energy development challenge that confronts all governments in an article by James Surowiecki in the 10 October 2011 edition of the New Yorker. In that piece he wrote:


… there are few industries where it makes a lot of sense for the government to complement the market by subsidising research and development. Renewable energy is one of them. That's because the energy market is not like most other markets. Indeed, the economics of alternative energy are such that private investors, left to their own devices, are bound to under-invest in it, since the considerable social benefits—cleaner air, fewer greenhouse emissions—accrue to everyone, not just to direct customers. That means that the economic rate of return is significantly less than the social rate of return. Energy markets are also dominated by entrenched, regulated companies, and that reduces the incentive for investment. Despite the immense size of the energy market, as of 2005 spending on energy R&D accounted for just 2 per cent of spending on R&D in the U.S. This creates an opportunity for the government to add value by investing smartly, just as it can add value by spending money on education or infrastructure, other areas where the social returns are greater than the economic ones.


That view is very much a part of how we have approached the task of setting Australia on the path to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future, with all the economic, environmental and social benefits this will deliver.


It is the same approach that the Labor government has taken with great success in first launching the incredible boom that we have seen in household solar PV systems, then gradually tapering our support as the industry's growing strength and the well-established private demand have made that higher level support unnecessary.


I am extremely pleased to support these bills and I am proud to be part of a Labor government that has fully applied itself to the challenge of reform, with all its difficulties but also most importantly with all its long-term rewards. I believe Australia will have a clean energy future. It is absolutely essential that we do and it begins with the work of this government in partnership with all the many and varied Australian innovators, inventors and entrepreneurs that we are seeking to support.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (21:21):  I rise to very strongly oppose the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and the associated measures. I do so because I think the member for Fremantle, in fairness to her, outlined just then a very stark difference between the sides of the House. The Labor-Greens alliance, the coalition of Labor and Greens, believe very much in market intervention. They believe very strongly in taxpayers providing funding to what would not normally be commercially viable businesses. 



Ms Plibersek interjecting—




Mr BRIGGS:
  The Minister for Health would be a big supporter of that. She does not know if she is a Green or a Labor Party member, but I tell you: at the next election she will have the Greens right on her door. I think the second highest primary vote around the country for the Greens at the last election was in the Minister for Health's electorate. Labor are now doing deals with the Greens to fund Christine Milne's pet project. It has gone from being the Bob Brown bank to the Senator Milne bank with the change in arrangements for the Greens. But what has not changed is that the Labor Party and the Greens are in coalition and this is the very worst of their policy positions.


As I said at the beginning of my remarks: in fairness to the member for Fremantle, she is very honest about what she believes the role of government is in society. I appreciate that in this place. There are not a lot on that side who are now honest about what they think the role of government is in society, but she is very honest about what she thinks is the role of government in society. It is that governments should pick winners and that governments should take taxpayers' money and make decisions that the market would not otherwise make. That is in effect what she has just said.


We heard the member for Fremantle say what a great job the government had done to build up the solar panel industry. Of course, they also tried with the pink batts industry with their assistance in that area. That did not work out so well. When they spent $1 billion trying to build up the pink batts industry, which, again, was all to the purpose of creating a clean energy future, they wasted $2 billion on the way through because it did not work—and this will not work either. This is $10 billion, however, and that is the most concerning part about it. In the last couple of days during estimates hearings it has already been admitted that over the forward estimates this agency is expected to lose some $300 million of taxpayers' money, which is on budget. Of course, this $10 billion is off budget very deliberately. It is another one of the off-budget schemes that the government are trying to pursue, like the National Broadband Network. They are trying to hide the fiscal loss to the Commonwealth by putting it off budget.


We already know from estimates hearings that the witnesses have at least been honest enough to say that they expect well over seven per cent of the money they are investing to fail—$300 million of Australian taxpayers' money on businesses that will not succeed. We should think about that. They are spending Australian taxpayers' hard-earned money on pet projects of the Australian Greens, Senator Christine Milne and the member for Fremantle. These guys are making these decisions because it suits their ideological pursuit, but it does not suit working families—remember them?—who are working hard every day to try to put away money for the Greens and their coalition partner, the Labor Party, to go and pursue their own ideological needs and desires. That is the worst aspect of this.


I think one of the most insidious parts of the climate change package that this government has brought before the parliament is this bill and this $10 billion. We have already seen how much waste is created by the Australian Labor Party. These are projects which the commercial sector will not fund. There are already very successful renewable energy companies in the marketplace that this money will undercut. One of the great ironies of this Clean Energy Finance Corporation is that the money it will invest will undercut the money of entrepreneurs who are already out there in the marketplace trying to do exactly what the Labor Party and the Greens will tell you they seek to do—create alternative energies. This bill will create a situation which will undercut the work and efforts of those companies.


We know that this bill has been designed by the former leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown, and his replacement, Senator Christine Milne, who was a Co-chair of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. I remind the House: this was a committee that was formed after the election because at the election the Labor Party's climate change policy was to have 150 Australians get together to tell them what their climate change policy should be, along with cash for clunkers. That was the climate change policy of the Labor Party at the last federal election. After the election, the Prime Minister, of course, did a deal with Senator Brown and Senator Milne and created this climate change committee, out of which emerged the so-called 'Bob Brown bank'.


As Senator Milne made very clear in her comments about the corporation, it was designed such that:


With a legislatively guaranteed stream of funding outside the budget, no future government will be able to undermine it without changing legislation.


It is a very deliberate means of getting Australian taxpayers' money and putting it into the areas that the Greens and the Labor Party favour. They will seek to provide government funding to commercial enterprises that the market has decided are not worthy of funding. We know how wise the Labor Party are with investing in private enterprise. Those of us who live in South Australia and Victoria know how well the Labor Party ran banks in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It happened in Western Australia as well. They turned South Australia from being one of the strongest states in a fiscal sense to being, now, the weakest state in a fiscal sense, excluding Tasmania, because of the damage that was done by their behaviour in trying to act like a bunch of bankers in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They do not run things well. Governments do not run things well. Governments do not make investment decisions which are in the best interests of Australian taxpayers. And this bill will not lead to a change in this regard. It will lead to billions upon billions of dollars being piled into non-commercial prospects. It will lead to massive waste. It will lead to pink batts writ large. It will lead to Australian taxpayers wondering yet again why it is they go to work and pay their taxes. It should not just be for Senator Milne and the Labor Party's frolics in spending Australian taxpayers' money. This is a very bad bill.


Debate interrupted.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (18:55):  In addressing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and related bills, let me begin with some history about the successes and failures of support for and management of renewable energy in Australia.


It was the coalition which created, developed and implemented the mandatory renewable energy target—successfully. It was the coalition which created, developed and implemented the then equivalent of the solar PV rebate—successfully. It was the coalition which created, developed and implemented the solar hot water rebate—successfully. By comparison, what we have had from this government is the Home Insulation Program, which on any account is arguably Australia's most dramatic policy failure on the domestic front since the Second World War. Two billion dollars were largely wasted, including $500 million simply to fix the roofs—over 70,000 repairs, removals or variations to the work done, and that is still knowing that there are hundreds of thousands of other jobs out there which will never be inspected by this government. There were, of course, 200 house fires, and the link to four of the most terrible tragedies.


But this government also created the Green Start program and the Green Loans program. Green Loans cost over $100 million for barely more than 1,000 loans: $100,000 per loan on average for loans which were literally a few thousand dollars. It was a monumental failure which in any other period of government would be classified as the standout failure of that administration, but it is dwarfed by the failures of the Home Insulation Program.


The Green Start program, which never actually started in any meaningful way, was terminated very shortly after it was announced. The cash-for-clunkers program was announced by this government as their centrepiece of the last election's climate change policy, only to be brought to its knees not that long after the new government was created because it was a policy that was so bad it should never have seen the light of day. The citizens assembly was created to randomly select 150 Australians from the phone book to determine the policy which the government dared not take to the last election.


And now we have potentially the largest waste of money of all, and that is the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the $10 billion clean energy fund which, even if it is successful, creates no net new renewable energy. It beggars belief that this government is proposing to spend $10 billion and there is not one megawatt, not one kilowatt and not one watt more of renewable energy which will be generated by 2020 as a consequence of this $10 billion. Let me look at the deep fundamental and structural flaws at the heart of this bill and explain why, whilst the opposition fully supports the 20 per cent renewable energy target, we believe that this bill is ill conceived, ill constructed and doomed to failure. I will do so in two phases: first by looking at the prospects even if there were the implausible case that all of the investments proposed were successful, and then by looking at the overwhelmingly more likely case of what happens if there are failures. Because, when you look around the world and at the history of investment by this government, this policy is doomed to failure and doomed to waste literally billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. This is money that comes from the work of shop assistants, plumbers, nurses and people who are working each and every day to pay their taxes, and their money will be wasted.


Let us begin with the concept, which is so fundamentally flawed. It would seem that spending $10 billion on renewable energy would get you something. What is proposed here is that the government will spend $10 billion and that therefore that will generate some form of new renewable energy. The problem, however, is that before this bill there was a 20 per cent renewable energy target. After the $10 billion included in this bill is spent, there will still be a 20 per cent renewable energy target. What does this mean? It means that any renewable energy generated as a consequence of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation investments will simply displace other renewable energy which would otherwise have come online between now and 2020. It is unarguable, it is without doubt and it is simply, palpably, absolutely the case that the government will spend $10 billion and, in a best-case, no-failure, no-problem, perfect-delivery scenario, will still produce not one gigawatt, not one megawatt, not one kilowatt and not one watt more actual renewable energy between now and 2020. That is an extraordinary example of conceptual failure.


I wonder if the minister at the table, Minister Shorten, or anybody else around the cabinet table considered the fact that for $10 billion there will not be an additional unit of energy generated at all between now and 2020. It is almost extraordinary that this policy could have been created, delivered and funded. But the answer is very simple. It was, of course, funded as part of the trade-off with the Greens to win their support for the carbon tax. The carbon tax, of course, is an entirely different story. We know that it was conceived in the breach. The Prime Minister famously said the very day before the election, 'I rule out a carbon tax.' On the Monday before the election, the Prime Minister said, now infamously, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' So the price of that betrayal and of winning support for it included this $10 billion fund. But, as I have set out, in the best-case scenario, on the basis of perfect delivery, no new renewable energy will result. Our alternative is very simple. We have a renewable energy target. It is set to achieve 20 per cent by 2020. We support that, we helped negotiate it and it will achieve that. That will be the same result with or without this bill. It is unarguable, and anything else from the government would simply be misleading.


However—and this brings me to the second part of what I wish to say this evening—this bill will not be executed perfectly. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the clean energy fund will not be delivered as the government intends, and history shows us that on three fronts. Firstly, on the government's own performance in this country, as I mentioned at the outset, we have had pink batts, Green Loans, Green Start, cash-for-clunkers, the citizens assembly, the solar bubble and collapse and the solar hot water deception, where $44.7 million was ripped from the budgets of 2011-12 and 2012-13. This was only revealed in its full deception on budget night, and as a consequence we are seeing job losses at Rheem and Dux now. That is a list of seven failures from this government in this space.


Then we go to the broader question of comparable systems around the world. In the United States, we have seen the $700 million failure of Solyndra under the comparable US system. Beacon Power has collapsed. Ener1 has collapsed. Solar Trust of America was given a $2.1 billion line of credit from the US Department of Energy and has collapsed. It makes you think that perhaps there may be some systemic problems. The comparable program in the United States is the source of enormous division, enormous conflict and an ongoing scandal in relation to its administration, according to the Republicans in the way that they have presented. So, far from being a unifying program in the United States, it is a program which has had significant failures and is a source of deep, clear and ongoing division within the US congress.


What about Australia? Are there any comparable programs? There are. Let me point to two similar examples. The first is the ZeroGen project, which had over $100 million of co-financing from the Queensland government, delivered by Peter Beattie and, from the Australian federal government, by the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. At the time that the ZeroGen project was proposed, Ian Macfarlane, who was the relevant spokesperson for the coalition, said that it would fail. He was clear on this front. The then Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie, famously said that Ian Macfarlane was on drugs—that, of course, was false. It also turned out that Ian Macfarlane was absolutely right: the ZeroGen project collapsed. It is gone; it is finished. The public money was done. Nothing was built. There is no low-carbon, let alone zero-carbon, ZeroGen project in Queensland. The money is gone. The project is gone. The idea was flawed from the beginning. It was not well executed. Therefore, we were not surprised when that which we had warned of came to pass.


But let me explain that that $100 million was money which came from everyday Australians. It was the taxes of everyday Australians, from all walks of life. It could be from members of the Health Services Union who are cleaning hospital wards and emptying bedpans. Their taxes go directly towards a project such as ZeroGen. It collapsed and failed. So all of that work and the payment of those taxes were wasted. So let us never forget that this is nothing hypothetical. When the government wastes somebody's money, it is real, because there is a shop assistant, an orderly or a small business person who has worked to pay that money. We hold their money in trust and we have a sacred responsibility to guard it carefully.


Let us also look at the Solar Flagships program: $700 million was announced over three years ago and yet no project has been successful. We have seen the Central Queensland project effectively collapse. We saw the Moree project collapse. I hope some success comes out of them. But many days, many months and three years have passed since the world's biggest solar array was proudly announced by the once and future Prime Minister. So that is another example.


We see the litany of failures of general environmental programs: pink batts, green loans, Green Star, cash for clunkers, citizens assembly, the solar bubble and the solar hot water bubble. We see the US examples of Solyndra, Beacon Power, Ener1 and Solar Trust of America, and we see the Australian examples of ZeroGen and also Solar Flagships where nothing has come to pass. The lessons must be fairly strong.


Let us, then, come to the costs of this bill. What we have seen is that, even on the government's own modelling, even in the explanatory memorandum, there is an expected loss, out of the first $6 billion, of $1.346 billion, or $1,346.4 million. That extrapolates out, over a five-year period, to more than a $2 billion loss—that is a combination of operating costs, write-downs for commercial failures and interest forgone for the government.


Let us understand that that is a best-case scenario—$2 billion being wasted over five years. That is a profound amount of money. And that is from a government which has not been highly successful in its other predictions in relation to comparable programs or allied environmental programs. Huge amounts of money have been wasted, to no effect. So, on its own best-case scenario, over five years we are looking at $2 billion of public money gone—written off; wasted.


Finally, we come to the fact that there is an impact on existing projects. It changes the financing regimes. It changes the competitive regimes. It changes the merit order. So it has a sovereign risk impact on existing investments in the space because, if they are displaced by subsidised projects, it has an impact on their ability to compete on level terms in the renewable energy space. That is another example of ill-thought-through consequences. I have a respect for the individuals involved who have sought to assist in this. But it is the fundamental design at the heart of government from people who have repeatedly shown an inability to apply government programs to the commercial environment with disastrous consequences.


Against all that background, what we saw yesterday was quite extraordinary: a two-hour hearing for $10 billion—$5 billion an hour—for a parliamentary inquiry. That inquiry was called on Friday. It was delivered on Monday. There was no ability for the public to have input. It was carried out over two days, and my understanding is that it will report tomorrow. What we had was not a parliamentary inquiry but a show trial. So that was an abuse of parliament and an abuse of the confidence of the public, and it is likely to be a fatal abuse of taxpayers' money.


In opposing this bill and the three related bills which extend the scope of the carbon tax to cover LPG, LNG and CNG, let me be clear on behalf of the opposition: the Clean Energy Finance Corporation $10 billion slush fund is destined to fail. Even in the unlikely event that it succeeds, what we will see is not one watt of additional renewable energy between now and 2020. In its design and its concept, this structure, this system will, on a best-case scenario, spend $10 billion and Australia will not have an additional watt of renewable energy between now and 2020. For those reasons, we oppose this bill and these allied bills, and we do so with every ounce of vigour.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (19:13):  I rise to voice my strong support for the clean energy bills before the House with a little bit more vigour than those opposite and than was evident in the member for Flinders's speech. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012 and Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012 are all part of the Gillard Labor government's commitment to move Australia towards a clean energy future.


Obviously, we have seen bipartisan support for these endeavours at the 2007 and 2010 elections—the same targets in terms of combating dangerous climate change gases, and the same clean energy targets of 20 per cent, on both sides of the chamber. It is good to see this bipartisan support in acting to ensure that our grandchildren and great-grandchildren have a world to inherit. I welcome the creation of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation as part of a raft of government initiatives designed to support the way we combat the impacts of dangerous and costly climate change. Investment in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will go a long way towards delivering major new private investment in clean energy projects and the supply chains that feed into these projects.


The bills outline numerous measures that serve to improve the Carbon Farming Initiative, enhance the security of the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units—which I think might have flowed from some Howard government initiatives from 2007—and develop working relationships with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Clean energy is a concept that has been much debated in this chamber, despite that bipartisan support for the same targets. Time and time again, the Labor government has taken action to set Australia on a course to a clean energy future, a gentle change in direction, but an important economic change of direction in terms of the glide path of where we will end up. As everybody knows, there are lower costs if we act now rather than later, but unfortunately time and time again the coalition has tried to sabotage these efforts in an attempt to score cheap political points rather than considering the nation's interests.


Today I went on the web to have a look at the coalition's direct action plan on environment and climate change—I presume the policy came out before the 2010 election—to get an idea of the details embraced by those opposite. I will be generous and say that the direct action plan is probably a little bit outdated, but it does seem to be very costly—over $3.2 billion forecast over four years. I am not quite sure whether that has moved on or whether it is going to be compressed, but it is the current policy as seen on the Liberal Party webpage. It is a little bit unrealistic, outdated and perhaps even counter-productive. I would be gravely concerned for our nation's environmental legacy and our economic preparedness under an Abbott-led coalition government. 


A nation's environmental legacy is what these clean energy bills before the chamber are all about—that is, what we leave behind for our children. The decisions we make in this chamber and the decisions voters make at the ballot box shape this nation for our descendants to inherit. I want my sons and their children and grandchildren to live in an Australia that did what was needed and when it was needed, even if it meant losing a bit of political skin. We need to do this to preserve the environment and work with the rest of the world in addressing climate change. Australia, while a young nation, has always had a proud record of being a good global citizen, whether it be Billy Hughes' actions after World War I—there was a lot of skin in that game after 60,000 Australians died in that conflict—or Doc Evatt in the first days of the United Nations. More recently, we can look to the former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and his actions in Antarctica or to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Griffith, with his endeavours in Libya. As a nation we do our bit and a little bit more, I would suggest. That is why this nation is putting a price on carbon in 30 or so days. It is about cutting pollution, creating clean energy jobs and making sure our economy is ready for this transformation that the world is undertaking. We proudly play our role in reducing global greenhouse emissions, and we will be well positioned to compete in a world moving to lower carbon technologies. 


As a Queenslander, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, you know that we as a state, the worst per capita polluter in the world, are taking some action to prepare our economy. We will not be alone. We are joining many countries around the world that are already taking action. In fact, 89 countries have already committed, and many are acting right now to take steps to address climate change. We saw the courage of the Koreans, one of our major trading partners—I have certainly heard the member for North Sydney talk a lot about Korea—which overnight committed to putting a price on greenhouse gases by 2015. Globally, more money is now invested in renewable power than in conventional high-pollution energy generation. The rest of the world is acting, and we must act with them and, more importantly, not be left behind. 


We are doing the right things for the right reasons, but it has not been easy. As anyone would know, there is a big scare campaign that is confusing and frightening many Australians with exaggerated cost estimates and exaggerated claims and hyperbole about what is going to happen. It suggests that the sky will fall in at midnight on 30 June and the world as we know it will end. That is not the reality. We are talking about a gentle change in direction, a glide path that will gently shape the Australian economy. This fear mongering, I would suggest, will be proved a foolish fallacy, come 1 July. In 20 years or in 50 years we will see just how stupid it was, just as if we look back 20 years ago to how people reacted to the High Court's decision on 3 June about Mabo. At the time there was hysteria—backyards were going to be taken—but, 20 years on, we look back and see that it was the appropriate thing to do at the time. It was a tough thing for Prime Minister Keating to do at the time, and perhaps he did not reach the decision as easily as he might have, but he then had the courage to lead the nation into doing the right thing. 


The honourable member for Warringah has neglected to mention that many vulnerable Australians, including many pensioners, will end up coming out ahead after the carbon price starts in little over a month from now. In Moreton alone, 16,000 pensioners—I note Minister Macklin at the table—will receive a cash payment over the coming weeks ahead of the introduction of the carbon price. All full and part pensioners in Moreton will receive a lump-sum payment of $250 if they are single and $380 for couples. Local pensioners will get another boost with an ongoing increase to their fortnightly payments from March 2013. In total, local pensioners will get around $338 extra a year for singles and $510 extra for couples. About 93 per cent of all pensioner households will be at least 20 per cent better off because of these new payments. We are talking about a gentle tax to change behaviour. If they are like many seniors that I know—people who do know where to find their jumpers, do know where to turn the lights switches off—they will find that it will not be the fear and doom and gloom, the jeremiad that those opposite would suggest. And, obviously, the money that the member for Jagajaga is putting in their pockets will be a reward for their years of service to the Australian community.


The member for Warringah does not want to hear about that and he certainly does not want to admit this to the Australian public. He more than any other member of parliament at the moment can hear the clocks in this House ticking loudly, because he knows that, as the days tick down towards 1 July, his campaign, his house of cards, the flimflam attack, the flimflam man, will find out that the world is different. His continued negativity on tackling climate change unfortunately has created a little bit of uncertainty in some markets, particularly the electricity market, which has hurt our economy and damaged the efficient functioning of the NEM and our energy markets. He has come a long way from his 2009 Lateline statement, where he supported an emissions trading scheme. He said:


We don't want to play games with the planet. So we are taking this issue seriously and we would like to see an ETS.


I agree with him. It would have been great to have an ETS. Obviously, that was before the member for Warringah knocked off the member for Wentworth in the leadership change early in December 2009 on that climate change sceptic ticket. I think the votes were 42 to 41, from memory. One person was absent, so did not actually vote, and one person could not bring themselves to vote for either of them, so I am not sure what their intentions were, even with two people on the ticket. Unfortunately we have not seen that sort of commitment from the opposition leader. As I said, the direct action plan that I have had a look through is quite different.


Like many other MPs I do have serious questions about Mr Abbott's direct action plan, particularly in the context of our shared Renewable Energy Targets. I have a lot of concerns about how this will impact on investment in solar, because I do believe as a Queenslander that we have great opportunities in solar. I was a bit disappointed to see one of the solar programs of the Queensland government scrapped the other day. I also think we have great potential in geothermal. I look forward to the Queensland government and the federal government working together to develop some of those geothermal resources. I would like to snatch some of those projects away from South Australia, hopefully.


We are only 30 or so days out from the start of our price on greenhouse gases. It is at this moment that I would like to have a look at some of the direct action plan policy. They are talking about creating a band within the Renewable Energy Target which would be reserved for emerging technologies such as big solar. I have a bit of a concern about that. If there were an addition to the 20 per cent target I could see the logic in that. If the coalition were to introduce a banded RET it would see solar built at the expense of other projects that are already in the pipeline—perhaps some of those geothermals, perhaps some of those other renewables like wave. That would create instability for renewable energy investors, and that is not a mature investment sector at the moment, even though, as I said, there is a lot of global money being pumped into this area.


The other policy in the direct action plan is to invest $100 million each year for an additional one million solar energy homes by 2020. As I said, this is the 2010 election policy, so it is slightly out of date. We are already on track for one million rooves by the end of 2014, so this plan as printed today is out of date and behind the times. As at April 2012, we are already in excess of 677,000 solar power systems, whereas the direct action plan estimates 275,000 by the end of 2012. I think they might need to update this document.


In their solar cities program, which I think was touched on by the member for Flinders, projects were announced for Adelaide, Townsville, Blacktown, Alice Springs and Central Victoria, 'providing practical benefits for the community, including PV, solar hot water and smart meters on public and private buildings'. The reality is that these are already solar cities, so I am not sure why we would need to go back and have a policy where we are going to try and take lessons from these. I think we should just let the industry get on with what it is already delivering.


The other surprising commitment is to fund 125 mid-scale solar projects in schools and communities. But we had 784 schools provided with solar power systems in the last funding round of the National Solar Schools Program, and already over 4,000 have been installed. I know this, because it is something I have been trying to push in my electorate. The schools are already ahead of the politicians. When complete next year, 70 per cent of schools will have a solar power system.


I would suggest there are some serious funding questions as well in this direct action plan. That cost of $1,300 per household is too high. It is time for the coalition, obviously, to reconsider this policy. I would ask for it to reconsider the scare campaign, although I would suggest it is going to be ramped up on the shrill factor to 11 in the lead-up to 30 June.


As a parliament everyone agrees—both sides of the chamber—that we need to take climate change seriously. There are really not too many sceptics that have got a voice on that side of the chamber. We need to do more so that we take action. The bills before the House are part of this plan. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012 and the Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012 are another step in the right direction and I commend them to the House.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (19:28):  I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and related bills. Well, I had to go and look at the running order a few minutes ago because I was confused. The member for Moreton did not seem to talk to the bills in any sense. It surprised me because, as the lead speaker for the government on supposedly one of their most significant initiatives, all we heard was 15 minutes of negativity and an avoidance of the big issues in this. There was no attempt to justify this carbon tax and all the related regulations and difficulties and costs that are going to be incurred by businesses and households, by the whole community. All we heard was a whole lot of platitudes intermingled with endless negative abuse of this side of politics.


This Clean Energy Finance Corporation is the product, unfortunately, of grubby politics. It is the product of a desperate last-minute deal, a $10 billion political bribe to win the support of the Greens for a carbon tax—pure and simple. That is what it is. Once again the Prime Minister caved in to the demands of the Greens and once again Australians will pay very heavily for this weakness and this lack of principle in dealing with major policy issues. 


Setting up a government bank with borrowed billions, underwritten by taxpayers, to invest in high-risk ventures should be a thing of the past in this country. Hasn't this government learnt anything from past debacles such as Tricontinental, Western Australia Inc. and the State Bank of South Australia? These were the investments and the types of organisations which helped create the brand image of those on the other side of politics of being unable to manage money—and it was a well-earned reputation. You would think people would learn from their mistakes, but here we go again, just because the Prime Minister sought to save her political skin at any cost to the taxpayer. Has this government not learnt from the US government's costly attempts to pick winners in renewable energy? Names like solar panel manufacturer Solyndra come to mind: it went bankrupt after receiving $500 million in loan guarantees and it cost 1,100 jobs. Others to go under in the US include Evergreen Solar, SpectraWatt and Beacon Power.


This Clean Energy Finance Corporation is the price Labor is happy to pay for Greens backing. It is the Bob Brown bank—the Bob Brown who has dictated so many of the stupid, irresponsible and dangerous decisions that this government has subsequently sought to introduce since the first weeks of this government when it caved in on so many things, and has since proceeded to cave in, in order to placate the Greens. The nation will pay heavily in all sorts of ways, and this Clean Energy Finance Corporation is another one.


Tricontinental was a merchant bank arm of the State of Bank of Victoria, and the State Bank collapsed under the weight of the $3.5 billion in bad loans made to the corporate cowboys of the 1980s by Tricon. The Review Panel of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation says of the CEFC initially that 'it is anticipated that the majority of its investment will be loans'. That reminds us very much of the State Bank and Tricontinental. For the CEFC, the $10 billion of borrowed money will be over five years starting in 2013-14, with the first $2 billion instalment to be paid into a special account in July 2013—in all likelihood, just prior to the election. It is to be invested in projects the banks would not touch with a barge pole. This is the stupidity of this proposal. It is money that will be mostly hidden from the budget bottom line, covering up their mistakes. If you did include this money you would see it eating into the forecast surplus. Over the forward estimates, $6 billion will be pumped into the CEFC. Just $320 million shows up in the underlying cash balance. This supposedly includes a 'prudent recognition that some investments will not be recovered'. Taxpayers will carry both the hidden debt exposure and the interest rate exposure. In Senate estimates, Treasury conceded it had factored in that 7.5 per cent of invested capital would not be recovered. On $10 billion, that is $750 million that is expected to be lost—just a lazy $750 million of borrowed money. This is a government with no sense of the value of money. It sees its value only in what it can deliver in a political sense to the government. It would be the most Pollyanna assumption that it will only lose $750 million. The way this government manages money, it will be billions.


The CEFC along with the National Broadband Network white elephant are reasons debt continues to rise despite Labor claiming to be returning to surplus. They have a $300 billion debt ceiling included in the budget legislation, an increase of $50 billion, and yet they claim they are going to surplus. It is an absolute joke. It is a deliberate deception. It is tens of billions of dollars that should be on the budget bottom line. It should be, but it is not. This is a government which is into deception and spin and irresponsible investment of taxpayers' money. Now they are borrowing billions and billions more, and the taxpayer will have to pay this back at some stage.


There are precedents in the budget papers as to why the CEFC should be on budget. There is an existing program which was announced as a budget measure only 12 months before the last one, in the 2011-12 in budget. At page 304 of Budget Paper No. 2 it is there in black and white:


The Government will provide $108.7 million over 14 years to support the development and commercialisation of renewable energy technologies by making early-stage equity investments that leveraged private funds.


Doesn't it sound very familiar? It sounds exactly like the description of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. I would like the next speaker to explain to the parliament what the difference is. There is no difference, we all know that. This is a cheap political stunt to get money off the bottom line and to try to save the skin of this Prime Minister. The only difference is the scale of the investment. It is an identical fund—one is on the budget; one is off. 


The government says that this corporation will be independent. The Leader of the Greens, Christine Milne, states:


It is an independent authority, it isn't something that's going to have political interference.


These bills make it clear that this will not be independent. The board members—the chair and up to six others—will be appointed and removed by the government. Of course, there is no political interference or political direction! The government's board will appoint the CEO after consulting key ministers, but there is no political interference! There is independence, of course, but they must consult key ministers before they make a decision. The government will inevitably also consult the Greens. These bills also give the responsible ministers 'powers of direction over the broad mandate of the Corporation'. It puts a lie to what Senator Milne had to say. They will say anything in order to justify the unjustifiable. 


The most absurd thing is that the renewable energy target was 20 per cent before this was announced and it is 20 per cent after it was announced. This is the reason this finance corporation should never exist. There is no justification. $10 billion will not increase the level of renewable energy in the grid because the target remains the same. What an absurdity! They bring in a carbon tax which morphs into an emissions trading scheme and they set a target of 20 per cent, and the credits that are issued each year will relate to how well the economy is achieving against that target. All we are seeing with this corporation is that the sale of carbon permits will be adjusted to meet the target and all the CEFC will do is see what would otherwise be cheaper emission reductions replaced by more expensive emission reductions. That is a fact confirmed by so many and yet this government has gone ahead with the scheme. All it will do is increase the cost of achieving an emissions reduction. And this is the government that talks about implementing a market based scheme!


The expert advisory panel, in its report, highlights these inherent risks. It says that a commercial investment filter will be applied to potential projects. The panel says:


The filter will not be as stringent as the private sector equivalent, as the CEFC has a public policy purpose.


Consequently, it has different risk/return requirements. For a given return, the CEFC may take on higher risk and, for a given level of risk, due to positive externalities, may accept a lower financial return.


What all that gobbledegook is saying is that this is a recipe to waste money we do not have. It is a recipe to waste borrowed money which taxpayers will have to repay. It is another symbol of Labor not been able to manage money.


The bill's explanatory material states:


The investment mandate will be in the form of a written legislative instrument. Because the investment mandate represents the policy direction of the Government and has the potential to impact on the Commonwealth Budget, it will be a non-disallowable instrument.


It has just smashed through this parliament and it is indefensible. It will increase dramatically the cost of achieving emissions and it will do nothing to increase the emissions in the country because of the cap.


There is an inexplicable omission. The fund is barred from supporting carbon capture and storage initiatives. The review panel observed:


With the abundance of coal in Australia, our cost of electricity is one of the lowest in the world.


Under a section titled 'Exclusions' it states: The government has announced the CEFC will not invest in Carbon Capture and Storage projects or technology.


Again, this is the Greens lording it over the government and lording it over the community. It is blind ideology. To the Greens, fossil fuels are the devil incarnate. They cannot be used. Irrespective of whether we could make the coal cleaner in order to maintain comparative advantage and our cheap electricity that we have enjoyed for 100-plus years, the CEFC deliberately sets out to erode this. It just shows the extent to which this government and this Prime Minister have so tugged their forelocks to the Greens party, which has been at the centre of so many of the cost increases that have been incurred over the last 18 months to two years, and it is demonstrably and rapidly making many areas of Australian business uncompetitive. When this carbon tax comes in we will see a real manifestation of how our competitive position can be eroded so dramatically on so many fronts.


So who will benefit from this slush fund? We will see the white shoe salesman and the dodgy operators that give the many reputable renewable energy businesses a bad name. This is exactly what happened with the pink batts. We have union funds, of course. It is no coincidence that the super funds are heavily invested in renewable energy projects. It will be a great temptation for the CEFC to give support to many of the investments on a non-commercial basis.


This piece of legislation is extremely dangerous and unnecessary and it should be stopped in its tracks. We should return to managing government money in a sensible and proper fashion.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (19:43):  After that performance I think the House could profit from some information about the bills that we are debating. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 establishes the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It empowers the corporation to invest directly and indirectly in financial assets for the development of Australian based renewable energy technologies, low-emission technologies and energy efficiency projects. The significant thing about this is that it is a measure designed to support, promote and develop Australian industry and to enable us to take advantage of renewable energy technologies, something we have really failed to do, unfortunately, in the years gone by. We have to a considerable degree missed out on what has been an emerging, growing area of technological development and manufacturing jobs. 


The accompanying bills to be passed with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 by 1 July will provide market certainty around the changes. In April the government released the expert review panel's report on the design of the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The government accepted the recommendations of that report and is implementing them through this bill. Clean energy technologies face a range of obstacles in attracting financing: current global financial conditions, the complex nature of Australia's electricity markets, the cost of renewable energy and preference of investing institutions for listed assets inhibit the financing of the clean energy sector. The corporation will invest in financial assets for the development of Australian based renewable energy technologies, low-emission technologies and businesses that supply the required inputs which are critical areas to the transformation of the Australian economy. It will leverage private sector financing.


The bill requires the corporation to have at least half of its investments in renewable energy technology by 30 June 2018 and thereafter. It is expected that the corporation will apply a commercial filter when making its investment decisions, focusing on projects and technologies at the later stages of development. The filter will not be as stringent as the private sector equivalent, as the corporation has a public policy purpose and values any positive externalities that are generated. By using a commercial filter, it is expected the corporation will invest responsibly and manage risk so it is financially self-sufficient and achieves a target rate of return. The government will provide $2 billion of funding to the corporation per annum for five years, starting in 2013-14, with profits—including any capital and interest earned—available for reinvestment. The corporation will make individual investment decisions independently of the government.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is part of a suite of government initiatives designed to transform the Australian economy for a cleaner energy future. The government's $10 billion investment in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will play a vital role in unlocking significant new private investment in clean energy projects and the supply chain that feeds into these projects. Australia's clean energy market is an early stage market, categorised by incomplete knowledge and limited experience of risk. This means that there are barriers inhibiting the effective allocation of capital. 


The expert review chaired by Jillian Broadbent identified a number of common barriers inhibiting financing of the clean energy sector, such as availability and cost of finance. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will make investments and encourage private sector investment in clean energy technologies, but there may still be market barriers that prevent these projects going ahead—for example, if investors are not familiar with emerging technologies. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will have tools at its disposal to tailor investments to address market barriers. These tools include a capacity to provide funds, change the allocation of risk amongst participants and offer a concessional cost of funds. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will act as a catalyst to private investment which is currently not available, and thereby contribute to carbon reduction and cleaner energy. It is not the intention of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to directly compete with the private sector. Rather, it will seek to leverage more private sector investment.


The introduction of a carbon price is the key to changing the underlying economics of clean energy projects and making them more competitive. A carbon price in conjunction with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will build on the government's investments in new renewable technologies and better and more efficient ways of using our energy resources. These efforts will create an incentive to reduce emissions, drive investment in renewable and low-emission technologies, create certainty for business investment and begin the adjustment of our economy to a cleaner energy future.


The member for Goldstein queried the purpose of the legislation and of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We need to say that this is a measure to boost Australian manufacturing. The carbon pricing mechanism and, in the particular, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, will generate additional manufacturing opportunities for Australian firms. Australia could become a world leader in creating green industries, generating up to a million green collar jobs by 2030 and multibillion dollar export opportunities in green technology. Australia is well placed to lead an economic renewal based around clean industries and green jobs, but we will need to act quickly to compete with countries such as Germany and Denmark, which are already greening their workforces and dominating the international green market in solar and wind technology.


The good news is that there has been a great deal of work done to kick-start the structural change geared towards renewable energy development. For example, the company Beyond Zero Emissions has produced a report titled Zero carbon Australia stationary energy plan, which is a 10-year road map for 100 per cent renewable energy generation, with baseload energy supplied by renewable sources at a cost of $8 per household per week, a similar electricity price rise to what may be expected in Australia's business-as-usual electricity market. The plan includes concentrating solar thermal power with molten salt storage supplying 60 per cent of electricity demand, wind supplying 40 per cent, and biomass and hydroelectricity being used as contingency backup for up to two per cent of annual demand.


This comes at a time when the world is currently experiencing a boom in clean energy investment that I think is the beginning of a new industrial revolution. Last year, a record-breaking $260 billion was invested in new renewable energy projects across the globe. In fact, clean energy investment has hit new records in seven of the last eight years, and even the oil giant BP predicts that renewables will be the fastest growing energy sector every year until at least 2030. More staggeringly, the global clean energy and environment sector is now valued at $4.7 trillion, which is three times Australia's annual gross domestic product. Last year was also the first year when clean energy investment exceeded investment in fossil fuels, led by skyrocketing investments in countries like America, China, India and Brazil. These investments now underpin between 2.3 to three million jobs in clean energy industries worldwide. Globally, more renewable energy was built last year than fossil fuel energy. The Chinese solar industry is leading the way, and it is claimed that solar will be cheaper than coal within a decade.


Australia has what it takes to be leading this race: world-class renewable energy resources, a skilled workforce and a proud history of innovation. However, of that $260 billion which I mentioned was being invested last year, only $4.7 billion of it was in Australia. So we have been missing out and I think it is an excellent time for us to be investing in clean energy. Australians overwhelmingly support a renewable energy future for Australia. Close to 90 per cent support greater investment in clean energy and 80 per cent of Australians believe that clean energy investment is good for jobs.


A recently released report by 100% Renewable Energy shows the results of a poll conducted through the first half of this year of 12,000 Australians on their attitudes to solar energy. Ninety-four per cent of the respondents said they wanted to see big solar projects built in Australia and 95 per cent wanted to see governments investing in big solar projects. While respondents understand that the private sector will do the heavy lifting, they do expect governments to lead. Governments in many of the major economies of the world are moving strongly to create jobs in solar industries of the future and to safeguard their environments and energy grids with safe, clean solar power. A number of themes emerged through the comments that were made in this poll, which included the risk of Australia getting left behind, falling costs of solar, the need to move away from coal and gas, the opportunities in jobs and regional development, and the desire for political leadership. The results of this poll show that Australia is ready for its leaders, of all political parties, to embrace the huge opportunities that are out there in renewable energy such as solar power. The community is calling for it, business is ready to invest and we have the resources.


Australia is one of the sunniest countries on earth and yet our largest solar power station is a mere 1.2 megawatts. With the sun drenched landscape so much a part of Australia's identity, it makes sense for us to be using this valuable resource to supply energy for our nation. We are embracing solar panels on our rooftops—and I think that is terrific—but we have so far not grasped the opportunity of large-scale solar power to generate electricity, employment and energy stability into the future. Solar thermal power plants that store the sun's energy after the sun goes down can provide baseload power for our industries, while solar PV at utility scale is expected to be cheaper than coal or gas by the middle of this decade. In combination with other renewable technologies such as wind, solar power can make our power supply cheaper and cleaner and just as reliable as that which we enjoy now. Investment in large-scale solar will also set Australia up to benefit from stable electricity prices for decades to come in a way that coal and gas, with their exposure to volatile international energy markets, can no longer guarantee.


The high level of community support for investment in new solar technology demonstrates the importance of bodies like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Communities are seeking bipartisan support for this kind of investment. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation could deliver five gigawatts of solar PV and two gigawatts of solar thermal by 2020, which is the equivalent of seven large coal fired power stations. I think it comes at exactly the right time to give Australia the leg-up that we need to enter the global renewable energy race. It will overcome the barriers which have stymied our clean energy sector for too long, and unlock significant new investment and jobs in Australia. Despite the uncertain global economy, this sector is set to become one of the biggest industries of tomorrow. In conjunction with our 20 per cent renewable energy target, it will deliver diversity in our mix of energy as 'insurance to Australia securing the lowest cost of energy in a carbon constrained world', and it will create tens of thousands of jobs to underpin a strong future economy. It equips Australia with a suite of policies that can pull emerging clean energy technologies right through the innovation chain, helping turn great Australian innovation into real clean energy projects.


Australians are great innovators. We live in a country endowed with some of the best renewable energy resources of any country in the world: sun, wind, oceans and hot rocks. However, as a nation we have been stumbling along in the global race to take advantage of the global boom in renewable energy. As I mentioned before, it was a $243 billion industry in 2010, and it is expected to attract $5.7 trillion of investment globally over the next 25 years. Countries like China, South Korea, Germany and the US, frankly, have been leaving us for dead, often using technologies that were developed here. We should be winning this race. We have what it takes to lead the world into a renewable energy future. Instead we have allowed other nations with less technological innovation and fewer natural resources to get ahead. Our universities have consistently delivered world-leading innovation in renewable energy, but, when it comes time for commercialising these technologies, a pattern has emerged that sees the innovations going offshore. We can and should put a stop to this. These have been missed opportunities for our manufacturing industries and a failure to capitalise on and maximise our job creation.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is designed to take our best renewable energy innovation to full-scale commercial operation. In conjunction with putting a price on pollution and building on the 20 per cent renewable energy target, the corporation is a critical policy that will deliver Australians clean energy cheaper and sooner. I commend the bills to the House.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (19:58):  Tonight, I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and other associated legislation: the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, the Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012 and the Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012. For the most part, though, my focus tonight will be on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012. I think it is important to understand the genesis of this bill. This bill is very separate to the announcement made by the government to introduce the carbon tax and all of the associated legislation that goes with it. The genesis of this bill was cooked up between the Labor government and the Greens at the direction of the Greens because they wanted to invest $10 billion of taxpayer money into renewable energy projects of their own choosing. At the time Senator Milne commented on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, or as it has colloquially become known 'the Bob Brown bank', and said:


With a legislatively guaranteed stream of funding outside the budget, no future government will be able to undermine it without changing legislation.


That is the point of the legislation that has been brought before this House. This legislation is designed to make it very difficult for any other government to undo. What does it seek to do? According to the government, it seeks to invest in financial assets for the development of Australian based renewable energy technologies, low-emission technologies and energy efficient projects. It has the power to enter into investment agreements and make investments through subsidiaries. It has a duty to ensure that, as of 1 July 2018, half the funds invested at that time for the purposes of its investment function are invested in renewable energy technology.


The legislation also sets out a special account through which it will operate. Into this account $2 billion of taxpayer money per annum will be paid for the next five years, with the first instalment due to be paid on 1 July 2013 and each subsequent year after that, totalling $10 billion. It has the purpose of making payments to the CEFC and to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA. The CEFC, according to the government, is intended to be self-sustaining once it is mature. The funds are meant to be returned to the CEFC for its investments and will be available for re-investment. That is what the government says the objectives of the bill are, and that is what it says the bill will do. However, we know that there is a huge difference between what the government says and what the government actually does.


It is important to note that the consultation on this bill has been negligible. The consultation process has been virtually zip. When you consider that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics is currently still looking at this bill—the report has not even been tabled—yet the government is debating this bill in the House. Let me just outline to you the amount of time that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics has had to look at this bill. The committee was notified on Thursday evening that a meeting was to be called because a referral had been given by the government. The committee met the following Friday morning at around 11 o'clock and it was determined by the government that the bills be referred to the committee. A media release went out that Friday afternoon calling for submissions. Submissions, of course, were closed on the Monday. So, following the weekend, submissions were closed and the only people invited to present for 2½ hours to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics were the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and the Treasury. There was no public consultation, nothing was heard by any market participants and no-one else was invited. It was effectively an in-camera job.


So, we have had one session of 2½ hours for a $10 billion bill. That is about $4 billion an hour. There has been no public consultation with industry or market participants and, as I said, the bill is still being considered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, and the report will not be tabled until tomorrow. But we know, really, that this is all a sham consultation process. Who could deduce otherwise from that timetable? The only conclusion that one could draw is that the government is seeking to avoid scrutiny of this bill because it knows it will be damned by that scrutiny.


Let us take the opportunity to have a look at what little evidence the committee could glean in that 2½ hours. Of course, the committee was shut down from any further scrutiny of the bills despite the fact that there were a number of members who sought to extend the timetable. The mandatory renewable energy target is something that is a bipartisan target of 20 per cent of mandatory renewable energy in Australia. Questions were asked. With this additional funding of $10 billion, will we see additional energy targets increase? Will we actually see more renewable energy as a result of a $10 billion 'investment' of taxpayer dollars into this renewable energy? I am sad to say that, in fact, there will be no change to the mandatory renewable energy target as a result of an additional $10 billion. I would like to quote from the evidence that was provided to the committee. My colleague Steve Ciobo asked this direct question of Treasury:


So, the purpose of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is to drive investment into renewable energy, but it is going to make zero difference to the renewable energy target. Is that correct?


Mr Waslin, who I must say had a very difficult task as a member of the Treasury in having to defend the government's policy, said:


The purpose is to overcome the financial barriers. The renewable energy target affects the pricing of renewable energy and what can be achieved, but the individual projects themselves may still have barriers which inhibit investment. The purpose of the CEFC is to address those barriers and not the target itself.


Unfortunately, the evidence was very clear that there will be no increase in the target despite the enormous expense to taxpayers of $10 billion.


Let us look at the investment mandate of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Who can forget the comments made by Paul Howes last week at the Press Club when he spoke about the need for the government to get back into the business of 'picking winners'? He need not have been too concerned because, of course, the Greens are well ahead of him, except they sort of mixed up the whole picking winners aspect. They want a very different investment mandate. They in fact want the mandate to be about the riskiest types of investment—not the cheapest, not the most efficient, but the riskiest. Again, unfortunately, we heard quite a bit of evidence—and we look to the explanatory memorandum itself—that the CEFC is charged with finding technologies in the market that are effectively unproven, speculative and too risky for commercial financing.


This of course means that not all of those investments will produce a commercial return. The explanatory memorandum states:


The fiscal and underlying cash balance impacts include a prudent recognition that some investments will not be recovered, and interest revenue. The fiscal balance impact also includes the concessional component of loans.


It is very clear from this that the government expects to lose money and a lot of it. When questions were asked of the Treasury about the fact that clearly there needed to be a rate of return for an investment, the Treasury were not able to define what that rate of return was. They speculated it could be the government bond rate, but they could not be certain because this is to be determined by the board. They said that no modelling had in fact been done but they had factored in that they thought that there would be 7.5 per cent a year of investments not recovered. When we consider that there is $2 billion of investment each year, we are talking about $150 million each and every year.


The Treasury said that this was a conservative estimate. When they were pressed on exactly how this was conservative—how 7½ per cent a year of the investment not being recovered, leaving aside the rate of return, was conservative—they had to take on notice how they had actually devised this figure. This is very concerning for everybody on this side of the chamber and it should be concerning to people on the other side of the chamber as well. It is something that we are exercised about, and I want to quote from some of the evidence. My colleague Mr Ciobo asked about the success rate. He said, 'You are predicting a 92.5 per cent success rate, which assumes that 7.5 per cent of the investments are not recovered.' Mr Nicol replied:


At the moment that is our best guess.


I think that is the key word there; it is a 'guess'—nothing more, nothing less. In fact, the government simply does not know.


More than this, the government says that the point of this bill is to have Australian investments in renewable energy. When you actually look at the bill, at clause 61, when they talk about Australian based investments it is very clear that the Australian based investments that are spoken about are investments that are to be determined by guidelines set out by the board itself. I asked a number of questions of the Treasury on this:


What about overseas investment? What about companies that are predominantly owned by foreign or overseas investors?


Mr Waslin from the Treasury replied:


We are talking about where the assets would be located and not the ownership.


I said:


So, so long as the assets are here, for the purpose of this section of the bill, you would say that that makes it an Australian-based investment?


He replied:


Yes.


I said:


Irrespective of the fact that the guidelines have not yet been drafted? 


He replied:


That is what is behind the solely or mainly based. It is a similar approach to what the UK Green Investment Bank is also taking. 


I said:


But it would be up to the board to take a different view? 


And the Treasury had to conclude that in fact it is entirely up to the board.


In the time remaining I would like to point out that there are a number of regulations that would go with this bill, yet these regulations have not been sighted. They are regulations that go to the heart of this bill. It causes us great concern that we have not been able to sight these regulations. We are also very concerned about the appropriation that has been provided to the CEFC for their ongoing costs: around $57.3 million over the forward estimates. This is drastically differently to the operating costs of the Inspector-General of Taxation, at around $1.5 million. When you look closely at the legislation there is nothing to prohibit the board setting very high salaries, for instance, for the CEO. There is no limitation on that amount. Again, it is entirely at the discretion of the board.


We are told by the Treasury, by the government, that the CEFC is going to be totally self-sufficient by 2015-16, yet there is no evidence to support this. It is merely a hope. It is merely something that the government wishes to be. Again, there is no evidence to support the statements that have been made. So what do we know? We know that this is $10 billion of taxpayers' money, $10 billion that has to be borrowed, $10 billion that will have to be paid for by not only this generation of Australians but future generations. What will we get for this? It is totally unclear.


The government has avoided scrutiny at every opportunity because it knows that the bill does not stand up to scrutiny. If those on the other side thought that these investments were so wonderful, they themselves would invest their own money in these investments. The ministers on the other side would put their superannuation funds in the hands of the CEFC. But I bet you they will not, and the reason they will not is that they know what we know: that this is bad legislation. The returns will be negligible, if anything, and it is an indictment on this government that this legislation has been brought forward.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (20:14):  How exciting it is to be able to speak on this visionary bill, and how disappointing it is to hear what should be the bright young future of the Liberal Party lining herself up with the dinosaurs on the front bench. What a giveaway it was to hear the member for Goldstein talk about this bill and lump it in with the NBN. Nothing could explain or illustrate to you better the lack of vision, the lack of imagination, that this coalition demonstrates. It is the sort of issue we face with a party and a coalition that is unable to meet the challenges that confront this country not only in relation to climate change but in relation to the economic needs of this country in being able to diversify our economy into the future. We heard reference to the consultation and development of this project. It makes me laugh when we think back to the Howard government's $10 billion water plan on the beer coaster that did not even go through cabinet compared to the extensive development that went into this project. We also heard the member for Flinders talk about the Howard government's record in introducing a mandatory renewable energy target. The shame of the Howard years was that through that 12-year period we saw our renewable energy generation capacity decline from 10 per cent to nine per cent. That was an incredibly shameful record of lost opportunities.


This bill is not just about climate change. In fact, you do not even have to believe in climate change to support this bill, because this bill is all about tackling those economic challenges we face, the challenges that are generated by the mining boom and the need to have an economy where we are investing in infrastructure, skills and innovation. This bill really addresses the innovation aspect of that trifecta. It also addresses the needs we will have in energy security and the needs we will have to improve the health of our population. We have the health minister here with us tonight. There are significant benefits to be had from cleaning up the air in our major cities and from getting to renewable energy. Remember, this is the move from non-renewable energy—in other words energy that will expire—to renewable energy.


In every development, every technological advancement and market improvement in human history there is always a period where price competitiveness is an issue in the introduction of new technologies. The first time you went out and bought a plasma TV they cost $12,000. They are now pushed out the door for less than $1,000. What we intend to do with measures like these is get that impetus, the strategic weight behind the shift to renewable energy. And then, as the market share increases, the volume increases and the technology improves so the price comes down. In effect, what we are doing for Australians through measures like these is delivering them a future of cheaper energy in the long-term, as renewable energy sources will inevitably be. It is the coalition that would deny them that future security and cheaper power.


It is important we get involved in innovation, as I mentioned. That is the challenge we face. We can see the impacts on our economy of the mining boom. I look to the example of Israel. I have been to visit Israel and looked at the way it has addressed innovation with similar constraints to Australia of not being able to compete with cheap labour from sources such as Asia. Innovation was the way it drove an economy that is leading the world in technological advance. This is a country that, I might point out, is 7,000 square kilometres smaller than my own electorate of Eden-Monaro yet has a venture capital pool of $16 billion. Certainly this has been driven by government policy creating a program very similar to this that stimulated co-investment from the private sector into innovation.


We heard the member for Higgins talk about the risk component of this project. It is precisely the fact that the culture of venture capital and risk-taking in Israel has delivered the economic benefits achieved. There is a need in this country to generate a culture of taking risk in innovation and in start-ups. This Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill will help deliver that. What am I talking about? I have an example in my own backyard of Spark Solar, the company of the wonderful young scientist Michelle McCann, who had done lots of research into more efficient solar cells. Spark Solar had proposals to develop a company in Queanbeyan which would have eventually been looking to export into our region. For the want of $2 million as a final piece of investment in that company, the whole project fell over. We cannot afford to see those sorts of projects fall over. We are seeing over a billion dollars worth of investment in my region in renewable energy projects but it is into these value added, high-tech companies that we also need to diversify. This is critical. We must get behind those entrepreneurs who we have seen bleed overseas in the past.


I am also concerned that this is an aspect of our energy security. When I was in Defence and had the Middle East desk I tracked the sources of funding coming into our region to fund radical madrassas and terrorist movements as coming from some unhealthy sources of petrodollars. We know that our country is currently 80 per cent self-sufficient in fuel supplies but within 15 to 20 years that figure will flop over. We will become 80 per cent dependent on foreign supplies, which means we will be at the mercy of OPEC and conglomerates and cartels such as that, which will add to our balance of payments deficit and fuel the sources of income to some of those unhealthy influences in our region. So it is important for us to get behind transitions as quickly as possible from fossil fuels.


There is a wonderful company near my region in the Shoalhaven called Algae Tec, which is developing brilliant technology for biodiesel fuels, and this very exciting. Projects like that will have a significant boost from these sorts of finance corporation measures. We know that these measures are intended to overcome the financial barriers to commercialising and deploying cleaner energy technologies. To move us through this process we know will take us to a 40 per cent generation figure by 2050. We are on track to achieve our 20 per cent target by 2020. These measures will get us over some of those hurdles we have experienced in investment and the timidity we have seen in investment in these sorts of industries and technologies in the past in this country.


But there are lots of measures in this bill that are to be admired for their elegance. For example, what we see with the requirement to apply a commercial filter is the combination of private sector skills and disciplines married to public policy guidance. With the funds that will be generated and that will be deployed through the appropriations, we will eventually see a self-sustaining finance mechanism. A special account will be created to manage surplus funds and to limit the corporations' need to undertake a cash management function. There will also be a mechanism whereby the board will be governed by an investment mandate from government. This will be where the public policy guidance will emerge even though there will be a high degree of independence. The sorts of directions that will appear in that mandate will deal with the issues of risk and return, eligibility criteria, investments in renewable energy technologies, low-emission technologies and energy efficiency projects, the allocation of investment, limits on concessional investments and types of financial instruments in which the corporation may invest in broad operational matters. And, very importantly, we intend to apply the Australian Industry Participation Plan framework to the corporation through this investment mandate with the objective of ensuring that Australian industry is afforded full opportunity to participate in these projects. And so this investment mandate will be in the form of a legislative instrument.


How is this being received by the business world? We know that a Deloitte study of over 40 senior executives from Australian banks, super funds, venture capital firms and major investors found that they overwhelmingly support this mechanism. Certainly, we have seen comments from the Clean Energy Council, which stated through the chief executive, Kane Thornton, that this will help bridge that gap between early research and development and the commercial rollout of clean energy technologies. The Australian Solar Energy Society said that the CEFC is set to help unlock substantial investment in community-scale, commercial-scale and large-scale solar energy. In fact, they called on the federal opposition to back the CEFC. They said that the CEFC is effectively helping to meet some of the goals that would normally be part of the philosophy of the Liberal Party—a coalition alignment—in relation to tackling climate change through commercial mechanisms and commercial filters. But, of course, we have seen the abandonment of those principles by the coalition and we have seen them so reluctant to adopt measures which actually promote business and investment through all of the propositions that we have put.


But certainly the corporation, through loans, loan guarantees and equity investment support, will begin operation, based in Sydney, in the period from about 2013-14. Of course, there is the potential through the $10 billion that this fund will have at its disposal to leverage something upwards of perhaps $100 billion in private investment through the co-investment strategies and requirements of the scheme.


I would draw the attention of members to an excellent article in the Sydney Morning Herald by the economist Simon O'Connor, who pointed to other mechanisms like these: the UK Green Investment Bank, the German development agency and the China Development Bank's $30 billion clean energy investments. We have been falling behind in this space, and the analysis that he put together is very instructive. Whereas the rest of the world is embracing this method of accelerating renewable energy investment at a time of intense global spending pressures we have been falling behind. He said:


Renewables are one of the few global industries that registered continued growth throughout the GFC. Clean energy investment is up 500 per cent since 2004.


Couple this with longer term energy forecasts and the necessity becomes very apparent. He continued:


Investing now in diverse sources is critical for the holy trinity of power: energy security, insurance against price shocks and lower energy prices.


He also stated:


Most energy analysts believe it is only a matter of time before our cheap fossil fuels inflate to international prices, all because of that very successful LNG and coal export program we've got going.


He points out:


Solar costs dropped by 50 per cent in 2011 alone.


So we are seeing that clean energy can indeed be cheaper, as I highlighted earlier with how we transition from one form of technology to the other. He also pointed out that another reason is the investment case. He stated:


Australians have more than $1 trillion invested in super funds, the majority of which is being battered by overexposure to global and domestic equity markets.


So:


… part of the solution relies on a more diverse asset allocation in pension fund portfolios.


He stated:


Indeed, when the global asset consultant Mercer investigated the overexposure of pension funds to climate risk, it came to the conclusion that 40 per cent of portfolios should be reallocated to climate-sensitive assets—such as clean energy.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation, like its global cousins, responds to these challenges by broadening the energy infrastructure assets accessible to institutional investors. The corporation will help package these clean energy assets into something that a super fund, or other large investors, can finally take a stake in.


Super funds in Australia have shown some desire already to go down this road:


Industry Funds Management owns Pacific Hydro on behalf of the industry super funds, VicSuper seeded the Cleantech Australia Fund and REST super is a cornerstone investor in a major wind farm development in Western Australia.


This, as Simon points out, is a far better mechanism than a so-called direct action policy that would require bureaucrats to pick winners. He states:


… the CEFC is a commercially driven co-investment vehicle, run by independent, financially experienced staff, chaired at this point by the impeccably credentialled Jillian Broadbent—


as he describes her. He describes this as:


… the winning strategy for mums and dads with their money in super and the investors who oversee it.


I would also like to point out, while we are at it, that in relation to the health benefits motor vehicle emissions, for example, are the main cause of outdoor pollution in Australia, accounting for about 75 per cent of that. We know that all of these particulates and pollution from the current source of non-renewable energy cause upper respiratory irritation, chronic respiratory and heart disease, lung cancer, acute respiratory infections in children and chronic bronchitis in adults, aggravating pre-existing heart and lung diseases or asthmatic attacks. In addition, short- and long-term exposures have been linked with premature mortality and reduced life expectancy.


What we can benefit from in this measure is an energy-secure and healthy future, and something that will meet the energy needs of future generations of Australians well into the future. It is this sort of creative solution to stimulate innovation and the diversified economy that this nation must have and which is long overdue. It will provide us with a potent sword to complement the shield of other measures we have introduced to slay our carbon emissions dragon. It will help us to provide the energy security, prosperity and rewarding jobs that our children have the right to expect. And it is within the gift of this generation of Australians to deliver. I commend the bill to the House.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (20:28):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and the related bills. The Rudd-Gillard government has had a lot of bad ideas. It has had a lot of ill-thought-through ideas. It has had a lot of politically motivated ideas. It has had a lot of ideas which have been very hastily put together to meet short-term political objectives without thinking through carefully whether they make good long-term economic or policy sense. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation ranks right up there with some of the very worst ideas the Rudd-Gillard government has brought forward in its deeply undistinguished nearly five-year tenure. The essence of the policy package that this House is considering this evening is that the Commonwealth government should take $10 billion of taxpayers' money, together with some running costs, and put that money into projects that the private sector would not touch. Supposedly this is going to be a commercially successful venture, yet this investment fund is constrained to invest in projects that the private sector would not touch. It is extraordinarily difficult to understand how anybody could imagine that this is going to be anything other than a spectacular financial disaster.


In the brief time available to me, I want to make three points. The first is that the rationale for this measure—the reason the House is considering it—has nothing to do with policy; it is pure politics. It is because of a promise that a desperate Prime Minister Gillard made to the Greens. The second point I want to make is that, to fund this promise, the Gillard government is spending $10 billion that it does not have. All of this is borrowed money, and they have resorted to dodgy accounting to try to hide that fact. The third point I want to make is that this is going to be a dud investment for the Australian taxpayer. Any taxpayer who thinks that we are likely to get back all or even some of the $10 billion is, I fear, going to be facing a very disappointing outcome indeed.


Let me turn to the first proposition. The reason that the House is debating the Clean Energy Finance Corporation proposal this evening is that the Gillard government was desperate to secure the political support of the Greens to cling onto government and, in turn, committed to introduce a carbon tax despite having gone to the 2010 election promising there would be 'no carbon tax under the government I lead'—the famous words of Prime Minister Gillard. In addition, the Gillard government was forced to do something that the Greens insisted on as a political price for supporting the package: the Gillard government was forced to agree to tip $10 billion of taxpayers' money into this ill-considered Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We first heard of it in July 2011 after the package negotiated between the government, the Greens and the Independents was finally announced.


Let me remind the House of the euphoric, giddy words of Greens Senator Milne, who was the co-deputy chair of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. Charged with the euphoria of victory, she said on 10 July 2011:


The Greens welcome the leap forward towards powering Australia with 100% renewable energy secured as part of the agreement to put a price on pollution announced today with the government and the independent MPs.


The Australian community is crying out for renewable energy and I am delighted that we have been able to deliver Australia's biggest ever public investment in renewable energy …


Those were the words of Greens Senator Christine Milne in July 2011 as she ecstatically claimed victory in securing this $10 billion commitment of borrowed taxpayers' money to go into this ill-conceived venture. It is noteworthy that key policy elements of what is coming before the House this evening are elements that were specifically insisted upon by the Greens. Again I go to the statement issued by Senator Milne:


Securing a guarantee of 50% of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation fund for renewable energy … is the biggest single investment in renewable energy Australia has ever made.


In other words, a key design feature of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation—an insistence that 50 per cent of the money go into renewable energy as opposed to other forms of green energy—is something that was specifically required by the Greens party, and the Labor Party and Prime Minister Gillard had no choice but to accede to that. That is the sorry history of the grubby political deal which underpins the $10 billion taxpayers' cheque that this people's House is being asked to write this evening—because that is what we are being asked to do. We are being asked to write a cheque for $10 billion of taxpayers' money with very little comfort and very little reason to believe that we are ever going to see that money again.


I need hardly remind the House that no part of this policy was taken to the last election. The Australian people were never given the opportunity to decide whether they wanted to put $10 billion of their money at risk investing in ventures which the private sector had declined to invest in. That option was never given to them, but the Labor government, in cahoots with the Greens, has decided on their behalf that apparently that is a good idea.


That brings me to the second point I wanted to make this evening. It is curious that on the one hand the government thinks this is a good idea but on the other hand it is desperate to find a way to disguise the true accounting and financial impact of this measure. To achieve the disguising of the true financial impact of this measure, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation have resorted to an accounting trick which they have resorted to several times already in the life of the Rudd-Gillard government. That accounting trick is to pretend that the money which is being spent is an equity investment in a vehicle which is going to generate a commercial return. That is the accounting trick which has been used for the National Broadband Network company, which is going to see some $20 billion, $30 billion or $40 billion—it could be $50 billion or more—of taxpayers' money squandered on an ill-conceived venture. That is the same accounting trick which this government is now using in relation to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which is again going to squander billions of dollars of taxpayers' money.


The consequence of the accounting trick—as I am sure you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Symon—is that, by treating the money as an equity investment, it is not included in what is called the underlying cash balance. The underlying cash balance is the number which is colloquially referred to as the budget bottom line. The Treasurer proudly produced a budget bottom line this year that was, for the year 2012-13, a promised surplus of a bare $1.5 billion—a derisory amount, it might be pointed out, in the context of total Commonwealth expenditure of $364 billion. But he proudly claimed that he was delivering a surplus. The point I make to you, Mr Deputy Speaker—and I am sure that, to you, being the aficionado of government accounting standards that you are, it is not a point I need to underline—is that that number is the underlying cash balance, and the $2 billion a year which is appropriated by the bill before the House this evening into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation does not appear in the underlying cash balance. If those moneys were included then it would make the forward estimates look $10 billion worse than they actually look in the numbers the Treasurer presented to this House just a few weeks ago.


Let me turn to the third point I want to make. I predict that this investment of $10 billion of taxpayers' money is going to turn out very, very badly. I predict that taxpayers are not going to see a good return on the $10 billion which this government has presumed to invest on their behalf in a range of speculative and unproven technologies—technologies so speculative and unproven that they are ones that the private sector has declined to invest in.


Let us be clear here, because there were some points made earlier by the member for Eden-Monaro which seemed designed to give a misleading impression. The coalition has no objection to a venture capital industry. The coalition has no objection to people putting money at risk in innovation, green energy or any other area of new technology. We say good luck to people who do that, and, if you make money out of it, we congratulate you. But what we also say is: that is not a proper function of governments, to put taxpayers' money at risk doing it. That is something which private business people are free to do if they want to put at risk their capital or their shareholders' capital. But the idea that taxpayers' money, collected painstakingly from millions of Australians, many of them of modest means, should be put at risk in speculative ventures where there is very little confidence that the money will ever come back is the height of irresponsibility. And for this government to be doing that in pursuit of a political objective is disgraceful.


Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have noticed, when you read the expert report prepared by Jillian Broadbent and her two eminent colleagues, that there was some very careful wording. I am looking at page 9. After describing the objective that the expert panel recommends for the CEFC, the experts go on to say:


The CEFC will be challenged in achieving this objective as there is a tension between funding the clean energy sector, applying a commercial filter, and maintaining the financial self-sufficiency of the corporation.


That is the understatement of the century. That is code for saying, 'It is extremely unlikely this organisation is ever going to make a buck.'


When officials of the Treasury department appeared before the House Standing Committee on Economics yesterday, I had the opportunity to ask them if they thought this was going to turn out to be a good investment for taxpayers. I took that opportunity to ask the question, but they declined to answer. They said it was a policy decision. And I can understand why an official facing that question would duck it, because anybody who has had any experience in this area and who has seen the sorry track record of governments marching in to invest money in areas where private sector investors have trodden more warily would know that it almost invariably ends in tears.


When we asked some further detailed questions yesterday of Treasury officials about why it was that the government is expected to be able to make money out of these kinds of investments when the private sector has not been able to, the answer that I got from Mr Waslin of the Treasury was as follows:


As I said, the government is prepared to provide funds at a target rate of return which is less than the private sector's but it does also recognise the positive externalities.


Let us put aside 'positive externalities', which is a nice bureaucratic way of saying, 'The fairies at the bottom of the garden—if we hope very, very hard, and close our eyes and hum a bit, then maybe we'll get a nice positive financial return.' Let us focus on what this particular official was really saying to the committee. What he was really saying was, 'The only reason that the government might be able to do this is because the government can live with a lower rate of return than the private sector.'


Let us just understand that point because, if you look through the expert committee report, it refers to a financial target of achieving a return equal to the government bond rate. In other words, the grand financial scheme here is: the government can borrow money at the government bond rate and therefore it can accept a commercial return which is only equal to the government bond rate and no higher. Given that the government bond rate is, by definition, lower than the cost of finance which the private sector has to pay, then, if you took that logic to its extreme, government would carry out every activity in our economy because it has a lower cost of financing. That is essentially what is being proposed in the economic logic of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation: because the government does not need such a high rate of return then it is okay for it to take a risk on investing in risky and speculative technologies in green energy where the private sector has chosen not to take that risk.


There are examples around the world of governments losing a huge amount of taxpayers' money in doing this kind of thing. If I had more time I could speak about Solyndra, a US company which received a US$535 million loan guarantee from the Obama administration in 2009; the money was all lost. I do not have time.


I will conclude by saying this. This is a really bad idea. It is going to lose a bucket of taxpayers' money. And we should reject it.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (20:43):  I would like to thank the member for Bradfield for his very positive and optimistic contribution to this evening's debate. That is the kind of positivity and optimism you might expect from Thomas Hardy or from Dickens—something of that nature—though not really unexpected from those opposite. It is interesting to me that in summary the member for Bradfield's contribution to this evening's debate is all about the inelegance and the inappropriateness of government intervention into a marketplace. It is curious therefore that his side of politics is in fact opposing one of the most significant market mechanisms that this country has seen, through the introduction of a carbon price mechanism. It is extraordinary that his side of politics is this evening so vehemently objecting to intervention in the market through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation by government and yet seeks to impose a $1,300 impost on each household to fund what their side of politics has called a Direct Action Plan, which has been described as a tree in every lounge room. It is a most extraordinary proposition to put forward and then come into this place this evening and oppose the proposition to support the development of renewables in this country through the establishment of an appropriately thought-through mechanism, developed in consultation with experts and as part of an overall clean energy package. It is extraordinary that the opposition come in here this evening, having opposed household assistance, having opposed things like the Carbon Farming Initiative—which indeed will help some to the National Party's constituents, some of their farmers. They oppose that and they manage to oppose household measures and tax cuts. They have presented us with a crude so-called Direct Action Plan to address one of the most significant problems facing not only our country but our globe. It is amateurish that they come in here and present us with these thoroughly inadequate responses to significant policy problems across the globe.


I mentioned optimism earlier on, and it is disappointing once again to come into this place and have the opposition merely say 'no' to a well thought-through, well crafted policy proposal by this government. It is not simply a policy proposal of this government. I was reminded of that this week when I met some of the young people who came in to see me from the 100% Renewable Campaign, which is a community campaign working with over 100 local groups right around Australia, some of which are in my own electorate of La Trobe. They are groups that have been out polling community members right around the country; they have polled around 8,000 people face-to-face and around 4,000 people online, they tell me, about their views on the solar industry and for government investment in the renewables sector as a whole. They tell me that those results show that 94 per cent of people they surveyed support building large scale solar, for instance, in Australia and that 95 per cent support the government's new proposal for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It is compelling to me that there are people who have by their own resources and by their own means—some of them very limited means, I would expect—come to Canberra to speak to members of parliament about their vision for clean energy in this country. The member for Bradfield and I am sure many other opposition members throughout the course of this debate and the broader debate within our community have asked: 'Well, what we do we get back for this investment that is being made in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which in turn will support renewables?' What we get back is the opportunity to establish new industries, the opportunity to establish new jobs for Australians in a country and a globe which is going through economic transition. We get the opportunity to support new industries for Australians. It is not surprising that this is the next step in the government's clean energy package of measures, because our commitment to a clean energy future is absolutely apparent and has been apparent for some time. Whether it is through the carbon price, the Carbon Farming Initiative—that I mentioned as being so disappointingly opposed by people who purport to support farmers in this country and who purport to support people who could well derive an income stream by means of the Carbon Farming Initiative—or whether it is through the establishment of renewables targets or whether it is through the establishment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation this evening, it is simply part of the sequence of events that this government is going through to build a new future for our country, one which is not reliant on old energy and which is not reliant on carbon polluting technologies.


This evening's bill, which contemplates the establishment of a Clean Energy Finance Corporation, is important because it ensures that new renewables technologies get the financial support that they need to become larger operations and to ensure that we have increasing numbers of employees engaged in those new industries. We know that clean energy technologies face a range of obstacles in attracting financing: current global financial conditions, the cost of renewable energy, the complex nature of Australia's electricity markets and the preference of some investing institutions for listed assets all contribute to the inhibiting of the financing of the clean energy sector at present. It is appropriate that we establish a mechanism to counteract that. 


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will make individual decisions about investment which are independent of government. They will be referential-backed to an investment mandate which provides a mechanism for the government to articulate its broad expectations of how that corporation might invest and how it might go about its work. In April this year we released the expert review panel's report on the design of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The government accepted the recommendations of that report and so it is implementing them through this bill. It has taken appropriate advice in a timely way in accordance with the range of measures which we have implemented to respond to the clean energy needs of our country and is implementing this measure through this bill.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will make investments for the development of Australian-based renewable energy technologies—low emission technologies, energy efficiency projects and businesses that supply the required inputs. I might say as someone who not so long ago was in commercial practice and acting in relation to clean energy opportunities that other countries' businesses had taken on, it was disappointing for me to see that the same opportunities were not being taken up by Australian companies. It is a great source of pride to me this evening to be participating in a debate that will try to support Australian-based renewables businesses. The bill before us requires the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to have at least half of the corporation's investments in renewable energy technologies by June 2018. The government will provide around $2 billion of funding to the corporation per annum for five years, starting in 2013-14, with profits being available for reinvestment. But why have a Clean Energy Finance Corporation? The investment of $10 billion in the corporation will mean that we can unlock new and very substantial private investment in clean energy projects and the supply chain that feeds into those projects. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will enable the leveraging of private sector financing for renewable energy, low-emissions and energy efficiency technologies—investments which are critical to the transformation of the Australian economy. It will mean that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation can make investments and encourage private sector investment in clean energy technologies. It is ultimately the key to changing the economics of clean energy projects and making them more competitive in our country. It is necessary so that we can overcome potential market barriers that currently prevent those projects from going ahead—for instance, where investors are not appropriately informed about or familiar with emerging technologies.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will have a number of means available to it to tailor investments to address current and potential market barriers, including the capacity to provide funds, change the allocation of risk amongst participants, and offer a concessional cost of funds. Ultimately it will act as a catalyst to enable private investment which is not currently available and thereby enable a contribution to be made to carbon emissions reduction and cleaner energy.


So this is a unique opportunity this evening and it is part of the broader package of measures being put in place by this government to respond to the needs of our community to develop industry opportunities, to develop employment opportunities in new technologies industries, and ultimately to respond to the challenge of climate change which affects Australia and which affects the globe. I am keenly aware of the impacts of climate change very close to home on things like biodiversity in a very sensitive part of the world—the Dandenong Ranges. I regularly have conservation groups—organisations such as Emerald for Sustainability and other groups which support the promotion of biodiversity and maintaining biodiversity in the Dandenong Ranges. They regularly come to me and remark on how positive they feel that action is now meaningfully being taken by Australia to respond to climate change—that action is not being taken in a piecemeal way through a so-called Direct Action Plan but is being taken in a way which supports industry, which supports those who are landowners and agriculturalists, which supports households while we make the transition, and which ultimately comes back to supporting our environment and protecting that environment for future generations.


This government is strongly committed to reducing Australia's carbon pollution because we know that, if Australia takes no action by 2020, our carbon pollution could be, for instance, 20 per cent higher than in 2000. The Australian government is investing more than $5 billion in developing and commercialising clean energy technologies because we know that they will be crucial to Australia's efforts to reduce its carbon pollution emissions. 


We have set a Renewable Energy Target of 20 per cent by 2020, and this means that by that stage one fifth of Australia's electricity will come from renewable sources such as wind, solar and geothermal power. It is for all those reasons that this important measure being considered this evening—the establishment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation—is necessary. It is for this reason that we are taking steps to not only provide incentives for high-polluting business to alter its practices so that it becomes lower polluting through the carbon price mechanism. It is not only through this mechanism that we seek to change behaviours. It is not only through that but through the Carbon Farming Initiative that we seek to offer opportunities to capture carbon emissions and to offset emissions. And, finally, it is through this measure that we enable a market mechanism to be assisted by the intervention of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to provide business opportunities, to provide employment opportunities, which go to support a properly functioning clean energy economy and our clean energy future.


It is for all of these reasons that this government has acted in a systematic, timely and well thought out way to develop a package of measures which enable our country to most efficiently make the transition to a clean energy future. There is a great deal of work yet to be done and we have engaged some of the best advice through those expert advisers who have provided their review on the operation of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It is through scientific advice and economic advice that we have formulated a range of policies—the carbon price, the Carbon Farming Initiative and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation—to deliver a package of reforms which provide us with a comprehensive means to respond to a clean energy future.


It is disappointing that those opposite have come here tonight once again simply to stymie debate on these issues. It is disappointing in the context of so many young people in my electorate and right around the country who have made their voices clearly known to me not simply through this week but through the course of my term as an MP and far beyond that period about the kind of future they want to see, about the clean energy economy that they want to see, about the opportunities that they want to see for our future. I am not going to squander that opportunity. Those of us on this side are not going to squander it. We are going to take the opportunity to change Australia for the better and we are doing it tonight through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (20:59):  I was interested to hear the last speaker mention the stymieing of debate, when you consider that we have a $10 billion fund for consideration in front of us that was actually only allowed two hours with the economics committee. If you want to talk about stymieing debate, that is certainly where we need to start. 


Tonight we are here to debate the Labor Party's bill to deliver its latest $10 billion slush fund. Of course, that is not what the government is describing this bill as, but then deceiving the Australian community has become business as usual for the Gillard government. We have to look at what this government says and then compare it to what it actually does. We see that yet again with this bill before the House. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill establishes another bureaucracy whose goal is to waste borrowed money that ultimately the taxpayer will be liable for. How many more times is this going to happen in the term of this government? There is a litany of failed wasteful green schemes and failed wasteful green bureaucracy after green bureaucracy. The great tragedy when you look at this fund is that the government does not actually know what to spend the money on, beyond such broad and nebulous directions as 'the corporation is a mechanism to help mobilise investment in renewable energy, low-emissions and energy-efficiency projects and technologies in Australia' and 'the corporation will finance Australia's clean energy sector using financial products and structures to address the barriers that are currently inhibiting investment'. 


Yet Australia already have products and structures that make low emissions and renewable energy attractive options, don't we? We have a bipartisan 20 per cent renewable energy target, which requires all energy suppliers to source one-fifth of their power from renewable sources by the year 2020. Failure to do so will attract penalties of hundreds of millions of dollars, much of which would have to come from state energy utilities. The existing production of around 15,000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy produced nationally is expected to have to increase by an extra 45,000 gigawatt hours over the next eight years, a total fourfold increase. Every unit of renewable energy power that suppliers fall short will cost them money. A penalty of $65 per megawatt hour would equate to $65,000 per gigawatt hour and $65 million per terawatt hour. At this price, if Australia only managed to double instead of quadruple its renewable energy production, our electricity suppliers would be facing annual fines of $1.95 billion. Now, that is an incentive. It is also a coincidence, given that $2 billion is the expected government contribution to the Clean Energy Fund annually as it collects its capital base. Otherwise, I presume, this cost will simply have to be added on to the cost paid by consumers—our Australian families and businesses.


Surely the renewable energy target is a major structure designed to increase low-emission energy production. It appears, however, that some observers think Australia will struggle to quadruple its renewable energy production in the required time, despite the obvious financial incentive. Getting three-quarters of the way to the target will still generate a billion dollars a year in penalties, which is, in effect, the government's second hidden carbon tax. This will be one more cost we can assume will be passed on to Australian energy consumers—to every house, every business and every family. So there already exists a structure to quadruple renewable energy production, yet according to the Gillard government this structure will be either inadequate or incompetent.


On top of the costs of the renewable energy target I have already mentioned, the carbon tax itself is supposed to be another structure the government designed to drive up the price of fossil fuel energy or, by default, subsidise the competitiveness of renewables. With a $23-a-tonne CO2 equivalent across the entire Australian economy, our nation has the most expensive carbon tax in the world. Australia's electricity generators produce nearly 200 million tonnes of CO2equivalent, which is, annually, over a third of our total emissions. At a cost of $23 a tonne, the impost they will have to pass on to consumers and industry is $4.6 billion, rising every year. Of course, free permits reduce the overall cost to some generators, but I note that no assistance is being offered to the Western Australian generators in my electorate, so many will pay the full cost.


Why do these two major pieces of Labor policy not create a sufficient environment for investment in renewable technologies? After all, they come with a billion-dollar revenue-raising capacity. Is the carbon tax a piece of environmental legislation, or is it social welfare and wealth redistribution coming to us stealthily like a wolf in sheep's clothing? I remind members of the explanatory memorandum for the clean energy future bill last year. It said:


A broad-based carbon price is the most environmentally effective and cheapest way to reduce pollution. A carbon price puts a price tag on carbon pollution. Under the mechanism, around 500 of the country's biggest polluters will be required to pay for each tonne of pollution they release into the atmosphere. This will have two effects.


It creates a powerful incentive for all businesses to cut their pollution by investing in clean technology or finding more efficient ways of operating.


A price on carbon will also create economic incentives to reduce pollution in the cheapest possible ways, rather than relying on more costly approaches such as government regulation and—


wait for it—


direct subsidies.


This is what the government said in their own clean energy future bill last year, that that would provide the mechanism so that the government did not have to rely on costly approaches such as direct subsidies. The explanatory memorandum to that legislation went on to say:


These incentives will flow through the economy. The carbon price will make lower-polluting technologies, especially clean energy technologies, more competitive and will boost investment in these technologies. In this way, introducing a price on carbon will trigger the transformation of the economy towards a clean energy future.


Well, what has happened? Why isn't this sufficient? These words should really be viewed through the usual screen of Labor Party distortion. What we do see, again, is the government saying one thing and doing another. That is not what they said in that clean energy futures bill and I hope those words will continue to be examined in the cross-examination of this bill before us now. Either the government misled the Australian people through the clean energy future bill or it is misleading the Australian people through this bill. It has to be one or the other. The government stated that the carbon tax itself would drive renewable energy technologies. So is the bill before the House today, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012, an acknowledgment  by the government that the carbon tax will actually fail to deliver renewable technology in its own right—so it is not going to do what the government said it would do? Is this an admission of failure, or, should I say, just the latest admission of failure and wasted borrowed funds and bloated bureaucracy yet again? Or is it instead not related to another government failure but an attempt to develop a separate Labor-Greens slush fund? 


The bill of course establishes the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, whose job it will be to oversee the expenditure and direct the outcomes the money will purchase. I wonder whether it will be more successful and more efficient than Labor's Fair Work Australia, that took four years to deliver a single report. Will there be better administrators than those who mismanaged Labor's disastrous pink batts program? I am particularly interested in this line in the explanatory memorandum:


The Corporation will apply capital through a commercial filter to facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean energy sector thus preparing and positioning the Australian economy and industry for a cleaner energy future.


What exactly will this commercial filter look like? 




Mr Chester:
  The green loans program.




Ms MARINO:
  The green loans program. Is it the same commercial filter through which the government gazed when it pretended to see world action on pricing carbon—even though the world has basically walked away from such moves? Is it the same commercial filter that the government used when it told high-energy-using trade-exposed industries that their carbon tax would have no impact—even though we see job losses, cancelled projects and closures on a daily basis? We really need to know what commercial filter this corporation will apply.


There are already serious concerns that the CEFC may in fact have a distortionary impact on the market and not stimulate tangible, sustainable results for progress in renewable energy projects. It may well undercut finance and investment in existing projects that have had to secure commercial financing—they have had to have a commercial case for large-scale renewable energy projects, and I have no doubt that the $10 billion will not be successfully invested. Irrespective of this, the renewable energy generated will still be 20 per cent—20 per cent before; 20 per cent after—so where is the justification?


I am absolutely appalled at the projected $750 million of taxpayers' money as losses attached to this bill. This is in the government's own papers. The government is admitting upfront that it plans to lose taxpayers' dollars through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill. I find that just appalling. Clearly, $750 million is chickenfeed to what the actual waste will be—$10 billion to pick Labor-Greens winners—and we will simply see questionable initiatives funded to support Labor and Greens ideologies. It will be without any question a Labor left-wing slush fund, aided and abetted by a board that will be appointed by the government and one that must consult with Labor ministers, a direct hands-on process. This is $10 billion being borrowed that Australian taxpayers will ultimately have to pay back. It is not in the government's budget. It is not part of the Labor government's $300 billion increase in the nation's debt ceiling. 


I have actually seen, as other members would have seen, some of the you-beaut schemes that will be pitching for these funds. I have seen some in newspapers and I have heard of some being hawked around the halls of this House. There are all sorts of opportunists rubbing their hands with glee. They know this is a gullible government. They have been down this road before. We have seen billions and billions of borrowed taxpayers' dollars wasted by this government. The opportunists know that the government cannot deliver programs without waste and mismanagement and they cannot wait to get their hands on these taxpayer funds. But it comes at a cost to Australian taxpayers. This government is infamous for coming up with the wrong answers to the questions of the day facing this nation, and this is yet another example of Labor getting it wrong.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (21:11): I am very pleased to support the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and related bills and to welcome the era of new technology development that they surely herald. I welcome this instalment in the government's carefully designed and far-reaching program for addressing carbon pollution, for addressing our reliance on hydrocarbons, and for setting up Australia as a leader when it comes to renewable energy and related technologies. This is a focused, forward-looking reformist Labor government, and we are getting things done, notwithstanding the vicissitudes of a minority parliament and a hostile coalition opposition, and we have just heard an example of that from the member for Forrest.


The policies and decisions of this Labor government, taken hand in hand with the resilience and creativity of Australian individuals and businesses, have made Australia a leader in economic management, and it is from that position of strength that we are leading this country through big-picture reforms in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency, in the areas of health and disability support, and in the areas of marine protection and transport infrastructure and reform. The clean energy legislation is a big part of that broad and deep reform effort, and it is a credit to the minister and the parliamentary secretary, to their staff, and the staff in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency that we stand on the brink of a new and promising trend of technological innovation in Australia.


Every day it seems there are events and challenges, both here in Australia and overseas, that can make it difficult to be optimistic about the world and our place in it. Terrible things happen and wicked problems persist. Economic crises are prompted by short-sightedness, poor regulation and greed. Economic successes are still too often characterised by inequality, selfishness and waste. Maybe that is an unnecessarily dark view, but it is one that can be hard to resist. And it is partly for that reason that we should recognise when we can the good things that we are capable of. In saying that, I strongly believe that the global effort to address the problems we have made for ourselves in the form of carbon pollution and hydrocarbon reliance will draw out some of the best human qualities. Like many people, I find it a bit sad that adversity is sometimes required to provoke the best in us, but I guess the best in us is worth having in any circumstances. The creation of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is a significant development in our history, the point at which a great flourishing of new low-carbon or no-carbon energy sources and other energy efficiency measures will be developed as the mainstay of Australia's electricity needs in the decades to come. 


Australia is far from alone in this effort, and indeed I have spoken before in this place to highlight the massive expansion of renewable energy investment and capacity that is occurring across the globe. As part of that global effort, this legislation is something that should make us all feel more positive and more optimistic about the direction in which we are headed as a nation. As a key component of the clean energy future package of reforms, these bills fit within a worldwide policy effort that gives me renewed hope in the idea of human progress and in the idea that we can learn from our mistakes and even outgrow the historical limitation of governing without enough regard to intergenerational needs or our shared international wellbeing.


The Clean Energy Finance Corporation, CEFC, is the part of the clean energy future package that will create an Australian economy that is more responsive to the needs of our burgeoning clean energy and energy efficiency industry. The government's $10 billion investment will play a supercharged enabling role in kick-starting new initiatives and in opening new private investment opportunities for low-carbon and no-carbon renewable energy projects. What is more, the CEFC will have the broader benefits of underwriting the improved design and construction of clean energy technology and the indirect benefit of creating lower cost technology. With the Australian clean energy market still in its early development, major obstacles exist in the currently limited and constrained allocation of capital for such initiatives. A number of these barriers were identified in the expert review chaired by Jillian Broadbent, and the structure and operation of the CEFC respond to the recommendations of that review.


The CEFC will function to stimulate private sector investment and financing for clean energy technologies. It will use a range of mechanisms to overcome the kinds of barriers identified by the expert review. For example, it will have the ability to provide direct funds, offer concessional cost funds, lengthen the available tenure of private sector loans, and favourably alter the allocation of risk amongst lending participants. By taking the lead in clean energy technology investments, the CEFC will act as a catalyst for the industry and for private market funding of new entrants. The corporation is not a grants program and the intention is not to compete with the private sector but, rather, to foster private sector energy growth in the clean energy market and associated industries by acting to overcome those existing private lending obstacles that are not really based on investment viability per se yet are real obstacles nonetheless in the current tight capital lending environment.


The board of the CEFC will be responsible for decision making and investments, and its operations are structured to avoid risks by being both transparent in its processes and of course fully accountable in relation to all individual investment decisions. The dividends from the CEFC earnings will be paid to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The funding provided to the CEFC will be a special appropriation of $2 billion per annum for five years from 1 July 2013. In addition, the corporation will receive operational and start-up funding through the budget of around $60 million over three years. The intention is that the CEFC will become financially self-sufficient, using its earnings to fund its operational expenses without further supplementary funding.


Appropriate capital finance support to underwrite the development of the emerging renewable energy sector is critical. Without such assistance, the huge potential of Australian inventors, innovators and entrepreneurs will be lost or, at best, it will go elsewhere. The importance of support in the form of capital finance is even greater now than it would normally be because capital markets are tight and constrained.


On that point, people need to remember what it is we are seeking to foster here. As Michael Ottaviano, the CEO of Carnegie Wave Energy in my electorate, has pointed out, the existing energy generation technologies and infrastructure that we all rely upon were not only developed with government support but wholly owned and run by government through almost all of the time in which electricity has been provided as a basic service to households and industry.


It is also salient to again emphasise that, where the Clean Energy Finance Corporation provides funding support, it will look to do so in a way that opens up avenues of private investment. This is the right and proper enabling role of government: first, to identify the country's long-term and strategic future needs; second, to recognise that these go above and beyond a much tighter horizon and profit frame in which business operates; and, third, to weigh both the wider costs of market inaction and the wider benefits of carefully rated risk and innovation.


I was very taken with a summary of the renewable energy development challenge that confronts all governments in an article by James Surowiecki in the 10 October 2011 edition of the New Yorker. In that piece he wrote:


… there are few industries where it makes a lot of sense for the government to complement the market by subsidising research and development. Renewable energy is one of them. That's because the energy market is not like most other markets. Indeed, the economics of alternative energy are such that private investors, left to their own devices, are bound to under-invest in it, since the considerable social benefits—cleaner air, fewer greenhouse emissions—accrue to everyone, not just to direct customers. That means that the economic rate of return is significantly less than the social rate of return. Energy markets are also dominated by entrenched, regulated companies, and that reduces the incentive for investment. Despite the immense size of the energy market, as of 2005 spending on energy R&D accounted for just 2 per cent of spending on R&D in the U.S. This creates an opportunity for the government to add value by investing smartly, just as it can add value by spending money on education or infrastructure, other areas where the social returns are greater than the economic ones.


That view is very much a part of how we have approached the task of setting Australia on the path to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future, with all the economic, environmental and social benefits this will deliver.


It is the same approach that the Labor government has taken with great success in first launching the incredible boom that we have seen in household solar PV systems, then gradually tapering our support as the industry's growing strength and the well-established private demand have made that higher level support unnecessary.


I am extremely pleased to support these bills and I am proud to be part of a Labor government that has fully applied itself to the challenge of reform, with all its difficulties but also most importantly with all its long-term rewards. I believe Australia will have a clean energy future. It is absolutely essential that we do and it begins with the work of this government in partnership with all the many and varied Australian innovators, inventors and entrepreneurs that we are seeking to support.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (21:21):  I rise to very strongly oppose the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 and the associated measures. I do so because I think the member for Fremantle, in fairness to her, outlined just then a very stark difference between the sides of the House. The Labor-Greens alliance, the coalition of Labor and Greens, believe very much in market intervention. They believe very strongly in taxpayers providing funding to what would not normally be commercially viable businesses. 



Ms Plibersek interjecting—




Mr BRIGGS:
  The Minister for Health would be a big supporter of that. She does not know if she is a Green or a Labor Party member, but I tell you: at the next election she will have the Greens right on her door. I think the second highest primary vote around the country for the Greens at the last election was in the Minister for Health's electorate. Labor are now doing deals with the Greens to fund Christine Milne's pet project. It has gone from being the Bob Brown bank to the Senator Milne bank with the change in arrangements for the Greens. But what has not changed is that the Labor Party and the Greens are in coalition and this is the very worst of their policy positions.


As I said at the beginning of my remarks: in fairness to the member for Fremantle, she is very honest about what she believes the role of government is in society. I appreciate that in this place. There are not a lot on that side who are now honest about what they think the role of government is in society, but she is very honest about what she thinks is the role of government in society. It is that governments should pick winners and that governments should take taxpayers' money and make decisions that the market would not otherwise make. That is in effect what she has just said.


We heard the member for Fremantle say what a great job the government had done to build up the solar panel industry. Of course, they also tried with the pink batts industry with their assistance in that area. That did not work out so well. When they spent $1 billion trying to build up the pink batts industry, which, again, was all to the purpose of creating a clean energy future, they wasted $2 billion on the way through because it did not work—and this will not work either. This is $10 billion, however, and that is the most concerning part about it. In the last couple of days during estimates hearings it has already been admitted that over the forward estimates this agency is expected to lose some $300 million of taxpayers' money, which is on budget. Of course, this $10 billion is off budget very deliberately. It is another one of the off-budget schemes that the government are trying to pursue, like the National Broadband Network. They are trying to hide the fiscal loss to the Commonwealth by putting it off budget.


We already know from estimates hearings that the witnesses have at least been honest enough to say that they expect well over seven per cent of the money they are investing to fail—$300 million of Australian taxpayers' money on businesses that will not succeed. We should think about that. They are spending Australian taxpayers' hard-earned money on pet projects of the Australian Greens, Senator Christine Milne and the member for Fremantle. These guys are making these decisions because it suits their ideological pursuit, but it does not suit working families—remember them?—who are working hard every day to try to put away money for the Greens and their coalition partner, the Labor Party, to go and pursue their own ideological needs and desires. That is the worst aspect of this.


I think one of the most insidious parts of the climate change package that this government has brought before the parliament is this bill and this $10 billion. We have already seen how much waste is created by the Australian Labor Party. These are projects which the commercial sector will not fund. There are already very successful renewable energy companies in the marketplace that this money will undercut. One of the great ironies of this Clean Energy Finance Corporation is that the money it will invest will undercut the money of entrepreneurs who are already out there in the marketplace trying to do exactly what the Labor Party and the Greens will tell you they seek to do—create alternative energies. This bill will create a situation which will undercut the work and efforts of those companies.


We know that this bill has been designed by the former leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown, and his replacement, Senator Christine Milne, who was a Co-chair of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. I remind the House: this was a committee that was formed after the election because at the election the Labor Party's climate change policy was to have 150 Australians get together to tell them what their climate change policy should be, along with cash for clunkers. That was the climate change policy of the Labor Party at the last federal election. After the election, the Prime Minister, of course, did a deal with Senator Brown and Senator Milne and created this climate change committee, out of which emerged the so-called 'Bob Brown bank'.


As Senator Milne made very clear in her comments about the corporation, it was designed such that:


With a legislatively guaranteed stream of funding outside the budget, no future government will be able to undermine it without changing legislation.


It is a very deliberate means of getting Australian taxpayers' money and putting it into the areas that the Greens and the Labor Party favour. They will seek to provide government funding to commercial enterprises that the market has decided are not worthy of funding. We know how wise the Labor Party are with investing in private enterprise. Those of us who live in South Australia and Victoria know how well the Labor Party ran banks in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It happened in Western Australia as well. They turned South Australia from being one of the strongest states in a fiscal sense to being, now, the weakest state in a fiscal sense, excluding Tasmania, because of the damage that was done by their behaviour in trying to act like a bunch of bankers in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They do not run things well. Governments do not run things well. Governments do not make investment decisions which are in the best interests of Australian taxpayers. And this bill will not lead to a change in this regard. It will lead to billions upon billions of dollars being piled into non-commercial prospects. It will lead to massive waste. It will lead to pink batts writ large. It will lead to Australian taxpayers wondering yet again why it is they go to work and pay their taxes. It should not just be for Senator Milne and the Labor Party's frolics in spending Australian taxpayers' money. This is a very bad bill.

"Broadbent, Russell, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (21:30):  What do all these men have in common: Bill Hayden, Dr Peter Hollingworth, Sir Guy Green, William Cox, Peter Underwood, Tim Fischer, Wilson Tuckey, Jeff Kennett, Lindsay Fox, Sir James Hardy, Clive James, Graham Kennedy, Normie Rowe, Lew Hoad, Doug Walters, Peter Brock, Dick Johnson and Don Earl. They were all national servicemen. These well-known Australians were part of our armed forces because national service was drawn from the entire community, which resulted in many servicemen rising to high positions in business, the professions and the community. Apart from these high-profile names, there were thousands of young men from across Australia called to serve and, just as our soldiers of earlier days were affectionately known as diggers, the national servicemen were later to be colloquially referred to as nashos.


One such nasho is Don Earl. Don is married to Betty and lives in Korumburra in South Gippsland. Don joined national service in 1951 and was among the first intake. At the time there were only 36,000 Australians in uniform and 1,700 of them were officers. With all the trouble in the Pacific it was decided that our defence was inadequate. That is when the government said, 'If you are 18, you have got to do national service.' Between 1965 and 1972 things changed and a total of 63,735 men were selected by a birthday ballot for the Army.


For many years Don Earl has served his local community. One of his great loves is the Korumburra-Bena football club. Don coached Korumburra for four years, and is a life member and former president of the Bass Valley Football Association. However, as a former national serviceman, Don found himself offering to help start up a sub-branch of the National Servicemen's Association in Korumburra.


Last week, in a surprise ceremony, Don Earl was presented with the Gordon Murphy Award for outstanding achievement by the Victorian branch of the National Servicemen's Association of Australia. This is the highest honour available to an individual national serviceman in Victoria. What sets this award aside and makes it even more unique is that, from a membership of thousands, only one person a year is presented with the award.


Don has served with the local sub-branch for over 13 years. He has served 10 years as president, 13 as welfare officer and has been state delegate for 12 years. Don has also cared for many nashos who were not in good health and he has conducted special funeral services for many of those servicemen. When asked about the award Don said that it was more about his mates and the service they gave to Australia than about his own contribution. 'They are the heart and soul behind this honour,' said Don. Don was presented with his award at the annual meeting of the South Gippsland sub-branch at the Inverloch RSL. This was a complete surprise to Don and was topped off when Mr Rick Murphy, son of the late Gordon Murphy, one of the founders of the association in Victoria, arrived to present the award to him personally.


The Gordon Murphy Award also recognises the work of Don's wife, Betty, who has actively supported her husband in many of his projects and stood by him unstintingly over many years. When asked about the award Don replied, 'Apart from marrying Betty, it's the greatest honour that I've ever had.' The sub-branch continues to flourish in Korumburra and now has up to 60 members at meetings who follow the motto 'sharing and caring'. It has always been known that there is a special bond between those who wear the uniform, and this is  particularly true for our national servicemen.


After the Vietnam War there was a great deal of derision and domestic divisions. This saw national servicemen, particularly those who had had active service, in the invidious position of being not only conscripted by a selected ballot but also subjected to derision by some of the Australian public. The personal contact with those men, who to this day still suffer from the experience, has caused Don, whilst juggling many other jobs, to take on the role of welfare officer, which occasionally included conducting special funeral services, as I said.


Betty had the last word. She said that for weeks before the award presentation she was answering the phone with a 'yes', or a 'no' or a 'maybe'. The surprise had to be kept at all costs. Then, as the family and special guests arrived at Inverloch, the annual meeting went from 40 to 73 people, and Don was speechless. 'That's the first time I've ever seen him speechless,' said Betty, 'and, as well as that, he was a big sook.' Don admitted to a tear or two.


Don: it helps to have the amazing, interesting and engaging personality that you have. You are a remarkable man. You have done great work. I first met you as an administrator in the football area. You have done us proud. We are so proud of you, Don Earl.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (12:01):  Whilst this is certainly a tight budget in a tight parliament and there will be plenty of debate, as has already taken place, around the rights and wrongs of it, in the end it will pass this parliament. So, for all the speeches one way or the other, the bottom line is it will pass. In my view, the budget is just one arm of the broader story of the moment and the question of the moment for all of us in public policy and throughout Australia. It is therefore a budget that I respond to in the broader context of what is going on in this parliament and throughout Australia right now.


I believe Australia is at a crossroads. We as a country need to conduct a budget-like audit of ourselves and ask ourselves whether we are still the brave reforming nation of our history, or have we succumbed to the risk averse, the timid and the anonymous critics of new media? Are we still the nation that spits in the eye of those who say, 'You can't, you won't, you shouldn't'? Or are we to now believe the pathetic, cult-like culture of the new radical conservatives in Australia, who want to kill this opportunity for reform within Australia right now via a campaign of vitriol and so-called death by adjectives?


We as a nation are at the crossroads. We are on the lip of the cliff of losing trust in our history, a history that has been shaped by taking chances and risks. We have a history of confidence against the odds and a history where we chose to do it our way—the Australian way and a way that so often has led the world in governance, sport, arts, science, innovation and business.


Eighteen months ago as an Independent MP in his third year of representing his community, I never thought the stakes were higher than forming government for three years, while locking in some local and national reforms through agreements reached. I was wrong. The stakes are much higher. At the crossroads as a nation, we are now in a fight for ourselves—a fight for the heart of Australia; a fight for what it means to be Australian. We are in danger of introducing something new into Australian public policy: fear. We are in danger of becoming a nation where fear wins over all else. We are in danger of creating a model of government and policy development that is risk averse and where the perception of the best government is in reality a government that does nothing at all just to avoid controversy.


In political terms, we are seeing more and more evidence of this. The Australian community is in grave danger of being 'astroturfed' into submission, where new organised, vested and issues-based interests control the chaos and the dissent for their own direct personal benefit and, as a consequence, governments cower from reform due to the new-found power of fear and dissent in Australia, leaving voters absolutely exhausted by the noise of the loudest and the richest. The crossroads we are at as a nation is whether we are a nation that still plays front-foot cricket and whether we are the great innovators who stare down opponents and prove them wrong time and time again, or whether we as a nation now play back-foot cricket and defend, whinge and complain. The question I have is: when and, more importantly, why did our Ian Chappell mentality turn into a Geoffrey Boycott mentality?


As a personal contribution on this, I accept my failure so far in these 18 months of this parliament. I sought consensus within the parliament itself, and I have found the toxic. I sought agreement on key issues across the major parties in the national interest, and I have found manufactured division. I might be too harsh on myself, as we have achieved much in this parliament: the ETS, some tax reform, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, aged care and 55 new Regional Development offices in a network. But as I seek more from the next 18 months—not for some personal reason but clearly because there is so much more to do—I feel frustrated by the moment.


I provide three examples of this right now. The first is recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia's Constitution. A full round of consultation and an extensive report were done last year, for which I was one of 22 very diverse members of a panel across party lines, working through the legal and moral complexities at stake. It delivered. It delivered a comprehensive report in January. It captured the 200 consultations throughout Australia and what was being sought by many Australians. It made the obvious and convincing point that the absolute key to success for any referendum in Australia is bipartisanship; our eight-from-44 record proves that. That is an example of this much sought-after consensus. But right now, over four months since the report was delivered, we are still stuck in the toxic muck. It is my understanding that neither Tony Abbott nor Julia Gillard has picked up the phone, walked down the corridor or leant across to the other at some joint function and said the simple words, 'Let's talk about that referendum question.' I take ownership of this failure as much as anyone, but all I can do is continue to seek more from our leadership on both sides of parliament and push and push and push where I can to seek more from both the MP for Lalor and the MP for Warringah, both of whom have extraordinary power right now and even more power together for the good of the nation. To now have good people like Tom Calma, Mark Leibler, Mick Gooda and the Liberal MP for Hasluck, Ken Wyatt, starting to say that toxic politics is now changing the strategy of policy—of when and how we promote a referendum in Australia—should cut to the absolute heart of anyone who cares about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and anyone who cares about Australia being the island nation of brave reformers. We are stuck in the toxic muck of our own making, and we lose nation-building opportunities unless we find a way out or a way through that muck.


A second example is electoral funding reform. In January the Australian Electoral Commission released donation records from 2010-11, and the figures should frighten everyone. The LNP revealed $110 million in political donations in the one year alone, and the ALP revealed $90 million in political donations in this same year. These are extraordinary figures that, if sustained, make a consensus on anything impossible and make the parliament itself a wholly owned subsidiary of major donors to the major parties. Again, because of the toxic, we look like heading into the 44th Parliament election season with no commitment from either side to electoral funding reform when it is so bleedingly obvious that the money now coming into the political parties is either unsustainable or dangerous for the nation. A consensus agreement is desperately needed by both major parties, as much in their own interests as in the interests of the nation. But the toxic moment is removing the opportunity for even a conversation, let alone a joint strategy. These are two governance examples, and this is before we get into the policy questions of where consensus right now would be in the national interest on policy. Take the Gonski review on education. What a difference a joint working group across party lines would make on that right now. Take comprehensive tax reform. What a difference a joint working group across party lines would make on that right now. Once again I plead and push. I plead with ordinary Australians, with commentators and with the major parties to put Australia's reform agenda first and push for consensus on policy first, because those that seek to divide do not act in Australia's interest. They act in their own interest, whether political or some other sectional interest.


I will not today nor ever support the dividers in Australia. I will always, today and in the future, support those whose focus is policy. In rugby terms, I will support those that play the ball of policy, not the man of politics. Today, in an era when we are seeing the conservative politics behave more radically than at any time since my distant cousin Michael Oakeshott wrote his conservative thoughts, I yearn for a day when these same conservative politicians and conservative cheerleaders try and win the day on policy and policy alone. Australia does suffer while we wait.


As a final point on this, I purposely single out three media leaders from the Australian newspaper, Chris Mitchell, Matthew Franklin and Dennis Shanahan—not to run some hate media argument on them and not to square up on any editorial position from them last year but because, out of a perverse mark of respect, I think these three shape the broader media position on what it is to be an opposition leader more than anyone else. I single them out as leaders who can make change for Australia. If these three continue to believe and to argue that an opposition's role is only to oppose—that their role and power as parliamentarians is to be denied right now and that there is no worth at all in the lion lying down with the lamb—then Australia suffers. I accept division makes great copy and sells newspapers, but consensus right now is what builds Australia and builds a nation. Consensus right now is what will answer the unanswered on constitutional reform, on tax reform, on productivity reform, on education reform and on electoral donation reform. If this challenge is denied, I can read the editorial now. The Australian will argue that it reflects community views only and the opposition is doing its job to oppose. If that is what it is then so be it. But, if we all want more, no three people can push for national outcomes on some key issues better than these three. Rest assured that I know the LNP, the opposition, are playing to that audience. Whilst ever they are allowed to have the position of all care and no responsibility, they will take it. I would take it. We would all take it, and reform in Australia grinds to a toxic halt.


Having said that, I think there is plenty of reform that has been achieved so far and that does deserve to be talked about. It is significant that the three major rating agencies have given a AAA rating to Australia right now. It is significant that the unemployment rate is under five per cent, inflation is in hand and the cash rate is below five per cent. Whilst there will be a debate about the debt ceiling—I am a reluctant partner in that whole process—now is not the time for a US-style debt ceiling fight. I will—and I understand the coalition will as well—allow that issue to pass this parliament right now.


The big issue next week in New South Wales is the Pacific Highway funding. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, that from the Bruce Highway's perspective you are watching closely. New South Wales can take the opportunity of finishing the project of the Pacific Highway by 2016, as promised and agreed by state and federal governments and by all political parties. The construction works were released through questions in this parliament over the past six months. There is no construction impediment to completing the final 400 kilometres of works. It is now down to nothing other than the money. I all but pushed all political chips across the table to get $3.56 billion allocated in the federal budget. As people can see in the budget papers, it is one of the standout roads items, if not the standout roads item. We can finish the job if the state commits to do its part and enter a partnership along the lines of what John Howard argued in 2007 and what Mark Vaile argued, and through all transport ministers going back to the start of this project with Laurie Brereton and Michael Knight. Everyone has argued the case for a fifty-fifty project. It is disappointing that the company line out of New South Wales in the last 12 months seems to have changed. I hope for a celebration next week, not a further cynical argument and political fight. But that is for the New South Wales budget, which we will all watch closely.


I acknowledge, as I mentioned before, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and aged-care reform. Both are significant steps forward through this budget, and I would hope that continued work sees both of those having very practical outcomes on the ground. It would be remiss not to mention the emissions trading scheme, something I took to both the 2007 and 2010 elections. We now will see that happen in Australia. It is recognising the place of both science and economics. I accept the science and the economics, and I accept my role in trying to get the policy process to deliver on both. I also would be remiss not to mention the Regional Development Australia network and the fact that we now have 55 regions identified in Australia and that all have an office working with local communities and trying to build the concept of place based and local based thinking in Australia. The budget will pass, but I do urge and encourage both Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott to lead, lead together, and lead together right now.

Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (12:16):  I rise to talk about this budget—Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 and related bills—in relation to what the government is doing. Each year I rise and ask the same question, and I do so again this year: what is the biggest item of expenditure in the federal budget? Of course, once again we find in this year's budget that the biggest single item is welfare. Some people would say welfare is a legitimate activity of government, but for it to be the No. 1 item of expenditure for a federal government—and this year it increased quite substantially when you look at the figures—I think is of great concern to Australia and the whole economy and how we operate our budgets. This government seems hell-bent on over-regulating and putting the government at the centre of everything in the national economy. It is correct, as the member for Lyne has identified, that Australia is at a crossroads in this regard when you consider that, in relation to small and medium enterprises, this government has brought in a whopping 20,000 new regulations for small and medium enterprises and has removed fewer than 200. There are 20,000 new regulations. When you look at this massive increase in the welfare budget and at what this government is doing to produce a smoke-and-mirrors surplus, I think you get a kind of feel for and flavour of what is really going on with this government's mismanagement of the economy.


The biggest ticket item in terms of expenditure cuts is, of course, the $5 billion worth of defence cuts, translated almost exactly into $5 billion of welfare increases. I think that $5 billion of cuts to our defence forces is one of the most short-sighted policy decisions that we will make in the coming decade. I say that because defence is the first priority of a national government. It is the most legitimate activity of a federal government. It is why we have a federal government, indeed. It is partly why we federated: to form a defence force to protect our national interests. A $5 billion cut, I think, represents a grave danger to the future operational capacity of the ADF and, indeed, will undermine its ability to upgrade many of the capital and other requirements for major projects that we all know are so necessary.


The government at the moment is lamenting in so many ways the loss of manufacturing workers, the loss of jobs in the economy and the loss of the capacity of Australia to manufacture its own things. There is no more legitimate activity of government in this space than manufacturing in defence industry. Defence industry in Australia is of vital concern for our nation's economic wellbeing. We could certainly sustain manufacturing jobs and other capacity in defence industry production, and yet we have a $5 billion cut in this regard. While we are subsidising a lazy and indolent car industry that is producing cars that consumers do not want at a price they cannot afford, and we are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars per job in that sector, we are ignoring a vital and successful component of our manufacturing that is the Australian defence industry. I am a well-known opponent of protection in industries, and I do not count defence as protection. The Prime Minister and I even had a Twitter fight about the car industry and her much vaunted policy, and I do not believe she came off best in that regard, because it is undeniable that the No. 1 reason why we need to subsidise this industry is because the top-selling car in Australia is a foreign car. Why? Because it is cheaper. People can buy a better-made car, at a cheaper price, that is smaller, more efficient and more environmentally friendly. That is the No. 1 reason that people are not choosing Australian cars. How is a subsidy going to produce a better outcome in relation to that? It flies in the face of the other policy that the government is vaunting in this budget and the economic debacle that is the so-called surplus, and that is the carbon tax.


The entire economy is now built on the carbon tax coming into operation on 1 July. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the opposition is firmly committed to the removal of this toxic tax from the Australian economy, for good reason. You do not need a $5 billion increase in welfare—which the government calls 'compensation'—if you do not have a major tax going into the economy, taxing all of the productive sectors of the economy, ripping money out and increasing prices of basic goods and services. The government often says, 'You're going to rip away money from pensioners. You're going to rip away money from families.' I do not see Australian families and Australian pensioners as welfare cases. They are capable of working for themselves, earning their own living, sustaining themselves into retirement and building their own financial footing. They do not need government. Every single family in this country does not need government to be a constant drip of money for them. They can do it themselves, and that is what the role of government is—not to get involved but to get uninvolved, to leave people alone to prosper, to build the businesses they want to build, to innovate and create wealth and jobs and look after themselves and their families. Government is there to step in when people cannot do it for themselves, when they will not do it for themselves and they are unable to or they come across other issues in life. That is the legitimate role of government.


Now we have got to the point in our society today where we are, through the carbon tax, basically becoming a welfare state of epic proportions, where everybody has an entitlement to compensation for prices that are deliberately ratcheted up by this government. Why are we ratcheting up the prices of goods and services and basics like electricity? The government says that it is 'to save the climate of the planet.' Today I noticed that Tim Flannery is on the bandwagon again. I heard the member for Lyne saying once again that he is a believer in the science. Today Tim Flannery has come forward to say that we need to remove the fillings from the teeth of dead people, if they have mercury in them, because we do not want that going back into the environment. Last week he was in Western Sydney—I know the member for Chifley will be very interested in this—and he was saying that people will die in Western Sydney because of the heatwaves that are coming through climate change. This is the kind of taxpayer-funded drivel that we are hearing every day, that is justifying an economy-wide carbon tax that will punish every business and industry and will push up the cost of goods and services. It will cause us to go further down the path of becoming a welfare state, because of people like Professor Tim Flannery who propose that we need to use a wrench to pull out teeth that have mercury in them. It is in the Daily Telegraph today. That is what he is proposing. He is paid $300,000 a year by the taxpayer. This is becoming an absolute travesty. The science is hardly what is driving this policy from this government. Concern for the climate seems to be backmost of what they are doing.


This budget is of great concern in my own electorate of Mitchell, which has one of the highest proportions of families of any electorate in the country. The cost of living, of goods and services and of electricity prices in particular resonates across Western Sydney. You would not find a door to knock on in Western Sydney that would not raise electricity prices as one of their No. 1 concerns, and they are concerned about the outcome of this budget and the carbon tax. In particular, once again we see in relation to the minister for transport and the much vaunted Infrastructure Australia policy, which from this government was meant to be the saving grace of infrastructure in Australia today, another complete abandonment of the nation's biggest city, Sydney. Not only is there not a single dollar in the budget for infrastructure in Sydney; there has not been in four years. There was $100 million for a study for a metro for the last state government, which we know was probably the worst government and the most incompetent government of any single government in the nation's history. That money had to be handed back to the federal government because of the incompetence of that state government. I know the member for Chifley knows all about that, so I will not lecture him anymore on that.


The failing of this government in particular is that there is no infrastructure funding for the biggest economic generator in the country. I follow the model of infrastructure provision that it should be economical where possible. Of course there are times where government has to go out and build a rail line or a road where it may not be so economical. But primarily we must be putting money into the economic and infrastructure drivers that will build and be sustainable in our major cities, in our major ports, in our major areas of economic activity. That is the best way to fund the infrastructure so that we can continue generating jobs and prosperity and keep the economy ticking over.


This federal government says not a single road, not a single rail line, not a single driver of economic activity is needed in our nation's biggest city, with its biggest economic generator, with its massive population, with its ability to draw all of our migrants—most migrants still go to Sydney. It says, 'You don't have any infrastructure pressures or priorities.' I think it is an absolute failing of Infrastructure Australia and the policy of this government to have what it describes as non-political bodies deciding on infrastructure.


The north-west rail line in particular has been earmarked as the No. 1 priority of the New South Wales state government, funded with an additional $2.1 billion from the federal government, earmarked in the MYEFO 2010-11 year. The federal government right before the last election came forward with a promise, written on the back of a coaster, to build a Parramatta to Epping rail line to try and win the seat of Bennelong and retain the seat of Parramatta, realising how much political trouble they were in. The Prime Minister made the announcement. We all saw in Sydney what Labor had done over 16 years playing politics with rail lines in metropolitan Sydney. It was an absolute disaster. It was an absolute disaster for the state government at the last election and it was an absolute disgrace for the Prime Minister to attempt to play politics with the rail line.


This $2.1 billion in MYEFO in 2010-11 that is earmarked, allegedly, for the Epping-Parramatta rail line is not going to be brought on or brought forward. No plans are in train to build the Epping-Parramatta rail link. There is no construction timetable and no priority. Nothing will be done. No money will actually come forward until, as this government says, the state government contribute some money. The state government have made it clear that they will not be doing that. So that money could be earmarked to that state government right now in New South Wales to get infrastructure moving in Sydney, which is vital for the development of our city. It must be brought forward. But you will not see any action from this government. I would argue that until this government is removed there will be this continual political gain in relation to infrastructure funding in Sydney, which I think is to the detriment of every resident in Western Sydney, in my electorate of Mitchell.


We have heard much about this government spreading the benefits of the boom to all sectors of the economy. I think the other great betrayal of our nation's enterprise and business community in this budget was the absolute and utter shameful backflip on cutting the corporate tax rate. We know why it did that. All these small and medium enterprises around the nation who are struggling to pay their bills at the moment were looking for the cut in the company tax rate which was promised, promised and promised. We know what the promises of this government are worth. But those businesses were expecting this company tax cut. How is it right for a government to, on the one hand, outline its national policy so that businesses can make decisions and so that small and medium businesses can say, 'Look, we are under pressure but there is some prospect of us getting some relief in the next budget so we can make decisions and struggle on with our business enterprise,' and then, on the other hand, in the budget without warning pull the company tax cuts for all those small to medium enterprises around the country?


That was supposed to be spreading the benefits of the boom to every corner, as the Treasurer is fond of saying of our economy—but not the corner that is the small and medium enterprises. Not that corner. That is not where the boom will be spread to, because small and medium enterprises are one of the lowest priorities of the government.


They have no regard for the family owned or small business that is struggling under the current economic conditions and they are not spreading any part of the boom to those hardworking mums and dads and families who own businesses around the country. That is perhaps one of the greatest betrayals out of this budget that I think will have a very negative impact in confidence and in the ability of people to get ahead in their businesses.


Another problem that we have in relation to what is coming out of this budget is the constant increases of taxation and the constant uncertainty about whether something will or will not happen. We have seen it this week in relation to the enterprise migration agreements. Who is in support of it? Will it happen? Will it not happen? Is it okay by the unions? Is it not okay by the unions? Australia is becoming a sovereign risk in so many ways because of the uncertainty coming out of this government. This budget certainly reinforces the uncertainty that is coming out.


The uncertainty of this budget is: does anybody believe that we will achieve a $1.5 billion surplus next year based on, perhaps, the best increases in economic conditions in 20 years that are modelled here?




Mr Husic:
  Read the Fin Review!




Mr HAWKE:
  Does the member for Chifley really want to come forward and put his name to that? MYEFO is coming up at the end of this year and then of course we will have next year's budget. And in next year's budget I do not think it is too cavalier to predict that these great conditions predicted in the budget may not come forward, and we may not share that $1.5 billion surplus.


So if I have one overarching criticism it is the absolute lack of certainty that is coming out of the government. Their economic policy is just unfathomable to business and to people looking to invest in this country, and really they ought to hang their heads in shame at the way they are treating economic policy in Australia today.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (12:31):  I am very pleased to speak in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and cognate bills, for the 2012-2013 budget. I am very pleased to do so because the first thing that comes to mind when we are talking about the budget and the delivery of the budget is that you need to do it on the back of a very strong economy. Without a strong economy you will not be able to implement the very good things that are currently happening.


We know that from when this government first came into government, back in 2007, until today 800,000 new jobs have been created, with another 300,000 on track by the end of 2013. We know that these jobs were not just created by the click of a finger or by sitting back and doing nothing; these jobs were created through good initiatives by this government and through the strong economy that we have built.


We bulletproofed the Australian economy and kept it out of recession, which was very important to get us to the stage where we are today. If you look around the world you see what is happening in Europe—in Greece, in Portugal, in Italy, in Spain and in Ireland—and in other parts of the world. Look at what the US has been through since 2008—its economy is just starting to pick up now. Our economy has been going strong all through that period.


It was strong because we took decisive action when the global financial crisis hit. Again, I reiterate in this place as I have done many, many times before; there was a lot of criticism about our infrastructure packages from the opposition and a lot of criticism about the BER. These were projects that kept us out of the doldrums when the rest of the world was suffering. For example, when I visit a BER project, one of the questions I always ask is: how many people did it employ? And the answer always comes back that it was anything between 50 to 200 people. When you multiply 26,000 projects, just like the BERs that I visit in my electorate, across the country and you see the number of people who were employed, you can see why we got out of that financial crisis. We did not sit back and fold our arms, as we were told to by the opposition—we actually took decisive action. That has assisted us to build this strong economy, to bulletproof the Australian economy and, as I said, to keep it out of that recession.


At the same time it has spread those good benefits of the mining boom, helping families on modest incomes and small businesses. Only last week we heard the announcement of 8,000 new jobs in WA—8,000 new jobs! What a great announcement. What a great announcement to be able to say that we are creating 8,000 new jobs and, at the same time, ensuring that the mining boom is spread evenly across the country. That is great news. Most governments around the world would fall over backwards to make an announcement like that.


There are obviously things that we have to do to get those 8,000 jobs up and running—for example, ensuring that we have the skills to be able to fulfil those positions. I am very pleased that there will be training positions along with new apprentices and of course positions for Indigenous and Aboriginal people in mining. That is a terrific story, and I think it is something that we should not fear or run away from. This is a very important announcement.


At the same time we are delivering the new schoolkids bonus: $1.3 billion—$410 a year for primary schoolchildren and $820 a year for high school children. This is on top of delivering Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme, increasing family payments for teenagers and raising the childcare rebate to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs. These are good things we have done because, as I have said, we have a good economy in place to be able to bring these projects to fruition and ensure that we deliver and spread the benefits of the economy across the nation.


Many good things are happening, and I support this budget because it will deliver big time for my electorate: for pensioners doing it tough; for families working long days, doing it tough and struggling to make ends meet; and for the vulnerable in our community. The measures in this budget reflect those true Labor values of our government: fairness, jobs and opportunity for all. They are the things that we see from this government. It is absolutely paramount that we deliver for those people.


I will take the opportunity to highlight some of the measures in this particular budget, the 2012-13 budget, and what it means on the ground for thousands and thousands of people in my electorate of Hindmarsh. We on this side of the House understand the pressures of families who work long days, living pay to pay and spending what little they have on themselves after paying the bills for the kids' school fees, the groceries, the electricity bill, petrol, mortgages et cetera. That is why we are easing the pressure through tax cuts and increasing payments. In the electorate of Hindmarsh, thousands of people, as I said, are now benefiting from these initiatives. We also have boosted the assistance for older people to support them in their retirement or while still working. We have introduced new initiatives to help younger people support themselves while studying or learning a trade.


Paid parental leave is a very positive initiative, and I am delighted that 906 local families in my electorate of Hindmarsh are benefiting from Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. Just this week I spoke in the chamber in favour of the Dad and Partner Pay scheme, which will see dads get two weeks paid leave to be with mum and the baby when it is born. I cannot tell you what a difference that would make on the ground. I spoke, as I said earlier, last week about what a difference it would have made to me when my boys were born if I could have spent those two weeks at home. I know there are many people today in the situation I was in back then. I actually had to change my shifts to be able to stay at home and assist my wife and do what I could to help in the first two to three weeks. At the time, as I have said before, I was driving taxis full time and I changed my shift from six at night to six in the morning so I could get home and give my wife some respite and look after the newborn babies when they came home. It was absolutely exhausting, and a bonus like the one that has just been announced would have been a godsend for my family back then. I know that there are thousands of people out there in exactly the same position that I was in 28 years ago for the first and 24 years ago with the second one. 


The baby bonus is another great initiative. In my electorate, 710 local families benefited from the baby bonus last year and many of these families received $500 more of their payment upfront to help pay for the initial costs of setting up the baby's room, buying prams, clothes and all the added expenses that come up when a newborn comes home. Family tax benefit A is another initiative of this Labor government. The families of about 2,600 Hindmarsh teenagers turning 16 over the next five years will now receive up to $4,200 extra in family payments if their child stays at school. That is under our boost for teenagers as part of family tax benefit A. Another great initiative is the advance payment of the FTB A. We have 6,351 local FTB recipients who may be eligible for an advance payment of up to $1,000 to help them meet unexpected family expenses. We all know that life is not always predictable. We know that things happen—the car might break down, you might have a medical emergency and, when you are living on a low income, it can be very hard to find extra money when you need it. So this will go a long way to easing stress on families who are already overloaded trying to balance work, family, study and sport commitments, which as the dad of two boys myself I know is not an easy job and does not slow down as they get older.


We have 4,261 local families who will be receiving the childcare rebate in the electorate of Hindmarsh, and they are now benefiting from Labor increasing the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket costs and the increase in the maximum payment to $7,500 per child per year. There are 4,261 local families in my electorate who now have the option of claiming their childcare rebate payment fortnightly rather than having to wait to the end of the year, so it is easier to make ends meet.


Twenty-nine thousand local pensioners are now benefiting from Labor's historic pension reforms, including the biggest increase to the pension in 100 years. Single pensioners on the maximum rate are receiving an extra $154 per fortnight, and couples on the maximum rate are receiving an extra $156 a fortnight combined. I have 3,275 local families in Hindmarsh who have received an annual $600 carer's supplement boost to assist with the financial pressures associated with caring for a loved one. In addition, those who care for a child with a disability now receive an extra $1,000 per year. Also, 29,000 local age pensioners in my electorate can now keep more of their pension if still working. After changes by this Labor government, pensioners can earn up to $250 a fortnight without it being taken into account as income under the pension income test. These are all good measures.


We have also realised that we need to support apprentices and the skilled labour workforce. Six hundred and sixty-three local apprentices training in skill shortage areas are being supported with $5,500 in total government support to help them complete their qualifications in my electorate.


I turn next to the household assistance package. From May, more than 8,000 local families in Hindmarsh will receive extra money through family assistance payments. A typical family in my electorate will get $529 through both tax cuts and family assistance payments. With regard to family tax benefit A and B, 7,500 FTB A recipients in Hindmarsh will receive up to $110 extra a year per child and 6,000 FTB B recipients will receive up to $69 extra a year per child as of this month. More than 1,300 families will receive an extra $289 per year in increased income support, as well as assistance through increased family payments. I mentioned pensioners earlier. I have 29,000 local pensioners in my electorate who will receive an extra $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples combined in their pensions. Payments have started to go out this week. I have more than 2,200 local self-funded retirees, and they will receive an extra $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples combined from May. More than 3,700 local job seekers will receive an extra $218 a year for singles and $390 for couples combined as of this month. I have over 2,200 students in my electorate who will get an extra $177 per year. The amount they get will depend on their rate and type of payment—for example, Austudy, Abstudy or youth allowance.


Many people will benefit from the tax cuts. Approximately 53,000 local taxpayers in my electorate will receive a tax cut on 1 July. Around 44,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut of at least $300, and 4,000 local residents in Hindmarsh will pay no tax at all due to the tripling of the tax-free threshold. The average wage earner in Hindmarsh now pays approximately $1,200 less tax than in 2007-08 as a result of Labor's tax cuts for low- and middle-income families. From July, Labor will put up to $500 into the superannuation accounts of 22,000 local workers who are earning up to $37,000. These are low-paid workers and this will be a big benefit for them. As I said earlier, importantly, dads in my electorate will be able to apply for Labor's new dad and partner pay scheme, which begins on 1 January 2013. These are all very good benefits.


There are also nation-building programs taking place in my electorate. We have seen a rollout of the biggest road and rail program in the nation's history, with work beginning, progressing or being completed on a long list of large and smaller scale projects. For example, in my electorate, I have been proud to secure $4.5 million funding for the new King Street bridge, which opened on time and on budget at the end of last year and has been much welcomed by local residents, businesses and tourism operators.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (12:46):  I was very pleased to be in the chamber to listen to the contribution from the member for Hindmarsh about the cash splash of taxpayer dollars. But he failed to talk about those other aspects of the budget which should be of concern to every Australian—the question, firstly, as to how this cash splash should be paid for and, secondly, why it is that the government feel the need for modest payments to people in electorates like his. It is because people know that the cost of living is going up and up and will go up even further as a result of the government's carbon tax, to be brought in on 1 July.


Never more true than they are today are the words first espoused by President Clinton two decades ago: 'It's the economy, stupid!' That is very true. It is right to consider these words when we consider the Appropriations Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and related bills this afternoon.


Let us look at the current domestic situation. The retail sector is hurting. We have a two-speed economy, which is very different in the east and in the west. Housing approvals for new constructions are down, growth is going backwards, multifactor productivity has flatlined and is now heading in the wrong direction, and business confidence is at an all-time low. Against this backdrop we consider the international situation, which should concern us greatly. Financial turmoil in Europe shows no signs of abating. The situation in Greece and in France is not just a financial crisis but has snowballed into something even more significant—a social crisis with far-reaching consequences. We see high levels of US debt and a significant crisis of confidence in the US, and we see signs that China's growth is slowing. This is all relevant for us here in Australia. 


The budget that was announced by Treasurer Wayne Swan the foundation stone on which its economic narrative is based, so it deserves very close and very careful consideration. We cannot simply rely on the glib mantra of the Treasurer that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. He seems to think that with this mantra he can somehow avert any further scrutiny. But today we scrutinise in the time available the budget bills that have been brought before us, and there are a number of elements that we should consider very carefully. The first of them is this size of government debt, the second is the size of government expenditure, the third is how this expenditure is to be funded and the fourth is the believability of the government's claims of a budget surplus.


The budget announced by Treasurer Wayne Swan is the fifth budget he has delivered. Let us go back to the budgets since the last coalition budget. The coalition had a surplus of $20 billion, we had no net debt and we had $70 billion in net government assets. Where are we today? It was announced that we have a deficit of $44 billion. This deficit was predicted by this Treasurer just over 12 months ago to be closer $12 billion. It has gone up from $12 billion to $23 billion to $37 billion and was finally announced by the Treasurer in his budget at $44 billion. If you go back and look at the four budgets that he delivered before this one, you will see that the accumulation of deficit hit in this budget a record of $174 billion. These were the four largest budget deficits in our history. I want that to sink in for the people who are listening to this speech. There has been a combined deficit of 174 thousand million dollars in just four years. We have gone from a position of no net debt to a position where our net debt will peak at $145 billion. Judging by previous forecasts, I think we can anticipate that that figure will blow out even further.


We should also consider the government's gross debt ceiling. The gross debt ceiling started at around $75 billion. The government had to increase it to $200 billion, then to $250 billion, and in this latest budget the government has sought to increase the gross debt ceiling to a record $300 billion. All Australians are rightly concerned by this. Why has the government needed to increase the net debt and the gross debt ceiling? It has needed to do so because it has increased the amount it is spending. The government has claimed that it is reducing expenditure, yet we see from this budget an increase in aggregate expenditure of more than $100 billion since the last coalition budget. That is a 40 per cent increase. How does the government propose to pay for all this? Through their 26 new or increased taxes. It will be paid for not only by this generation but also by future generations of Australian taxpayers.


On what will all this money be spent? There was, of course, $2.4 billion spent on a pink batts scheme. That $2.4 billion, if you consider the opportunity costs of the same amount of money, could have been spent on 12 much-needed grade separations on train lines throughout Victoria. The interest payments that will be made in 2015-16 of $8 billion would equate to about 32 railway crossings. Why are railway crossings significant? In my state of Victoria there are still over 172 level crossings; Sydney has just eight. Quite a number of these crossings are located on the Dandenong railway line, which currently serves over a million people and is considered a key area for future population growth. The railway line is a major east-west artery for both people and freight stretching through my electorate and Melbourne's south-eastern suburbs and its industrial parks to the significant commercial hub of Dandenong and the growing residential developments and proposed deepwater port of Hastings. The Victorian government made a submission to Infrastructure Australia. It asked for increased funding to get rid of these railway crossings, noting that the railway corridor contributed $92 billion to GDP in 2007-08, which accounted for roughly half of Melbourne's GDP or nine per cent nationally. The railway line is already operating at or above capacity, resulting in very significant closures of the level crossings.


Within my electorate of Higgins there are three crossings in close proximity to each other: Koornang Road, Carnegie; Murrumbeena Road, Murrumbeena; and Poath Road, Murrumbeena. Their frequent and lengthy closures are severely impacting on pedestrians, car traffic and road freight and having negative consequences for local business, schools, shops and community life. But these are not the only railway crossings in my electorate. Another significant railway crossing that causes concerns for so many of my constituents is the Burke Road crossing, another very significant problem.


The economic benefits of removing these traffic impediments are self-evident. That is why I am helping to promote the RACV's Redspot campaign. Critical infrastructure spending is essential to the nation's productivity growth. This is where the government should be focusing its attention, yet in this budget we see no money for Victoria for these railway crossings. Not one cent was provided of the $16 million which the Victorian government requested in its submission for railway crossing removals in Victoria. Yet in the budget we see that the government found $36 million in extra funding for carbon tax ads. This brings to a total $69.5 million that the government is spending on spinning to the Australian people the benefits of the increased cost of living that will be applied to each and every Australian as a result of their carbon tax from 1 July this year. The government has its priorities all wrong.


We also see from this budget that there has been no security of funding for the school sector. The Gonski review recommended that the government spend an extra $5.5 billion on school funding initiatives in order to revamp the way that school funding is delivered. This was being considered by the government. We see the results of that consideration in this budget. The more than $5 billion in additional funding for schools recommended in the review is not in the budget; there is not even $1 billion for it in the budget. In fact, over two years this government has apportioned an extra $5.8 million to schools funding. There is no security of funding, particularly for those schools in my electorate of Higgins which are concerned about the impact if the government does not continue with the indexation of funding for independent schools. In Higgins, $29 million will be lost to schools, and I have 39 schools in my electorate, all of which will be impacted by the loss of security of school funding if the government does not heed their call—and, of course, it has not. In this budget these schools have been completely ignored.


We can only assume from that that the government has a different plan for school funding; a different plan for the quadrennium of school funding that it will apply beyond the next election. It will involve a hit list on independent schools which, as we know, they have proposed in the past. As an opposition we will strongly oppose this.


In this budget the government has made good on its threats to cut the private health insurance rebate. Again this will increase the cost of living to so many Australian families and so many people in my electorate of Higgins. Seventy-seven per cent of people in my electorate of Higgins have private health insurance funding. This is one of the significant costs in their budget, and the government will be increasing the cost just as it has increased the cost of so many other things—including things as essential as child care. Thanks to the government's changes in regulation, childcare costs—instead of going up by 57c a week as the minister has claimed—have gone up by between $50 and $70 a week. Again, I can only reiterate the point that, on 1 July, with the carbon tax being brought into effect, this will hit not only every Australian but also every Australian business. According to the government's own modelling alone, there will be a 10 per cent increase in electricity costs, which will flow throughout the economy.


Of course, the people of Higgins expect more, and the people of Higgins deserve more. Australians deserve hope, reward and opportunity—which is the coalition's plan. We will not simply talk about delivering a surplus; we have in the past delivered surpluses. This is something that we will do; it is not something we will just talk of doing. The government's claim to deliver a $1.5 billion surplus simply does not add up, particularly when you consider that they have been pulling funding into this year and spending into this year and pushing it out into other years to try to create fictional surplus for 2012-13.


The Australian people will not be spun on this. The Australian people have clearly made a decision on this Prime Minister, on her broken promises and on her budget that was delivered only a number of weeks ago—a budget that has sunk without a trace, and for good reason. It is a budget that the Labor Party do not wish to talk about because it is a budget that highlights their failure in government. We can do better. We will do better. That is why we look forward to the opportunity of governing. We hope that the leadership issues of the government will be resolved and we look forward to the government calling an election at the earliest opportunity.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs) (13:02):  The 2012-13 budget is a budget which has delivered a surplus on time, as promised. It is a budget which sets up our country for the future, building a stronger economy and at the same time creating a much fairer community. It is a budget which will spread the wonderful benefits that this country is getting through the mining boom to all Australians—noting that we do have a patchwork economy, where many, particularly in the south-east corner of our country, are not enjoying the benefits of the mining boom to the extent that others are. So this is a budget that will deliver for them.


It is a budget that protects low- and middle-income Australians. It does this by providing more money to families and small businesses and supporting the most vulnerable members of our community, through tax cuts, so that all taxpayers earning up to $80,000 will get a tax cut, including the tripling of the tax-free threshold and increases in the pension for more than 3.4 million pensioners. It is a budget which provides for an increase to family payments. It is a budget which provides the Schoolkids Bonus, which helps families with the costs of their children's education. It is a budget which will help support people who are living on allowances and it will also help people through the parenting payment. It is a budget which will introduce for the first time the historic National Disability Insurance Scheme, which, in the fullness of time, will represent just about the biggest advance in social policy in this country since Medicare. It is a budget which will see a blitz on public dental waiting lists.


I want to talk a little bit about how that broad picture of the budget will apply specifically in my electorate of Corio. In my electorate, 8,550 local families who have school kids will receive $410 in the case of primary school children and $820 in the case of high school children. That adds up to nearly $9 million worth of assistance for families in the electorate of Corio. More than 11,000 local families will receive an increase of up to $600 through family tax benefit A, from 1 July 2013.


Through the minerals resource rent tax we are seeing an increase in superannuation for 42,500 local workers in the Corio electorate. They will see their superannuation increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That is going to add almost $108,000 to the projected retirement income of an average 30-year-old worker. From July, Labor will put up to $500 into the superannuation accounts of 23,500 local workers earning up to $37,000. For 14,600 small businesses in Corio, Labor is giving an instant tax write-off for each purchase of an asset below $6,500—which, again, is one of the many benefits that flow from the minerals resource rent tax. In addition to that, the first $5,000 spent on a new motor vehicle will also be able to be written off.


In addition to those measures, there is also being rolled out as we speak the household assistance package, which will support families with any modest increases in prices which occur as a result of putting a price on carbon. More than 11,300 families in the Corio electorate will receive additional money as a result of the assistance payments. A typical family in my electorate will get $529 through both tax cuts and family assistance payments. In excess of 10,800 family tax benefit recipients in the electorate will receive up to $110 extra a year per child, and 9,200 family tax benefit B recipients will receive up to $69 a year per child. 


More than 26,700 local pensioners will receive—with the rollout beginning yesterday—an increase in their pension. There will be a lump sum of $250 for singles and $380 for couples. From March next year, pensioners will receive another increase in their fortnightly payments which will see in total an increase of $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples.  More than 1,000 local self-funded retirees will receive an extra $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples.


More than 5,000 local job seekers will receive an extra $218 a year for singles and $390 for couples. More than 2,500 students in Corio will get up to $177 extra per year. That amount will depend on the rate and type of payment they get at the moment in terms of supporting their studies, be it Austudy, Abstudy or Youth Allowance. About 46,000 local taxpayers will receive as a result of the household assistance package a tax cut from 1 July. Around 38,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut of at least $300, and 4,000 local residents will pay no tax at all due to the tripling of the tax-free threshold.


All of that represents a concerted effort on the part of this government to tackle two of the great economic challenges facing our nation. The first is to make sure that the enormous benefits which flow to us through the resources boom are there for all Australians, because the essential product of that resources boom—the resources which lie underneath our ground—is owned by all Australians.


The second great challenge is placing a price on carbon so that we can develop an industrial base going forward which is much less dependent upon carbon, in a future world where dependency upon carbon is going to be penalised, and doing that in a way which does not have an impact on low- and middle-income households. They will get through this a package of assistance that will cover, and in some cases more than cover, any increase in costs associated with putting a price on carbon.


This budget and the work that has been done on that comes on the back of a very significant record of achievement on the part of Labor in power since 2007 in relation to the Corio electorate. We have seen an unprecedented level of federal government support and engagement in the electorate of Corio. I want to take a moment to describe some of those. It is a very impressive record of achievement, which is unprecedented in terms of the way federal governments have impacted upon the Corio electorate in the past.


As a result of the Labor government we will see the $3.2 billion regional rail link, which separates regional and metropolitan trains as they enter Melbourne. The City of Geelong has a vital connection with Melbourne, with a growing number of those living in Geelong working in Melbourne. This will see an infinitely more reliable and faster rail service to Melbourne, a service that does not see trains from Geelong and Ballarat caught up in the metropolitan, transit traffic jam that occurs every morning. This is a significant piece of infrastructure that will change the daily lives of working people in Geelong.


There has been $50 million spent on the rail upgrades at Geelong Port, which will make it an easier port to access from both directions and will put a focus on the significance of the port for Geelong's economic future—and that equals jobs. Deakin University's Australian Future Fibres Research and Innovation Centre has had $37 million dollars spent on it. This is a collaboration between Deakin University, CSIRO and the Victorian Centre for Advanced Materials Manufacturing.


We often talk of the old economy and the new economy, and the high-tech manufacturing jobs of the future—making carbon fibre and working with carbon fibre is the high-tech manufacturing of the future. This research centre will have a world's best research furnace for carbon fibre production, which will set up Geelong and our region to be the centre of carbon fibre research, manufacturing and production. This is an investment in future manufacturing jobs. 


We have seen $26 million spent on an integrated cancer care service at Barwon Health. This acknowledges the extent to which Geelong is, in a sense, a regional capital of Victoria's south-west and a really important centre for making sure that health outcomes of those living in regional Australia are the same as those living in our capital cities. We have seen the construction of a fantastic new Australian Taxation Office building in Little Ryrie Street, which is now also the centre for the Department of Human Services in Geelong. This brings together, in one building, all the federal services that the people of Geelong rely on—in a state-of-the-art green building—and employs hundreds of local people.


We have a trade training centre, which I had the pleasure of visiting on its second day of operation, at Northern Bay College. It is a fantastic facility. It provides vocational training in the north of Geelong, where it is so badly needed. Another $4.2 million has been committed to the trade training centres at St Joseph's, Sacred Heart, Clonard and McKillop colleges, the next cluster to receive that benefit. We have seen $62 million provided in assistance to support manufacturing industries across 20 programs. Importantly, we have seen $10 million provided to Simonds Stadium, the home of the Geelong Football Club. It is part of a $46 million build on what is the southern-most stand of that stadium, setting the stadium up to be the most important piece of regional sporting infrastructure in the country.


We have seen $10 million spent on the Geelong Library and the  Heritage Centre, which is a really important spend. It develops the Geelong Library and protects our city's most important and valuable records. Both were funded out of the first round of funding from the Regional Development Australia Fund. Millions of dollars have been spent on road improvements. This includes an announcement made a couple of weeks ago of $390,000 to fix four black spots in our city. Expenditure of $2.8 million has been made on five stormwater harvesting projects so that we can be much smarter in the way we use our water. A legacy of the drought is that we are now using our water in a much cleverer way. This will set us up for the next time we go through a dry patch. There has been $3.1 million spent on the renovation of the iconic Eastern Beach complex in Geelong, which is really one of the most important historical venues that we have in Geelong. It is a place which, to this day, is a gathering spot, particularly in the summer, for so many of our citizens to enjoy Corio Bay. A smaller amount of money but just as important, $391,000, has been spent on the Kardinia Park netball complex upgrade. Looking forward, there will potentially be an upgrade of the Point Wilson Waterside Infrastructure Project. Point Wilson pier is the only major ordnance pier that we have in Australia. Remediating Point Wilson is a high priority of this government. The wharf there is the sole Defence facility in the country which is capable of receiving strategic imports of explosive ordnance. This project is a long-term strategic investment that will extend the life of the wharf through to 2055.


Our government has faced the global financial crisis and steered our country through it such that we have the best economy in the developed world. Our government has faced the patchwork economy, an enormous challenge, and is spreading the benefits of the mining boom to all parts of Australia. We have a plan to do both. We have done that in the face of relentless negativity on the part of the opposition, which does nothing other than appeal to the darker angels of our nature and deny any innate optimism that exists amongst Australians to see a bright future ahead. This is not what Australians will respond to. What the Labor government is providing is a sense of hope and a sense of strategy about taking our country forward.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (13:17):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 representing the people of Macarthur on what can only be described as a bad budget. The people of Macarthur are honest, hardworking people who want nothing but the best for their children and future generations of our community. They have high hopes for a strong economy which will provide more jobs and opportunities for all Australians. While they are working hard to pay off their mortgages and balance the family budget, they are becoming fed up with a government that continues with its wasteful spending and incompetence.


While the people of Macarthur are trying to decrease their debt and reduce their credit limits, this government has increased the nation's credit card by $50 billion—from $250 billion to $300 billion. It has been only five short years since Labor came to office in 2007 inheriting a debt of zero. It is no wonder the people of Macarthur are fed up with a government which has continued to borrow more than $100 million a day. In 18 months, the government's estimated deficit for 2011-12 has blown out from $12 billion to $44 billion—and the year is not even over yet. This is the fourth Labor deficit in four years. Together, Labor's deficits total $174 billion. Interest payments on Labor's debt are set to reach an alarming $8 billion per year—that is $22 million a day on interest payments alone. Who do they think is going to pay off this debt? The debt will be there for our children and future generations of Australians to pay off. It is just not good enough.


The people of Macarthur can see through the spin surrounding this budget—a budget which includes the world's biggest carbon tax, cynical bribes to soften the impact of a tax, broken promises on corporate tax cuts, higher unemployment, blow-outs in the cost of border protection, an underfunded NDIS, and equity funding for the NBN which has been kept off budget. In headline cash terms, the Gillard government will spend $8.7 billion more than it earns in 2012-13. The government continues to spend on projects such as the NBN, which has been taken off budget. If this government was honest and included the NBN expenditure, the budget would show deficits over the next three years. To put it simply, there would be no surplus if the NBN was on the books.


In fact, by bringing forward just two programs—the back-to-school payment and the Commonwealth grants to local government—the government artificially saves more than $1.5 billion in 2012-13. Honest budget treatment of these two programs alone would wipe out the Treasurer's wafer-thin surplus. When will this government learn that cooking the books is no substitute for good, solid economic management? Let us face it, the Treasurer lives in 'Wayne's world'. His forecast of a $1.5 billion surplus is a mirage. The harder you look at it, the more you realise it just does not exist. Even if the Treasurer does deliver on his razor-thin surplus, Australia will need more than 93 years of the Treasurer's surpluses to repay all the waste and mismanagement created by this Treasurer. It is the families in my electorate who are feeling the pinch from this government's waste and mismanagement. The rising cost of living is a major factor affecting families, pensioners, self-funded retirees, small businesses and homeowners in Macarthur. Many have contacted my office concerned about the impacts of the carbon tax on electricity and grocery bills. Things will only get worse with the world's biggest carbon tax set to hit families, jobs and investment very soon. The budget papers confirm that, despite falling international prices, the carbon tax will go up to $29 a tonne in just three years, and an additional $36 million will be spent on taxpayer funded carbon tax advertising over the next two years. This tax will affect the entire economy. The price of everything will go up and up. Families will be hit hard. Small businesses, which are the engine room of our economy, will receive no compensation for the carbon tax.


The people of Macarthur are against this tax. They are unsure and anxious about its effect on their weekly bills, and they are angry after being misled by the Prime Minister, who said days before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. The Treasurer did not mention the carbon tax once in his budget speech or indeed in the budget papers. He makes a glib passing reference to a carbon price but tells people not to worry about it, that it is no big deal—a tax with the single greatest impost on the family budget of every household in Macarthur. Even the Prime Minister's initial compensation package did not make a dent in the angst felt by the community.


Families in Macarthur are already paying for the highest electricity prices in the world. Now that we are heading into winter, this government will be forcing older residents on fixed incomes to spend their evenings in the dark and cold because they will not be able to afford to use their heaters or to turn on the lights. What would the Treasurer say to 60-year-old Mrs Schuit, who contacted my office last week? Mrs Schuit survives week to week by eating once a day, cooking once a week and showering every second day to keep her electricity and water bills down. Come 1 July, Mrs Schuit will be hit by the carbon tax, stretching what little finances she has even further. I would like to know: when did electricity become a luxury in this country, and when did having hot water suddenly become aspirational? People on fixed incomes, such as pensioners like Mrs Schuit, self-funded retirees, single mothers and people with a disability will be the hardest hit of all by the carbon tax. The base carbon price will continue to rise, but their compensation will not.


Now the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have resorted to desperately buying back votes from mums and dads with their schoolkids bonus sugar hit, a vain attempt to hide the true effects of the carbon tax. The Treasurer has pushed this payment into the 2011-12 financial year to protect his wafer-thin surplus. This is treating Australian families with contempt—throwing cash to them with one hand and taking away even more with the other. All seniors, students, couples and pensioners will miss out on this new cash splash, and families are not the only ones who will do it tough as a result of this budget.


This budget offers nothing more to 800 small businesses in Macarthur who will also be hit with the world's biggest carbon tax. The government has offered nothing new in this budget to provide immediate relief to struggling businesses. The sector is seeing a 48 per cent increase in insolvencies. I have met with many small-business owners in Macarthur recently who are fed up with all the broken promises, because every one of the government's broken promises will affect their livelihoods. First there was the broken promise not to introduce a carbon tax, and now there is a broken promise to cut the company tax rate.


Carbon tax related sweeteners in the form of accelerated depreciation allowances are not fooling anyone. These allowances are going to rely on small businesses having ready cash to spend on new capital items. The government's abolition of the entrepreneurs tax offset has increased tax for nearly 370,000 of our smallest businesses, including micro, home based, independent contractor and start-up businesses with incomes of less than $70,000 or $80,000 year. The local corner shop in Macarthur is not only going to have to deal with an increase in the cost of supplies and electricity but also going to have pressure from consumers looking for a bargain as the cost of living increases and unemployment rises, as forecast at in the budget.


Last year's budget promised 500,000 new jobs over two years, but the government now expects to miss its target by 300,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is forecast to increase to 5.5 per cent while the government is cutting $200 million of job services programs. Even the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:


The decision to abandon the company tax cut is dripping with politics and a low blow to the business sector …


The chamber also said that this budget lacks vision for the broader economy.


I hold grave concerns for the future of small business in Macarthur. These local mums and dads will be hit the hardest because their costs will go up and up when the carbon price goes up and up. They will not receive a single cent in compensation. The coalition has a clear roadmap to restore hope, reward and opportunity for small business by scrapping the carbon tax and getting out of the way of business by slashing $1 billion worth of red tape. We believe in a hand up, not a hand out and in rewarding those who work hard to earn a living and support their families. While the much needed infrastructure projects in Macarthur do not rate a mention in this budget, the Treasurer does manage to promise preliminary economic, social and environmental studies into the sustainability of Wilton as a site for a second Sydney airport. The prospect of a second Sydney airport has been brewing in the background of Australian politics for well over 30 years, and the people of Badgerys Creek and Wilton have fought against it time and time again, and for good reason. The member for Throsby has been quoted in the Illawarra Mercury as saying:


While … there are environmental challenges—


and that is a huge understatement—


with the Wilton site, I can also see enormous economic benefits for our region.


It sounds like code for 'I support an airport at Wilton' to me. I dare say that any economic benefits would be entirely negated by the massive cost for both the federal and New South Wales governments if Sydney's water supply were contaminated. The 1985 Kinhill Stearns report clearly ruled out Wilton as a possible site for an airport because of the highly sensitive nature of the water catchment area. The development of an airport at Wilton would pose an extremely serious threat to the long-term quality and integrity of Sydney's drinking water supply. As the New South Wales state member for Wollondilly, Jai Rowell, said, what is spilt on the ground in Wilton ends up in our water supplies. The March 2012 Joint study on aviation capacity for the Sydney region identified that:


… the Wilton site … appears to have a partial overlap with a designated Mine Subsidence District and all these sites are underlain by coal measures which are actively being mined …


So questions need to be asked: why would the infrastructure minister decide to place an airport on land affected by mine subsidence, and where will Sydney get its drinking water if Warragamba Dam, Nepean Dam, Avon Dam and Cordeaux Dam are compromised?


The people of Macarthur have also been short-changed when it comes to the promised National Disability Insurance Scheme. While I understand that progress has been made with the NDIS, the government has allocated only $1 billion over four years when the Productivity Commission has said that in that time frame $3.9 billion is needed. That is $2.9 billion less than what is needed for the start-up years of the NDIS. I find it concerning and disappointing, and I think a lot of people living with a disability in Macarthur and their families will be feeling short-changed. The Productivity Commission also proposed that the NDIS would cover 400,000 Australians. The government's budget announced that it would only extend to 20,000 Australians. Based on the budget figures, full implementation of the scheme by the Productivity Commission's target date of 2018 will not happen. This budget has let down the residents of Macarthur who are living with a disability, and their families and carers. The government will be spending more each financial year—$8 billion—on debt and interest costs than it will spend in total over the next four years on the NDIS. The government has already rejected the coalition's offer to develop a joint parliamentary committee chaired by both the coalition and Labor Party spokespeople on disabilities. This would ensure that the NDIS is kept above politics so it can survive through the three election cycles it will take to be fully implemented.


I would also like to talk about the seniors in my electorate, who are forgotten in this budget. In this budget self-funded retirees will not receive a single cent of compensation to assist with the imposed damage of the carbon tax. In fact, this budget makes life much more difficult for self-funded retirees by reducing the higher tax concessions for super contributions of higher income earners. It also defers a higher concessional contributions cap for over-50s with less than $500,000 in superannuation. This government has also made it difficult for self-funded retirees to meet their medical costs by introducing means testing of the medical expenses tax offset. The incentive for mature age workers to remain in the workforce has also been removed by phasing out the $500 mature age worker tax offset. Of the $66.9 million allocated to the new Economic Potential of Senior Australians program, only $10 million is set aside to assist mature age workers to gain employment in the workforce. This program pays $1,000 to an employer who takes on a mature age worker for three months, compared to the coalition's policy, which would pay $3,250 to an employer who takes on a mature age worker from the welfare system and employs them for a minimum of six months. The remaining $56.9 million has been allocated to talking about the problem of discrimination, not fixing it, with things like an advisory panel to discuss legislation for positive ageing.


This is just another example of this government's waste and mismanagement, but the waste is nothing new to this government. A local newspaper in my electorate has labelled the National Broadband Network a 'flop' for the people of Macarthur. The NBN, which the Treasurer has left off the books this year, has become the laughing-stock of the developed world. People will be paying three times as much for their internet to use speeds that a majority of the population are not going to need, and no thought has been given to prioritising areas that either do not have broadband or have inadequate services. On top of this, the government will spend $20 million on a propaganda campaign about the NBN to paint over the waste and mismanagement of the $50 billion project—that is, if it does cost $50 billion to complete. Some are estimating that it could cost between $60 billion and $80 billion. To make matters worse, this week the Australian newspaper reported that foreign controlled companies have been awarded 82c in every dollar's worth of contracts struck for Labor's National Broadband Network, sparking warnings that local industry is being bypassed in Australia's biggest infrastructure project. Shame. The coalition will continue to hold the government to account on the NBN. We will also continue to develop our alternative broadband policy, which will improve the quality and availability of broadband for all Australians.


The coalition also has great plans for Australian school students and will revive foreign languages in schools to help unlock the potential offered by the Asian century. Within a decade, we want to see 40 per cent of all year 12 students in Macarthur and across Australia studying a foreign language. The proportion of year 12 students studying a foreign language has dropped from about 40 per cent in the 1960s to around 12 per cent today. Knowing the language of our major trading partners—China, Japan, Korea and India—is essential to unlocking the potential of the Asian century for Australia. We believe that, starting in preschool, every student should have an exposure to foreign languages. This is part of the coalition's positive plan for our economy, and I am looking forward to working with students and schools in Macarthur to ensure that this plan to revitalise foreign languages in schools becomes a reality.


I am proud to be part of a coalition that has an alternative to this Labor incompetency. We will restore hope, reward and opportunity for all Australians, we will restore good economic management and we will end the waste. We will repeal the carbon tax and stop Labor's attack on the family budget. Only in a growing economy is it possible to have lower taxes, better services and a stronger budget bottom line, as Australians discovered during the Howard era. Under a coalition government, there will be tax cuts without a carbon tax but we will find the savings to pay for them. From an economic perspective, the worst aspect of this budget is that there is no plan for economic growth, and nothing whatsoever to promote investment or employment. The coalition will ensure Australia has a vigorous five-pillar economy, strong manufacturing, vibrant agriculture, growing knowledge based industries and resilient service sectors as well as a mining industry. We will restore Australia to its rightful place in the world.


I join my colleagues here today who are disappointed in this government and its budget. Like the people of Macarthur, I am frustrated because I know there is a better way. I have seen it before—a strong economy which supports all Australians. But to achieve this we need an election so that a coalition government can put policy in place that will see our country and its peoples prosper. The coalition will reward innovation, not punish those Australians who contribute so greatly to our nation. We will restore opportunity for all Australians, young and old, and we will restore hope in our nation's future. The people of Macarthur have a bright future ahead of them under a coalition government. That is something I am very sure of. (Time expired)

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (13:32):  In speaking today on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2012-2013 and related bills, I would like to focus on the critical failure of governance associated with the influence of the union movement and union officials on Australia's $1.35 trillion superannuation sector. I want to make three points. Firstly, we have seen a governance scandal at the Health Services Union, and that has clearly spilled over into governance in the superannuation sector. Secondly, the problem is broader than just the Health Services Union. Thirdly, I want to note that the recent Cooper review into superannuation recommended substantial reforms to superannuation governance but the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, Bill Shorten, has done nothing about it.


Let me turn, firstly, to the governance scandal at the Health Services Union. The former national secretary of that union is the subject of an 1,100-page report by Fair Work Australia detailing multiple breaches of the union rules. Another senior Health Services union official, Michael Williamson, has been the subject of serious corruption allegations. The partner of the current Health Services Union National Secretary, Kathy Jackson, has written to police complaining about what is happening at the Health Services Union. The most obvious victims of the mismanagement and poor governance at the Health Services Union are the unfortunate members of that union.


Another group of Australians should be very concerned: those whose retirement savings are in the hands of Health Services Union officials appointed as directors of superannuation funds. Thanks to deeply flawed governance arrangements put in place by the Keating government, union officials have a privileged place in running superannuation funds. Health Services Union boss, Michael Williamson, was until recently a director of First State Super, a fund with $30 billion under management for some 70,000 current and former New South Wales public servants. He was appointed to that position by Unions New South Wales. Last month, the Chairman of First State Super complained that he had no power to remove Williamson as a trustee. Three other current Health Services Union officials are directors of superannuation funds. Peter Mylan, who is the assistant secretary of the New South Wales Health Services Union and a man recently described in the Australian as 'a long time Williamson loyalist', is also on the board of First State Super, appointed by Unions NSW. HESTA, which is a fund with $18.3 billion of superannuation savings for people working in the health industry, has two Health Services Union officials appointed by that union to the board of HESTA: Rosemary Kelly and Lloyd Williams.


Then we could look at former directors of superannuation funds appointed by the Health Services Union. Until recently there was another superannuation fund called Health Super and, before it recently merged into First State Super, Health Services Union official David Langmead served on its board. Until last year, Kathy Jackson, National Secretary of the Health Services Union, was a director of HESTA, and Craig Thomson, the former National Secretary of the Health Services Union and the current member for Dobell, is also a former director of HESTA. 


Let us just remind ourselves of what the current member for Dobell had to say about Kathy Jackson's appointment as a director of HESTA. He said:


She sat on the board of HESTA, collecting board fees for many years, rarely attending meetings. But when the union decided the board fee should go to the union, she left the board.


I do not know whether or not that allegation is correct. But I do think it is instructive as an insight into the mindset of one former union official, the current member for Dobell, about the status of board appointments to superannuation funds.


It is deeply troubling that so many officials of a union whose affairs have become a byword for corruption, mismanagement and failure of governance are able to be appointed by that union to roles as directors of superannuation funds where they have the responsibility to oversee the retirement savings of tens of thousands of Australians, many of whom are not members of the Health Services Union or any other union. The Health Services Union scandal shows what happens when union officials are more interested in looking after themselves than in serving their members.


I want to come to the second proposition put before the House this afternoon: that this is a broader problem, which extends beyond the Health Services Union. There are dozens of superannuation funds that have up to half of their directors directly appointed by a union and hence there is the real risk that, if a union is infected by a 'look after your mates' culture, this in turn can infect governance in the superannuation sector.


One troubling indicator is the number of superannuation funds that do not disclose the fees they pay to their directors. Of the 16 funds which brand themselves as 'industry super', fewer than half of them disclose the fees paid to individual directors in their most recent annual reports. Another indicator that something is wrong here is the number of current or former union officials doing very nicely from serving on the boards of multiple superannuation funds. Michael Williamson of the Health Services Union, whom I mentioned before, was recently reported in the Sydney Morning Herald to earn a $330,000 a year salary, in addition to $150,000 from his various board positions, such as First State Super. 


Mr Williamson is not the only follower of this particular career strategy. Consider, for example, Mr Bob Henricks, a former Queensland secretary of the Electrical Trades Union and CEO of Energy Super, a Queensland based fund with net assets of $3.8 billion. He was also Chairman of SPEC Super, until it recently merged into Energy Super, and he is also Chairperson of AUST(Q) Super. None of these funds in their annual reports disclose the fees paid to Mr Henricks as a director but, when you add up those fees across multiple funds, they are likely to be significant.


Another interesting case study is that of Mr Bernie Riordan, until recently the head of the Electrical Trades Union in New South Wales. Last year the Sunday Telegraphreported that he earns nearly $400,000 a year from a combination of his union job and directorships of three superannuation funds and businesses: Energy Industries Superannuation Scheme, FuturePlus Financial Services, and Chifley Financial Services, and one other company.


Let us look at another fund where there has been a profound governance problem. Vision Super in Victoria, formerly known as Local Government Super, was supposed to be merging with Equip Super, the fund which covers employees in the Victorian electricity and power sector. It has recently been announced that the merger is off. The difficulty seems to have been that it ran smack bang into the politics of the Australian Services Union, which dominates Vision Super. Equipsuper has elected member representatives, which is a good thing, but Vision Super has its four so-called member representatives directly appointed by the Australian Services Union. The merged entity was supposed to have elected member representatives, but it seems that ASU officials were very unhappy when a member of the Equipsuper fund—somebody who happened to be a senior manager at a power company, somebody who had formerly been an employer-appointed director of Equipsuper—chose to seek election as a board member of the merged super fund.


A letter was circulated to ASU members by ASU state secretary Brian Parkinson. Let me read from some of what he had to say. He said:


Voting has now commenced for the election of two member elected directors to serve on the Equipsuper board. 


As expected, employers are seeking election to workers' positions. Indeed, one such individual, John Azaris (General Manager—Operations and Services at SP Ausnet), has exploited his senior management role to frustrate the election chances of ASU candidates. 


To illustrate this point, I wish to bring this one incident to your attention. SP Ausnet management allowed Azaris, a current employer director at Equipsuper, to use it's email system to promote his candidacy as a member director. When an endorsed ASU candidate employed there (with almost 40 years of service to the company) sought to use the same service, he was refused on the most flimsy of pretexts. Management will pull out all the stops to see one of their own elected at the expense of workers. 


These are the sort of unfair tricks we can expect from management. It is a disgrace. Workers such as yourself need to send a clear message to management to keep their hands off Equipsuper.


It seems that Mr Parkinson, who, as well as being ASU state secretary is also a director of Vision Super, was unhappy that the Australian Services Union was not going to have a guaranteed number of union appointed directors to the board of the merged entity. But his letter reveals that he has fundamentally misconceived his duties as a director of Vision Super. The selection of directors of a superannuation fund, to take on the vital task of stewarding the collective retirement wealth of members of the fund, has nothing to do with outdated class-war rhetoric about workers and bosses.


We could look at reported difficulties in the Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund. According to a recent report in the Australian this union invested some $30 million in a property company called Austcorp, before the company collapsed in May 2009 with almost all of the $30 million being lost. According to the Australian, Austcorp paid tens of thousands of dollars to a Mr Wally Curran, described as 'a legendary unionist, former long-time secretary of the Meatworkers Union and a long-serving trustee director of the Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund.' If you look at the most recent annual report of that fund, you will see that he was listed as a director. According to the article, Mr Curran is 80 years old and a former communist. 


It is an obvious question: is Mr Curran a suitable person to be managing a superannuation fund which has $550 million of assets? Does he have the qualifications, skills and ability to separate what is in his personal interests from what is in the interests of members of the fund? But if this question can be asked about Mr Curran or Mr Parkinson—or Mr Williamson, of whom I have earlier spoken—how many other union officials on superannuation fund boards can it be asked of? If you take the 67 funds listed by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority as industry or public sector funds, there are 170 directors appointed directly by a union or a union peak body such as the ACTU. The majority of these people have as their day job that of being a union official. For example, the four union appointed directors on TWUSuper are the national secretary and the three state secretaries of the Transport Workers Union. 


Let me turn to the third point I wish to make, which is that the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and the Gillard government have failed to implement the reforms recommended in the Cooper review to address the governance problems that I have spoken of. The minister, Bill Shorten, has done some window-dressing recently, announcing a package of measures that will, amongst other things, require funds to disclose the remuneration of directors. That is a good thing, but in both his reform package and in the legislation dealing with the obligations of directors of trustee companies of superannuation funds, which went through this House last week, the minister made no attempt to deal with key recommendations from the recent Cooper review dealing with the governance of superannuation funds.


Those recommendations include that disclosure of conflict of interest should be mandatory; that directors must properly disclose their remuneration in line with the provisions that apply to publicly listed companies; that the so-called equal representation model—which is code for the unions having a privileged role in the governance of superannuation funds—should no longer be mandatory; that where equal representation does apply there should be at least one third of the directors on the board who are independent; and that directors who want to sit on multiple boards must demonstrate to APRA that they do not have any foreseeable conflicts of interest.


As I have demonstrated, there is plenty of evidence that union officials regard being on the board of a superannuation fund as a nice little extra benefit that comes as part of the package of being an official. There is troubling evidence that some do not understand their fiduciary obligations to members of the superannuation fund—obligations which have nothing to do with their position as a union official and which are quite separate and which are legally binding. Unfortunately, Minister Shorten has done nothing to solve this problem. He is, I note, himself a former union official and a former director of an industry superannuation fund—one of the predecessors of AustralianSuper—as are two other Labor parliamentarians former directors of AustralianSuper, Greg Combet and Senator Doug Cameron, and as was Labor's failed candidate for Melbourne in the 2010 elections, Cath Bowtell.


The current arrangements suit the union movement and individual union officials very well. They are not, however, in the interests of the millions of Australians who are members of superannuation funds which have union officials appointed to the board, because those fund members get no say in that appointment and, in many cases, those fund members are not members of the union.


The evidence is very clear: there is a profound governance problem in superannuation. Last week the minister said that he was 'appalled' about the HSU scandal. I could not help being reminded of Captain Reynaud in Casablanca, who was 'shocked' to discover that there was gambling going on, and promised to 'round up the usual suspects'. It is time to end the window-dressing. It is time for Minister Shorten to deal with this serious problem. (Time expired)

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (12:01):  Whilst this is certainly a tight budget in a tight parliament and there will be plenty of debate, as has already taken place, around the rights and wrongs of it, in the end it will pass this parliament. So, for all the speeches one way or the other, the bottom line is it will pass. In my view, the budget is just one arm of the broader story of the moment and the question of the moment for all of us in public policy and throughout Australia. It is therefore a budget that I respond to in the broader context of what is going on in this parliament and throughout Australia right now.


I believe Australia is at a crossroads. We as a country need to conduct a budget-like audit of ourselves and ask ourselves whether we are still the brave reforming nation of our history, or have we succumbed to the risk averse, the timid and the anonymous critics of new media? Are we still the nation that spits in the eye of those who say, 'You can't, you won't, you shouldn't'? Or are we to now believe the pathetic, cult-like culture of the new radical conservatives in Australia, who want to kill this opportunity for reform within Australia right now via a campaign of vitriol and so-called death by adjectives?


We as a nation are at the crossroads. We are on the lip of the cliff of losing trust in our history, a history that has been shaped by taking chances and risks. We have a history of confidence against the odds and a history where we chose to do it our way—the Australian way and a way that so often has led the world in governance, sport, arts, science, innovation and business.


Eighteen months ago as an Independent MP in his third year of representing his community, I never thought the stakes were higher than forming government for three years, while locking in some local and national reforms through agreements reached. I was wrong. The stakes are much higher. At the crossroads as a nation, we are now in a fight for ourselves—a fight for the heart of Australia; a fight for what it means to be Australian. We are in danger of introducing something new into Australian public policy: fear. We are in danger of becoming a nation where fear wins over all else. We are in danger of creating a model of government and policy development that is risk averse and where the perception of the best government is in reality a government that does nothing at all just to avoid controversy.


In political terms, we are seeing more and more evidence of this. The Australian community is in grave danger of being 'astroturfed' into submission, where new organised, vested and issues-based interests control the chaos and the dissent for their own direct personal benefit and, as a consequence, governments cower from reform due to the new-found power of fear and dissent in Australia, leaving voters absolutely exhausted by the noise of the loudest and the richest. The crossroads we are at as a nation is whether we are a nation that still plays front-foot cricket and whether we are the great innovators who stare down opponents and prove them wrong time and time again, or whether we as a nation now play back-foot cricket and defend, whinge and complain. The question I have is: when and, more importantly, why did our Ian Chappell mentality turn into a Geoffrey Boycott mentality?


As a personal contribution on this, I accept my failure so far in these 18 months of this parliament. I sought consensus within the parliament itself, and I have found the toxic. I sought agreement on key issues across the major parties in the national interest, and I have found manufactured division. I might be too harsh on myself, as we have achieved much in this parliament: the ETS, some tax reform, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, aged care and 55 new Regional Development offices in a network. But as I seek more from the next 18 months—not for some personal reason but clearly because there is so much more to do—I feel frustrated by the moment.


I provide three examples of this right now. The first is recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia's Constitution. A full round of consultation and an extensive report were done last year, for which I was one of 22 very diverse members of a panel across party lines, working through the legal and moral complexities at stake. It delivered. It delivered a comprehensive report in January. It captured the 200 consultations throughout Australia and what was being sought by many Australians. It made the obvious and convincing point that the absolute key to success for any referendum in Australia is bipartisanship; our eight-from-44 record proves that. That is an example of this much sought-after consensus. But right now, over four months since the report was delivered, we are still stuck in the toxic muck. It is my understanding that neither Tony Abbott nor Julia Gillard has picked up the phone, walked down the corridor or leant across to the other at some joint function and said the simple words, 'Let's talk about that referendum question.' I take ownership of this failure as much as anyone, but all I can do is continue to seek more from our leadership on both sides of parliament and push and push and push where I can to seek more from both the MP for Lalor and the MP for Warringah, both of whom have extraordinary power right now and even more power together for the good of the nation. To now have good people like Tom Calma, Mark Leibler, Mick Gooda and the Liberal MP for Hasluck, Ken Wyatt, starting to say that toxic politics is now changing the strategy of policy—of when and how we promote a referendum in Australia—should cut to the absolute heart of anyone who cares about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and anyone who cares about Australia being the island nation of brave reformers. We are stuck in the toxic muck of our own making, and we lose nation-building opportunities unless we find a way out or a way through that muck.


A second example is electoral funding reform. In January the Australian Electoral Commission released donation records from 2010-11, and the figures should frighten everyone. The LNP revealed $110 million in political donations in the one year alone, and the ALP revealed $90 million in political donations in this same year. These are extraordinary figures that, if sustained, make a consensus on anything impossible and make the parliament itself a wholly owned subsidiary of major donors to the major parties. Again, because of the toxic, we look like heading into the 44th Parliament election season with no commitment from either side to electoral funding reform when it is so bleedingly obvious that the money now coming into the political parties is either unsustainable or dangerous for the nation. A consensus agreement is desperately needed by both major parties, as much in their own interests as in the interests of the nation. But the toxic moment is removing the opportunity for even a conversation, let alone a joint strategy. These are two governance examples, and this is before we get into the policy questions of where consensus right now would be in the national interest on policy. Take the Gonski review on education. What a difference a joint working group across party lines would make on that right now. Take comprehensive tax reform. What a difference a joint working group across party lines would make on that right now. Once again I plead and push. I plead with ordinary Australians, with commentators and with the major parties to put Australia's reform agenda first and push for consensus on policy first, because those that seek to divide do not act in Australia's interest. They act in their own interest, whether political or some other sectional interest.


I will not today nor ever support the dividers in Australia. I will always, today and in the future, support those whose focus is policy. In rugby terms, I will support those that play the ball of policy, not the man of politics. Today, in an era when we are seeing the conservative politics behave more radically than at any time since my distant cousin Michael Oakeshott wrote his conservative thoughts, I yearn for a day when these same conservative politicians and conservative cheerleaders try and win the day on policy and policy alone. Australia does suffer while we wait.


As a final point on this, I purposely single out three media leaders from the Australian newspaper, Chris Mitchell, Matthew Franklin and Dennis Shanahan—not to run some hate media argument on them and not to square up on any editorial position from them last year but because, out of a perverse mark of respect, I think these three shape the broader media position on what it is to be an opposition leader more than anyone else. I single them out as leaders who can make change for Australia. If these three continue to believe and to argue that an opposition's role is only to oppose—that their role and power as parliamentarians is to be denied right now and that there is no worth at all in the lion lying down with the lamb—then Australia suffers. I accept division makes great copy and sells newspapers, but consensus right now is what builds Australia and builds a nation. Consensus right now is what will answer the unanswered on constitutional reform, on tax reform, on productivity reform, on education reform and on electoral donation reform. If this challenge is denied, I can read the editorial now. The Australian will argue that it reflects community views only and the opposition is doing its job to oppose. If that is what it is then so be it. But, if we all want more, no three people can push for national outcomes on some key issues better than these three. Rest assured that I know the LNP, the opposition, are playing to that audience. Whilst ever they are allowed to have the position of all care and no responsibility, they will take it. I would take it. We would all take it, and reform in Australia grinds to a toxic halt.


Having said that, I think there is plenty of reform that has been achieved so far and that does deserve to be talked about. It is significant that the three major rating agencies have given a AAA rating to Australia right now. It is significant that the unemployment rate is under five per cent, inflation is in hand and the cash rate is below five per cent. Whilst there will be a debate about the debt ceiling—I am a reluctant partner in that whole process—now is not the time for a US-style debt ceiling fight. I will—and I understand the coalition will as well—allow that issue to pass this parliament right now.


The big issue next week in New South Wales is the Pacific Highway funding. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, that from the Bruce Highway's perspective you are watching closely. New South Wales can take the opportunity of finishing the project of the Pacific Highway by 2016, as promised and agreed by state and federal governments and by all political parties. The construction works were released through questions in this parliament over the past six months. There is no construction impediment to completing the final 400 kilometres of works. It is now down to nothing other than the money. I all but pushed all political chips across the table to get $3.56 billion allocated in the federal budget. As people can see in the budget papers, it is one of the standout roads items, if not the standout roads item. We can finish the job if the state commits to do its part and enter a partnership along the lines of what John Howard argued in 2007 and what Mark Vaile argued, and through all transport ministers going back to the start of this project with Laurie Brereton and Michael Knight. Everyone has argued the case for a fifty-fifty project. It is disappointing that the company line out of New South Wales in the last 12 months seems to have changed. I hope for a celebration next week, not a further cynical argument and political fight. But that is for the New South Wales budget, which we will all watch closely.


I acknowledge, as I mentioned before, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and aged-care reform. Both are significant steps forward through this budget, and I would hope that continued work sees both of those having very practical outcomes on the ground. It would be remiss not to mention the emissions trading scheme, something I took to both the 2007 and 2010 elections. We now will see that happen in Australia. It is recognising the place of both science and economics. I accept the science and the economics, and I accept my role in trying to get the policy process to deliver on both. I also would be remiss not to mention the Regional Development Australia network and the fact that we now have 55 regions identified in Australia and that all have an office working with local communities and trying to build the concept of place based and local based thinking in Australia. The budget will pass, but I do urge and encourage both Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott to lead, lead together, and lead together right now.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (12:16):  I rise to talk about this budget—Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 and related bills—in relation to what the government is doing. Each year I rise and ask the same question, and I do so again this year: what is the biggest item of expenditure in the federal budget? Of course, once again we find in this year's budget that the biggest single item is welfare. Some people would say welfare is a legitimate activity of government, but for it to be the No. 1 item of expenditure for a federal government—and this year it increased quite substantially when you look at the figures—I think is of great concern to Australia and the whole economy and how we operate our budgets. This government seems hell-bent on over-regulating and putting the government at the centre of everything in the national economy. It is correct, as the member for Lyne has identified, that Australia is at a crossroads in this regard when you consider that, in relation to small and medium enterprises, this government has brought in a whopping 20,000 new regulations for small and medium enterprises and has removed fewer than 200. There are 20,000 new regulations. When you look at this massive increase in the welfare budget and at what this government is doing to produce a smoke-and-mirrors surplus, I think you get a kind of feel for and flavour of what is really going on with this government's mismanagement of the economy.


The biggest ticket item in terms of expenditure cuts is, of course, the $5 billion worth of defence cuts, translated almost exactly into $5 billion of welfare increases. I think that $5 billion of cuts to our defence forces is one of the most short-sighted policy decisions that we will make in the coming decade. I say that because defence is the first priority of a national government. It is the most legitimate activity of a federal government. It is why we have a federal government, indeed. It is partly why we federated: to form a defence force to protect our national interests. A $5 billion cut, I think, represents a grave danger to the future operational capacity of the ADF and, indeed, will undermine its ability to upgrade many of the capital and other requirements for major projects that we all know are so necessary.


The government at the moment is lamenting in so many ways the loss of manufacturing workers, the loss of jobs in the economy and the loss of the capacity of Australia to manufacture its own things. There is no more legitimate activity of government in this space than manufacturing in defence industry. Defence industry in Australia is of vital concern for our nation's economic wellbeing. We could certainly sustain manufacturing jobs and other capacity in defence industry production, and yet we have a $5 billion cut in this regard. While we are subsidising a lazy and indolent car industry that is producing cars that consumers do not want at a price they cannot afford, and we are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars per job in that sector, we are ignoring a vital and successful component of our manufacturing that is the Australian defence industry. I am a well-known opponent of protection in industries, and I do not count defence as protection. The Prime Minister and I even had a Twitter fight about the car industry and her much vaunted policy, and I do not believe she came off best in that regard, because it is undeniable that the No. 1 reason why we need to subsidise this industry is because the top-selling car in Australia is a foreign car. Why? Because it is cheaper. People can buy a better-made car, at a cheaper price, that is smaller, more efficient and more environmentally friendly. That is the No. 1 reason that people are not choosing Australian cars. How is a subsidy going to produce a better outcome in relation to that? It flies in the face of the other policy that the government is vaunting in this budget and the economic debacle that is the so-called surplus, and that is the carbon tax.


The entire economy is now built on the carbon tax coming into operation on 1 July. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the opposition is firmly committed to the removal of this toxic tax from the Australian economy, for good reason. You do not need a $5 billion increase in welfare—which the government calls 'compensation'—if you do not have a major tax going into the economy, taxing all of the productive sectors of the economy, ripping money out and increasing prices of basic goods and services. The government often says, 'You're going to rip away money from pensioners. You're going to rip away money from families.' I do not see Australian families and Australian pensioners as welfare cases. They are capable of working for themselves, earning their own living, sustaining themselves into retirement and building their own financial footing. They do not need government. Every single family in this country does not need government to be a constant drip of money for them. They can do it themselves, and that is what the role of government is—not to get involved but to get uninvolved, to leave people alone to prosper, to build the businesses they want to build, to innovate and create wealth and jobs and look after themselves and their families. Government is there to step in when people cannot do it for themselves, when they will not do it for themselves and they are unable to or they come across other issues in life. That is the legitimate role of government.


Now we have got to the point in our society today where we are, through the carbon tax, basically becoming a welfare state of epic proportions, where everybody has an entitlement to compensation for prices that are deliberately ratcheted up by this government. Why are we ratcheting up the prices of goods and services and basics like electricity? The government says that it is 'to save the climate of the planet.' Today I noticed that Tim Flannery is on the bandwagon again. I heard the member for Lyne saying once again that he is a believer in the science. Today Tim Flannery has come forward to say that we need to remove the fillings from the teeth of dead people, if they have mercury in them, because we do not want that going back into the environment. Last week he was in Western Sydney—I know the member for Chifley will be very interested in this—and he was saying that people will die in Western Sydney because of the heatwaves that are coming through climate change. This is the kind of taxpayer-funded drivel that we are hearing every day, that is justifying an economy-wide carbon tax that will punish every business and industry and will push up the cost of goods and services. It will cause us to go further down the path of becoming a welfare state, because of people like Professor Tim Flannery who propose that we need to use a wrench to pull out teeth that have mercury in them. It is in the Daily Telegraph today. That is what he is proposing. He is paid $300,000 a year by the taxpayer. This is becoming an absolute travesty. The science is hardly what is driving this policy from this government. Concern for the climate seems to be backmost of what they are doing.


This budget is of great concern in my own electorate of Mitchell, which has one of the highest proportions of families of any electorate in the country. The cost of living, of goods and services and of electricity prices in particular resonates across Western Sydney. You would not find a door to knock on in Western Sydney that would not raise electricity prices as one of their No. 1 concerns, and they are concerned about the outcome of this budget and the carbon tax. In particular, once again we see in relation to the minister for transport and the much vaunted Infrastructure Australia policy, which from this government was meant to be the saving grace of infrastructure in Australia today, another complete abandonment of the nation's biggest city, Sydney. Not only is there not a single dollar in the budget for infrastructure in Sydney; there has not been in four years. There was $100 million for a study for a metro for the last state government, which we know was probably the worst government and the most incompetent government of any single government in the nation's history. That money had to be handed back to the federal government because of the incompetence of that state government. I know the member for Chifley knows all about that, so I will not lecture him anymore on that.


The failing of this government in particular is that there is no infrastructure funding for the biggest economic generator in the country. I follow the model of infrastructure provision that it should be economical where possible. Of course there are times where government has to go out and build a rail line or a road where it may not be so economical. But primarily we must be putting money into the economic and infrastructure drivers that will build and be sustainable in our major cities, in our major ports, in our major areas of economic activity. That is the best way to fund the infrastructure so that we can continue generating jobs and prosperity and keep the economy ticking over.


This federal government says not a single road, not a single rail line, not a single driver of economic activity is needed in our nation's biggest city, with its biggest economic generator, with its massive population, with its ability to draw all of our migrants—most migrants still go to Sydney. It says, 'You don't have any infrastructure pressures or priorities.' I think it is an absolute failing of Infrastructure Australia and the policy of this government to have what it describes as non-political bodies deciding on infrastructure.


The north-west rail line in particular has been earmarked as the No. 1 priority of the New South Wales state government, funded with an additional $2.1 billion from the federal government, earmarked in the MYEFO 2010-11 year. The federal government right before the last election came forward with a promise, written on the back of a coaster, to build a Parramatta to Epping rail line to try and win the seat of Bennelong and retain the seat of Parramatta, realising how much political trouble they were in. The Prime Minister made the announcement. We all saw in Sydney what Labor had done over 16 years playing politics with rail lines in metropolitan Sydney. It was an absolute disaster. It was an absolute disaster for the state government at the last election and it was an absolute disgrace for the Prime Minister to attempt to play politics with the rail line.


This $2.1 billion in MYEFO in 2010-11 that is earmarked, allegedly, for the Epping-Parramatta rail line is not going to be brought on or brought forward. No plans are in train to build the Epping-Parramatta rail link. There is no construction timetable and no priority. Nothing will be done. No money will actually come forward until, as this government says, the state government contribute some money. The state government have made it clear that they will not be doing that. So that money could be earmarked to that state government right now in New South Wales to get infrastructure moving in Sydney, which is vital for the development of our city. It must be brought forward. But you will not see any action from this government. I would argue that until this government is removed there will be this continual political gain in relation to infrastructure funding in Sydney, which I think is to the detriment of every resident in Western Sydney, in my electorate of Mitchell.


We have heard much about this government spreading the benefits of the boom to all sectors of the economy. I think the other great betrayal of our nation's enterprise and business community in this budget was the absolute and utter shameful backflip on cutting the corporate tax rate. We know why it did that. All these small and medium enterprises around the nation who are struggling to pay their bills at the moment were looking for the cut in the company tax rate which was promised, promised and promised. We know what the promises of this government are worth. But those businesses were expecting this company tax cut. How is it right for a government to, on the one hand, outline its national policy so that businesses can make decisions and so that small and medium businesses can say, 'Look, we are under pressure but there is some prospect of us getting some relief in the next budget so we can make decisions and struggle on with our business enterprise,' and then, on the other hand, in the budget without warning pull the company tax cuts for all those small to medium enterprises around the country?


That was supposed to be spreading the benefits of the boom to every corner, as the Treasurer is fond of saying of our economy—but not the corner that is the small and medium enterprises. Not that corner. That is not where the boom will be spread to, because small and medium enterprises are one of the lowest priorities of the government.


They have no regard for the family owned or small business that is struggling under the current economic conditions and they are not spreading any part of the boom to those hardworking mums and dads and families who own businesses around the country. That is perhaps one of the greatest betrayals out of this budget that I think will have a very negative impact in confidence and in the ability of people to get ahead in their businesses.


Another problem that we have in relation to what is coming out of this budget is the constant increases of taxation and the constant uncertainty about whether something will or will not happen. We have seen it this week in relation to the enterprise migration agreements. Who is in support of it? Will it happen? Will it not happen? Is it okay by the unions? Is it not okay by the unions? Australia is becoming a sovereign risk in so many ways because of the uncertainty coming out of this government. This budget certainly reinforces the uncertainty that is coming out.


The uncertainty of this budget is: does anybody believe that we will achieve a $1.5 billion surplus next year based on, perhaps, the best increases in economic conditions in 20 years that are modelled here?




Mr Husic:
  Read the Fin Review!




Mr HAWKE:
  Does the member for Chifley really want to come forward and put his name to that? MYEFO is coming up at the end of this year and then of course we will have next year's budget. And in next year's budget I do not think it is too cavalier to predict that these great conditions predicted in the budget may not come forward, and we may not share that $1.5 billion surplus.


So if I have one overarching criticism it is the absolute lack of certainty that is coming out of the government. Their economic policy is just unfathomable to business and to people looking to invest in this country, and really they ought to hang their heads in shame at the way they are treating economic policy in Australia today.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (12:31):  I am very pleased to speak in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and cognate bills, for the 2012-2013 budget. I am very pleased to do so because the first thing that comes to mind when we are talking about the budget and the delivery of the budget is that you need to do it on the back of a very strong economy. Without a strong economy you will not be able to implement the very good things that are currently happening.


We know that from when this government first came into government, back in 2007, until today 800,000 new jobs have been created, with another 300,000 on track by the end of 2013. We know that these jobs were not just created by the click of a finger or by sitting back and doing nothing; these jobs were created through good initiatives by this government and through the strong economy that we have built.


We bulletproofed the Australian economy and kept it out of recession, which was very important to get us to the stage where we are today. If you look around the world you see what is happening in Europe—in Greece, in Portugal, in Italy, in Spain and in Ireland—and in other parts of the world. Look at what the US has been through since 2008—its economy is just starting to pick up now. Our economy has been going strong all through that period.


It was strong because we took decisive action when the global financial crisis hit. Again, I reiterate in this place as I have done many, many times before; there was a lot of criticism about our infrastructure packages from the opposition and a lot of criticism about the BER. These were projects that kept us out of the doldrums when the rest of the world was suffering. For example, when I visit a BER project, one of the questions I always ask is: how many people did it employ? And the answer always comes back that it was anything between 50 to 200 people. When you multiply 26,000 projects, just like the BERs that I visit in my electorate, across the country and you see the number of people who were employed, you can see why we got out of that financial crisis. We did not sit back and fold our arms, as we were told to by the opposition—we actually took decisive action. That has assisted us to build this strong economy, to bulletproof the Australian economy and, as I said, to keep it out of that recession.


At the same time it has spread those good benefits of the mining boom, helping families on modest incomes and small businesses. Only last week we heard the announcement of 8,000 new jobs in WA—8,000 new jobs! What a great announcement. What a great announcement to be able to say that we are creating 8,000 new jobs and, at the same time, ensuring that the mining boom is spread evenly across the country. That is great news. Most governments around the world would fall over backwards to make an announcement like that.


There are obviously things that we have to do to get those 8,000 jobs up and running—for example, ensuring that we have the skills to be able to fulfil those positions. I am very pleased that there will be training positions along with new apprentices and of course positions for Indigenous and Aboriginal people in mining. That is a terrific story, and I think it is something that we should not fear or run away from. This is a very important announcement.


At the same time we are delivering the new schoolkids bonus: $1.3 billion—$410 a year for primary schoolchildren and $820 a year for high school children. This is on top of delivering Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme, increasing family payments for teenagers and raising the childcare rebate to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs. These are good things we have done because, as I have said, we have a good economy in place to be able to bring these projects to fruition and ensure that we deliver and spread the benefits of the economy across the nation.


Many good things are happening, and I support this budget because it will deliver big time for my electorate: for pensioners doing it tough; for families working long days, doing it tough and struggling to make ends meet; and for the vulnerable in our community. The measures in this budget reflect those true Labor values of our government: fairness, jobs and opportunity for all. They are the things that we see from this government. It is absolutely paramount that we deliver for those people.


I will take the opportunity to highlight some of the measures in this particular budget, the 2012-13 budget, and what it means on the ground for thousands and thousands of people in my electorate of Hindmarsh. We on this side of the House understand the pressures of families who work long days, living pay to pay and spending what little they have on themselves after paying the bills for the kids' school fees, the groceries, the electricity bill, petrol, mortgages et cetera. That is why we are easing the pressure through tax cuts and increasing payments. In the electorate of Hindmarsh, thousands of people, as I said, are now benefiting from these initiatives. We also have boosted the assistance for older people to support them in their retirement or while still working. We have introduced new initiatives to help younger people support themselves while studying or learning a trade.


Paid parental leave is a very positive initiative, and I am delighted that 906 local families in my electorate of Hindmarsh are benefiting from Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. Just this week I spoke in the chamber in favour of the Dad and Partner Pay scheme, which will see dads get two weeks paid leave to be with mum and the baby when it is born. I cannot tell you what a difference that would make on the ground. I spoke, as I said earlier, last week about what a difference it would have made to me when my boys were born if I could have spent those two weeks at home. I know there are many people today in the situation I was in back then. I actually had to change my shifts to be able to stay at home and assist my wife and do what I could to help in the first two to three weeks. At the time, as I have said before, I was driving taxis full time and I changed my shift from six at night to six in the morning so I could get home and give my wife some respite and look after the newborn babies when they came home. It was absolutely exhausting, and a bonus like the one that has just been announced would have been a godsend for my family back then. I know that there are thousands of people out there in exactly the same position that I was in 28 years ago for the first and 24 years ago with the second one. 


The baby bonus is another great initiative. In my electorate, 710 local families benefited from the baby bonus last year and many of these families received $500 more of their payment upfront to help pay for the initial costs of setting up the baby's room, buying prams, clothes and all the added expenses that come up when a newborn comes home. Family tax benefit A is another initiative of this Labor government. The families of about 2,600 Hindmarsh teenagers turning 16 over the next five years will now receive up to $4,200 extra in family payments if their child stays at school. That is under our boost for teenagers as part of family tax benefit A. Another great initiative is the advance payment of the FTB A. We have 6,351 local FTB recipients who may be eligible for an advance payment of up to $1,000 to help them meet unexpected family expenses. We all know that life is not always predictable. We know that things happen—the car might break down, you might have a medical emergency and, when you are living on a low income, it can be very hard to find extra money when you need it. So this will go a long way to easing stress on families who are already overloaded trying to balance work, family, study and sport commitments, which as the dad of two boys myself I know is not an easy job and does not slow down as they get older.


We have 4,261 local families who will be receiving the childcare rebate in the electorate of Hindmarsh, and they are now benefiting from Labor increasing the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket costs and the increase in the maximum payment to $7,500 per child per year. There are 4,261 local families in my electorate who now have the option of claiming their childcare rebate payment fortnightly rather than having to wait to the end of the year, so it is easier to make ends meet.


Twenty-nine thousand local pensioners are now benefiting from Labor's historic pension reforms, including the biggest increase to the pension in 100 years. Single pensioners on the maximum rate are receiving an extra $154 per fortnight, and couples on the maximum rate are receiving an extra $156 a fortnight combined. I have 3,275 local families in Hindmarsh who have received an annual $600 carer's supplement boost to assist with the financial pressures associated with caring for a loved one. In addition, those who care for a child with a disability now receive an extra $1,000 per year. Also, 29,000 local age pensioners in my electorate can now keep more of their pension if still working. After changes by this Labor government, pensioners can earn up to $250 a fortnight without it being taken into account as income under the pension income test. These are all good measures.


We have also realised that we need to support apprentices and the skilled labour workforce. Six hundred and sixty-three local apprentices training in skill shortage areas are being supported with $5,500 in total government support to help them complete their qualifications in my electorate.


I turn next to the household assistance package. From May, more than 8,000 local families in Hindmarsh will receive extra money through family assistance payments. A typical family in my electorate will get $529 through both tax cuts and family assistance payments. With regard to family tax benefit A and B, 7,500 FTB A recipients in Hindmarsh will receive up to $110 extra a year per child and 6,000 FTB B recipients will receive up to $69 extra a year per child as of this month. More than 1,300 families will receive an extra $289 per year in increased income support, as well as assistance through increased family payments. I mentioned pensioners earlier. I have 29,000 local pensioners in my electorate who will receive an extra $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples combined in their pensions. Payments have started to go out this week. I have more than 2,200 local self-funded retirees, and they will receive an extra $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples combined from May. More than 3,700 local job seekers will receive an extra $218 a year for singles and $390 for couples combined as of this month. I have over 2,200 students in my electorate who will get an extra $177 per year. The amount they get will depend on their rate and type of payment—for example, Austudy, Abstudy or youth allowance.


Many people will benefit from the tax cuts. Approximately 53,000 local taxpayers in my electorate will receive a tax cut on 1 July. Around 44,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut of at least $300, and 4,000 local residents in Hindmarsh will pay no tax at all due to the tripling of the tax-free threshold. The average wage earner in Hindmarsh now pays approximately $1,200 less tax than in 2007-08 as a result of Labor's tax cuts for low- and middle-income families. From July, Labor will put up to $500 into the superannuation accounts of 22,000 local workers who are earning up to $37,000. These are low-paid workers and this will be a big benefit for them. As I said earlier, importantly, dads in my electorate will be able to apply for Labor's new dad and partner pay scheme, which begins on 1 January 2013. These are all very good benefits.


There are also nation-building programs taking place in my electorate. We have seen a rollout of the biggest road and rail program in the nation's history, with work beginning, progressing or being completed on a long list of large and smaller scale projects. For example, in my electorate, I have been proud to secure $4.5 million funding for the new King Street bridge, which opened on time and on budget at the end of last year and has been much welcomed by local residents, businesses and tourism operators.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (12:46):  I was very pleased to be in the chamber to listen to the contribution from the member for Hindmarsh about the cash splash of taxpayer dollars. But he failed to talk about those other aspects of the budget which should be of concern to every Australian—the question, firstly, as to how this cash splash should be paid for and, secondly, why it is that the government feel the need for modest payments to people in electorates like his. It is because people know that the cost of living is going up and up and will go up even further as a result of the government's carbon tax, to be brought in on 1 July.


Never more true than they are today are the words first espoused by President Clinton two decades ago: 'It's the economy, stupid!' That is very true. It is right to consider these words when we consider the Appropriations Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and related bills this afternoon.


Let us look at the current domestic situation. The retail sector is hurting. We have a two-speed economy, which is very different in the east and in the west. Housing approvals for new constructions are down, growth is going backwards, multifactor productivity has flatlined and is now heading in the wrong direction, and business confidence is at an all-time low. Against this backdrop we consider the international situation, which should concern us greatly. Financial turmoil in Europe shows no signs of abating. The situation in Greece and in France is not just a financial crisis but has snowballed into something even more significant—a social crisis with far-reaching consequences. We see high levels of US debt and a significant crisis of confidence in the US, and we see signs that China's growth is slowing. This is all relevant for us here in Australia. 


The budget that was announced by Treasurer Wayne Swan the foundation stone on which its economic narrative is based, so it deserves very close and very careful consideration. We cannot simply rely on the glib mantra of the Treasurer that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. He seems to think that with this mantra he can somehow avert any further scrutiny. But today we scrutinise in the time available the budget bills that have been brought before us, and there are a number of elements that we should consider very carefully. The first of them is this size of government debt, the second is the size of government expenditure, the third is how this expenditure is to be funded and the fourth is the believability of the government's claims of a budget surplus.


The budget announced by Treasurer Wayne Swan is the fifth budget he has delivered. Let us go back to the budgets since the last coalition budget. The coalition had a surplus of $20 billion, we had no net debt and we had $70 billion in net government assets. Where are we today? It was announced that we have a deficit of $44 billion. This deficit was predicted by this Treasurer just over 12 months ago to be closer $12 billion. It has gone up from $12 billion to $23 billion to $37 billion and was finally announced by the Treasurer in his budget at $44 billion. If you go back and look at the four budgets that he delivered before this one, you will see that the accumulation of deficit hit in this budget a record of $174 billion. These were the four largest budget deficits in our history. I want that to sink in for the people who are listening to this speech. There has been a combined deficit of 174 thousand million dollars in just four years. We have gone from a position of no net debt to a position where our net debt will peak at $145 billion. Judging by previous forecasts, I think we can anticipate that that figure will blow out even further.


We should also consider the government's gross debt ceiling. The gross debt ceiling started at around $75 billion. The government had to increase it to $200 billion, then to $250 billion, and in this latest budget the government has sought to increase the gross debt ceiling to a record $300 billion. All Australians are rightly concerned by this. Why has the government needed to increase the net debt and the gross debt ceiling? It has needed to do so because it has increased the amount it is spending. The government has claimed that it is reducing expenditure, yet we see from this budget an increase in aggregate expenditure of more than $100 billion since the last coalition budget. That is a 40 per cent increase. How does the government propose to pay for all this? Through their 26 new or increased taxes. It will be paid for not only by this generation but also by future generations of Australian taxpayers.


On what will all this money be spent? There was, of course, $2.4 billion spent on a pink batts scheme. That $2.4 billion, if you consider the opportunity costs of the same amount of money, could have been spent on 12 much-needed grade separations on train lines throughout Victoria. The interest payments that will be made in 2015-16 of $8 billion would equate to about 32 railway crossings. Why are railway crossings significant? In my state of Victoria there are still over 172 level crossings; Sydney has just eight. Quite a number of these crossings are located on the Dandenong railway line, which currently serves over a million people and is considered a key area for future population growth. The railway line is a major east-west artery for both people and freight stretching through my electorate and Melbourne's south-eastern suburbs and its industrial parks to the significant commercial hub of Dandenong and the growing residential developments and proposed deepwater port of Hastings. The Victorian government made a submission to Infrastructure Australia. It asked for increased funding to get rid of these railway crossings, noting that the railway corridor contributed $92 billion to GDP in 2007-08, which accounted for roughly half of Melbourne's GDP or nine per cent nationally. The railway line is already operating at or above capacity, resulting in very significant closures of the level crossings.


Within my electorate of Higgins there are three crossings in close proximity to each other: Koornang Road, Carnegie; Murrumbeena Road, Murrumbeena; and Poath Road, Murrumbeena. Their frequent and lengthy closures are severely impacting on pedestrians, car traffic and road freight and having negative consequences for local business, schools, shops and community life. But these are not the only railway crossings in my electorate. Another significant railway crossing that causes concerns for so many of my constituents is the Burke Road crossing, another very significant problem.


The economic benefits of removing these traffic impediments are self-evident. That is why I am helping to promote the RACV's Redspot campaign. Critical infrastructure spending is essential to the nation's productivity growth. This is where the government should be focusing its attention, yet in this budget we see no money for Victoria for these railway crossings. Not one cent was provided of the $16 million which the Victorian government requested in its submission for railway crossing removals in Victoria. Yet in the budget we see that the government found $36 million in extra funding for carbon tax ads. This brings to a total $69.5 million that the government is spending on spinning to the Australian people the benefits of the increased cost of living that will be applied to each and every Australian as a result of their carbon tax from 1 July this year. The government has its priorities all wrong.


We also see from this budget that there has been no security of funding for the school sector. The Gonski review recommended that the government spend an extra $5.5 billion on school funding initiatives in order to revamp the way that school funding is delivered. This was being considered by the government. We see the results of that consideration in this budget. The more than $5 billion in additional funding for schools recommended in the review is not in the budget; there is not even $1 billion for it in the budget. In fact, over two years this government has apportioned an extra $5.8 million to schools funding. There is no security of funding, particularly for those schools in my electorate of Higgins which are concerned about the impact if the government does not continue with the indexation of funding for independent schools. In Higgins, $29 million will be lost to schools, and I have 39 schools in my electorate, all of which will be impacted by the loss of security of school funding if the government does not heed their call—and, of course, it has not. In this budget these schools have been completely ignored.


We can only assume from that that the government has a different plan for school funding; a different plan for the quadrennium of school funding that it will apply beyond the next election. It will involve a hit list on independent schools which, as we know, they have proposed in the past. As an opposition we will strongly oppose this.


In this budget the government has made good on its threats to cut the private health insurance rebate. Again this will increase the cost of living to so many Australian families and so many people in my electorate of Higgins. Seventy-seven per cent of people in my electorate of Higgins have private health insurance funding. This is one of the significant costs in their budget, and the government will be increasing the cost just as it has increased the cost of so many other things—including things as essential as child care. Thanks to the government's changes in regulation, childcare costs—instead of going up by 57c a week as the minister has claimed—have gone up by between $50 and $70 a week. Again, I can only reiterate the point that, on 1 July, with the carbon tax being brought into effect, this will hit not only every Australian but also every Australian business. According to the government's own modelling alone, there will be a 10 per cent increase in electricity costs, which will flow throughout the economy.


Of course, the people of Higgins expect more, and the people of Higgins deserve more. Australians deserve hope, reward and opportunity—which is the coalition's plan. We will not simply talk about delivering a surplus; we have in the past delivered surpluses. This is something that we will do; it is not something we will just talk of doing. The government's claim to deliver a $1.5 billion surplus simply does not add up, particularly when you consider that they have been pulling funding into this year and spending into this year and pushing it out into other years to try to create fictional surplus for 2012-13.


The Australian people will not be spun on this. The Australian people have clearly made a decision on this Prime Minister, on her broken promises and on her budget that was delivered only a number of weeks ago—a budget that has sunk without a trace, and for good reason. It is a budget that the Labor Party do not wish to talk about because it is a budget that highlights their failure in government. We can do better. We will do better. That is why we look forward to the opportunity of governing. We hope that the leadership issues of the government will be resolved and we look forward to the government calling an election at the earliest opportunity.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2012-05-29,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs) (13:02):  The 2012-13 budget is a budget which has delivered a surplus on time, as promised. It is a budget which sets up our country for the future, building a stronger economy and at the same time creating a much fairer community. It is a budget which will spread the wonderful benefits that this country is getting through the mining boom to all Australians—noting that we do have a patchwork economy, where many, particularly in the south-east corner of our country, are not enjoying the benefits of the mining boom to the extent that others are. So this is a budget that will deliver for them.


It is a budget that protects low- and middle-income Australians. It does this by providing more money to families and small businesses and supporting the most vulnerable members of our community, through tax cuts, so that all taxpayers earning up to $80,000 will get a tax cut, including the tripling of the tax-free threshold and increases in the pension for more than 3.4 million pensioners. It is a budget which provides for an increase to family payments. It is a budget which provides the Schoolkids Bonus, which helps families with the costs of their children's education. It is a budget which will help support people who are living on allowances and it will also help people through the parenting payment. It is a budget which will introduce for the first time the historic National Disability Insurance Scheme, which, in the fullness of time, will represent just about the biggest advance in social policy in this country since Medicare. It is a budget which will see a blitz on public dental waiting lists.


I want to talk a little bit about how that broad picture of the budget will apply specifically in my electorate of Corio. In my electorate, 8,550 local families who have school kids will receive $410 in the case of primary school children and $820 in the case of high school children. That adds up to nearly $9 million worth of assistance for families in the electorate of Corio. More than 11,000 local families will receive an increase of up to $600 through family tax benefit A, from 1 July 2013.


Through the minerals resource rent tax we are seeing an increase in superannuation for 42,500 local workers in the Corio electorate. They will see their superannuation increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That is going to add almost $108,000 to the projected retirement income of an average 30-year-old worker. From July, Labor will put up to $500 into the superannuation accounts of 23,500 local workers earning up to $37,000. For 14,600 small businesses in Corio, Labor is giving an instant tax write-off for each purchase of an asset below $6,500—which, again, is one of the many benefits that flow from the minerals resource rent tax. In addition to that, the first $5,000 spent on a new motor vehicle will also be able to be written off.


In addition to those measures, there is also being rolled out as we speak the household assistance package, which will support families with any modest increases in prices which occur as a result of putting a price on carbon. More than 11,300 families in the Corio electorate will receive additional money as a result of the assistance payments. A typical family in my electorate will get $529 through both tax cuts and family assistance payments. In excess of 10,800 family tax benefit recipients in the electorate will receive up to $110 extra a year per child, and 9,200 family tax benefit B recipients will receive up to $69 a year per child. 


More than 26,700 local pensioners will receive—with the rollout beginning yesterday—an increase in their pension. There will be a lump sum of $250 for singles and $380 for couples. From March next year, pensioners will receive another increase in their fortnightly payments which will see in total an increase of $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples.  More than 1,000 local self-funded retirees will receive an extra $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples.


More than 5,000 local job seekers will receive an extra $218 a year for singles and $390 for couples. More than 2,500 students in Corio will get up to $177 extra per year. That amount will depend on the rate and type of payment they get at the moment in terms of supporting their studies, be it Austudy, Abstudy or Youth Allowance. About 46,000 local taxpayers will receive as a result of the household assistance package a tax cut from 1 July. Around 38,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut of at least $300, and 4,000 local residents will pay no tax at all due to the tripling of the tax-free threshold.


All of that represents a concerted effort on the part of this government to tackle two of the great economic challenges facing our nation. The first is to make sure that the enormous benefits which flow to us through the resources boom are there for all Australians, because the essential product of that resources boom—the resources which lie underneath our ground—is owned by all Australians.


The second great challenge is placing a price on carbon so that we can develop an industrial base going forward which is much less dependent upon carbon, in a future world where dependency upon carbon is going to be penalised, and doing that in a way which does not have an impact on low- and middle-income households. They will get through this a package of assistance that will cover, and in some cases more than cover, any increase in costs associated with putting a price on carbon.


This budget and the work that has been done on that comes on the back of a very significant record of achievement on the part of Labor in power since 2007 in relation to the Corio electorate. We have seen an unprecedented level of federal government support and engagement in the electorate of Corio. I want to take a moment to describe some of those. It is a very impressive record of achievement, which is unprecedented in terms of the way federal governments have impacted upon the Corio electorate in the past.


As a result of the Labor government we will see the $3.2 billion regional rail link, which separates regional and metropolitan trains as they enter Melbourne. The City of Geelong has a vital connection with Melbourne, with a growing number of those living in Geelong working in Melbourne. This will see an infinitely more reliable and faster rail service to Melbourne, a service that does not see trains from Geelong and Ballarat caught up in the metropolitan, transit traffic jam that occurs every morning. This is a significant piece of infrastructure that will change the daily lives of working people in Geelong.


There has been $50 million spent on the rail upgrades at Geelong Port, which will make it an easier port to access from both directions and will put a focus on the significance of the port for Geelong's economic future—and that equals jobs. Deakin University's Australian Future Fibres Research and Innovation Centre has had $37 million dollars spent on it. This is a collaboration between Deakin University, CSIRO and the Victorian Centre for Advanced Materials Manufacturing.


We often talk of the old economy and the new economy, and the high-tech manufacturing jobs of the future—making carbon fibre and working with carbon fibre is the high-tech manufacturing of the future. This research centre will have a world's best research furnace for carbon fibre production, which will set up Geelong and our region to be the centre of carbon fibre research, manufacturing and production. This is an investment in future manufacturing jobs. 


We have seen $26 million spent on an integrated cancer care service at Barwon Health. This acknowledges the extent to which Geelong is, in a sense, a regional capital of Victoria's south-west and a really important centre for making sure that health outcomes of those living in regional Australia are the same as those living in our capital cities. We have seen the construction of a fantastic new Australian Taxation Office building in Little Ryrie Street, which is now also the centre for the Department of Human Services in Geelong. This brings together, in one building, all the federal services that the people of Geelong rely on—in a state-of-the-art green building—and employs hundreds of local people.


We have a trade training centre, which I had the pleasure of visiting on its second day of operation, at Northern Bay College. It is a fantastic facility. It provides vocational training in the north of Geelong, where it is so badly needed. Another $4.2 million has been committed to the trade training centres at St Joseph's, Sacred Heart, Clonard and McKillop colleges, the next cluster to receive that benefit. We have seen $62 million provided in assistance to support manufacturing industries across 20 programs. Importantly, we have seen $10 million provided to Simonds Stadium, the home of the Geelong Football Club. It is part of a $46 million build on what is the southern-most stand of that stadium, setting the stadium up to be the most important piece of regional sporting infrastructure in the country.


We have seen $10 million spent on the Geelong Library and the  Heritage Centre, which is a really important spend. It develops the Geelong Library and protects our city's most important and valuable records. Both were funded out of the first round of funding from the Regional Development Australia Fund. Millions of dollars have been spent on road improvements. This includes an announcement made a couple of weeks ago of $390,000 to fix four black spots in our city. Expenditure of $2.8 million has been made on five stormwater harvesting projects so that we can be much smarter in the way we use our water. A legacy of the drought is that we are now using our water in a much cleverer way. This will set us up for the next time we go through a dry patch. There has been $3.1 million spent on the renovation of the iconic Eastern Beach complex in Geelong, which is really one of the most important historical venues that we have in Geelong. It is a place which, to this day, is a gathering spot, particularly in the summer, for so many of our citizens to enjoy Corio Bay. A smaller amount of money but just as important, $391,000, has been spent on the Kardinia Park netball complex upgrade. Looking forward, there will potentially be an upgrade of the Point Wilson Waterside Infrastructure Project. Point Wilson pier is the only major ordnance pier that we have in Australia. Remediating Point Wilson is a high priority of this government. The wharf there is the sole Defence facility in the country which is capable of receiving strategic imports of explosive ordnance. This project is a long-term strategic investment that will extend the life of the wharf through to 2055.


Our government has faced the global financial crisis and steered our country through it such that we have the best economy in the developed world. Our government has faced the patchwork economy, an enormous challenge, and is spreading the benefits of the mining boom to all parts of Australia. We have a plan to do both. We have done that in the face of relentless negativity on the part of the opposition, which does nothing other than appeal to the darker angels of our nature and deny any innate optimism that exists amongst Australians to see a bright future ahead. This is not what Australians will respond to. What the Labor government is providing is a sense of hope and a sense of strategy about taking our country forward.

"Matheson, Russell, MP",LP,2012-05-29,"



Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (13:17):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 representing the people of Macarthur on what can only be described as a bad budget. The people of Macarthur are honest, hardworking people who want nothing but the best for their children and future generations of our community. They have high hopes for a strong economy which will provide more jobs and opportunities for all Australians. While they are working hard to pay off their mortgages and balance the family budget, they are becoming fed up with a government that continues with its wasteful spending and incompetence.


While the people of Macarthur are trying to decrease their debt and reduce their credit limits, this government has increased the nation's credit card by $50 billion—from $250 billion to $300 billion. It has been only five short years since Labor came to office in 2007 inheriting a debt of zero. It is no wonder the people of Macarthur are fed up with a government which has continued to borrow more than $100 million a day. In 18 months, the government's estimated deficit for 2011-12 has blown out from $12 billion to $44 billion—and the year is not even over yet. This is the fourth Labor deficit in four years. Together, Labor's deficits total $174 billion. Interest payments on Labor's debt are set to reach an alarming $8 billion per year—that is $22 million a day on interest payments alone. Who do they think is going to pay off this debt? The debt will be there for our children and future generations of Australians to pay off. It is just not good enough.


The people of Macarthur can see through the spin surrounding this budget—a budget which includes the world's biggest carbon tax, cynical bribes to soften the impact of a tax, broken promises on corporate tax cuts, higher unemployment, blow-outs in the cost of border protection, an underfunded NDIS, and equity funding for the NBN which has been kept off budget. In headline cash terms, the Gillard government will spend $8.7 billion more than it earns in 2012-13. The government continues to spend on projects such as the NBN, which has been taken off budget. If this government was honest and included the NBN expenditure, the budget would show deficits over the next three years. To put it simply, there would be no surplus if the NBN was on the books.


In fact, by bringing forward just two programs—the back-to-school payment and the Commonwealth grants to local government—the government artificially saves more than $1.5 billion in 2012-13. Honest budget treatment of these two programs alone would wipe out the Treasurer's wafer-thin surplus. When will this government learn that cooking the books is no substitute for good, solid economic management? Let us face it, the Treasurer lives in 'Wayne's world'. His forecast of a $1.5 billion surplus is a mirage. The harder you look at it, the more you realise it just does not exist. Even if the Treasurer does deliver on his razor-thin surplus, Australia will need more than 93 years of the Treasurer's surpluses to repay all the waste and mismanagement created by this Treasurer. It is the families in my electorate who are feeling the pinch from this government's waste and mismanagement. The rising cost of living is a major factor affecting families, pensioners, self-funded retirees, small businesses and homeowners in Macarthur. Many have contacted my office concerned about the impacts of the carbon tax on electricity and grocery bills. Things will only get worse with the world's biggest carbon tax set to hit families, jobs and investment very soon. The budget papers confirm that, despite falling international prices, the carbon tax will go up to $29 a tonne in just three years, and an additional $36 million will be spent on taxpayer funded carbon tax advertising over the next two years. This tax will affect the entire economy. The price of everything will go up and up. Families will be hit hard. Small businesses, which are the engine room of our economy, will receive no compensation for the carbon tax.


The people of Macarthur are against this tax. They are unsure and anxious about its effect on their weekly bills, and they are angry after being misled by the Prime Minister, who said days before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. The Treasurer did not mention the carbon tax once in his budget speech or indeed in the budget papers. He makes a glib passing reference to a carbon price but tells people not to worry about it, that it is no big deal—a tax with the single greatest impost on the family budget of every household in Macarthur. Even the Prime Minister's initial compensation package did not make a dent in the angst felt by the community.


Families in Macarthur are already paying for the highest electricity prices in the world. Now that we are heading into winter, this government will be forcing older residents on fixed incomes to spend their evenings in the dark and cold because they will not be able to afford to use their heaters or to turn on the lights. What would the Treasurer say to 60-year-old Mrs Schuit, who contacted my office last week? Mrs Schuit survives week to week by eating once a day, cooking once a week and showering every second day to keep her electricity and water bills down. Come 1 July, Mrs Schuit will be hit by the carbon tax, stretching what little finances she has even further. I would like to know: when did electricity become a luxury in this country, and when did having hot water suddenly become aspirational? People on fixed incomes, such as pensioners like Mrs Schuit, self-funded retirees, single mothers and people with a disability will be the hardest hit of all by the carbon tax. The base carbon price will continue to rise, but their compensation will not.


Now the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have resorted to desperately buying back votes from mums and dads with their schoolkids bonus sugar hit, a vain attempt to hide the true effects of the carbon tax. The Treasurer has pushed this payment into the 2011-12 financial year to protect his wafer-thin surplus. This is treating Australian families with contempt—throwing cash to them with one hand and taking away even more with the other. All seniors, students, couples and pensioners will miss out on this new cash splash, and families are not the only ones who will do it tough as a result of this budget.


This budget offers nothing more to 800 small businesses in Macarthur who will also be hit with the world's biggest carbon tax. The government has offered nothing new in this budget to provide immediate relief to struggling businesses. The sector is seeing a 48 per cent increase in insolvencies. I have met with many small-business owners in Macarthur recently who are fed up with all the broken promises, because every one of the government's broken promises will affect their livelihoods. First there was the broken promise not to introduce a carbon tax, and now there is a broken promise to cut the company tax rate.


Carbon tax related sweeteners in the form of accelerated depreciation allowances are not fooling anyone. These allowances are going to rely on small businesses having ready cash to spend on new capital items. The government's abolition of the entrepreneurs tax offset has increased tax for nearly 370,000 of our smallest businesses, including micro, home based, independent contractor and start-up businesses with incomes of less than $70,000 or $80,000 year. The local corner shop in Macarthur is not only going to have to deal with an increase in the cost of supplies and electricity but also going to have pressure from consumers looking for a bargain as the cost of living increases and unemployment rises, as forecast at in the budget.


Last year's budget promised 500,000 new jobs over two years, but the government now expects to miss its target by 300,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is forecast to increase to 5.5 per cent while the government is cutting $200 million of job services programs. Even the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:


The decision to abandon the company tax cut is dripping with politics and a low blow to the business sector …


The chamber also said that this budget lacks vision for the broader economy.


I hold grave concerns for the future of small business in Macarthur. These local mums and dads will be hit the hardest because their costs will go up and up when the carbon price goes up and up. They will not receive a single cent in compensation. The coalition has a clear roadmap to restore hope, reward and opportunity for small business by scrapping the carbon tax and getting out of the way of business by slashing $1 billion worth of red tape. We believe in a hand up, not a hand out and in rewarding those who work hard to earn a living and support their families. While the much needed infrastructure projects in Macarthur do not rate a mention in this budget, the Treasurer does manage to promise preliminary economic, social and environmental studies into the sustainability of Wilton as a site for a second Sydney airport. The prospect of a second Sydney airport has been brewing in the background of Australian politics for well over 30 years, and the people of Badgerys Creek and Wilton have fought against it time and time again, and for good reason. The member for Throsby has been quoted in the Illawarra Mercury as saying:


While … there are environmental challenges—


and that is a huge understatement—


with the Wilton site, I can also see enormous economic benefits for our region.


It sounds like code for 'I support an airport at Wilton' to me. I dare say that any economic benefits would be entirely negated by the massive cost for both the federal and New South Wales governments if Sydney's water supply were contaminated. The 1985 Kinhill Stearns report clearly ruled out Wilton as a possible site for an airport because of the highly sensitive nature of the water catchment area. The development of an airport at Wilton would pose an extremely serious threat to the long-term quality and integrity of Sydney's drinking water supply. As the New South Wales state member for Wollondilly, Jai Rowell, said, what is spilt on the ground in Wilton ends up in our water supplies. The March 2012 Joint study on aviation capacity for the Sydney region identified that:


… the Wilton site … appears to have a partial overlap with a designated Mine Subsidence District and all these sites are underlain by coal measures which are actively being mined …


So questions need to be asked: why would the infrastructure minister decide to place an airport on land affected by mine subsidence, and where will Sydney get its drinking water if Warragamba Dam, Nepean Dam, Avon Dam and Cordeaux Dam are compromised?


The people of Macarthur have also been short-changed when it comes to the promised National Disability Insurance Scheme. While I understand that progress has been made with the NDIS, the government has allocated only $1 billion over four years when the Productivity Commission has said that in that time frame $3.9 billion is needed. That is $2.9 billion less than what is needed for the start-up years of the NDIS. I find it concerning and disappointing, and I think a lot of people living with a disability in Macarthur and their families will be feeling short-changed. The Productivity Commission also proposed that the NDIS would cover 400,000 Australians. The government's budget announced that it would only extend to 20,000 Australians. Based on the budget figures, full implementation of the scheme by the Productivity Commission's target date of 2018 will not happen. This budget has let down the residents of Macarthur who are living with a disability, and their families and carers. The government will be spending more each financial year—$8 billion—on debt and interest costs than it will spend in total over the next four years on the NDIS. The government has already rejected the coalition's offer to develop a joint parliamentary committee chaired by both the coalition and Labor Party spokespeople on disabilities. This would ensure that the NDIS is kept above politics so it can survive through the three election cycles it will take to be fully implemented.


I would also like to talk about the seniors in my electorate, who are forgotten in this budget. In this budget self-funded retirees will not receive a single cent of compensation to assist with the imposed damage of the carbon tax. In fact, this budget makes life much more difficult for self-funded retirees by reducing the higher tax concessions for super contributions of higher income earners. It also defers a higher concessional contributions cap for over-50s with less than $500,000 in superannuation. This government has also made it difficult for self-funded retirees to meet their medical costs by introducing means testing of the medical expenses tax offset. The incentive for mature age workers to remain in the workforce has also been removed by phasing out the $500 mature age worker tax offset. Of the $66.9 million allocated to the new Economic Potential of Senior Australians program, only $10 million is set aside to assist mature age workers to gain employment in the workforce. This program pays $1,000 to an employer who takes on a mature age worker for three months, compared to the coalition's policy, which would pay $3,250 to an employer who takes on a mature age worker from the welfare system and employs them for a minimum of six months. The remaining $56.9 million has been allocated to talking about the problem of discrimination, not fixing it, with things like an advisory panel to discuss legislation for positive ageing.


This is just another example of this government's waste and mismanagement, but the waste is nothing new to this government. A local newspaper in my electorate has labelled the National Broadband Network a 'flop' for the people of Macarthur. The NBN, which the Treasurer has left off the books this year, has become the laughing-stock of the developed world. People will be paying three times as much for their internet to use speeds that a majority of the population are not going to need, and no thought has been given to prioritising areas that either do not have broadband or have inadequate services. On top of this, the government will spend $20 million on a propaganda campaign about the NBN to paint over the waste and mismanagement of the $50 billion project—that is, if it does cost $50 billion to complete. Some are estimating that it could cost between $60 billion and $80 billion. To make matters worse, this week the Australian newspaper reported that foreign controlled companies have been awarded 82c in every dollar's worth of contracts struck for Labor's National Broadband Network, sparking warnings that local industry is being bypassed in Australia's biggest infrastructure project. Shame. The coalition will continue to hold the government to account on the NBN. We will also continue to develop our alternative broadband policy, which will improve the quality and availability of broadband for all Australians.


The coalition also has great plans for Australian school students and will revive foreign languages in schools to help unlock the potential offered by the Asian century. Within a decade, we want to see 40 per cent of all year 12 students in Macarthur and across Australia studying a foreign language. The proportion of year 12 students studying a foreign language has dropped from about 40 per cent in the 1960s to around 12 per cent today. Knowing the language of our major trading partners—China, Japan, Korea and India—is essential to unlocking the potential of the Asian century for Australia. We believe that, starting in preschool, every student should have an exposure to foreign languages. This is part of the coalition's positive plan for our economy, and I am looking forward to working with students and schools in Macarthur to ensure that this plan to revitalise foreign languages in schools becomes a reality.


I am proud to be part of a coalition that has an alternative to this Labor incompetency. We will restore hope, reward and opportunity for all Australians, we will restore good economic management and we will end the waste. We will repeal the carbon tax and stop Labor's attack on the family budget. Only in a growing economy is it possible to have lower taxes, better services and a stronger budget bottom line, as Australians discovered during the Howard era. Under a coalition government, there will be tax cuts without a carbon tax but we will find the savings to pay for them. From an economic perspective, the worst aspect of this budget is that there is no plan for economic growth, and nothing whatsoever to promote investment or employment. The coalition will ensure Australia has a vigorous five-pillar economy, strong manufacturing, vibrant agriculture, growing knowledge based industries and resilient service sectors as well as a mining industry. We will restore Australia to its rightful place in the world.


I join my colleagues here today who are disappointed in this government and its budget. Like the people of Macarthur, I am frustrated because I know there is a better way. I have seen it before—a strong economy which supports all Australians. But to achieve this we need an election so that a coalition government can put policy in place that will see our country and its peoples prosper. The coalition will reward innovation, not punish those Australians who contribute so greatly to our nation. We will restore opportunity for all Australians, young and old, and we will restore hope in our nation's future. The people of Macarthur have a bright future ahead of them under a coalition government. That is something I am very sure of. (Time expired)

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (13:32):  In speaking today on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2012-2013 and related bills, I would like to focus on the critical failure of governance associated with the influence of the union movement and union officials on Australia's $1.35 trillion superannuation sector. I want to make three points. Firstly, we have seen a governance scandal at the Health Services Union, and that has clearly spilled over into governance in the superannuation sector. Secondly, the problem is broader than just the Health Services Union. Thirdly, I want to note that the recent Cooper review into superannuation recommended substantial reforms to superannuation governance but the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, Bill Shorten, has done nothing about it.


Let me turn, firstly, to the governance scandal at the Health Services Union. The former national secretary of that union is the subject of an 1,100-page report by Fair Work Australia detailing multiple breaches of the union rules. Another senior Health Services union official, Michael Williamson, has been the subject of serious corruption allegations. The partner of the current Health Services Union National Secretary, Kathy Jackson, has written to police complaining about what is happening at the Health Services Union. The most obvious victims of the mismanagement and poor governance at the Health Services Union are the unfortunate members of that union.


Another group of Australians should be very concerned: those whose retirement savings are in the hands of Health Services Union officials appointed as directors of superannuation funds. Thanks to deeply flawed governance arrangements put in place by the Keating government, union officials have a privileged place in running superannuation funds. Health Services Union boss, Michael Williamson, was until recently a director of First State Super, a fund with $30 billion under management for some 70,000 current and former New South Wales public servants. He was appointed to that position by Unions New South Wales. Last month, the Chairman of First State Super complained that he had no power to remove Williamson as a trustee. Three other current Health Services Union officials are directors of superannuation funds. Peter Mylan, who is the assistant secretary of the New South Wales Health Services Union and a man recently described in the Australian as 'a long time Williamson loyalist', is also on the board of First State Super, appointed by Unions NSW. HESTA, which is a fund with $18.3 billion of superannuation savings for people working in the health industry, has two Health Services Union officials appointed by that union to the board of HESTA: Rosemary Kelly and Lloyd Williams.


Then we could look at former directors of superannuation funds appointed by the Health Services Union. Until recently there was another superannuation fund called Health Super and, before it recently merged into First State Super, Health Services Union official David Langmead served on its board. Until last year, Kathy Jackson, National Secretary of the Health Services Union, was a director of HESTA, and Craig Thomson, the former National Secretary of the Health Services Union and the current member for Dobell, is also a former director of HESTA. 


Let us just remind ourselves of what the current member for Dobell had to say about Kathy Jackson's appointment as a director of HESTA. He said:


She sat on the board of HESTA, collecting board fees for many years, rarely attending meetings. But when the union decided the board fee should go to the union, she left the board.


I do not know whether or not that allegation is correct. But I do think it is instructive as an insight into the mindset of one former union official, the current member for Dobell, about the status of board appointments to superannuation funds.


It is deeply troubling that so many officials of a union whose affairs have become a byword for corruption, mismanagement and failure of governance are able to be appointed by that union to roles as directors of superannuation funds where they have the responsibility to oversee the retirement savings of tens of thousands of Australians, many of whom are not members of the Health Services Union or any other union. The Health Services Union scandal shows what happens when union officials are more interested in looking after themselves than in serving their members.


I want to come to the second proposition put before the House this afternoon: that this is a broader problem, which extends beyond the Health Services Union. There are dozens of superannuation funds that have up to half of their directors directly appointed by a union and hence there is the real risk that, if a union is infected by a 'look after your mates' culture, this in turn can infect governance in the superannuation sector.


One troubling indicator is the number of superannuation funds that do not disclose the fees they pay to their directors. Of the 16 funds which brand themselves as 'industry super', fewer than half of them disclose the fees paid to individual directors in their most recent annual reports. Another indicator that something is wrong here is the number of current or former union officials doing very nicely from serving on the boards of multiple superannuation funds. Michael Williamson of the Health Services Union, whom I mentioned before, was recently reported in the Sydney Morning Herald to earn a $330,000 a year salary, in addition to $150,000 from his various board positions, such as First State Super. 


Mr Williamson is not the only follower of this particular career strategy. Consider, for example, Mr Bob Henricks, a former Queensland secretary of the Electrical Trades Union and CEO of Energy Super, a Queensland based fund with net assets of $3.8 billion. He was also Chairman of SPEC Super, until it recently merged into Energy Super, and he is also Chairperson of AUST(Q) Super. None of these funds in their annual reports disclose the fees paid to Mr Henricks as a director but, when you add up those fees across multiple funds, they are likely to be significant.


Another interesting case study is that of Mr Bernie Riordan, until recently the head of the Electrical Trades Union in New South Wales. Last year the Sunday Telegraphreported that he earns nearly $400,000 a year from a combination of his union job and directorships of three superannuation funds and businesses: Energy Industries Superannuation Scheme, FuturePlus Financial Services, and Chifley Financial Services, and one other company.


Let us look at another fund where there has been a profound governance problem. Vision Super in Victoria, formerly known as Local Government Super, was supposed to be merging with Equip Super, the fund which covers employees in the Victorian electricity and power sector. It has recently been announced that the merger is off. The difficulty seems to have been that it ran smack bang into the politics of the Australian Services Union, which dominates Vision Super. Equipsuper has elected member representatives, which is a good thing, but Vision Super has its four so-called member representatives directly appointed by the Australian Services Union. The merged entity was supposed to have elected member representatives, but it seems that ASU officials were very unhappy when a member of the Equipsuper fund—somebody who happened to be a senior manager at a power company, somebody who had formerly been an employer-appointed director of Equipsuper—chose to seek election as a board member of the merged super fund.


A letter was circulated to ASU members by ASU state secretary Brian Parkinson. Let me read from some of what he had to say. He said:


Voting has now commenced for the election of two member elected directors to serve on the Equipsuper board. 


As expected, employers are seeking election to workers' positions. Indeed, one such individual, John Azaris (General Manager—Operations and Services at SP Ausnet), has exploited his senior management role to frustrate the election chances of ASU candidates. 


To illustrate this point, I wish to bring this one incident to your attention. SP Ausnet management allowed Azaris, a current employer director at Equipsuper, to use it's email system to promote his candidacy as a member director. When an endorsed ASU candidate employed there (with almost 40 years of service to the company) sought to use the same service, he was refused on the most flimsy of pretexts. Management will pull out all the stops to see one of their own elected at the expense of workers. 


These are the sort of unfair tricks we can expect from management. It is a disgrace. Workers such as yourself need to send a clear message to management to keep their hands off Equipsuper.


It seems that Mr Parkinson, who, as well as being ASU state secretary is also a director of Vision Super, was unhappy that the Australian Services Union was not going to have a guaranteed number of union appointed directors to the board of the merged entity. But his letter reveals that he has fundamentally misconceived his duties as a director of Vision Super. The selection of directors of a superannuation fund, to take on the vital task of stewarding the collective retirement wealth of members of the fund, has nothing to do with outdated class-war rhetoric about workers and bosses.


We could look at reported difficulties in the Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund. According to a recent report in the Australian this union invested some $30 million in a property company called Austcorp, before the company collapsed in May 2009 with almost all of the $30 million being lost. According to the Australian, Austcorp paid tens of thousands of dollars to a Mr Wally Curran, described as 'a legendary unionist, former long-time secretary of the Meatworkers Union and a long-serving trustee director of the Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund.' If you look at the most recent annual report of that fund, you will see that he was listed as a director. According to the article, Mr Curran is 80 years old and a former communist. 


It is an obvious question: is Mr Curran a suitable person to be managing a superannuation fund which has $550 million of assets? Does he have the qualifications, skills and ability to separate what is in his personal interests from what is in the interests of members of the fund? But if this question can be asked about Mr Curran or Mr Parkinson—or Mr Williamson, of whom I have earlier spoken—how many other union officials on superannuation fund boards can it be asked of? If you take the 67 funds listed by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority as industry or public sector funds, there are 170 directors appointed directly by a union or a union peak body such as the ACTU. The majority of these people have as their day job that of being a union official. For example, the four union appointed directors on TWUSuper are the national secretary and the three state secretaries of the Transport Workers Union. 


Let me turn to the third point I wish to make, which is that the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and the Gillard government have failed to implement the reforms recommended in the Cooper review to address the governance problems that I have spoken of. The minister, Bill Shorten, has done some window-dressing recently, announcing a package of measures that will, amongst other things, require funds to disclose the remuneration of directors. That is a good thing, but in both his reform package and in the legislation dealing with the obligations of directors of trustee companies of superannuation funds, which went through this House last week, the minister made no attempt to deal with key recommendations from the recent Cooper review dealing with the governance of superannuation funds.


Those recommendations include that disclosure of conflict of interest should be mandatory; that directors must properly disclose their remuneration in line with the provisions that apply to publicly listed companies; that the so-called equal representation model—which is code for the unions having a privileged role in the governance of superannuation funds—should no longer be mandatory; that where equal representation does apply there should be at least one third of the directors on the board who are independent; and that directors who want to sit on multiple boards must demonstrate to APRA that they do not have any foreseeable conflicts of interest.


As I have demonstrated, there is plenty of evidence that union officials regard being on the board of a superannuation fund as a nice little extra benefit that comes as part of the package of being an official. There is troubling evidence that some do not understand their fiduciary obligations to members of the superannuation fund—obligations which have nothing to do with their position as a union official and which are quite separate and which are legally binding. Unfortunately, Minister Shorten has done nothing to solve this problem. He is, I note, himself a former union official and a former director of an industry superannuation fund—one of the predecessors of AustralianSuper—as are two other Labor parliamentarians former directors of AustralianSuper, Greg Combet and Senator Doug Cameron, and as was Labor's failed candidate for Melbourne in the 2010 elections, Cath Bowtell.


The current arrangements suit the union movement and individual union officials very well. They are not, however, in the interests of the millions of Australians who are members of superannuation funds which have union officials appointed to the board, because those fund members get no say in that appointment and, in many cases, those fund members are not members of the union.


The evidence is very clear: there is a profound governance problem in superannuation. Last week the minister said that he was 'appalled' about the HSU scandal. I could not help being reminded of Captain Reynaud in Casablanca, who was 'shocked' to discover that there was gambling going on, and promised to 'round up the usual suspects'. It is time to end the window-dressing. It is time for Minister Shorten to deal with this serious problem. (Time expired)


Debate adjourned.
