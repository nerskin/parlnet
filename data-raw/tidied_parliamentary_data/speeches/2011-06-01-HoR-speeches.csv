Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (09:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I am pleased to present legislation that delivers on the government’s budget measures to help support our veteran community. These measures further improve the operation of Australia’s repatriation system and provide special recognition to those Australians who were prisoners of war. The 2011-12 budget reflects the government’s ongoing commitment to more than 360,000 veterans and their families.


The bill will introduce a new payment for surviving Australian prisoners of war (POWs) recognising the hardships these men and women endured. More than 30,000 Australians became prisoners during the Second World War and the Korean War.


We have all heard of the hardships these men and women endured during captivity.


Subject to extremely harsh conditions and deprivation, many have lived with physical and psychological scars for decades. All in the service of their country. It is expected that around 900 former POWs will benefit from the payment. This bill introduces a new payment of $500 per fortnight which will be known as the prisoner of war recognition supplement. The supplement will be payable from 20 September 2011 with the first payment being made on 6 October 2011. Payments will begin automatically for former POWs known to the department. The supplement will be payable in addition to any existing benefits the person receives from the Commonwealth. It will be exempt income for the purposes of income tax and for the purposes of the veterans entitlements and social security income tests.


Further amendments in the bill will affirm the longstanding arrangements under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act for compensation offsetting. Offsetting is intended to prevent double payments of compensation. This can happen when a veteran or member is eligible for compensation for the same incapacity under different schemes.


This bill will clarify the longstanding compensation offsetting arrangements that have been in place in the repatriation system since 1973. This follows a full Federal Court decision which highlighted the need to clarify the legislation. It does not vary the disability pension for any veteran.


Finally, the bill will rationalise and better target payments for veterans and members who are undergoing treatment for war or defence caused injuries or diseases. There is currently an overlap in the allowances paid to veterans and members who are unable to work due to episodes of medical treatment and recuperation for war or defence caused injuries or diseases. This bill will better target payments through the loss of earnings allowance. Abolishing the temporary incapacity allowance ensures individuals are recompensed where there is actual loss of income. It has no impact on a veteran or member’s existing disability payment. From 20 September 2011, all eligible veterans and members in this situation will be assessed consistently against the criteria for the loss of earnings allowance.


This government is committed to streamlining and enhancing the services and support that our veterans, members and their families so rightly deserve.


Debate adjourned.

Mr CRAIG THOMSON
 (Dobell) (09:05):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics I present the committee's report entitled Advisory report on the taxation of alternative fuels bills 2011, incorporating a dissenting report, together with the minutes of the proceedings.


In accordance with standing order 39(f), the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr CRAIG THOMSON:
  by leave—This is a report into four government bills that affect the tax treatment of alternative fuels. Three of the bills apply an excise on liquid petroleum gas, compressed natural gas and liquid natural gas. The fuels were not previously subject to excise, which will now be applied at 50 per cent of that applied to petrol. The fourth bill continues a grant scheme for the next 10 years where the amount of the grant offsets the amount of excise levied on biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. The majority on the committee support these bills, and it is worth looking at what some people have said about the proposal that goes with them. I go back to May 2003, when the then Treasurer—the former member for Higgins, Peter Costello—announced the then government's alternative fuels tax arrangements as an long-term important reform, saying, 'Australia must have a more consistent and sustainable fuel tax regime.' In December 2003, the then Prime Minister, John Howard, said, 'These reforms will result in a more consistent and neutral tax regime for fuels used in vehicles.' The then Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, at the same time emphasised the importance of investment certainty and that the measures then introduced would achieve that certainty in an identical manner to the way in which it will be achieved by the bills considered by the committee in the present report. Furthermore, Mr Costello stated in his press release:



… 
today I am announcing important long term reforms to the excise treatment of fuels
. The reforms establish a broad 
sustainable taxation framework for fuels, by addressing a number of anomalies in the current fuel tax system and providing increased long term certainty for investors, while meeting Government commitments and providing time for industry to adjust.



You will not often see me get up here and say that the former Prime Minister was right, that the former Treasurer was right or that the former Deputy Prime Minister was right; but they were absolutely right about those reforms and the effect they would have. Today we have an absolute policy vacuum on the other side. The member for Moncrieff, the deputy chair, who is going to speak next, and particularly the current member for Higgins,-who was an adviser to the former Treasurer at the time those reforms were introduced, must really be severely conflicted about what they are going to say here today in opposing the bills that the committee considered.


These bills are in the national interest. They had bipartisan support. The former government thought they were necessary. But because we now have Mr No in charge of the opposition, good public policy on these issues does not matter anymore; those on the other side are just saying no to the sake of saying no and this is probably the worst example we have seen of the positions that the Leader of the Opposition forces them to take. It does not matter what the issue is now, whether the former Treasurer introduced identical reforms to the ones in these bills or whether the former Prime Minister was a strong advocate of the reforms in these bills; those on the other side say, 'We're not going to support them because we don't support anything that the government puts up.' It is an absolute disgrace that they are taking this position on Australia's long-term fuel interests and trying to score a cheap political point. What is more, it is hypocritical. We hear day after day about the government's not being able to make cuts to the budget, to the deficit and to the bottom line, but this budget measure saves over $500 million, and what are those on the other side saying? They are saying, 'No, you shouldn't do it.' Hang your heads in shame—the position that you are adopting on these bills is disgraceful.


How can the member for Higgins come into this place and, for the sake of political expediency and supporting an opposition leader who will say no to anything, oppose these bills, despite having worked for the former Treasurer and given him advice that his reforms were good policy? It is unbelievable that we are in this situation, and it is a great shame that hangs over the heads of the opposition. We even have the unusual situation of Senator Minchin, who is not known for great policy development—in fact, his position is probably best characterised as extremely pragmatic and political—saying that this legislation should be supported by those on the other side. So a long history of bipartisanship on the way in which the measures in these bills should be dealt with is being trashed completely because those on the other side are not interested in what is good for the Australian people, in what is good for this industry or in making sure that we set up a fair regime for alternative fuels. All they are interested in is saying no and opposing what this government wants to do to make sure that Australia is better placed on these alternative fuels and on our budget bottom line.


These are important pieces of legislation, and both we and those on the other side have known the implications of them since 2003; they have not suddenly been rushed on the parliament. The Prime Minister and the former Treasurer made their statements in 2003 and set in place the policies that these bills are trying to implement, and it is an absolute disgrace that some eight years later we are seeing a complete reversal and a complete absence of policy from those opposite. The only argument that they are going to put forward here today is that it is going to affect cost-of-living issues. They are now going to try to mount another scare campaign on what is essentially their own policy, undermining it by arguing that these measures are going to affect consumers in their adjustment to the cost of living. Where is that cost-of-living adjustment going to come about? They are going to say that taxis will be more expensive, but the increase on an average $20 taxi fare, if it is passed on by the various state governments who regulate the cost of taxis, will be about 80c. So, for the sake of the opposition's attacking and undermining Australia's sensible budget and fiscal stance and undermining policy on alternative fuels, we are having an argument about 80c in a taxi fare.


The opposition stand condemned for their persistent negativity about any bill that comes here, particularly these three bills. The majority of the committee—the government members on the committee—took the sensible approach, advocated by the former Prime Minister Mr Howard, the former Treasurer Mr Costello and the former Deputy Prime Minister Mr Anderson and supported by Senator Minchin. The government has taken the sensible approach. The government members on the committee recommend these bills to the House, and that recommendation is contained in this report.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (09:14):  by leave—Mr Speaker, I would like to start on a positive note and say it is good to see you in the chair today after what occurred yesterday. I turn to the subject of the debate before the House, and that is the report that came from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. It was interesting to note the passion that the chairman of the committee had with respect to this particular report and the passion that he had about defending the integrity of the government's budget position. I must say that for members on this side of the House it was a little bemusing. The reason it was bemusing is that the lecture that we got for five minutes from the chairman of the committee was about the importance of budget integrity. The lecture from the chairman of the committee was about how this was coalition policy and how it ought not be changed.


The interesting thing about that for all members of the coalition is that this came from a member of the Labor Party whose Prime Minister sits at the table and, only eight days out from the election, swore black and blue that there would not be a carbon tax under the government that she would lead, and then, seven days later, changed her position. So I say to Labor Party members: if you want to lecture us about changes in position, why don't you address the fact that you had a change in eight days as opposed to our change, which was years and years later and reflects one very fundamental aspect—that is, this is not the time for this change. The reason it is not the time for this change is that there are families across this country facing some very difficult choices. They are facing hard choices because the government has presided over a massive increase in the cost of living.


I noticed as well that the chairman of the committee almost fobbed off the very genuine and real concerns of struggling working families. Members opposite, do you remember those struggling working families in Western Sydney who have to budget to the last dollar? The member opposite completely fobs off their concerns and says, 'This is about 80c on a $20 cab fare.' That is exceptionally disingenuous. For example, we know that there is a fleet of some 700,000 vehicles that have been converted to LPG or run on LPG. The taxi component of the 700,000 vehicles is 18,000, so there are about 682,000 vehicles out there that are not taxis and have been converted to run on LPG because families need to embrace the savings. The evidence that was put to the committee demonstrated that those people would be slugged with an extra $250 to $500 a year as a result of this policy change. That is the reason why the coalition will stand up for those families; that is the reason why the coalition will not support this change. But it is about more than that. It is also because the reforms that the government has laid out will see increases in CNG and LNG. The most vulnerable people in our society are going to be slugged with this new tax.


Government members stand up and say: 'But this is about protecting budget integrity. Why won't the coalition be with us? There are savings of $500 million, or thereabouts.' No, there are not. Do not use economic jargon in here and say that this is about savings of $500 million. Let's call it what it is: a direct tax slug of nearly half a billion dollars. The government say, 'Where is the coalition?' I will tell you where the coalition is: we stand against higher taxes. That is where we are. We stand against this kind of activity because it is about taking money straight out of the pockets of the most vulnerable in our society. That is why we turn our backs on this. We turn our backs on this because the government need to get their house in shape, the government need to make policy changes and the government need to make savings. We will then consider what we can do to have policy integrity, but it will not be through the sweat off the brow of working families in Western Sydney. It will not be off their sweat; it will be because the government start to tighten their belt. When the government do that, we will be serious about so-called policy integrity.


I must say that there is one aspect of this that we are comfortable with. We are very happy to support the fourth bill. That particular bill goes to ensuring that there is equitable treatment when it comes to ethanol and other alternative fuels like biodiesel. We are supportive of that. It is not all about 'No, no, no,' despite what the Labor Party say. We are happy for that bill to go through, but that requires the government to do something. It requires the government to stop being quite so tricky. It requires the government to recognise that the first three bills need to be put to one side and then the final bill will be passed by the House. At the moment, the government are into playing tricky games and are insisting that all four bills be passed or none be passed. As the coalition and the dissenting members of the committee said, we are happy to support the passage of the fourth bill, but we will oppose the first three.


I call upon the member opposite to take that message back. He and all Labor members need to concern themselves with the passage of the fourth bill, which is the one for which time is of the essence—that one can go through the House and up to the Senate—or they can stand in their tricky political way against all four bills and refuse to allow them to go through. We will not support that. We make no apology for the fact that we will stand up for those Western Sydney families, we will stand up for those 700,000 vehicles that have been converted to LPG and, most importantly, we will stand up for the environment. The reason we will stand up for the environment is that we know that this policy will make environmentally-friendly vehicles—those vehicles with a smaller carbon footprint—less attractive. This government policy will see the emphasis return to traditional fossil fuels. This government policy will see the hundreds of millions of dollars that has been invested in the conversion of vehicles from traditional fossil fuels to, for example, LPG effectively junked.


I reinforce the point to the chamber and, through the broadcast, to those listening. Remember that it is the coalition that stands for a smaller carbon footprint, it is the coalition that stands for being environmentally-friendly and it is the coalition, through its position on this bill, that will stand up for those who are trying to do the right thing by the planet. The coalition and all the members of the coalition on this committee stand by our dissenting report because we know that we will look after working families and we will look after the environment. We still allow passage of the bill for which time is of the essence, but we remain steadfastly opposed to the first three bills because they are wrong for Australia at the wrong time. In fact, tax reform needs to be part of a comprehensive energy platform.

Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide—Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (09:22):  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all members for their contributions on this debate. The government's Building Australia's Future Workforce reforms represent a long-term investment in Australia's economy through building the education, the skills and the employment prospects of the Australian workforce. An important part of these reforms is directed towards providing greater incentives for parents, particularly single parents, to engage in the workforce to reduce their reliance on welfare and to provide their family with a better future underpinned by secure and rewarding employment. The Social Security Amendment (Parenting Payment Transitional Arrangement) Bill 2011 represents the first stage of the income support payment reforms contained in the Building Australia's Future Workforce package. This bill is a positive step towards reducing the inequity which exists within the legislative structure of parenting payment.


Under current arrangements recipients of parenting payment are treated differently based upon when they first applied for the payment. This inequity dates back to the 2006 Welfare to Work reforms which allowed for recipients who had applied for the payment prior to July 2006 to stay on parenting payment for up to 10 years longer than those parents who applied for payment after 1 July 2006. From July 2006 persons who claimed parenting payment can only qualify until their youngest child turns eight if the parent is single, or six if the parent is a member of a couple. Prior to July 2006 a person could qualify for parenting payment until their youngest child turned 16.


This bill will amend the Social Security Act so that from 1 July 2011 new children who come into the care of an existing parenting payment recipient will no longer extend the duration of a recipient's preferential treatment. This will serve to minimise the lingering inequity within parenting payment as a result of the 2006 Welfare to Work reforms. Further changes for parents on income support will take effect from 1 January 2013 and will be included in a separate bill to be introduced later this year.


I take this opportunity to once again thank members for their contributions and commend this bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

This bill will amend the Social Security Act so that from 1 July 2011 new children who come into the care of an existing parenting payment recipient will no longer extend the duration of a recipient's preferential treatment. This will serve to minimise the lingering inequity within parenting payment as a result of the 2006 Welfare to Work reforms. Further changes for parents on income support will take effect from 1 January 2013 and will be included in a separate bill to be introduced later this year.


I take this opportunity to once again thank members for their contributions and commend this bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (13:45):  In January 2008 Warley Hospital on Phillip Island closed. Warley Hospital had been pledged $2½ million by the coalition government to remain open to allow it to continue the work of over 80 years of commitment to the people of Phillip Island. It was a great shame and an unacceptable situation that the incoming government refused to match that grant and support the people of Warley Hospital.


The money received from the sale of the hospital has allowed a fund of $1.4 million to be established. I call upon Minister Nicola Roxon to match that money to allow the reopening of the hospital as a subsidiary of the Bass Coast health network. This was a community based hospital which had served the people of Phillip Island for decades and decades. It is a tragedy that the hospital, which would have remained open under a coalition government, was allowed to close. Phillip Island has a significant permanent population. It attracts up to two million visitors each year, I am told. This hospital must have matching funding from the federal government. (Time expired)

 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I move:


That the House records its deep regret at the deaths of Lance Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case on 30 May 2011 while on operations in Afghanistan, and place on record its appreciation of their service to the country and tender its profound sympathy to their families in their bereavement.


The House and the nation shared the sorrow and the pride yesterday of two Australian families and we continue today to share that sorrow and that pride. Andrew Jones was killed on 30 May while serving on operations in Afghanistan. He was from the 9th Force Support Battalion and was serving with Force Support Unit 4 in the Chora Valley. He was an Army cook by trade, an Australian soldier by profession, on duty in uniform the day he died. He was 25 years old.


Marcus Case was killed on the same day in a separate incident. Marcus was a member of the Sydney based 6th Aviation Regiment. He began his training as a reservist, deferred his university studies to serve in the Army full time, trained as a commando and was deployed to East Timor. Marcus then trained as a pilot and had deployed to Afghanistan as a Heron unmarked aerial vehicle operator. On Monday he was taking part in a resupply sortie in southern Afghanistan when the helicopter he was in crashed. He was 27 years old.


The Chief of the Defence Force, the Minister for Defence, members of this parliament and I have all spoken, yesterday and today, to express our nation's grief and our resolve of the loss we feel of two good, young men gone and the determination we share as a nation to see the mission through. Today the Jones family and the Case family have spoken beautifully as well in their statements and in sharing their sorrow. I want to share with the House some of what they, the families, have said. The words of Andrew Jones's family speak volumes to me and I am sure to all of us. The family said:


Andrew was a dependable, very cheeky character who we will miss with all our hearts. We believe Andrew was very, very happy serving with his friends, doing the job he loved. We would like to especially thank those that helped Andrew in his last hours. We know you did your best to save him and continue to face the big job ahead of you while also dealing with his death.


The words of Marcus's family too will remain with me for a long time and with all of us. They said:


Marcus was born to fly. His favourite comment was 'Are you ready for this?' before performing some acrobatics to demonstrate his incredible skills.


Marcus will be sorely missed by his loving and very proud family as well as by his large group of supportive friends. He was an idol to his niece and nephews who, upon seeing a helicopter, would point at it and gleefully say, 'There goes Marcus.'


Marcus and Andrew were professionals, trained to serve, ready for a day like this. These days are very hard, but we owe it to Marcus and Andrew and their mates to be ready too. It is in our nation's interests to continue our deployment in Afghanistan, to make sure that Afghanistan does not again become a safe haven for terrorists, to stand firmly by our ally the United States. Transition will take time. We must not transition out only to transition back in. We must not leave a security vacuum which terrorists who threaten us would fill.


Australia will see the mission through in Afghanistan. Today, we share the sorrow of the Jones and Case families. We cannot truly share their suffering, but today I want the Jones family and the Case family to know this: you are not alone. You are Australians—you are never alone—and the sacrifice your boys have made will not be forgotten.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:05):  I rise to support the words of the Prime Minister. Lance Corporal Andrew Jones was always quick to volunteer for dangerous or difficult missions and had previously served in East Timor. Lieutenant Marcus Case had also served in East Timor and, most recently, had served in Queensland where he helped with flood assistance missions earlier in the year.


In expressing our grief to the families and friends of these dead, brave soldiers we should also express our appreciation for their professionalism, their selflessness and their devotion to duty. Inevitably, when we have these incidents—particularly a tragedy arising, it seems, from the treachery of an ally—people's determination is inclined to waver. But this, in the end, goes to the sort of country that we want to be. Are we going to be a country that takes up burdens when they are easy only to drop them when they are hard? I believe that, on reflection, all of us would want Australia to be a country that can be relied upon in hard times as well as in good times. We as members of parliament, and in the case of the members opposite senior members of the government, are all conscious of the price our soldiers pay for the decisions that this parliament and its members make. I am sure that all of us remain determined that the deaths of these two brave soldiers should not be in vain. On behalf of the coalition, on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I extend our deepest condolences to their families.

Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (14:07):  I associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in both expressing condolence to the families of Lance Corporal Andrew Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Case and reaffirming our mission and our resolve in Afghanistan.


Following on so quickly from the death of Sergeant Brett Wood, this terrible news has reverberated throughout our country. Lance Corporal Andrew Jones was a young man of 25 years from the 9th Force Support Battalion in Amberley, who had served in the Army for seven years. His first operational deployment was to East Timor in 2008 and his second, to Afghanistan, commenced in November last year. Lance Corporal Jones was a loyal, reliable and trustworthy soldier who was dedicated to serving his country and his people. He is described as a team player who loved doing his job. He had a quiet personality but enjoyed a joke with his mates. He was a skilled cook but was always the first to volunteer for any task. The circumstances of his death have been particularly difficult for his family and for his nation.


Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case was 27 years old, from the Sydney based 6th Aviation Regiment and was deployed to Afghanistan as a Heron unmanned aerial vehicle operator. His first deployment was as an infantryman to Malaysia with Rifle Company Butterworth in 2005. In 2007, he deployed to East Timor with 1st Commando Regiment, and in 2008 he transferred to the Army and became an Army helicopter pilot. In January this year he provided much-needed flood assistance in Queensland. He deployed to Afghanistan in May this year. He was keen and motivated and excelled as a pilot. He was described as the go-to man who was always able to get the job done.


The deaths of Lance Corporal Jones and Lieutenant Case bring to 26 the number of fatalities in Afghanistan since our operation commenced almost a year ago. In these terrible circumstances it is important to reflect upon why we are in Afghanistan and the basis on which we are there. We very strongly continue to believe that it is in our national interest to help stare down international terrorism. Our mission in Afghanistan continues to be authorised by a United Nations mandate which has been in existence for a decade and successively renewed as part of a nearly 50 country international security assistance force in Afghanistan. In the face of this devastating news this week our resolve must continue. This parliament shares the anguish and distress of family, friends and mates. This parliament shares the grief and pain of our men and women in uniform. We express our condolences to the families with our age-old refrain: Lest we forget.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (14:10):  Two more poppies have just sprouted in Flanders fields, resolute, brilliant in the sun, young men of promise, young leaders of praise, men who put duty first. I join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Defence in honouring these men, Lieutenant Marcus Case and Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, who were tragically killed in Afghanistan on Monday, and to lend our prayers to those wounded.


Two more poppies now grow in a field alongside 24 others. They stand as a testimony that we as a people will never submit to tyranny and never flee from terrorism. We will fight it where it stands until it stands no more. This heart-wrenching loss may shake our resolve in the now but it will never break our commitment to the rightness of our cause. So as the ubiquitous Afghan fighting season rises to meet us let all Australians mirror the commitment of our fighting men and women through our support for their service and sacrifice. What we at home offer our troops transcends distance, for it is a chorus of praise that buoys their spirits through the difficult and demanding times ahead. Our troops deserve nothing less.


Lieutenant Case and Lance Corporal Jones are the first non-infantry, armour or engineers to be killed in action in Afghanistan. For every single Australian soldier mans the walls, joins the patrols and is prepared to fight regardless of their profession. Combat surrounds all of them every day. As a pilot Lieutenant Case, based in Kandahar with our UAV detachment, worked 12-hour shifts to keep eyes in the sky to support our ground forces. His work meant that Special Forces retained vital imagery of the adversary they fought; his work saved lives.


Lance Corporal Jones, a young cook, was serving with men from the 5th Battalion in one of the most remote patrol bases in the Chora Valley, a base hard fought to attain in one of the most dangerous regions of Oruzgan, where temperatures soar to 50 degrees following a winter of minus 20. All the time, this young leader fed the men, patrolled the valleys and manned the battlement.


To the loving parents, siblings and girlfriends, the nation grieves with you. Lads, we will remember you as a pilot of daring and a tough soldier of fortitude, men who knew the great dangers, flew the tough missions and manned the tough posts. We honour you as we mourn your loss, for two more poppies have just sprouted in Flanders field today.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (14:16):  My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the fact that the economy went backwards in the first three months of this year. Treasurer, why is the government hitting Australian households and businesses with a carbon tax, a mining tax and a flood levy when we now know that a mining boom cough can lead to economic pneumonia?

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:16):  I am simply stunned by that question from the shadow Treasurer. He refers to the contraction in the March quarter as a 'mining boom cough', when in fact we have had a contraction in the March quarter of 1.7 percentage points because of the impact of the biggest natural disaster in Australia's history. They do not accept that on that side of the House. I am completely stunned as to how out of touch they have become. There was a contraction in the March quarter of 1.2 per cent, but minus 1.7 per cent came from the natural disasters—from the floods in Queensland, from Cyclone Yasi, from the floods in northern New South Wales, from the floods in the north-west of Western Australia. And they come into this House and describe that as a mining boom cough. This is just extraordinary.


I think I can understand why they are so out of touch. We had a clue to this a few weeks ago. The Leader of the Opposition came into this House and gave a speech for 30 minutes and did not once mention the impact of the floods, Cyclone Yasi or the weather events in the north-west of Western Australia—not once in a 30-minute speech. Then we had the shadow Treasurer go to the Press Club, supposedly to deliver some alternative to the budget, and not once, in a 30-minute speech, did he mention the impact of the floods, Cyclone Yasi and other weather events. This just shows how out of touch, how incompetent, they are and how they do not understand the challenges facing the Australian economy.


The fact is that the fundamentals of our economy are strong. If you have a look at the figures today, you will see that consumption, dwelling investment and business investment are all making positive contributions to growth, but the big negative in the figures today is the impact of those cyclones and those floods. Those opposite want to stick their heads in the sand and pretend that they never happened. This is incredible.


I do not think there has been an opposition this incompetent, this out of touch, in the history of this country. They want to ignore too the very strong pipeline of business investment that we have. They want to ignore the fact that, if we are going to cope with that in the years ahead, we have got to bring our budget back to surplus. But they are intent on wrecking that surplus. They come into the House and complain about deficits. They have never seen a deficit that they did not want to make bigger, as they come into this House and oppose saves. They are opposing vital savings measures in this House. They are trying to wreck the government surplus. It has got so bad, and they have got so negative, that they are now opposing their own policies. Can you believe that? They are opposing a policy of the Howard government that goes back to 2004 because they are so negative.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Treasurer could not be being more irrelevant to the question he was asked. He is required to be directly relevant, and he is straining over every subject other than the question he was asked—and 'straining' is the word.




The SPEAKER:
  As I have reflected in the past, less debate would be helpful, but I think that the Treasurer should keep in mind that he needs to relate his material directly to the question.




Mr SWAN:
  They pretend that the global financial crisis is a hiccup and that the natural disasters, the floods and cyclones, did not happen. That is how incompetent they are, how negative they have become and how unqualified they are for high office.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:27):  As my colleagues have observed, the Leader of the Opposition has already grown bored with discussion of the economy and he is back to the only thing he knows how to do, which is to distort things in pursuit of a fear campaign. What he is doing today is distorting the words of Professor Ross Garnaut in an incredibly irresponsible way. To anybody who has listened to the Leader of the Opposition's question let me say this to them very clearly. The Leader of the Opposition has misrepresented Professor Garnaut. We always see the Leader of the Opposition do this because he cannot mount an argument that deals with the facts. It is impossible. He knows he cannot mount an argument that deals with the facts. He can never discuss the facts. He never wants to hear the facts because as soon as the facts are on the table his fear campaign falls away. So at every opportunity, including every opportunity in this parliament, he walks in with distortions. 


Professor Garnaut did not say what the Leader of the Opposition put into his question. That did not happen. What Professor Garnaut talked about was the kind of climate commission they have in the United Kingdom where a body makes recommendations to government, which then performs its democratic role in the way that governments do. Of course, our democracy is filled with bodies that make recommendations to government. The Productivity Commission is just one such body that makes recommendations to government. If we look at the way that works in our democracy, it has worked for years without anybody taking the kind of silly political point we are seeing the Leader of the Opposition take today. I have never heard the Leader of the Opposition walk up to the dispatch box or indeed any other microphone and say that his Conservative counterpart David Cameron is not exercising an appropriate democratic—




The SPEAKER:
  The Prime Minister will resume her place. The Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Prime Minister was asked a very specific question. These needlessly negative debating points that she is making are quite out of order, and I ask you to draw her back to the question she was asked.




The SPEAKER:
  The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. No matter how he characterises the argument in the response, in the standing order the only requirement is that the response be directly relevant, and the Prime Minister is aware of the need to be directly relevant.




Ms GILLARD:
  I had a distortion of Professor Garnaut's words put to me. I am correcting that distortion. No-one should believe it to be true. It is not true. I am pointing out the truth of what Professor Garnaut said. You can see examples of the kind of arrangement that he is thinking about around the world, including in the United Kingdom, where Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron very recently received recommendations from a climate commission and determined to act on those recommendations. I did not hear the Leader of the Opposition say at that time that he thought his Conservative counterpart was not behaving appropriately as Prime Minister, so let us not listen to any of this nonsense.


I think the Australian people will increasingly be asking themselves: why is it that the Leader of the Opposition can never engage in the climate change debate by dealing with the facts? Why is it that he always has to rely on falsehoods and fear? You rely on falsehoods and fear when you do not have a rational argument, and that is the Leader of the Opposition's problem. He has no rational argument, no rational policy, no rational belief in the science; all he is peddling is fear and falsehood, and every Australian should understand that.

  Let us go to the truth of what Professor Garnaut said. This is the truth, and I say to those members opposite who are yelling, who may have been misled by the falsehood that their leader just spoke in this parliament: this is what Professor Garnaut said. Professor Garnaut is proposing, in terms of governance arrangements around a carbon price, the following. He is proposing an independent committee which would not set targets or price—

This misrepresentation of Professor Garnaut should stop here. Professor Garnaut said the independent committee would not set targets or price but would make recommendations to government. Under his proposal the setting of targets and scheme caps is something that would remain firmly under the democratic control of the government of the day.


The Leader of the Opposition today has come in and he knows he cannot debate carbon pricing based on the facts. He is peddling falsehoods and he is peddling fear, because he is a man with no belief in the science and no answer on the policy. No-one should believe these falsehoods.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:34):  It is very clear from the remarks we have just heard from, amongst other people, the Minister for Climate Change, that I am getting under their skin. I certainly am travelling this country. I am going to the workplaces of this country, particularly the blue-collar workplaces of this country, to alert the Australian people to the threat posed to jobs, in particular the threat posed to manufacturing jobs by this government's carbon tax. I will keep doing this. I will keep doing this, every day, while there is breath in my body, because the one thing that we need in this country is a viable manufacturing sector. If there is one sector of our country which is threatened by the government's carbon tax it is the manufacturing sector of this country.


Let us have no more talk in this parliament about big polluters, because all of those decent, honest Australian businesses, which are defamed day in, day out by senior members of this government, are not so much the big polluters but the big employers, the big exporters and the big providers of jobs in this country. That is what they are. Let there be no doubt about the intentions of the authors of this carbon tax legislation: they want to kill manufacturing industry in this country. They must kill manufacturing industry in this country, because manufacturing in this country cannot continue without power, and power in this country is absolutely dependent upon the burning of coal, the burning of gas and the use of oil. I say to members opposite: how many steel mills can you run on solar power? How many motor-manufacturing plants can you run on wind power? That is why I will travel right around this country, every day, while this parliament is not sitting, alerting the blue-collar workers of this country to the threat that this government poses to their jobs and their livelihood. These people who are so derided, so defamed, so blackguarded by members of this government are absolutely essential to a modern economy. They are absolutely essential if the standard of living of every single Australian is to be maintained. The whole point of a carbon tax is to shrink and ultimately to close industries that emit carbon dioxide. That is the whole point of a carbon tax. There is no point having a carbon tax if it does not mean that we burn less coal, use less gas, use less petrol and use less power. If we do not do that, there is no point whatsoever to this carbon tax.


Let me start to go through just what this carbon tax is going to do to the manu–facturing sector of this country. Let me appeal to members opposite who I suspect in their hearts do want to do the right thing by the workers of this country. I do not think all of them are as blind to reality as the Prime Minister and some of her colleagues. I think in their hearts they do want to stand up for the jobs of their constituents and for their union members. I want to lay down in this chamber some of the jobs that will be at risk if this carbon tax goes ahead. There are 1,300 jobs at Ford at Geelong. I know because I have been there. I am standing up for the jobs at Ford. What is the member for Corio doing for the workers at Geelong? What is the member for Corangamite doing for the workers at Geelong? I see the Special Minister of State at the table. In the electorate of Brand, there are 1,300 jobs at Alcoa at Kwinana. What is the minister doing for those jobs at Kwinana?


I see another minister at the table. What is he doing for the jobs at the steel mill in Western Sydney? Members opposite need to stand up for, in this case, the old Smorgon steel mill, now a OneSteel mill. Come on, mate, surely you are not so ignorant as to not know anything about the Smorgon steel mill in Western Sydney. You may not be interested in their jobs but you have not forgotten about the existence of the mill, surely.


Really and truly, right around Australia jobs are at risk in the electorates of members opposite and it is high time they stood up for them. There are 800 jobs at the Newlands coalmine in the electorate of Capricornia. There are 600 jobs at the Moranbah mine and 600 jobs at the German Creek mine. Also in the electorate of Corio, there are 3,300 jobs at Toyota at Altona. In the electorate of Calwell, there are around 1,900 jobs at Ford at Broadmeadow. All of these jobs are at risk under this government's carbon tax and it is high time that members opposite started standing up for the jobs of their constituents. It is high time that members opposite stopped making excuses for a floundering Prime Minister, stopped defending a policy that is obviously failing and started standing up for the jobs of their members.


We know that the Prime Minister is not interested in the 500 jobs at OneSteel Laverton. We know she is not interested because I went there and the workers said to me: 'Where is the Prime Minister? She doesn't want to protect our jobs. She wants to hit us with a carbon tax that will put all of those jobs at risk.'


I see the Chief Government Whip, the member for Hunter. What are you going to say, Joel, for the 600 jobs at the Wambo coalmine, the 600 jobs at the Mount Thorley coalmine and the 600 jobs at the Mt Owen coalmine? What are you going to say about that, Joel? Stand up for the workers of your electorate and say no to this carbon tax. Be less interested, Joel, in staying on as Chief Government Whip and more interested in protecting the jobs of the people that you are pledged to represent in this parliament.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Leader of the Opposition will refer to the Chief Government Whip by his title and not by his name.




Mr ABBOTT:
  I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do apologise. I was trying to touch the member for Hunter's deeper and finer feelings. I know that, deep down, he wants to protect the jobs of his members and I am putting to him that the only way to protect the jobs of his members is to sacrifice the job of this Prime Minister.


But it does not stop there. I have already spoken about BlueScope Steel and the more than 5,000 jobs at Port Kembla. What has the member for Throsby done to stand up for the workers of BlueScope Steel? What has the member for Cunningham done to stand up for the workers of BlueScope Steel? What have those Illawarra members done to stand up for the 2,000 jobs at Illawarra Coal? One thing we know is that the carbon tax is a dagger aimed at the heart of the coal industry, even under the government's own modelling. By 2020, there will be a 35 per cent reduction in coal production and 13 per cent in coal investment, so what are all of those members opposite who represent coal seats going to do to stand up for that industry?


We have 2,700 jobs at Holden at Elizabeth in South Australia. What is the member for Wakefield doing to stand up for those jobs? We have 851 jobs at Alcoa in Gove, in the Northern Territory. What is the member for Lingiari doing to stand up for those jobs? We have 560 jobs at Alcan at Bell Bay. What is the member for Bass doing to stand up for those jobs?


There is one party in this House today that is determined to protect as far as it reasonably can the jobs of the manufacturing workers of this country, and it is the Liberal-National party. The people who are being completely betrayed by members opposite are the manufacturing workers of this country. I am happy to defend, day in, day out, the right of our power stations, our steel industry and our aluminium industry to continue to exist in this country, because, unlike members opposite, I understand that those industries are vital to a First World economy, and I want Australia to continue to be a First World economy. I want Australia to continue to be a country where people make things.


That is what it comes down to in the end: are we going to be a country which manufactures things or are we going to be a country which says goodbye to all of that in the name of misguided green zealotry? Does anyone think for a second—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Do you have anything of substance to say?




Mr ABBOTT:
  Isn't it typical of this government that this man up the back does not speak up for the jobs of his workers but all we get is more inane bluster from members opposite. That is all we ever get from those people.


If this carbon tax regime comes in and we lose our steel industry, aluminium industry, cement industry, glass and plastics, does anyone think that we are not going to continue to use all those substances? Of course we are going to use them. They will be imported. That is the whole point. Under this carbon tax, we will export jobs and we will import emissions. That is the truth. That is what this government is doing to the manufacturing heartland of our country.


We will stand up for the workers of this country. We will stand up for the 45,000 workers who, even on the government's own figures, will lose their jobs in energy-intensive manufacturing.




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  You're making it up as you go along. You're embarrassing yourself.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  The Chief Government Whip will remain silent!




Mr ABBOTT:
  We will stand up for the 126,000 workers who will not be employed in regional Australia as a result of the government's carbon tax. We will stand up for the 24,000 mining workers—particularly the coal workers of the Hunter and the Illawarra—who will lose their jobs under the government's carbon tax. We will stand up for these workers. I say to the manufacturing workers of this country: you have a friend in the coalition.




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  This is a leadership speech. This is about Malcolm.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Chief Government Whip will remain silent for the rest of the leader's contribution!




Mr ABBOTT:
  We will stand up for the workers of this country. I say to members opposite: if you have any residual concern for the ethos of the old Labor Party, if you have any instinctive sympathy for the Labor Party of John Curtin and Ben Chifley—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  This is embarrassing, Tony. Where's your substance? 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I warn the Chief Government Whip!




Mr ABBOTT:
  junk this toxic tax and do what is best, do what is right, do what is necessary for the workers of this country whose jobs are currently at risk.




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  That's a good one, Tony. That'll get the troops back!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Chief Government Whip will remain silent!




Mr ABBOTT:
  This carbon tax is a watershed for our country because it poses the question, in the starkest possible terms: what do we want to be as an economy? Do we want to be an economy that manufactures things or do we want to be an economy which is in thrall to green zealotry? The Chief Executive of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, Andrew McKellar, speaking of the carbon tax, said:


… we won't have green jobs, we will have green unemployment.


The Chairman of BlueScope Steel, speaking of the so-called compensation for manufacturing industries that the government is talking about, said:


It's simply a Band-Aid on a bullet wound.


Even Paul Howes, the National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, has said:


Carbon pricing could be the straw that breaks the camel's back as far as some industries are concerned.  … If one job is gone, our support is gone.


That is the test that members opposite should lay down for the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister cannot realistically guarantee manufacturing jobs, mining jobs, coal jobs, power jobs, they should withdraw their support for her; they should get rid of her. Most of all they should get rid of this toxic tax.

Opposition members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Honourable members on my left will contain themselves.




Mr CLARE:
  We heard 15 minutes of diatribe about jobs. It is worth asking yourself the question: if the Leader of the Opposition really cared about jobs, where was he when the stimulus package was voted on in this parliament, a stimulus package that stopped Australia going into recession and protected 200,000 jobs?



Mr Robb interjecting—




Mr CLARE:
  If you cared about this, you might hang around. It was a stimulus package that stopped Australia going into recession and protected 200,000 jobs. That is the equivalent of two Olympic stadiums worth of people who had their jobs saved because of a stimulus package here. Where was the Leader of the Opposition when that vote was occurring? Was he on this side of the chamber? Was he on that side of the chamber? No. He was asleep on his couch in his office. That is how much the Leader of the Opposition really cares about jobs. He is happy to come in here and talk about it, but when there is a vote to protect jobs he is nowhere to be seen—he is lying on his couch.


Since Adam was a boy, we have always had scare campaigns. One hundred and ten years ago, there were scare campaigns about giving women the vote.  Sixty years ago, there were scare campaigns about the 40-hour week. Twenty years ago, there were scare campaigns about native title. We had people on the other side of the chamber saying that you were going to lose your backyard. All of it proved to be false. All of it eventually proved to be nonsense. When we cut tariffs and when we introduced compulsory superannuation, there were exactly the same arguments being made then that were just made by the Leader of the Opposition. Go back and have a look at the Hansard from 1992 and you see Liberal after Liberal after National after Liberal telling us that jobs are going to be lost. Senator Panizza said:


The worst case scenario—


this is on the introduction of compulsory superannuation—


is the loss of 100,000 jobs ... there are 100,000 jobs on the line ... and I can see those 100,000 jobs quite easily going out the door within a very few years.


Senator Watson said rising unemployment would occur and it would 'exacerbate poverty and hardship'. Senator Crichton-Browne said superannuation would reduce economic growth, add to unemployment, create inflationary pressures, reduce savings and reduce living standards. Allan Rocher, the then member for Curtin, said it would be 'a tax on jobs'. All of this was nonsense and was proved eventually to be false. So what occurred? The opposite. Instead of the loss of 100,000 jobs what we got was the creation of 60,000 jobs and a whole new industry with $1.4 trillion in savings, the fourth biggest managed fund in the world. You can see by the arguments that the Liberals made then and by the arguments that they make now that this is just a scare campaign.


The Leader of the Opposition talked about his travels around the country and it went from the sublime to the ridiculous. It probably went from the ridiculous to the ridiculous. He started in Whyalla in April and said that a carbon tax would wipe Whyalla off the map. Then he talked about his trip to Geelong. He went there and said that this will be the final nail in the motor industry's coffin in Australia. He went on to say this would spell disaster for Australia as a First World economy, so he was basically saying Australia was going to become a Second World or a Third World economy. Then he went off to Weet-Bix and said that a carbon price was going to effectively destroy breakfast. This is from Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, who only two years ago—and it puts things in perspective and tells you the type of man he is—said when talking about a carbon price on Sky on 29 July 2009:


I think if you want to put a price on carbon why not just do it with a simple tax.


Now apparently it is the greatest disaster to hit Australia in its history and apparently it will turn Australia into a Third World country. But it is not just the Leader of the Opposition who is making these ludicrous, ridiculous claims. When we were debating this issue in another MPI, in March this year, the member for Indi was speaking opposite and she said this:


The future under a carbon tax is the single greatest disruption to the Australian economy and the destruction of Australian jobs that we have ever seen.


What about the Great Depression with 29 per cent unemployment? But, no, introducing a carbon tax, according to the opposition, would lead to the 'greatest destruction of Australian jobs that we have ever seen'. Then you have the member for Murray. Remember that on Monday she said that Heinz was moving from Australia to New Zealand because Australia was introducing a carbon tax. The problem with that is that New Zealand already have a carbon price. They introduced an emissions trading scheme in 2008. But that did not stop the member for Murray, because she went out on the doors and said:


Well New Zealand is talking about climate change action, yes, but they're watching to see what happens in Australia. They have not moved yet, they're saying what Australia might do we might do but that is, I think, code for we'll make sure we remain more competitive than Australia when it comes to energy costs.


What a load of baloney! What a load of absolute nonsense! They moved three years ago. So that is where the scare campaign has ended, with an opposition that is just making things up. It is making up nonsense and complete fantasy—just like the bloke last week, Harold Camping, who promised the rapture was coming last month and just like Donald Trump who ran around America calling for the President of the United States to release his birth certificate. Well, now you have the Leader of the Opposition—all Trump, no toupee—running around, really great at making headlines but just speaking nonsense.


It is time that we talked about the two plans that are at stake here in this parliament, because there are two plans. Both parties have committed to doing something about climate change and both have committed to cutting carbon pollution by five per cent. Both have got a plan to do this and the focus of this debate should be on the relative merits of both plans as to which one is the best for Australia. With the government's plan, we have proposed to introduce a carbon price. It would be fixed for three to five years and after that period of time we would move to an emissions trading scheme. The advice from Treasury is that this is the cheapest way to cut carbon pollution. That is why John Howard adopted the same approach. To help families and pensioners deal with any changes, we will provide generous household assistance. One of the ways to do this, and the Prime Minister has said this, could be through tax cuts. 


There is another plan, as the Leader of the Opposition also has a plan to cut carbon pollution. Under his plan, the government taxes all Australians and uses that money to give big polluters an incentive to cut their own emissions. According to the Leader of the Opposition, this will cost about $10 billion of taxpayers' money. Of course, there is no guarantee that it would work. According to Treasury, the opposition's scheme will increase emissions by 13 per cent, not reduce them. To actually cut emissions by five per cent, which is the opposition's target, would cost taxpayers about $30 billion. The member for Wentworth was on Lateline a few weeks ago and he explained why this is the case. He said:


... a direct action policy where the Government—where industry was able to freely pollute, if you like, and the Government was just spending more and more taxpayers' money to offset it, that would become a very expensive charge on the budget in the years ahead ...




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  I think Joe understands that.




Mr CLARE:
  I think he does. In effect, this explains why the member for Wentworth, in his contribution to the CPRS debate last year, said this would be fiscal recklessness on a grand scale. So companies keep polluting and taxpayers keep paying and potentially a whole lot of taxpayers' money is flushed down the toilet and the pollution goes up rather than down. It is the sort of plan that you have when you do not think that climate change is real. Well, it is real. Climate change is happening and human beings are contributing to it and it is a serious challenge. Cutting carbon pollution in our economy is not an easy task. It involves hard economic reform, effectively severing the link between economic growth and the growth in the amount of carbon dioxide that the economy produces. It is not easy but we have to do it. It is simply in our economic interests to do it. There will be a binding international agreement in the years ahead and Australia will have to comply. If we act now, Australian companies will have time to adjust. We can reduce the amount of carbon pollution we produce gradually, over time, and that will help to support Australian companies and support Australian jobs, but the longer we wait, the faster, eventually, we will have to cut our emissions, and that invariably will hurt Australian companies and hurt Australian jobs. That is why it makes economic sense to act now.


There has been some discussion here about what other countries are doing. India has a carbon tax on coal. China is launching a pilot emissions trading scheme in six provinces, including Beijing and Shanghai, in 2013. The US has committed to a 17 per cent reduction in emission levels by 2020. The United Kingdom produces about the same amount of emissions as Australia. Their Conservative government announced just last week that they will cut their emissions by 50 per cent by 2027. And here we are, producing roughly the same amount of emissions as the United Kingdom, and we are having a fight about cutting emissions by five per cent.


The British Prime Minister, of course, is not the only conservative leader to be doing something serious about climate change. As Paul Kelly pointed out in the Australian today, it is conservative governments around the world that have been leading the fight to tackle climate change. Whether it is Germany, Britain, France or South Korea, or the former Governor of California, it is conservatives who have led the way. Even in Australia, every single former leader of the Liberal Party supports taking action to cut climate change through putting a price on carbon—but not the current Leader of the Opposition. Andrew Peacock, John Hewson, Malcolm Fraser, Malcolm Turnbull and even John Howard all support putting a price on carbon. If Robert Menzies were alive today, I suspect he would back it as well.


But not this Leader of the Opposition, because he is in the embrace of the same people who thought that smoking did not cause cancer. Remember those debates in 1995 about whether smoking was addictive and whether smoking caused cancer? Senator Minchin, the man who put in a dissenting report to a Senate report in 1995, said he did not believe that smoking was addictive and did not believe that passive smoking caused cancer—the same person who helped the Leader of the Opposition get a job. There is another member of this parliament who in 1995 said: 'I say to those people who believe tobacco is a dreadful product: make your case. They have not done so.' These people in the House and in the Senate, the people who thought smoking did not cause cancer, are the same people who think that climate change is not real. And they are the same people who in the party room last week said to the Leader of the Opposition that even they thought he was being too negative, because now the Leader of the Opposition does not even support the Howard government's policies. Things he supported when he was a member of the Howard government he is now opposing—proof, if you ever needed any, that this is all just about politics.


The Leader of the Opposition is very different to John Howard. He opposes everything and stands for nothing. Remember what John Howard was like when he was the Leader of the Opposition? He supported reforms like floating the dollar. He supported reforms like cutting tariffs. But not this Leader of the Opposition. The answer to every single question we ask of this Leader of the Opposition is no. If we put a motion into this House supporting motherhood, the answer would be no. If we put a motion into this parliament supporting the Queen Mother, the answer would be no. If we put a motion into this parliament supporting the Queen and the Queen Mother, if we had a motion that entrenched the constitutional monarchy forever, he would oppose it. If we had a motion supporting budgie smugglers at the beach, he would oppose it. He opposes everything and stands for nothing. He is like that guy in drag in Little Britain: 'Computer says no'—except that in this case it is, 'Abbott says no.'


The people of Australia deserve better than that. They pay us money to come to Canberra to work together on the big reforms and the big issues to make this a better place. They expect us to work together. They expect something better than somebody who sleeps on a couch during important divisions and when he is awake just says no. (Time expired)

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (16:04):  Economic growth slumped by 1.2 per cent in the March quarter. This was the first quarter of negative growth since the financial-crisis-induced fall in the December quarter of 2008 and was the biggest decline since the March quarter of 1991 during the Keating 'recession we had to have'. Annual growth fell to just one per cent. Growth was heavily impacted by the cyclone and floods earlier this year and by the earthquake and also the tsunami in Japan, as I said in my press conference. This reduced production and export of key commodities, particularly coal.


These factors are temporary and of course will unwind through the balance of this year as production and exports recover, but this episode highlights the increasing importance of the mining sector to the Australian economy. It only accounts for 10 per cent of production and two per cent of employment, but it contributes more than half of our exports. This more prominent role of mining is a strength while times are good, but it also increases Australia's exposure to disruptions to the industry and to volatility in offshore markets. The disruptions to production and exports of commodities, particularly coal, from the cyclone and floods led to a plunge in net exports which cut a massive 2.4 percentage points off economic growth in the quarter. This shows clearly that, when the mining industry coughs, Australia catches economic pneumonia.


Thankfully, the international environment generally remains positive for Australia. The terms of trade rose another six per cent and are now at the highest for a century and a half. Business investment is very strong, with investment in machinery and equipment up six per cent and investment in non-dwelling construction up 1.3 per cent. Separate data on business investment shows that much of this strength is actually coming from the mining industry, as I pointed out at the National Press Club. Nevertheless, households remain cautious. They are still spending but at a moderate pace. Spending on retail was relatively flat, but this was partly because households had to spend more on petrol, education and rent. It is no surprise that households have to reduce their spending on the things they want to buy when they have to find money for things they actually need.


Spending on interest payments on mortgages and other household debt rose further, an indication of the impact of the seven increases in interest rates since late 2009, and particularly what the last one did on Melbourne Cup Day, followed by a significant increase by the banks above and beyond the move in the reserve and the impact that had on household budgets. Households are now spending a massive $21 billion on interest every three months to service their debts. Effective interest rates paid on borrowings by households are now higher than they were over the average of the Howard years. The bad news is that interest rate pressures will intensify as this government continues to compete for scarce funds through its ongoing deficit-fuelled spending binge.


Savings by households continue to rise and are around the highest level for several decades. On the one hand that is good but on the other hand it indicates that there is caution in Australian households, and the caution is linked back to the fact that borrowing for housing is increasing at its slowest pace in a generation and prices of houses are softening.


Today's data also highlights the difficulties being faced by the non-mining sectors of the economy, particularly manufacturing, which contracted by 3.1 per cent over the year. This is a struggle under the impact of higher interest rates, but particularly the Australian dollar. The rise in the Australian dollar to the highest level since the currency was floated in December 1983 is hurting trade-exposed industries. It is squeezing those export industries that are not linked to mining. It is also creating issues for import-competing industries such as the motor vehicle industry and business input and consumer goods producers. Both of these factors are heavily influenced by the government's continued heavy borrowing program, with demands on the capital markets of $49 billion this year and a further $23 billion next year.


The data shows that the growth pattern across the country is patchy. The strongest performing state is the Australian Capital Territory, with growth in the quarter of 3.3 per cent. That is not really surprising given that the Labor government is employing more and more public servants here in Canberra. Output dropped in South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland—




Mr Perrett:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order concerning relevance. The word 'manufacturing' has been mentioned once in six minutes and the carbon tax has not been mentioned at all.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  A matter of public importance debate is wide ranging. I call the honourable member for North Sydney.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Queensland, of course, has been the most heavily impacted as a result of the natural disasters. The latest snapshot of the economy shows the underlying resilience in the economy is entirely the result of good luck in recent times rather than good management. The economy is receiving the biggest boost from offshore in a very long time, certainly much bigger than anything the coalition had during its years in government. We might expect that this government would be acting to leverage this bountiful windfall with sound policies to lock in a sustainable future. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The government continues with its wasteful spending. Households are being careful with their money whilst the government just seems to be spending more. And the Treasurer had the audacity to stand in this place boasting about a surplus. What surplus was he referring to? Was it the surplus he might deliver in two years time. He said 'we are making the savings'—the savings that in the next fiscal year he is actually going to outspend by $2.5 billion, which illustrates the fraudulent words of the Treasurer in this place. But what is most concerning for households is that, while they are being asked to pull back and live within their means, the government is not doing so. The government is wasting money hand over fist, from set top boxes to an extra $110 million dealing with their pink batts issue.


From our perspective the greatest risk to the Australian economy is the impact of the carbon tax, the mining tax and the flood levy. At this particular point in time, after we have just had a full quarter of negative growth, albeit a headline negative growth, and after we have just had three months of the economy going backwards, what is the very worst thing the government could do? It would be to penalise households with a flood levy, to penalise the mining industry with a mining tax and to penalise every Australian with a carbon tax. Those initiatives alone are going to have a very real impact on the confidence levels of Australian households, but in particular they will have a devastating impact on Australian manufacturers, who are already struggling to compete with offshore players who have a massive currency advantage. The fact of the matter is that the Australian dollar is incredibly strong against the US dollar and many of the Asian countries that have strong manufacturing bases competing against Australian manufacturers have their currencies tied to the US dollar, and therefore their currencies have come down as well, which means that they have a competitive advantage against Australian manufacturers. 


So, at a point in time when Australian manufacturers are being hit with the impact of a high Australian dollar, at a point where Australian manufacturers are struggling to deal with some of the capacity challenges that the government identified in last year's budget but did nothing about and at a time when Australian manufacturers are asking themselves whether it is time to move their operations offshore, what does this government do? It introduces a carbon tax that makes everything manufacturers produce here in Australia more expensive. That is the logic of the Labor Party's economic policy—to make life harder, not easier, for manufacturers, for Australian households and for so many of the people who are already being left behind by the mining boom. This economy is being left in the hands of incompetent amateurs. It is time to get the mature people back in charge. It is time to have an election on the carbon tax.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (16:14):  If you are going to come into this place and raise a matter of public importance on the impact of government policy on the manufacturing sector; if you are going to come into this place and profess—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  The member for Throsby ought not use the word 'you' because it refers to the occupant of the chair. I am in this place because I am in the chair.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  I thank you for that guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. If somebody is going to come into this place and profess a love for workers in the manufacturing industry, they need to do it with some credibility. The fact is that those opposite—particularly the Leader of the Opposition—have absolutely no credibility on this issue.


Those opposite profess a love for the manufacturing industry and manufacturing workers. If they have a love, it is a very modern love affair. When you look at their record when it comes to the manufacturing industry and manufacturing workers in particular, it is a dismal record. Between the years 1996 and 2007, that mob over there, who profess to be in there in defence of manufacturing workers, oversaw the absolute obliteration of jobs in the manufacturing industry. Over 10,000 jobs were lost in the manufacturing industry when that mob over there last had the opportunity to do something about the sector. That is about 1,000 jobs per annum, or 20 jobs a week. So when the Leader of the Opposition stands here and says to workers in the manufacturing industry, 'I am your friend; I have your interests at heart,' those workers need to look at his record—and his record is pretty damn ordinary. Over 1,000 jobs per annum were lost on the opposition's watch—20 jobs a week.


But it did not just come to job losses. When the Leader of the Opposition was last focusing on industry and workers it was because he was out there spruiking the Work Choices legislation. But as he makes his fear tour around the electorate in 2011 he will not be going around the manufacturing plants talking about his last love affair—the love that dare not speak its name, his love affair with Work Choices. He cannot tell the workers in those manufacturing plants that the two pillars of his last love affair were to make it easier for employers to sack their workers. This bloke who comes in here and says he has love and affection for manufacturing workers was, when he last had a chance, introducing laws and defending laws in this place to make it easier for bosses to sack their workers and to cut their wages and conditions.


I have had a look at the outcome of the opposition's Work Choices legislation when it came to workers, particularly manufacturing workers. Over 70 per cent of workers on Work Choices AWAs lost their shift loadings, 68 per cent lost their annual leave loadings, 65 per cent lost penalty rates, 49 per cent lost overtime loadings and 25 per cent no longer had public holidays. The man who comes into this chamber professing a love affair for manufacturing workers does that on the basis that he hopes workers in the manufacturing industry have a very short memory indeed. Those opposite have no credibility on this issue and they have no policy.


The policy of those opposite in this area is quite simple. It can be summarised as follows. Those opposite want ordinary workers, including workers in the manufacturing industry, through their taxes, to subsidise big polluters for the ability to continue to pollute and for the obligation to reduce their pollution. They want ordinary workers, ordinary taxpayers, to go out there and subsidise the polluting activities of big business. We on this side of the chamber say that that is bad public policy. We believe that the most effective way to get a change in our economy and to reduce carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon and ensure that it is the big polluters who pay, not ordinary workers.


It is not surprising that the member for Wentworth—in fact, the last two members for Wentworth—have found it very difficult to defend the direct action policy. We understand that it is going to cost ordinary workers—those whom in the chamber today he was proposing to protect—around $720 per annum and to cost the economy around $30 billion. It is not surprising that when those opposite went to their focus groups and said, 'We've got a policy and we're thinking of calling it the Taxpayer Funded Pollution Scheme' that their focus groups and their media spin advisers said: 'That just won't work. We'd better come up with a tag like ""direct action"".' But the people of Australia will not be fooled. They know this is a taxpayer funded pollution scheme. It is no surprise that the current member for Wentworth finds it very difficult to defend. The previous members for Wentworth find it even harder to defend, and I would not be surprised if those opposite are seeking to abolish the seat of Wentworth retrospectively to do away with their embarrassments.


There is a risk to manufacturing, and that is the risk of being left behind. There is no chance that Australia is going to be at the head of the pack, because the rest of the world is already acting—and they are already acting decisively. If we do not act it is going to become all the harder for us to retool in our manufacturing industry, for us to reinvest and for us to do the things we need to do to protect jobs and protect this vital part of our economy.


The other risk to manufacturing, of course, is the uncertainty created by those opposite. We know that investors are very nervous indeed at the moment about making any long-term investments in the manufacturing industry or in electricity generation because they are uncertain as to whether we are going to have a bipartisan policy on this issue. When they are making 20- and 30-year investments, they are concerned that those investments will be completely undermined by the policies of those opposite. It is this uncertainty and this lack of a bipartisan approach to dealing with climate change that are the real threats to investment in manufacturing at the moment. That is without mentioning the threats that we currently face, and the case of Qantas which, we learn this week, is going to have border adjustments imposed on it by the European Union. These are the threats facing us from not introducing a plan to deal with climate change, from not putting a price on carbon. 


Those opposite came in here earlier today and proposed a love affair with the manufacturing industry. We know it is hypocrisy. We know it is hypocrisy because when they were last in government they oversaw the massive loss in manufacturing industry jobs. We also know that if they got into government again they would further take the axe to the manufacturing industry. In fact, the coalition's plan is to make massive cuts to industry programs. The Leader of the Opposition says that they want to protect jobs in the car industry, but the reality is that if the coalition had their way they would cut half a billion dollars from the Automotive Transformation Scheme.


The Automotive Transformation Scheme provides investment in research and devel–opment that increases the competitiveness and productivity of our automotive industry across the entire supply chain. So those who profess a love for manufacturing and manufacturing workers are at the same time planning to take the hatchet to the plans that are going to give workers in these industries a real future. They say that they are proposing to protect jobs in manufacturing industries but at the same time they are proposing to slash funds for Enterprise Connect, one of the main support programs for emerging manufacturing firms. They are proposing to cut over $100 million from Enterprise Connect, a program which has assisted over 7,500 firms. 


On this point there is absolutely no credibility from those opposite, whereas we on this side of the chamber know that we have a challenge in the manufacturing sector and the challenge is one brought about by the fact that we have a very high Australian dollar. That is a sign of confidence in the Australian economy, a sign of international confidence in the Australian economy, and we know that we have to assist our vital manufacturing sector to make it through these difficult and challenging times.

Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (16:25):  The manufacturing sector is critical to Australia. One million Australians work in this sector. It may interest the member who has just spoken to know that during the time of this Labor government 550 jobs a week are lost in manufacturing. I will repeat that so that he adds it to his little notebook: 550 jobs a week are lost by this government. Who has cut $1.8 billion from industry assistance? That would be his minister, Minister Carr, who thankfully resides in the other place. So let us not get too hypocritical about this issue, because all you need to do is not listen to the coalition if you do not want to but listen to industry? Why don't you listen to industry when it says that a carbon tax is, as Paul O'Malley from BlueScope Steel said: 


… clearly economic vandalism. It clearly says we don't want manufacturing in Australia. 


We hear that carbon pricing could be the straw that breaks the camel's back as far as some industries are concerned. 'If one job is gone our support is gone.' That quote is not actually from industry; it is from Paul Howes. Of course he was pushed into a corner by the most powerful branch of his union and he was forced to stand up for them. He said that—one of the faceless men who put the Prime Minister in her job. But apparently he does not even get to have a say in this. Bob Brown is even more important than him. 


We also hear what will happen if we act unilaterally—we will just export our industries and export our jobs. It was Graham Kraehe, Chairman of BlueScope Steel, who said: 


… a tax on carbon produced in steelmaking is fine as long as the Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Indians, Russians, Americans, Brazilians and others have a similar tax. 


If this is not the case Australia will simply transfer the carbon generation to countries without a carbon tax and accelerate the hollowing out of Australia's economy. 


They are not alarmist words; they just state the fact. They state exactly the fact and what has happened in other nations. The business sector wants this Prime Minister to stop trying to club manufacturing out of existence. The workers who work in this sector want the Prime Minister to stop seeking to punish them, to stop trying to label the very successful and innovative businesses in which they work as environmental vandals. We do not want to see these industries legislated out of existence; nor do these businesses that are filled with decent, hardworking Australians, that have invested in this nation, that are fighting for their life at the moment, want to see jobs go in Australia. What a contrast that is to the vainglorious politicians and the celebrities who lecture everyone else about how they should lead their lives, who lecture everyone else about the sorts of things they can afford and what they should do to save the planet. It is because of this arrogance and this inability to listen to ordinary Australians that the Prime Minister has now allowed herself to be cornered by that fringe dweller Bob Brown, who is going to inherit even more extremists come 1 July. She has allowed this once great party representing the workers to now be the author of and the signatory to the bill that will destroy manufacturing and alter the face of this economy.


We heard from the other side, typically, all those arrogant statements: 'The coalition does not understand manufacturing' and the like. Actually, both my parents spent 20 years working in manufacturing in the industrial suburbs of Melbourne, so I fully do appreciate and understand the importance of manufacturing today in employing one million Australians and the important heritage that manufacturing has had in building innovation capability, in building up our manufacturing capability and in allowing particularly SMEs to grow and flourish. On this side of the House we understand that. We understand you cannot have a modern economy without steel, cement, plastics, aluminium and glass. We on this side of the House do not want to see the food-processing industry further contract, because we believe it is important for Australia as a nation not only to make things but to process our own food.


Manufacturing is doing it tough with the rising value of the Australian dollar and ever-increasing competition, but on the government benches they are gripped with this blind desire, this false bravado, and think that if they just crash through with Bob Brown's carbon tax they will somehow get over the line at the next election—and for what? To save one person's job: the Prime Minister's. The government have not actually done the hard work. There is no industry policy coming from them and the Prime Minister has barely been to a manufacturing business in months. Behind lecterns in Parliament House, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research is reduced to reciting gibberish about how manufacturing assistance is going to increase under a punitive carbon tax and, at the same time, firms will also be partly compensated for the damage they suffer. He let out of the bag the other night during estimates that industry was going to get 46 per cent of overall compensation. He did not have the guts to detail that. He did not have the guts to tell a lot of manufacturers that they were not going to get a cent, though I suppose he has been adequately chastised for that. He did not tell the Australian people that there will be no compensation for losing their jobs, but I suppose this attitude should not come as a surprise from a bloke who once admitted on live radio that 'no-one's job is safe under this government'. That is about the only thing I agree with him on.


Then we have the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, former union boss and prime ministerial wannabe, who was so chastened by being jeered about his carbon tax by Port Kembla workers that he is now trying to forget that he was even there, which, of course, is probably not a difficult thing to do when you reside in a multimillion dollar mansion by the sea—the same sea that, if you believe some of his spin, is supposed to be about to engulf people who allegedly are still silly enough to live in coastal areas.


Of course, the implementation of a carbon tax would be bad enough if the situation were not so dire in the first place. Under Labor we have seen 550 manufacturing jobs disappear every week. That is a figure that we should all remember: 550 manufacturing jobs disappear every week. Around one in every 12 manufacturing workers across Australia have lost their jobs since Labor came to power. But Labor are not happy with that figure; they want to accelerate it even further. So much for the former Prime Minister's 'working families' of the 2007 election. They now want to create 'unemployed families'.


Not only do they want to pummel manufacturing with a carbon tax; the Prime Minister in her arrogance is so out of touch that when she is asked, 'How will manufacturing survive?' she says, 'Oh well, they'll innovate; they'll keep up.' I suppose she just wants them, like lobotomised zombies, to say, 'Yes, we'll go along with this.' All she has to do is go out and speak to those union members who work in manufacturing. Why doesn't she have the guts to go from one end of the country to the other and speak to those businesses? Do not believe the coalition; believe those workers that you say you represent—while in your arrogance, in your ivory tower, you are so aligned to the Greens.


You have no idea, Prime Minister, what it is to have a modern economy. You have no idea how difficult it is for these families to survive. Not only do you want to increase their cost of living but you want to rip their jobs away from them. The Labor Party's idea is: if an industry is successful, punish it. If an industry does not toe the line, demonise and vilify it. If an industry would benefit from any serious policy reform, just shrug your shoulders and let it die.


The coalition will never shirk the serious responsibilities of reform and looking after important industries in this nation because we understand you cannot have a serious economy without a viable manufacturing sector. We will stand up and we will defend these manufacturing jobs against an ill-conceived carbon tax that will do nothing but increase emissions and export Australian jobs overseas. (Time expired)

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (16:35):  On behalf of, I hope, all members of the House, I apologise to that rather large group of visitors in the Speaker's gallery, who could take no more during the contribution by the member for Indi and walked out en masse. I cannot blame them, because that really was what I would describe as a rather embarrassing contribution to this matter of public importance. It was full of bluster, it contained no facts and was, typically, an attempt to scaremonger.


But the member for Indi was not on her own. The shadow Treasurer was not much better. I do excuse him just a little. He used his contribution to say something about the national accounts, which, of course, were released today, and I would expect him as shadow Treasurer to take any opportunity he can to speak about them. So we will go easy on the shadow Treasurer. It was not a bad contribution; he tried to say a few positive things. The significant thing is that he totally ignored his own leader's MPI. We have seen from the shadow Treasurer this week, mainly via his rather interesting contribution by way of a letter to the Australian Financial Review, that at the moment he is a bit on the fence. He does not know which way to jump at this stage because there is some heavy competition going on between the current leader and the member for Wentworth, who is seated at the table. Joe just does not know which way to jump.


That brings me to what I thought was the most embarrassing contribution of all, and that was the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition. He raised an MPI in this place on a substantial issue—it is one worth debating: a carbon constraint is the most interesting and topical issue of debate in this country at the moment—but he did not say anything about it. He came in here without one fact, with no thoughtful ideas and with no real contribution to make to the debate. Instead, he made a leadership speech full of one-liners that he was hoping would rally those sitting behind him at a crucial time for him, when he is struggling to maintain their support. The really interesting thing about him introducing the MPI on this topic is that this debate is not about climate change. It is not about whether the globe is warming. It is not even about whether man makes a contribution to that heating. Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, accepts that. He accepts it so fulsomely that he has a policy to address it. We do not like the policy and the broader Australian community will not like the policy when they come to understand it because it is a policy to tax them more and take that money and use it to subsidise the big polluters. That is something that the latter will of course greet with open arms, but there will be nothing in it to ensure that they use that money for the purposes for which it is intended. The member for Wentworth on Lateline belled the cat and made the point that this is a road to everywhere or nowhere, I am not sure which. Certainly it is a policy for which the costs cannot be controlled. We appreciate the member for Wentworth's very, very honest contribution on that topic.


I am going to share the worst kept secret in this place and that is that the Chief Government Whip has some say in who contributes to the MPI debate. I know my colleagues will be shocked, but that is a fact. Today, anticipating the lowbrow contribution we would get from the Leader of the Opposition, I thought, 'Let's have a guy from the Hunter and let's have a guy from the Illawarra.' It is interesting because the Leader of the Opposition used up—I wish I had had the clock running—at least 33 per cent of his contribution going around the electorates. 'What about the member for Hunter; what is he going to do? What about the member for such and such; what is he going to do?' I have another confession, Mr Deputy Speaker: I used to occasionally do this in opposition too. With 30 minutes to speak on a tax bill you are struggling sometimes, so you fill it up by going around each electorate and introducing a bit of politics into the debate. I know that some people listening to the debate will be shocked, but I am happy in this place to solemnly declare and confess my sins of the past, and that is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition did today.


How sad is it when the Leader of the Opposition in this country cannot come in here for 15 minutes and make a constructive contribution to the biggest debate in this country at the moment without putting in a filler, without spending five minutes of his time running a scare campaign seat by seat? I listened to the member for Throsby and I congratulate him on his response to the scare campaign from the Leader of the Opposition—that he had nothing to say, no facts. The government has not even released the detail of its policy, but do not worry, it will soon. Therefore, by definition everything the Leader of the Opposition said today has to be confected, has to be made up. There can be no other explanation for the way in which he made his contribution today.


I want to say something very important about the Hunter because, like the member for Throsby and others, the Leader of the Opposition had a bit to say about impact in certain regions. Let me let him in on a surprise: the overwhelming majority of people in the Hunter want us to do something about global warming. They want us to take a responsible approach and that is what we will do. Here is the point the Leader of the Opposition misses: the mining union and unions generally in the Hunter Valley support action on climate change. They support a carbon constraint. They want their industries to be sustainable into the future. Sensibly they are coming with us on that front.


There was bluster from the Leader of the Opposition about whether the member for Hunter has told his workers. Well, my workers tell me. My workers come to me and say, 'We want you to ensure that our jobs in the Hunter are sustainable.' Indeed, that applies to manufacturing too. There are only two real threats to manufacturing at the moment. One, as has been mentioned, is the very high Australian dollar and the other is the abandonment on the part of the coalition of a commitment to the market and to market based policies. The best thing we can do for manufacturing in this country is to put them on a sustainable footing and to introduce new opportunities through a carbon constraint world, and that is what we will do.


The other point he misses is the projections on the consumption of energy in this country into the future. The Leader of the Opposition rhetorically said, 'How many factories can you power off solar?' What a ridiculous thing to say. The Hunter produces something like 80 per cent of New South Wales electricity consumption. In the future New South Wales will need all the coal fired and gas fired electricity we can produce in the Hunter, but it will need to keep up with the demand of significant renewable energy as well. The Hunter is very, very well placed. We already have a foot in the door on solar. We have had solar in the Upper Hunter for some time now. We have the expertise. The Prime Minister spoke during question time about the significant investment we are making in solar in the Hunter Valley. The experts who determine these things have come to the conclusion that the Upper Hunter is the second best geographical region in the country for geothermal energy. What a great opportunity for the Hunter. Wind-mapping done by New South Wales demonstrates that the Upper Hunter around Scone is, I think, the second best place in New South Wales for wind technology. These are big opportunities for the Hunter. Even if there are still some sceptics on the other side, they should ask themselves this: even if you do not believe in climate change, even if you do not believe in man's contribution, why is it that a number of big polluters continue to pump their pollution into the sky without charge but that when the member for Wentworth goes to the council tip with his box trailer, having done the clippings around his stately mansion, he has to pay the council for the right to dump that waste? Why is it that small business people in this country—and those who produce waste; maybe a plumber who ends up with significant waste at the end of a working day—have to pay the local council tip when they go to the dump yet the polluters continue to freely emit their pollution including carbon into the atmosphere? That is a distortion of the market and the government will remove that distortion and produce economic efficiencies in those markets. (Time expired)

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (16:45):  I conclude my remarks on the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. It is true that all we have gotten from Labor's so-called reforms in health has been overblown promises, overblown spending and new layers of bureaucracy, one after the next. Let us hope the legislation before us to make changes in the aged-care sector is more successful. There is provision for a review to be conducted in 2014-15. Aged care needs supportive policy. Currently it is overregulated, underfunded and facing huge challenges. I note that the explanatory memorandum for this bill states that it is difficult to quantify the regulatory impact of these amendments. This remains an ongoing concern for the coalition. This is a government that imposes additional regulatory burden on industry at every turn. The aged-care sector has almost been regulated to death. For those reasons I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:


(1) notes:


(a) objection to the growing burden of regulation being placed on the aged care sector by this Government and its impact on the ability of providers to make available affordable aged care places; and


(b) that the Government has broken its election promise to repeal one regulation for every new regulation; and


(2) calls on the Government to immediately adopt the Coalition’s commitment to reduce Commonwealth regulation by at least $1 billion per year.""

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:47):  I speak in support of the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. I take issue with what the member for Dickson was saying about what we are doing on aged care because we are strengthening protections for accommodation bonds paid by care recipients to providers of residential and flexible aged-care services. We are taking steps in a massive way to support the aged-care sector. The aged-care sector has never received such a large sum of money in any budget than it has in this budget. We are providing assistance to the aged-care sector in a big way. We are supporting a review on aged-care services in this country. The Productivity Commission handed down its draft report on 21 January this year and we are seeing significant interest in that and from the aged-care sector.


We are making sure that we have a sustainable sector. We are making sure that we have opportunity for people in their senior years to get the best quality care, that people have choice and that people have decency and support from good qualified nurses, nurse aides, doctors and care workers in that sector. We are also very committed to making sure that the workers in that sector have decent and affordable wages and conditions.


The member for Dickson was very critical of our performance on aged care. He quoted the Grant Thornton analysis of aged care. It is interesting because back in 2006-07 Grant Thornton examined what went on under the Howard coalition government. The member for Dickson pointed this out, failing to tell those who might be listening that the coalition government was in power at that time. Grant Thornton prepared a financial analysis based on data obtained from financial information from the Department of Health and Ageing. Grant Thornton found that 40 per cent of all providers of aged care reported a loss in residential aged care. Net profit per bed fell by 30 per cent from 2005 to 2006—those opposite were in government at that time—and the annual average net profit per bed was around $1,700, a return of less than 2.5 per cent.


So let us not come up with this furphy that somehow there was some sort of aged-care nirvana during the time they were in government. In fact, the aged-care portfolio was a bit like the Northern Ireland of politics in the UK because Prime Minister Howard took the view that he would put people like the current member for Sturt in the portfolio—people he did not really like. We saw plenty of people over there who are not really too au fait with the portfolio. We saw a revolving door of about seven different ministers across about 11 years. The aged-care sector was up in arms about this.


I can recall meeting with the Aged Care Alliance in Queensland before the 2007 election when they were just absolutely livid with the performance of the coalition government. A number of backbenchers opposite were clearly of the view—they knocked on the door of the then member for Bennelong, the then Prime Minister John Howard—that more support should be provided. This was a constant refrain in the Courier Mail and the media back home in Queensland. So let us not perpetuate and perpetrate a myth about the commitment to aged care from the coalition. I look forward to what the Productivity Commission has to say when it releases its report at the end of June this year because the draft report was creative and innovative. I see the member for Ryan across the chamber. She and I both spoke at an aged-care breakfast in Brisbane about this topic some months ago where, as she would know, people from the aged-care sector were looking forward to the liberty and to a more sustainable, flexible and financially viable sector. We welcome the Productivity Commission's draft report. I have to confess I actually have read that report, all 507 pages. The Productivity Commission has made it clear that we need to make reforms in this area. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing have made it clear that this item is very high on the second term agenda of the government.


The legislation that is before the House today will make a number of important reforms that I think go towards transitioning aged care to the point where we look at, act upon and take seriously the suggestions of the Productivity Commission and its recommendations. The bill will make amendments which limit the permitted uses for accommodation bonds taken after 1 October 2011, such that providers of aged care may still use bonds for capital improvements to aged-care services and prudent financial investments but may not use bonds for operational purposes. The bill provides a two-year transition period to allow time for the sector to adjust to the new arrangements. Bonds are of course paid in low care and not in high care, which is a more hospital-like environment for people who are suffering from severe illness and disability.


The average person who goes into a high-care facility is about 84 years of age. We have about 170,000 people in residential aged-care facilities across the country, but a million Australians interact with the aged-care sector and we are putting about $50 billion into that sector across the forward estimates. A million people often get home and community care. On the Extended Aged Care at Home Dementia packages: I have been arguing for some time, in my electorate for a start, that there should be more aged-care packages. I am pleased to see that recently my representation has been successful with further packages for Blue Care in the upper part of the Brisbane Valley around Lowood. I warmly welcome the representation from Peter Conaghan in relation to that. Peter has been a terrific advocate as the Service Manager, Community, at Blue Care in Lowood.


These amendments will also remove restrictions on the use of income derived from bonds, retention amounts and accommodation charges. This will give an unrestricted source of income to aged-care providers. I spent 14 years on the board of Queensland Baptist Care and acted as a lawyer for many aged-care providers. In fact, when I spoke at the event that the member for Ryan also attended, I saw in the audience quite a number of the clients I represented when I was in private practice as a lawyer.


The aged-care sector is crying out for reform. The amendments in this legislation are transitional, but they make clear the sources of income. It is always difficult to invest in capital infrastructure to build the best kind of facility and to have that ready source of income. So I welcome the ACFI funding that we have put in during the last few years, which has given further assistance to those in aged care and made a ready source of money available to assist people.


The challenges in this sector are so great. By 2050 we will have 2.7 Australians working for every person over the age of 65. That is what the third intergenerational report says. The increase in costs in aged care will be three times what the increase will be in health funding. That is the challenge we face. About five Australians now work for every person over the age of 65 years. The intergenerational report indicates the rate of growth is enormous. About seven in 10 women and about five in 10 men reach 65 years of age and they are going to need some form of help for their domestic needs, some form of help with showering, shopping, mowing, ironing and those kinds of routine household chores.


The legislation we are debating today is about caring for the disadvantaged and the vulnerable. It is about honouring the contributions that they have made to our welfare and our wellbeing in this country. We believe that every Australian deserves the right to access good quality care. We believe it is appropriate and the measure of a decent society is how we treat our senior citizens. In my electorate of Blair we have made a significant contribution to our senior citizens. Of the $9 million used to redevelop the Cabanda aged-care facility in Rosewood, a community run aged-care facility, $1.5 million was federal government money. We have put in $5 million as an interest-free loan for the Milford Grange project in Ipswich run by RSL Care. Our transitional funding through low-interest loans has made a big difference. Older people will benefit from another 113 new aged-care places in Blair costing more than $6 million a year. This includes an allocation of 30 new residential aged-care beds. We are making a huge contribution. On 8 December, the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing announced that 12,272 new aged-care places worth more than $450 million a year will be allocated across the country. That is a huge number of people who will interact with the aged-care sector. The aged-care sector has been crying out for reform for a long, long time. It is not as if those opposite did not know about the need to reform the aged-care system, which the Productivity Commission has described as complex and difficult for people who interact with it to negotiate and navigate. They knew very well about the challenges in aged care because former Prime Minister John Howard instructed Professor Warren Hogan to undertake the Hogan review back in 2004. Professor Hogan urged radical change in the aged-care sector, but for three years the government sat on his report and did virtually nothing.


In 1997 the government made some significant change, which we acknowledge, but subsequently they refused to take up the mantle of change. They refused to be reformers. Their idea of aged care was to manage it as best they could, in a political way. They did not really commit themselves to the change they needed to make. 


The Productivity Commission's draft report Caring for older Australians has really made it clear that the Howard coalition government utterly failed with respect to aged care. It has made clear that there is great disparity in wages and conditions for aged-care sector staff; that the system is difficult for people to work out; that we need a different model, a different method, for funding the aged-care sector; and that we need a gateway agency to allow people to navigate the system, with different methods of assessment, different methods of sanction and different methods of accreditation. There is a lot to be done—the legislation here is really transitional—before that happens.


We think that making changes to the aged-care sector will improve the lot and lifestyle of our senior citizens. We think a more flexible range of care and support services will make a difference. We want to make sure there are safety and quality standards across the sector. We want to make sure that the regulatory commissions and bodies involved in it are transparent, accountable and open. We want to make sure that there is a simplified gateway that is easily understood so that assessments of care and information can be given to consumers and customers. We want to make sure that where there are gaps in service delivery we can fix them.


The legislation here is part of that process as we transition to major reform. This is a priority of a reformist Labor government. The fact that we have to do it is testimony to the failure of those opposite who, for 11½ years, fudged and fumbled aged care because they did not have the wisdom or wit to do the reform that needed to be undertaken.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,9,1,speech
"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (17:02):  Aged care in Australia is a topic that confronts and challenges us all. I spoke in my maiden speech about the importance of social connectedness and active ageing. To put the potential impact of an ageing population into perspective, it is worth noting the statistics. By 2050, one in two voters will be aged over 50 and by 2055, 78,000 Australians will be aged over 100. We need to acknowledge not only the cost but also the potential benefits of age. Australians aged over 55 contribute an estimated $74.5 billion per annum through voluntary, unpaid and caring work. We must not dismiss their enormous contribution and potential. That is our challenge.


The government is not meeting this challenge. We are here today debating yet another amendment—another stop-gap measure; a bandaid solution—that still does not resolve the bigger issue. The government came to the 2007 election claiming 'new directions for frail and older Australians' and claimed that it would make the transition from hospital to aged care a priority. Yet the reality is: another Labor priority policy area; another Labor government failure.


After delivering so little for this sector during its first term, this Labor government refused to commit to any substantial reform during last year's election campaign, leaving aged care to be swept under the rug once again. This government has failed to make the tough decisions needed in the aged-care sector, yet again dodging the key issues and then passing the buck to the Productivity Commission inquiry. The findings of this inquiry will not be released until after the 2011-12 budget, providing the government with yet another excuse to delay any real action in this vital area.


This amendment bill aims to strengthen consumer protection for accommodation bonds paid to aged-care facilities as well as to improve the arrangements for the handling of complaints about Commonwealth funded aged-care services. Given the recent experience of one of my constituents, I agree with the government that at the very least there are major issues within this area that need to be addressed. Ms Linda Fitzgibbon recently contacted my office to share her experience when dealing with an aged-care facility. Ms Fitzgibbon placed her two elderly parents into care last year, paying an upfront accommodation bond of $300,000 for each parent—$600,000 in total up-front just for the bond—in addition to the fees she would be paying for their care.


As Ms Fitzgibbon points out, she was lucky to have been able to afford this outlay up-front, as the interest charged on paying this bond off over time was, at that point, over seven per cent per annum. Sadly, she has lost both her parents over the course of the past year, her mother in September and her father in March. During this grieving and stressful time she also faced, due to circumstances beyond her control, a delay in her parents' wills going to probate. 


As you would appreciate, this was a very distressing time for Ms Fitzgibbon. That stress was compounded by the fact that, due to the delay in the will going to probate, the aged-care facility would not release her parents' accommodation bond. Unfairly, neither was that bond earning interest at the same rate that the constituent would have been charged had she not paid that bond up-front. That rate has now increased to 8.94 per cent. With this in mind, I do find the proposals to strengthen consumer protection for accommodation bonds and improve arrangements for the handling of complaints to be warranted, and we on this side will continue to support sensible policy measures. It will help to curb aged-care facilities investing these accommodation bonds—substantial amounts of money—in high risk investments, reducing the possibility of the bond being lost. The proposals will also, hopefully, encourage aged-care providers to upgrade their facilities for residents, which I am sure residents and their families would appreciate.


But the question we must ask is: why is this happening within the aged-care industry? It is happening because the sector does not receive enough support from the government. As the Productivity Commission report stated, the aged-care industry is close to crisis, with 40 per cent of aged-care providers operating in the red as at June 2010. Yet the population of over 85-year-olds, the main users of aged care in Australia, is set to swell from 400,000 in 2007 to 1.6 million by 2047. Increasingly, seniors are struggling to access the care that they want, they need and they deserve, with 2,000 aged-care beds and 786 bed licences lost since 2007 alone. The government clearly have not faced the reality of our ageing population and they do not appreciate the dedicated and committed individuals working in aged-care facilities. Aged-care nurses on average earn 20 to 30 per cent less than their acute-care colleagues.


Whilst the amendments we discuss today are both needed, they are not enough. This government's entire treatment of the sector is simply inadequate. Those in the industry have already raised the alarm that the system is difficult to navigate, confusing and underfunded. The whole industry is already overregulated, yet here we are today discussing stopgap regulation but not real reform. Back in 2007 the government promised to cut one regulation for every one it introduced—one in, one out. So the obvious question is: what is being cut today? The answer to that is: nothing. It is yet another broken promise of this Labor government. In fact it has introduced 220 new regulations for each one it has repealed. Indeed, rather than reducing regulation, the only cut this government has made is a cut to funding for the sector. The assistive technology in community care initiative was cut and, as a result, there is restricted access to vital technology which could assist older Australians in their homes. We have also seen cuts to hearing services through the introduction of a threshold, and funding cuts to preventative measures that assisted our older Australians to keep fit and healthy, increasing the financial burden on the government purse and, sadly, reducing support for our senior citizens. On top of that the Labor government applied one of their most simplistic and lazy 'saving' measures: freezing indexation payable to aged-care providers in the 2009-10 budget, thereby cutting approximately $910 million over four years. The government continues to fail our aged-care sector and therefore fails our seniors, in turn fails their families and then fails our young Australians—for it is our young Australians who will bear the responsibility and the cost in the future for rectifying this neglect. 


The amendments today are a bandaid step, but we need genuine reform if we are to support aged care in Australia. It must be done responsibly and it must be done soon. Aged care is in crisis, and the financial viability and associated issues are of vital importance. As Mike Woods of the Productivity Commission said:


… the system is expected to provide care to over 3.6 million older Australians by 2050. It is inevitable that government expenditure will rise. The challenge is to reform the system, while keeping that expenditure within sustainable limits. 


The more we fail now, the greater the problems for future generations. The more costs and pressures we place now on the aged-care industry, and by extension the health system, the greater the burden we place on future generations. Failing in aged care affects so many facets of our economy and has far-reaching consequences which this government refuses to face. To quote Abraham J. Heschel: 


A test of a people is how it behaves towards the old. It is easy to love children. Even tyrants and dictators make a point of being fond of children. But the affection and care for the old, the incurable, the helpless are the true gold mines of a culture.


Mr Deputy Speaker, let us begin to apply this philosophy to our aged-care sector.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Government Whip) (17:12):  I rise to support the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011 and I commend the minister on bringing this matter to the parliament. A compassionate and responsible aged-care sector is, quite frankly, the hallmark of a modern society. When we look at the costs associated with maintaining that sector I know they sometimes appear horrendous, but one of the things that strikes me these days is that we have seen huge changes, particularly with respect to the standards of accommodation and lifestyle which are associated with aged-care facilities. One of the reasons for that is not just that it is what society expects for its aged community; it is what we expect for our parents. If you personalise that point, it is what we are looking forward to for the care of our mums and dads—and I suppose we might possibly inherit that degree of care from our kids as well—and it shows that there is a reason why we constantly review, upgrade and look forward to progress being made in this sector. We pride ourselves on advancing our own standards of living and lifestyle, and clearly in taking care of our aged these things are no less important. That is the hallmark of a modern society and a modern community, which we are all very happy to support. That is the reality of the position. In my electorate I have—as, no doubt, every member has—a number of aged-care facilities. I take the opportunity to visit them regularly. I would like to mention two that I have been to very recently. One is the Cardinal Stepinac Village and the other is the Indo-Chinese Elderly Hostel. They are fantastic organisations. These organisations cater for a significant ethnic population in my electorate. I have mentioned many times that my electorate is the most multicultural electorate in the country. The work that those two organisations do—Cardinal Stepinac Village with respect to the Croatian community and the Indo-Chinese Elderly Hostel with respect to the Indochinese population—is extraordinary. A lot of the residents have limited English. That has not always been the case. Regrettably, as people grow old and with the onset of dementia, a lot of people return to their original tongue. Hence, these two facilities cater very significantly to the ethnic aspects of the elderly in my electorate.


I would like to refer to Harry Tang and his team. Harry is the President of the Indo-Chinese Elderly Hostel and Veronica Hon is the CEO. They do a wonderful job. As a consequence, the government rewarded them only recently with approval for another 32 aged-care beds as part of the second round approval process. That is significant in my area, particularly around Bonnyrigg where they are located. When I was at Cardinal Stepinac Village the chief executive officer, Matt Smolcic, presented me with a cheque for $40,000 to top up the Premier's Disaster Relief Appeal in Queensland. I thought that what the Croatian community did was pretty good—that they still thought about others.


Getting back to the bill—I know I have digressed—these amendments will strengthen consumer protection around accommodation bonds and will make the processing of complaints easier and probably more flexible as that applies in this sector. In particular, it will amend the Aged Care Act to address the current legislative inadequacies around accommodation bonds in aged-care facilities. It will go a long way to clearing up the confusion and uncertainty—certainly in the minds of some of the industry operators but, more particularly, in the minds of residents and families of residents—about what these bonds can and cannot be used for.


Bear in mind that these bonds are a form of interest-free loans to operators. They are certainly worth a significant amount of money and it is only right that we protect the consumer—often that is the family of the aged-care recipient—make sure that their investment is protected and that the money is used for proper processes. As I understand it, when the bonds were introduced in 1997, they were designed to apply to infrastructure—the bricks and mortar associated with accommodation. However, since then, without prescription provided by the legislation, there has been the opportunity for some operators to use the money, which has effectively been held in trust for recipients, to do other things. This bill is designed to bring it back to what these bonds were originally intended to do. The bill gives greater clarity in that respect. It will ensure that what the bonds in the aged-care sector are for—the money is held in trust—and what the bonds can be used for by the operator is clearly understood. The amendment, which will take effect on 1 October 2011, will make it clear to all operators, residents and, in particular, the families of residents that the bonds are to be used strictly for capital improvement and not, under any circumstances, used for other operational purposes.


The two-year transition period will give the aged-care providers the opportunity to prepare for the changes. In addition, the compliance and enforcement regime will change under these provisions. That will be enhanced around these bonds. It will introduce new offences where misuse of funds has been identified. It will also provide for new and better information-gathering powers for the department to follow up on when there are complaints or allegations of misuse of accommodation bonds.


The second aspect of the bill removes restrictions on the use of income derived from accommodation bonds, which technically gives aged-care providers an unrestricted source of income. The amendments to the Aged Care Act will strengthen and improve the compliance scheme in the aged-care area. It will replace the investigation principles with a new complaints based principle. That will broaden the department's scope for dealing with and following up on concerns.


At present the department is limited to only being able to investigate complaints and establishing whether a breach of the act has occurred. If that is proven to be the case, it would go down the prosecution route and adversarial aspects in terms of compliance with the act. This amendment will make the scheme more flexible. It will introduce the aspect where the department can employ a wide range of mechanisms to assist in resolving complaints, not waiting until there has been an established breach of an act. Those mechanisms include early resolution, conciliation and mediation to work in collaboration with residents, families of residents—the complainants in this case—and the operators of an aged-care facility. At the end of the day, it is not in our interests or the department's interests to establish a prosecutorial regime. We want to show leadership in the standards and the services that are being administered by aged-care providers, and we want their obligations to be understood not only by the providers but also by the residents and the families of the aged. This will lend greater flexibility in trying to resolve issues so that people can undertake their work—that is, to look after the aged.


These recommendations came out of an independent report commissioned by the then Minister for Ageing, Justine Elliot, into how the industry responded to concerns. I acknowledge the former minister's good work and I wish her well in her new portfolio. For what it is worth, I think she applied herself diligently in the ageing portfolio with a view to making a difference for the people in aged care.


The last element of the bill will make some minor operational changes to remove the redundant provisions of the Aged Care Act. These amendments were developed through extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including aged-care providers, residents and their families, and aged-care advocacy groups. These amendments will get the balance right. That is not to say that once we pass this bill everything will come to a stop, because this is an ongoing reform of aged care. Changes will obviously occur from time to time, but we are trying to make sure that the administration of our aged-care residents reflects the contemporary standards that one would expect in a society such as ours.


We intend to protect residents and their families from unscrupulous operators. There are profits to be made in this area, there is no question about that. It is not simply an altruistic industry. We want to make sure that people do not cut corners that prejudice the lifestyle of residents. As a consequence, continued monitoring of this industry will be needed and that is why a further review will take place two years after these changes are implemented.


As I said, we are setting about to protect the community from unscrupulous operators, but that is not meant to cast aspersions on all of the good operators out there who are the vast majority. However, where operators and their senior staff abuse the rights of others we need to be able to give a level of assurance to the aged and those who effectively fund the accommodation bonds. This government will do all we can to support Australians who are being cared for in aged-care facilities and to support the industry so that they can provide the highest possible standard of care to our aged. As such, the government will continuously monitor the effectiveness of these changes. As I have said, once they have been implemented there will be a subsequent review that will take place in 2014 or 2015.


The elderly certainly have the potential to continue playing a very significant role within our community and that is why we need greater flexibility in aged care. One of the things that drives the development of the aged-care industry is what we expect for our own parents. I support these amendments because they will introduce changes that are needed, but they do need to be continually reviewed. The best thing we could do to provide a greater degree of assurance for those in aged care is establish mechanisms that can quickly and appropriately address complaints instead of simply looking for breaches to prosecute in the courts. I think these amendments will take us a long way down that track. I think it shows that we are committed to making sure that the processes work not only on paper but also in ways that fundamentally deliver good results for the aged-care sector and, more importantly, for those who are cared for in the aged-care sector. I commend the bill to the House.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (17:27):  I am very pleased to speak on the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. As previous speakers have mentioned, this bill introduces a number of amendments to the Aged Care Act 1997 which are part of the reform agenda to strengthen consumer protection for accommodation bonds paid to aged-care services and to improve the arrangements for handling complaints about Commonwealth funded aged-care facilities. If this bill is passed it is proposed that the reforms regarding accommodation bonds for approved providers will take effect after 1 October 2011 and the new complaints mechanisms will take effect on 1 September 2011. I am sure that my colleagues have already mentioned that there will be a transition period, so I will not just repeat what everyone else has said about these matters.


There was a need for reform because things have happened with accommodation bonds. The original policy was that they were to be used for capital funding for investment in the building of stock; however, the principal amount of the accommodation bond was not clearly articulated in the legislation. In other words, the act needed clarification and that is what this bill does. It makes it clear that bonds must not be used for purposes other than those related to providing aged care to recipients. The bill also provides that, where a bond is charged, the approved provider is entitled to income derived from that bond and the principal can be deducted from it for specific purposes. The bonds were generally invested in deposit-taking institutions, such as banks et cetera, but they did venture into other areas, such as credit unions, syndicates and other sorts of trusts. There has been a very wide use of bonds and there has been a lack of consistent interpretation regarding permitted uses of bonds. There have been a number of anomalies which have been identified by the Department of Health and Ageing. These included using accommodation bonds to make loans to related parties, related entities and individuals, and failing to meet existing prudential standards relating to bonds.


Grant Thornton, in his Aged care performance survey in November 2007, found that 40 per cent of all providers were operating in the red. Without going through all the issues, that is why we are here today. Let us get on to some of the real issues in relation to why there is a crisis in aged-care funding. I suspect that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, would be the only one who has been in this House long enough to know that in 1997 there was a massive argument in this House about the charging of bonds and it essentially brought down the minister of the day, the member for Pearce. She was attacked roundly by the member for Jagajaga for trying to charge accommodation bonds where it related to the family home.


I will not revisit that whole experience, other than to say that we supported sensible arrangements to charge bonds because no government can afford the growing aged-care industry capital spending that is required. There needs to be a blend of funds from government, the investment sector and individuals. As we know, at that time, many people entering aged-care facilities had a home and they could have used the value of that home to help provide capital for accommodation by providing a bond to the aged-care facility. But that proposal was not supported, and people like Francis Sullivan from the Catholic association helped the Labor Party opposition at that time savage us over this issue.


There are still massive underspends in what is required for aged-care accommodation. I see on the opposite side of the House the former minister for aged care. I am sure as she travels around this country she would hear—as all members hear in their electorates—that they are desperate for funds in this area. At the moment, there is not only a crisis but also a massive underspend because these facilities cannot create a business case. I have met with my aged-care providers, and earlier this year the member for Hasluck and I met a delegation of aged-care providers at Amaroo Village in Perth. We met with David Fenwick—who is very vocal on these issues—Trudi Hodges, from Dale Cottages, and a number of other providers. They said that we had to do something about supporting their parlous situation and they wanted us raise this issue in the parliament—and this debate gives me the opportunity today.


What is happening in Western Australia—and it is happening right across Australia—is that they are handing back the allocation of funds for beds and they are handing back licences because they cannot make a business case. Charitable organisations, churches, community based aged care et cetera cannot make a business case at the moment. As a result, they are experiencing real problems trying to expand or even do with what they have now.


I feel very, very chastened because during the election campaign I visited one of my aged-care facilities, the Graceford Hostel, an independent living facility in Byford in my electorate, and they pleaded with me: 'Mr Randall, can you do something about helping us?' While showing us through the home, they said, 'We are in a desperate situation here for a whole number of reasons: we are swamped by regulation, we are swamped by the massive amount of compliance and we can't get aged-care nurses.' They are not very well paid. I think they are 30 per cent under the average nursing payment ratio, particularly agency nurses. They cannot get qualified nurses or even nurses who want to work in the sector. As you know, Western Australia has a shortage of labour in a whole range of areas, and this is exacerbated in the aged-care area. This home had no ability to get capital funding to expand the services even though they had a massive waiting list.


All of these aged-care facilities are asking me, 'Can you help us?' One of the things that they came up with at the forum that I attended with the member for Hasluck was: 'If there is all of this money being offered for beds—and 2,000 in Western Australia alone have been handed back—obviously there is a massive underspend in that area because they are not taking them up.' They said—and I am sure that the member for Hasluck will corroborate this—'If there is this massive underspend and the money is not getting out the door, why can't you cobble it together and put out more per bed to make a business case out of it, because at the moment the amount per bed just will not make a business case for any organisation that wants to invest in age care?'


What is the end result to this? In 2007, Kevin Rudd said that he would end this logjam in hospitals, where aged people were being parked up in hospitals. He was going to do something about it, but it never happened. It did not happen through the Rudd years and it certainly has not happened through Prime Minister Gillard's years. There is a logjam and people, particularly in rural and regional areas, are getting parked in hospitals rather than going into aged-care facilities. The residents at Quambie Park in my electorate are so frustrated that Ken Landwehr, the CEO, sent me a petition from them. It said:


Let Canberra know about the needs of older Australians—their right to quality care and support now and in the future.


This is how desperate they are.


Pam Corker and Quambie Park have actually opened a further expansion of their dementia facilities. But they did this largely through legacies left to them by former residents and the community. The strange thing about it is that the legacy left to them by one of their former residents made it more difficult for them to get ongoing and recurrent funding. They were told, 'You have too much money.' The system is just not flexible enough. Since the Labor Party has taken over, compliance has, if anything, increased and made it harder for people to get on and do the actual job of nursing. In addition to compliance, as I said, you cannot make a business case out of the funding available.


The tsunami is coming and this government is not prepared for it. In 2007, there were 400,000 people over 85—1.7 per cent of the population. There will be 1.6 million people in this age group by 2047—that is the size of the aged-care exercise that is heading our way. In addition to that, the growing incidence of dementia means that specialist facilities have to be built—in other words, more capital funding. In 2009, 245,000 people were deemed to have dementia. By 2030, it is predicted that there will be 591,000 and the prediction for 2050 is a staggering 1.13 million. And yet this is an underfunded area. It is not a priority of the Gillard government; aged care is not a priority area for the Labor Party at all. In fact their failure to act is indictable. 


We have an ageing population. In 2007, there were six working people to support every person aged 67 and over; by 2047, there will be only 3.2 people for each aged person. So where is the plan for the future? Where is the investment for the future in this sector? That is what aged-care providers in my electorate are asking me to raise here. At their meeting with the member for Hasluck and me, they even asked: 'Can you get someone to have the courage to look at the housing situation again? Obviously any way of freeing up capital for aged-care facilities, nursing homes et cetera would be a blessing for us, because we cannot make a go of it.' As I said, rather than expanding their services, many of them now are reducing their services or even selling them. Who is buying them? It is the large aged-care providers in Australia. There are economies of size, but you do not get the same level of care from these large providers as is provided by the hands-on community aged-care facilities found in many suburbs and rural and regional areas. Ageing in place? That is ideal and it should happen. Without economies of scale, however, it is harder.


I say in the House today to the government: investment in this area has not so far been a priority of yours. While we were in government under John Howard, we made it a priority and we certainly made sure that there was accreditation and that standards were lifted. We are asking you, on behalf of the aged and frail of Australia, to finally get off your hands and do something about getting funding into this sector. (Time expired)

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (17:42):  I am delighted to speak on the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. This bill once again demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that older Australians receive the best possible care available. This bill again demonstrates that protections are in place to ensure that money paid by those entering assisted living is being returned in capital investment. These amendments will also strengthen the arrangements for managing complaints concerning facilities providing subsidised care by creating more flexibility in the resolution process.


This is not new. The Gillard government has taken a number of steps to improve aged care for older Australians and to ensure the aged-care system is both sustainable and responsive to care needs. The Gillard government will give $55.4 billion for aged care over the next four years. This year's budget will support continued investment in the aged-care industry to meet the increasing demand for services.





(Quorum formed) When entering a care facility, residents are often required to pay a bond, much like any other individual entering into an accommodation arrangement. The value of these bonds has increased to more than $10.6 billion. Currently we can see an increase in value of more than 20 per cent every year. These bonds are, in essence, an unsecured loan paid by care recipients to the approved provider. Given the significant and increasing amount of bonds, it is appropriate that care recipients can be assured that their funds are being used for the intended purposes and that there is transparency of, and accountability for, that use.


While the intent of the legislation was always that the bond would be used for capital funding, a lack of clarity in the language—being that bond money should be used for expenses related to 'providing' aged care to care recipients—has allowed some service providers to fund a wide variety of other purposes. The danger is that certain expenditure of bonds, especially those which fund day-to-day operational costs, makes having bond money on hand for repaying recipients on leaving the care facility extremely difficult. This does introduce unnecessary concern and it is resulting in a higher chance of default on these important payments.


This legislation ensures that we clearly articulate what these bonds can and cannot be used for. The legislation is not about making life more difficult for providers by taking away a potential source of income; rather, this legislation is about ensuring that what is a significant part of each resident's life savings—and we are talking about a sum of about $167,000 per individual on average—is used to provide the necessary capital improvements that are just a part of maintaining a home.


Similarly, the amendments in this bill will enshrine that these bonds can be invested in term deposit accounts and act as interest-bearing investments. While some providers have done this in the past, it was never expressly known as a possibility, as previously it did not meet the requirement that it was spent on providing care to recipients. My electorate of Robertson, and the Central Coast as a whole community, is an aged and ageing community. We do have a large cluster of young people at the other end but aged care is definitely part of the landscape of the Central Coast.


In our care facilities we have a high population of retirees who downsize from the long-held family homes in the region and use a proportion of the profit from the sale of their home to fund their accommodation bond. Often making this move into a new facility—a change at the later stages of life—can be very daunting. Whatever we can do as a government to give more certainty to those individuals will ensure that people have confidence in the sector. It is important that people have confidence. It is important they know that the facility and the management are doing the right thing and that when it is time for their bonds to be returned, the money will be available.


These amendments are for the care of recipients. These amendments are aimed at improving the quality of aged care for the care recipient through increased investment in capital works. These amendments will increase the reliability of refunding of bonds and add more transparency and more certainty to ensure that bonds are not squandered but reinvested. This certainty will, in turn, provide longer term benefits to the providers themselves. The removal of restrictions on the use of income derived from bonds will provide aged-care providers with a legitimate cash flow and will reduce the current regulatory burden.


The introduction of criminal offences, which this amendment bill provides, is a reflection of the moral importance that we as a government put on ensuring that money which is essentially 'loaned' to providers is spent properly. It is our intention to protect the rights and the interests of care recipients, who are often in a vulnerable situation. There was considerable support for the introduction of criminal penalties, and we are very aware of this from the submissions to the inquiry. Submissions urged the department to carefully structure any penalties to ensure that key personnel could not unintentionally be caught up under any new offences. The legislation was also structured to ensure that the new offences did not dissuade people from taking up roles within aged care and that offences would only apply to those individuals in the worst cases where an individual has deliberately acted in a way that has caused a provider to misuse bonds.


These changes in the legislation have received wide consultation. The government has spoken to consumer groups, peak bodies, providers of aged care and the financial services sector. A total of 33 submissions were received: six from peak industry bodies, 23 from approved providers, one from a consumer group and three from other interested organisations. It is important to note that the aged-care sector supports these changes. It is also important to note that we are not responding in panic; rather, it is a much-needed and carefully considered response to the reality that exists in our communities.


The bill provides much more clarity in the language, This will ensure that providers know precisely what they can and cannot do, and that has to be a massive improvement for aged-care recipients who are participating in transactions. The consultation period yielded a great sense of a need for this change. Providers and consumer groups all recognised the issues that currently existed within the unclear language and they all agreed that action had to be taken to review what options were available. The government was open and responsive to these needs and, with wide contribution from all those participants in the formation of the legislation, we know that we have brought the best legislation before the House.


We also do not propose to blind side the industry with these changes. We understand that there will be some immediate compliance costs with the changes, as providers make the necessary changes to their financial affairs. The government is proposing that the changes take effect from 1 October 2011 for all bonds received on or after that date. Bonds received before that date can continue to be used in accordance with the existing rules or may be used in accordance with the new rules. This ensures that the changes do not have any retrospective impact but also gives approved providers the flexibility to choose to treat all bonds in the same way.


A two-year transition period is also proposed, whereby approved providers may use bonds for existing purposes associated with aged care. This will provide the department with the data necessary to determine if further adjustments to this proposal should be made to assist the cashflow management of approved providers and will provide industry with a reasonable transition period to become familiar with these important new arrangements.


This legislation is effective in clarifying our aged-care bond system. It is absolutely effective in providing a more positive outlook for service providers and care recipients. It is a practical reform that is not based on some ideological rhetoric; rather, it is based on a genuine consideration of the needs of the system and those who use it and on the way in which accommodation bonds could and should be used. I commend the bill to the House.

"Roy, Wyatt, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (17:55):  I rise to speak to the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. The bill introduces a number of amendments that aim to strengthen consumer protection for accommodation bonds paid to aged-care service providers and aims to provide an increased focus on consumer complaint resolution and on the achievement of outcomes for complaints rather than just investigation.


The coalition will not be opposing this bill, which takes steps to protect some of the most vulnerable members of our community. However, there is so much more that needs to be done, encompassed within a framework of reform of the aged-care sector—reform that should see a vibrant aged-care sector that provides for the holistic needs of older Australians and a sector that is valued for the work that it does.


The ageing of Australia's population is undoubtedly one of the nation's biggest social challenges. Over the last two decades, the median age of the population has increased by 4.8 years, whilst over the same period the number of children aged between 0 and 14 decreased by three per cent. The first cohort of baby boomers will leave the workforce this year, but the number of young people joining it will decline. In 2007 there were seven people working to support every person over the age of 67. By 2047, this figure is expected to almost halve to 3.2 people supporting every Australian over the age of 67. Australians are expected to live longer, further increasing the pressure on the aged-care sector. More and more people are expected to live well into their 80s. By 2047, there is expected to be an increase from 1.7 per cent to 5.6 per cent of over-85-year-olds requiring the services of our aged-care sector.


There is evidence that the aged-care sector is already struggling to provide the excellent levels of care that we want for our older Australians, who have contributed so much to our community. This Labor government has delayed any meaningful reform of the sector by commissioning report after report, whose conclusions only point in one direction: a crisis in the sector. Forty per cent of aged-care facilities are operating in the red. There are a record number of provider liquidations and undersubscription to aged-care places.


In the context of the current legislation at issue, accommodation bonds payable were originally intended for capital funding. The legislation as it stands provides for the use of accommodation bonds paid for by someone going into care for the purpose of providing aged care for recipients. However, there are ambiguities around what this actually means, so accommodation bonds have been used for a wide variety of purposes, including meeting operational costs. There is no clarity around the ability of service providers to invest the money in, for example, long-term bank accounts or, alternatively, to use the money to provide loans. There is currently no data that reveals the true extent of the problem. However, anecdotal evidence from discussions with service providers indicates that bonds are being utilised for operational purposes.


At the moment there are restrictions on how an approved aged-care provider can use income derived from an accommodation bond. However, the restrictions that currently apply do not reflect the comparative risk and create a situation whereby the administrative burden of the regulations may impact on cashflow, thereby increasing the possibility that bonds may be used for operational expenses. The financial viability of the aged-care sector is a major issue, an issue that will only gain greater prominence in Australia. In its 2011-12 budget submission, the Aged Care Industry Council stated that a snapshot of the industry at the start of 2011 indicates a sector that is unsustainable. Hours of service are decreasing, hours of care provided under Community Aged Care Packages are decreasing, new residential care beds are not being built, many services are not operating at a profit and liquidations have increased.


At a time when Australia is likely to see increasing demand for aged care, the sector is struggling. In 2008-09, 2,000 beds were cut in the aged-care approvals round, and industry is rejecting government funded beds. The last two aged-care rounds were undersubscribed, as opposed to the situation under the coalition government, where aged-care places were prized. Providers are handing back licences, and beds are being left empty, with older Australians having to wait longer for a bed and travel greater distances. This is particularly the case in rural Australia.


In my electorate, this is an issue for the community. I have had to deal with several cases of older constituents waiting for months in hospital beds because there is no other place for them to go. This is not representative of a system that recognises the holistic needs of individuals. If people from Bribie Island in my electorate are in hospital in Brisbane, their partners have to commute for up to three hours a day to visit them. This has the obvious effect of causing social dislocation and isolation. It also has the effect of placing extra pressure on an already overcrowded public hospital system. This situation is causing distress and anxiety in my community.


This legislation is designed to increase regulations on the amount of accommodation bond principal; however, it will reduce the regulations on income derived from the bond, retention amounts and accommodation charges. The regulation would then better reflect the risk associated with the principal. This would permit improved oversight of the bond, which is effectively an interest-free loan made by a resident, and other sources of income derived from the approved provider. Permitted uses for the accommodation bond would be limited to the original policy intent of providing funding for increased investment in capital works, in certain products and to pay debt related to the provision of aged care. From talking to local aged-care providers, it would seem that it is the provision of capital-intensive mortar and bricks that provides the greatest financial hurdle for the sector. The Department of Health and Ageing will have increased information-gathering powers to ensure that service providers that might be at risk are able to repay accommodation bonds.


Because the sector is struggling and aged-care providers have had to go into liquidation, the Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme has been utilised to the tune of $24.5 million, meaning around 150 accommodation bonds. This legislation proposes that there be new penalties introduced for approved providers that use bonds for non-permitted purposes that might trigger the guarantee scheme. While this is a step forward in safeguarding the contributions of older Australians and making the sector more financially viable, there is more that needs to be done.


Unfortunately, as in many other areas of government policy, the Labor government's record is littered with broken promises. For example, the attraction and retention of nurses in the aged-care sector is becoming increasingly difficult. However, despite promises of a fix, Labor recruitment policies have failed. The Bringing Nurses Back into the Workforce Program was abolished, with the program delivering only 139 nurses out of a promised 1,000 by February 2010. In 2009-10, only 8,200 out of 13,100 training places for aged-care workers had been delivered. Of the 2,000 transition places promised, only 698 had become operational by April 2010.


The bill is also designed to improve complaints handling by changing the focus to resolution of complaints rather than just their investigation. It is intended that the handling of aged-care complaints will be improved, with an increased focus on the achievement of outcomes for care recipients, their families and other representatives. A range of approaches such as mediation, conciliation and investigation will be employed by the Department of Health and Ageing to resolve complaints cooperatively with care recipients and providers of care. This should go some way to reassuring care recipients and their families that issues relating to their care will be dealt with rather than just investigated, and as such the coalition welcomes the change.


The coalition is committed to providing the highest possible standards of aged care. We believe that this is one way of giving back to those who have contributed so much to this country in the past and continue to contribute in a number of ways. My electorate is full of senior people who continue to make a full and meaningful contribution to the community. Some of them have the time and are able to volunteer in various ways that provide invaluable support for the community. However, there are those that are more vulnerable and require different levels of care. These people and their families should expect and receive the very highest possible standards of care. Whilst this bill is a step in the right direction, the whole aged-care sector is in need of serious attention, not just tinkering around the edges.


The Labor government has failed the aged-care sector and with it many of our most vulnerable senior Australians. The coalition, on the other hand, remains committed to the provision of $935 million over a four-year period in order to provide for the increasing challenges the aged-care sector will face as there is increasing demand for its services from an ageing population. Central to the coalition policy is the development of an aged-care provider agreement with the aged-care sector that will be designed to reduce red tape and paperwork so that medical professionals can actually get on with the job of providing care rather than jumping through bureaucratic hoops. The agreement would provide more certainty for older Australians and those involved in their care.


For a start within this coalition policy the agreement would see the provision of $50 million over four years for professional aged-care programs and services. There would be payments of $30,000 for 3,000 aged-care places as part of the implementation of the aged-care bed incentive program. Importantly, the coalition would work cooperatively with the aged-care sector in order to identify areas of greatest need in order to establish a framework for the allocation of the places. As with many other areas in health, the coalition believes that it is the people on the ground and in the communities, not bureaucrats in Canberra, who are best placed to know and make decisions about what is needed. Importantly for my community, the coalition has promised to establish a convalescent care program, with funding of $300 million over four years to assist up to 20,000 Australians waiting in hospital to return home. As I mentioned before, this is an issue that has been raised with me on many occasions by the senior members of my community who are waiting for months to return home and are impeded from doing so because there is no-one able to care for them. The convalescent care program would provide up to 21 days in a residential aged-care facility, relieving pressure on our hospitals and adding to aged-care providers' funds. Uncertainty is plaguing the aged-care sector and the coalition's plans for an aged-care provider agreement would provide much-needed certainty for aged-care providers with the added benefit of increasing security of employment in the aged care workforce.


Labor has neglected the needs of older Australians and the aged-care sector is in urgent need of reform to meet the coming challenges of Australia's ageing population. Older Australians have every right to feel they are going to be well cared for in their twilight years and the coalition is committed to meeting care needs now and into the future. This legislation is a step forward; however, broader reform of the aged-care sector is needed. The coalition's sustainable plan would see the needs of our seniors met and would provide a framework for the real reform the sector so urgently needs in constructive partnership with them.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (18:07):  I took great interest in listening to the member for Longman read his speech to this parliament. There were a number of items in his speech that I think really need to be dealt with. His speech demonstrated to me that he was unaware of what happened in the Howard government era. He was unaware of the lack of spot checks, the people in aged-care facilities being given kerosene baths and the total lack of receptiveness of the Howard government to the needs of older Australians. He talked about the aged-care sector struggling. It was struggling as it was under enormous pressure at the time of the Howard government. As for reviews, we had the Hogan review. What happened following the Hogan review, a review which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was so proud of at the time?


And what of operating in the red, as he suggested? Well, I know that in the Howard government era aged-care facilities were really struggling. Time and time again the facilities people came and talked to me about the need for compensation, workers compensation, electricity, water and wages—all the issues that the Howard government ignored. As for 'unsustainable', he talked about people waiting for aged-care beds. In the Howard government era one out of every 10 beds in the Shortland electorate only existed on paper—phantom beds! I think it is beholden upon me to remind the House of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing report about the blame game that was brought down in the parliament in, I think, 2007. As a member of the committee, I spoke to a number of people who were involved in aged care and the one thing that was pointed out to me by those people was the number of people waiting for aged-care beds who were languishing in hospital because the Howard government refused to act.


Here we have before us today legislation, in the form of the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011, that is bringing about real change, legislation that strengthens protection for accommodation bonds paid by care recipients to providers of residential and flexible aged-care services—something that is good for the aged-care facilities and good for those people that make those facilities their home. I am really pleased to say that the minister at the table was previously the Minister for Ageing who was responsible for the reviews that have been bringing about the changes that we are seeing now. If it were not for her efforts, we would not have this really proactive good legislation before us today. Legislation limits the permitted use for accommodation bonds taken after 1 October 2011, so that providers of aged care can still use these bonds for capital improvements to aged-care services. That is really important for those facilities. I talk to the aged-care facilities people in my electorate on a regular basis, just as I talk to the people that live in those aged-care facilities and those people that may need those facilities in the future.


Shortland is one of the oldest electorates in the country—it is the 11th oldest electorate—and this is an issue that is very dear to my heart and I need to know that the aged-care facilities we have, and also the care that those people who choose to live in them will receive, will be outstanding. This change to the use of the bonds is really important. The fact that bonds cannot be used for operational purposes is a very important change. The introduction of the new criminal offences where there has been a significant misuse of bonds is about the government facing up to and dealing with the problem, not burying its head in the sand and hoping it will go away and not acting and so ignoring the needs of older people and the needs of the aged-care industry. This is a government that actually deals with the problem and does not mouth platitudes or make statements that just sound good. We act, we do and we address the problem. The legislation is introducing new information-gathering powers to enable the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing to better monitor approved providers that may be experiencing financial difficulties or using bonds for non-permitted uses. This will allow the department to help these aged-care providers. It is about making sure that there is continuity of aged care and making sure that older Australians have security about where they live. There is also a move to remove restrictions on the use of income derived from bonds, retention amounts and accommodation charges. This gives aged-care providers an unrestricted source of income, offsetting the proposed restrictions on the bonds. That is a really good news story. It is about making the aged-care providers more viable and, by doing that, making aged care safer and more secure for those older Australians who will require aged care over a period of time.


I referred earlier to the Parliamentary Secretary for Trade, who is at the table. On 12 April 2010, when she was the Minister for Ageing, she announced that the government would increase protection for aged-care residents' savings. She made that announcement as part of the announcement entitled 'More support for older Australians in the National Health and Hospitals Network'. She has always been committed to the needs of older Australians, and I know she also represents an electorate in this House that has an older population.


This legislation has been subjected to extensive consultation with the industry, community, government and stakeholders on the options for enhancing prudential regulation of accommodation bonds to identify the best means by which to ensure as far as possible that the financial interests of the residents are protected; to maintain effective regulatory safeguards for accommodation bonds; to provide a regulated source of capital funding for investment in aged-care infrastructure; to provide a regulatory framework that is commensurate to the risk associated with the exponential growth of accommodation bond holding; and to promote public confidence in the aged-care system. I emphasise that that last point, promoting public confidence, is very important.


Unlike the previous government, this government believes in consultation. We believe in talking to the people who will be operating the aged-care facilities. We believe in talking to those people who will be using the aged-care facilities. We also believe in talking to those people who will be regulating the facilities. This is a far cry from the type of consultation that took place in the last parliament, where there was cover-up after cover-up after cover-up, no spot checks—and now spot checks are regular occurrences—in aged-care facilities and a culture that enabled elderly people to be given kerosene baths.


As a result of this consultation process it is proposed that there will be changes to the act to strengthen the accommodation bond. This will address the lack of clarity in the act, which I think is really important, and introduce new criminal offences where misuses of bonds are identified. Once again, that is a really important change to the legislation. It is dealing with a problem that exists. It is proposed that the changes will take place from 1 October this year. There will be a two-year transition period to allow the sector to become more familiar with the new requirements, and I think that that is very important.


The other major change in this legislation involves the proposed amendments to the complaints scheme. It is proposed to amend the act to enable investigation principles which currently describe the investigation process in relation to complaints to be replaced with a complaints principle. This means that concerns relating to the delivery of residential, community and flexible aged care subsidised by the government can be investigated. They will be investigated. There is going to be a strong focus on resolution of complaints rather than investigations of complaints.


Investigating a complaint is all very well. Like me, all members of this parliament would have been visited by a constituent who had a problem with an aged-care facility. You would ring the aged-care complaints line. They would investigate it. And still that person who came to see you, more times than not, would be unsatisfied with the result. It was about investigation; it was about looking at it. It was not about dealing with the issue. It was not about resolving the issue.


These changes will allow those issues to be resolved rather than an investigation taking place that will deliver no outcome whatsoever to the person who has lodged a complaint. I think the fact that this legislation brings about a change that focuses on resolution rather than investigation is a very proactive and good change. The bill shifts the focus of the system from investigation to a more flexible scheme where the department can employ a range of mechanisms to assist to resolve a complaint, including early resolution, conciliation, mediation and encouraging the departments to resolve the issue themselves.


The changes that are outlined in this bill are essential. They come out of the government reviewing the system, looking at it and then, after consulting widely with the community and the sector, putting in place changes to the 1997 act that was introduced by the Howard government. Changes have caused quite a few problems within the community. We only have to look back to the time when the member for Mackellar was the Minister for Aged Care to see the kinds of problems that can be caused if governments do not consult widely with the community. The community and the aged-care sector need to have input into the direction of legislation, because good legislation is not imposed on a sector or on the community; good legislation is developed in consultation with all parties. I congratulate the minister for developing legislation that builds on the work of the previous minister and brings about legislation that is workable, that takes account of the interests of all parties and that will benefit those vulnerable frail aged people in the electorates of each and every member of this parliament. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (18:23):  I rise tonight to raise various points concerning the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. The first point I would like to address is that of regulation, which we are once again seeing. The merits of that regulation are yet to be tested and it is yet to be seen whether they will be worthwhile. But we are seeing regulation occurring without the government honouring its commitment of 'one regulation in-one regulation out'. This is a sector that is continually suffering from the stifling impacts of regulation, so we need to address that.


We also need to look at where the aged-care sector stands at the moment. The Rudd government came into power promising all sorts of things for this sector, but it delivered next to nothing. We then need to compare that with how the coalition would go about addressing the problems and issues confronting the aged-care sector. We have a proven track record on this. Ever since we introduced the Intergenerational Report and forecast what was going to occur with the ageing of our population we have had a policy that has fitted neatly with that budget summation as to where spending on aged care is going to go as Australia's population continues to age. I would then like to look at some of the impacts the aged-care sector is facing in my seat of Wannon and make some reference to Sea View House and a way forward on that issue at the moment.


This bill introduces a number of amendments as part of the governments health and hospital reform agenda. It plans to, and hopefully will, strengthen consumer protection for accommodation bonds paid to aged-care services. It also plans to improve arrangements for the handling of complaints about Commonwealth funded aged-care services. The government released an issues paper in October 2010 and, following submissions, undertook a series of industry and consumer stakeholder meetings. A consultation paper was released in February 2011 followed by industry, consumer and regulatory stakeholders in February and March 2011.


As part of the government's health and hospital reform agenda, it is committed to strengthening consumer protection for accommodation bonds and this is what this legislation seeks to do. If the bill is passed the reforms regarding accommodation bonds will take effect on and after 1 October 2011 and the new complaints principles will take effect on 1 September 2011. However, there will be a two-year transition period, until the end of September 2013, for the changes to the permitted use of accommodation bonds, which will allow the sector to become familiar with the new requirements. A post-implementation review will be conducted in 2014-15.


In its 2011-12 budget submission, the Aged Care Industry Council stated:


A snapshot of the industry at the start of 2011 does not depict a sustainable system: only 40% of residential aged care services are operating in the black; hours of service are decreasing; hours of care provided under community aged care packages have fallen; and many providers are not building new residential care beds. The situation is worse in rural and regional areas where providers face generally higher costs with less ability to manage their income streams.


This does not portray a sector that is heading in the right direction. This does not portray a sector that is ready to meet the ageing of Australia's population. This does not portray a sector that is going to deliver, especially for older Australians in regional and rural areas. What it does portray is a sector that is in urgent need of reform. It also portrays a sector that needs a government that will listen to it and address its problems, and this does not seem to be occurring. As a matter of fact, if there is a constant theme that I am hearing in my community and I am witnessing when I come into this place every day the parliament sits, it is that this government does not seem to want to listen to the Australian people. It has its own agenda and it seems hell-bent on forcing that agenda on the Australian people.


The difficult part about this bill is that we do not really have a clear understanding of the regulatory impact. Also, given that we are introducing more regulation, what regulation are we taking out of the aged-care sector to help it meet the incredible demands it is going to be facing in the coming years?


The coalition understands that the very best care, whether in the community or residential, should be balanced. We need a clearly articulated policy that balances the community care and the residential care. We put forward at the last election a clear policy that first admitted the reality that the ageing of the population is an enormous social challenge facing Australia. We have a rapidly ageing population, and we are seeing that played out more in regional and rural areas. Australians are living longer and, as a result, are facing more complex health conditions. Disease patterns are changing as a result of Australians living longer. We are also seeing a shift in the size and composition of households, which means that there is not the family support there once was to help Australians as they age.


What does this mean? It means that our budget cannot sustain Australia's demographic changes. The declining workforce will generate insufficient tax revenue to meet the health and aged-care demands of our ageing population. On this point, we have to look at where the Australian budget is at the moment. The budget just handed down has a deficit of $47 billion—a budget deficit the size of the whole of the Victorian budget. We do not have a government that is getting our budgetary position in place to deal with the ageing of our population. We have a government that has forgotten about the Intergenerational report and how it set out clearly what we need to do as a country to make sure we are ready to meet the ageing of our population.


We have a budget deficit forecast for next year of $21 billion. All this has led already to a net debt position of $106 billion, with repayments of $135 million per day. Imagine what that money could do if it were put into productive use in our aged-care sector. Sadly, though, we will see this money being used to repay debt and not to deal with these enormous challenges we are facing today in the aged-care sector.


In 2007 Kevin Rudd and the Labor government promised the world for this sector. They pointed out that there were issues about providing enough aged-care beds and people becoming 'blockers' of acute care hospital beds. Kevin Rudd announced that we were going to get a new direction. He promised the world. What has he delivered? As I quoted before from that damning indictment in the prebudget submission, we did not get that at all. The Aged Care Industry Council has stated that the snapshot of the industry at the start of 2011 does not depict a sustainable system—and we must work towards a sustainable system.


A key to producing a sustainable system will be making sure there is appropriate funding and also making sure we do not stifle this sector with regulation. Sadly, it is a habit of this government to try to fix every problem with regulation. Maybe it should step back and listen to some very wise advice, which is that trying to fix every problem with regulation often just creates more problems.


In visiting aged-care facilities across Wannon—in Ararat, Stawell, Casterton, Hamilton, Portland, Warrnambool and Mortlake, just to name a few—I see communities dealing with constant issues, especially workforce issues. This is not made easier by governments promising to deliver—for instance, promising to deliver new nurses, especially in regional and rural areas—and not delivering on those promises. These centres are dealing more and more with constraints on accessing the labour they need. Not only that but they then have to deal with extra regulation that requires them to have professionals with certain qualifications and does not allow them flexibility as to where they get those professionals and how often they can use them.


One of the key things for regional and rural communities is to ensure that as people age in their communities they can stay in those communities. One of the key components of the coalition's policy approach before the last election was to ensure that there was flexibility in the system to enable people to age gracefully in the communities in which they grew up. Sadly, we are not seeing that from this government. What we are seeing from this government are regulations that continually make this more and more difficult—regulations that seem to support large facilities in urban areas and do not have the flexibility to enable the smaller aged-care facilities to operate.


Finally, I will point to a very simple example. Sea View House in Portland is a 56-bed supported residential service that has had the rug pulled from underneath it by Portland District Health. At the moment it is trying to deal with the question of what will become of it. The community has rallied and is keen to buy Sea View House so that it can continue to provide services. I would like to take this opportunity to say how much I support what the community is trying to do to save Sea View House. Glenda Carswell, the spokeswoman from the community group which has been set up, the Sea View House Support Group, has been doing an excellent job to make sure that the facility can continue to provide its services to the people in residence there. They have provided bonds to make sure that they are in a situation where they can live the last parts of their lives in a very comfortable way and in an environment which they have freely chosen. The support group are doing a terrific job and I hope that they will be able to get a purchaser for that facility so that it can continue to provide its services. I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this bill.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (18:38):  The Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011 introduces a number of amendments, which form part of the government's health and hospitals reform agenda. This bill plans to improve arrangements for complaints handling of Commonwealth funded aged-care services and to strengthen consumer protection for accommodation bonds paid to aged-care services. The history of this bill is an interesting one and for once demonstrates that those on the other side sometimes consult and listen to key stakeholders. Especially on an issue as important as aged care, we would expect the government to undertake consultations. The issues paper on enhanced prudential regulation of accommodation bonds, released in October 2010, resulted in a consultation paper released in February this year, which was followed by a number of industry, consumer and regulatory stakeholders meetings with the government to work through the issues raised. 


In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander society elders are consulted because of their knowledge, wisdom and life experiences. Their guidance helps to shape our future and teaches us humility, compassion and understanding. Ageism is not a factor; nor is age. Members of this House need to fully appreciate that if we apply the same approach in our wider society then we are more likely to provide the level of aged-care services and facilities that reflect aged people's needs, including staying in their own home. It is that generation that built and continued to build this great country of ours and the lifestyle we enjoy; therefore, we should take care of them.


The current regulation around the use of accommodation bonds is not consistent throughout the industry. The Department of Health and Ageing has identified, through monitoring and compliance activity and financial reports from a range of providers, that the lack of consistency of interpretation as to the permitted uses of bonds has led to many providers misusing them. The Aged Care Act provides that if an accommodation bond is charged to the care recipient by the aged-care provider then the provider must not use the bond for a purpose that is not related to 'providing aged care to care recipients.' It also stipulates that where a bond is charged then the provider is entitled to the income derived from the bond and may also deduct retention amounts from the bond principal. However, there are restrictions on how these amounts can be used. As mentioned before, the Department of Health and Ageing has found that a number of providers are using bonds to make loans to related parties and meet operational costs, making loans to related entities and to individuals with variable practice in documenting the loans, repayment arrangements and interest charges, and failing to meet the existing prudential standards relating to bonds. Since the prudential requirements were introduced in 2006, over 15 per cent of the aged-care industry has been found to be noncompliant.


Our aged-care system is a mess under this government. According to a Grant Thornton aged-care performance survey in 2007, over 40 per cent of all providers were operating in the red. I find that fascinating in this day and age. The Aged Care Industry Council stated in its 2011-2012 budget submission:


… only 40% of residential aged care services are operating in the black; hours of service are decreasing; hours of care provided under community aged care packages have fallen; and many providers are not building new residential care beds.


This is important, because in my own electorate I have a large demographic, but part of that demographic are retirees and ageing Australians who will remain in their homes for a period until such time as they are unable to continue in independent residential living and move into a facility that will provide the levels of support that they require. In some instances those who need more intensive care move from my electorate into two other regions of the metropolitan area because the aged-care facilities that are established in our electorate do not have the capacity to meet the numbers.


This industry needs urgent help. No-one knows this better than Mr David Fenwick, in my electorate of Hasluck, who I work extremely closely with on the issues that impact on the industry. Mr Fenwick is the Chief Executive Officer of Amaroo Village in Gosnells. Amaroo provides independent living units, 92 high-level care places and 81 low-care places. Amaroo is an outstanding example of how the industry is making it work. They struggle to meet operating costs but recognise that there is a need in the area and continue to work towards the best outcomes possible for the residents.


Back in January, my colleague the member for Canning and I were presented with petitions from aged-care providers in our electorates of Canning and Hasluck. The aim of the petitions was to 'let Canberra know about the needs of Older Australians—their right to quality care and support they deserve now and in the future'. Their voices deserve to be heard. The pity is that the petitions did not meet the rigour of the requirements for petitions to be tabled in the House. Nevertheless the message was quite strong. 


The management and care team at Amaroo are passionate about their work and they deserve to be supported by governments. This is consistent in all of the aged-care facilities that I have visited in Hasluck. Instead, the government has broken its election promise to repeal one regulation for every new regulation. Red tape and bureaucracy is holding the industry back. The burden of growing regulation is a disgrace. The coalition is committed to reducing Commonwealth regulation by at least $1 billion per year. Unlike those on the other side, we want to see industry encouraged to innovate, grow and provide the best possible services to those who need them the most.


We need to be supporting the aged-care industry now because we remember that, one day, we will all most likely need to access the services provided by the aged-care industry. When we grow old and need support, the aged-care industry, and the carers and providers, who are extremely passionate, will be looking after us. Unfortunately, only when that day comes for those opposite will they realise that they should have been much more supporting of the aged-care industry than they are now. The aged-care industry is becoming financially unviable and the number of providers going into liquidation has increased. However, many are being absorbed by larger facilities, thus not giving an accurate representation of the state of the industry.


The changes proposed by this bill strike a balance between explicit regulatory requirements and a risk based approach. It is difficult to accurately quantify the regulatory impact of these proposed changes due to the lack of available data. The changes include the provision of a regulatory framework that is equal to the risk associated with the strong growth of accommodation bond holdings and the increasing of incentives for bonds to be used in a prudent and sustainable way to meet the policy objective of allowing providers to charge bonds. Further, any costs to providers due to changes to ensure that bonds are only used for permitted purposes will be minimised by removing current restrictions on the use of income derived from bonds, retention amounts and accommodation charges and giving providers complete flexibility over how such income is used. There will be a transition period of two years, which will allow approved providers time to comply with the new arrangements. The changes also ensure that the financial interests of care recipients are protected.


These proposed changes will take effect in relation to accommodation bonds taken by approved providers on or after 1 October 2011 and the new complaints principles will take effect on 1 September 2011. A two-year transition period will conclude at the end of September 2013 to allow the changes to permitted uses of accommodation bonds to take effect and to allow the sector to become familiar with the new requirements. A post-implementation review will take place in 2014 or 2015. This review will be extremely important to the industry and I certainly look forward to seeing the outcome and what the challenges are.


Another key element of this bill is the management and resolution of complaints about aged-care services. The bill proposes that the investigation principles be replaced with new complaints principles. This will provide greater flexibility for complainants and will result in a range of options being available to assist in resolving a complaint, including early resolution, conciliation and mediation. I support this measure as people accessing the industry deserve to be looked after.


In my electorate of Hasluck, there are 22 approved aged-care providers providing a total of 321 community care places, 313 residential high-care places and 610 residential low-care places. I have been privileged to visit a number of these providers and they provide outstanding service to those in Hasluck who need it. I will always fight for the needs of the aged-care sector because it is an important part of the Hasluck community. We all know someone who is accessing aged-care services and, as such, we all have a duty to stand up and argue to improve the quality of the industry. This is a passion of mine. As I stated in my first speech to the House:


Elders within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies are revered and respected, and hold a special place—they do not go away but remain as wisdom-givers and guides in our future. The same concept has to be applied to all seniors and retirees, and the support they require should be accorded to them.


In the short time I have represented the electorate of Hasluck I have enjoyed the privilege of meeting people within residential care and, equally, those who have made the decision to remain living at home. The level of support provided in the home has been welcomed; what is disappointing, though, is that where there are increasing numbers there is not the financial capital to build the infrastructure required to provide the number of beds that are needed. I hope that in the future the Productivity Commission report and the work that we do on this side will help contribute to solutions that will make a difference across this nation for our elders, who will need the services and opportunities that are provided, both socially and from the point of view of accommodation at secure facilities that provide them with a bed and the comfort of support.


I revere our seniors. I believe that they provide opportunities for us to learn of the past, to take their knowledge and use it for the future and to understand our history in this nation. When I was teaching, the school had a relationship with an aged-care home and I saw many children enjoy the relationship with older people. Those who did not have grandparents enjoyed the relationship with seniors in those villages. They liked the fact that they were talking to people who had lived through a history, where they had seen the transition from horse-and-cart days to the types of vehicles and technology that we have in this day and age. I just hope that this government gives due attention to the needs of our elderly and to aged-care services.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (18:51):  The aged-care system in Australia is rapidly approaching crisis point. The number of people over 65 is set to double over the next 20 years and the industry is desperate for additional funding particularly for capital works. There are a number of indicators that should alarm all policy-makers in this House in the provision of residential care in particular, and I would like to talk about some of these.


Last year the federal government allocated 1,564 additional residential aged-care places to Western Australia. However, only 314 of the beds were taken up—just 20 per cent. In the preceding year, of the 1,208 beds on offer, only 507 or 42 per cent were taken up in WA. What is worse, over the last three years 786 aged-care bed licences, the licence that provides the funding for aged-care beds, were handed back to the government and 283 of them were from Western Australia. We are now some 2,400 beds short of our aged-care requirements in WA. The situation is going to get worse.


This is happening at a time when the group referred to as the 'baby boomers', those born between 1946 and 1964, start to enter retirement. They are looking at retirement and at aged-care solutions. I would suggest that several members in this House right at this moment may be part of that group and may feel as though they are being made responsible for a lot of the world's problems. Some of us do, however, represent a significant increase in the ageing population, which makes the debate on how we care for our ageing community perhaps even more urgent for some members here.


In my electorate of Forrest there are around 19,000 residents over the age of 65 and that number will increase rapidly. We have 30 aged-care facilities; however, the number of facilities and their capacity has to expand as the age demographic within my electorate increases. I note that in its 2011-12 budget submission the Aged Care Industry Council stated:


A snapshot of the industry at the start of 2011 does not depict a sustainable system: only 40% of residential aged care services are operating in the black; hours of service are decreasing; hours of care provided under community aged care packages have fallen; and many providers are not building new residential care beds. The situation is worse in rural and regional areas where providers face generally higher costs with less ability to manage their income streams.


This is exactly the case in my electorate, and I would expect it is also the case in other rural and regional electorates. It is extremely difficult for aged-care providers to invest in new facilities. The financial viability of the sector is critical to the ongoing provision of appropriate aged care in this nation.


As well as the viability issue, as we engage in the debate about aged care, there are several other questions. One of them is: what is the most appropriate form of care? Historically senior members of our community were cared for by their families in the homes. While in some circumstances this may have resulted in some forms of neglect, in most cases it did not. In many countries in the world it is still the primary form of aged care. Some constituents of mine with a strong history in the aged-care sector visited Italy in recent years and did some research on the aged-care industry there. It was extremely limited, of course, because most of the aged care in Italy centred on care in the home, by the family, with the support as needed. We have some similarities. They have a baby boomer population entering retirement, as does most of the developed world. There are increasing numbers of families who can no longer care for their ageing relatives at home although Italy, as you would imagine, starts from a much lower base on this.


Most Australians want to live in their own homes as long as they possibly can. When people cannot do so, they will most certainly enter residential care but, because it will be later in life, they will be in a much more frail state with far more serious health issues, as the member for Mackellar frequently advises us. They will potentially need high care, which brings me to the bill before the House. Accommodation bonds are an acknowledgement that the individual does have some responsibility to contribute to their own aged care. The bill tightens the rules for the use of bond money. Greater certainty in the area is required, but it is another tinkering around the edges of aged-care provision. This is an industry that is overwhelmed with compliance already, yet the government is adding to that burden, and more and more resources within these facilities are being directed to compliance and less into patient care where it is so badly needed. Again, the government has broken its promise to repeal one piece of legislation and regulation for every other piece that it passes. As I said, the industry is swamped with complex, overlapping and costly regulations.


The government must also consider the specific and individual needs of smaller, community based aged-care providers such as Tuia Lodge in Donnybrook in my electorate, which is a 26-bed facility employing 30 very caring staff members. Lui Tuia has been the driving force, as the member for Mackellar knows. It has been Lui's leadership and endless volunteering, the commitment from the local community and constant community fundraising that has provided the people of Donnybrook with a great quality, caring aged-care facility. In this small community not only does Tuia Lodge provide aged care but it is one of the major employers in the town. I am told that, in general, aged care employs more people than retail. Facilities like Tuia Lodge need to be able to expand to meet the growing demands of Donnybrook. There will be an explosion in the need for high-care provision within three years in this area, but they need the capital funding to expand and, of course, it has to be a profitable outcome to proceed and be sustainable. Tuia Lodge needs all the help and consideration of its specific needs from this government not only to continue to provide quality services but to continue to expand to meet the needs of the community.


Another issue confronting rural and regional communities is the fact that parents with disabled children of a mature age have no aged-care accommodation facilities that provide for their specific needs. The task ahead, the future of aged care will take bold vision and strength of resolve that not only is not in this legislation but is also lacking from this government.


An aged-care provider in the town of Collie in my electorate, Southern Cross Care, has a 64-bed residence which currently has a waiting list of 22 people. One poor lady has recently had to leave the town she has lived in for 66 years and move 50 kilometres to Bunbury. There was no other option for the lady and, of course, it is particularly difficult for her family.


I did want to briefly touch on palliative care, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I see that my time has run out. I believe there are other matters in this House that are about to be dealt with, so I will conclude my remarks.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (16:45):  I conclude my remarks on the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. It is true that all we have gotten from Labor's so-called reforms in health has been overblown promises, overblown spending and new layers of bureaucracy, one after the next. Let us hope the legislation before us to make changes in the aged-care sector is more successful. There is provision for a review to be conducted in 2014-15. Aged care needs supportive policy. Currently it is overregulated, underfunded and facing huge challenges. I note that the explanatory memorandum for this bill states that it is difficult to quantify the regulatory impact of these amendments. This remains an ongoing concern for the coalition. This is a government that imposes additional regulatory burden on industry at every turn. The aged-care sector has almost been regulated to death. For those reasons I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:


(1) notes:


(a) objection to the growing burden of regulation being placed on the aged care sector by this Government and its impact on the ability of providers to make available affordable aged care places; and


(b) that the Government has broken its election promise to repeal one regulation for every new regulation; and


(2) calls on the Government to immediately adopt the Coalition’s commitment to reduce Commonwealth regulation by at least $1 billion per year.""




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Hon. BC Scott

Mr Turnbull:

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:47):  I speak in support of the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. I take issue with what the member for Dickson was saying about what we are doing on aged care because we are strengthening protections for accommodation bonds paid by care recipients to providers of residential and flexible aged-care services. We are taking steps in a massive way to support the aged-care sector. The aged-care sector has never received such a large sum of money in any budget than it has in this budget. We are providing assistance to the aged-care sector in a big way. We are supporting a review on aged-care services in this country. The Productivity Commission handed down its draft report on 21 January this year and we are seeing significant interest in that and from the aged-care sector.


We are making sure that we have a sustainable sector. We are making sure that we have opportunity for people in their senior years to get the best quality care, that people have choice and that people have decency and support from good qualified nurses, nurse aides, doctors and care workers in that sector. We are also very committed to making sure that the workers in that sector have decent and affordable wages and conditions.


The member for Dickson was very critical of our performance on aged care. He quoted the Grant Thornton analysis of aged care. It is interesting because back in 2006-07 Grant Thornton examined what went on under the Howard coalition government. The member for Dickson pointed this out, failing to tell those who might be listening that the coalition government was in power at that time. Grant Thornton prepared a financial analysis based on data obtained from financial information from the Department of Health and Ageing. Grant Thornton found that 40 per cent of all providers of aged care reported a loss in residential aged care. Net profit per bed fell by 30 per cent from 2005 to 2006—those opposite were in government at that time—and the annual average net profit per bed was around $1,700, a return of less than 2.5 per cent.


So let us not come up with this furphy that somehow there was some sort of aged-care nirvana during the time they were in government. In fact, the aged-care portfolio was a bit like the Northern Ireland of politics in the UK because Prime Minister Howard took the view that he would put people like the current member for Sturt in the portfolio—people he did not really like. We saw plenty of people over there who are not really too au fait with the portfolio. We saw a revolving door of about seven different ministers across about 11 years. The aged-care sector was up in arms about this.


I can recall meeting with the Aged Care Alliance in Queensland before the 2007 election when they were just absolutely livid with the performance of the coalition government. A number of backbenchers opposite were clearly of the view—they knocked on the door of the then member for Bennelong, the then Prime Minister John Howard—that more support should be provided. This was a constant refrain in the Courier Mail and the media back home in Queensland. So let us not perpetuate and perpetrate a myth about the commitment to aged care from the coalition. I look forward to what the Productivity Commission has to say when it releases its report at the end of June this year because the draft report was creative and innovative. I see the member for Ryan across the chamber. She and I both spoke at an aged-care breakfast in Brisbane about this topic some months ago where, as she would know, people from the aged-care sector were looking forward to the liberty and to a more sustainable, flexible and financially viable sector. We welcome the Productivity Commission's draft report. I have to confess I actually have read that report, all 507 pages. The Productivity Commission has made it clear that we need to make reforms in this area. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing have made it clear that this item is very high on the second term agenda of the government.


The legislation that is before the House today will make a number of important reforms that I think go towards transitioning aged care to the point where we look at, act upon and take seriously the suggestions of the Productivity Commission and its recommendations. The bill will make amendments which limit the permitted uses for accommodation bonds taken after 1 October 2011, such that providers of aged care may still use bonds for capital improvements to aged-care services and prudent financial investments but may not use bonds for operational purposes. The bill provides a two-year transition period to allow time for the sector to adjust to the new arrangements. Bonds are of course paid in low care and not in high care, which is a more hospital-like environment for people who are suffering from severe illness and disability.


The average person who goes into a high-care facility is about 84 years of age. We have about 170,000 people in residential aged-care facilities across the country, but a million Australians interact with the aged-care sector and we are putting about $50 billion into that sector across the forward estimates. A million people often get home and community care. On the Extended Aged Care at Home Dementia packages: I have been arguing for some time, in my electorate for a start, that there should be more aged-care packages. I am pleased to see that recently my representation has been successful with further packages for Blue Care in the upper part of the Brisbane Valley around Lowood. I warmly welcome the representation from Peter Conaghan in relation to that. Peter has been a terrific advocate as the Service Manager, Community, at Blue Care in Lowood.


These amendments will also remove restrictions on the use of income derived from bonds, retention amounts and accommodation charges. This will give an unrestricted source of income to aged-care providers. I spent 14 years on the board of Queensland Baptist Care and acted as a lawyer for many aged-care providers. In fact, when I spoke at the event that the member for Ryan also attended, I saw in the audience quite a number of the clients I represented when I was in private practice as a lawyer.


The aged-care sector is crying out for reform. The amendments in this legislation are transitional, but they make clear the sources of income. It is always difficult to invest in capital infrastructure to build the best kind of facility and to have that ready source of income. So I welcome the ACFI funding that we have put in during the last few years, which has given further assistance to those in aged care and made a ready source of money available to assist people.


The challenges in this sector are so great. By 2050 we will have 2.7 Australians working for every person over the age of 65. That is what the third intergenerational report says. The increase in costs in aged care will be three times what the increase will be in health funding. That is the challenge we face. About five Australians now work for every person over the age of 65 years. The intergenerational report indicates the rate of growth is enormous. About seven in 10 women and about five in 10 men reach 65 years of age and they are going to need some form of help for their domestic needs, some form of help with showering, shopping, mowing, ironing and those kinds of routine household chores.


The legislation we are debating today is about caring for the disadvantaged and the vulnerable. It is about honouring the contributions that they have made to our welfare and our wellbeing in this country. We believe that every Australian deserves the right to access good quality care. We believe it is appropriate and the measure of a decent society is how we treat our senior citizens. In my electorate of Blair we have made a significant contribution to our senior citizens. Of the $9 million used to redevelop the Cabanda aged-care facility in Rosewood, a community run aged-care facility, $1.5 million was federal government money. We have put in $5 million as an interest-free loan for the Milford Grange project in Ipswich run by RSL Care. Our transitional funding through low-interest loans has made a big difference. Older people will benefit from another 113 new aged-care places in Blair costing more than $6 million a year. This includes an allocation of 30 new residential aged-care beds. We are making a huge contribution. On 8 December, the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing announced that 12,272 new aged-care places worth more than $450 million a year will be allocated across the country. That is a huge number of people who will interact with the aged-care sector. The aged-care sector has been crying out for reform for a long, long time. It is not as if those opposite did not know about the need to reform the aged-care system, which the Productivity Commission has described as complex and difficult for people who interact with it to negotiate and navigate. They knew very well about the challenges in aged care because former Prime Minister John Howard instructed Professor Warren Hogan to undertake the Hogan review back in 2004. Professor Hogan urged radical change in the aged-care sector, but for three years the government sat on his report and did virtually nothing.


In 1997 the government made some significant change, which we acknowledge, but subsequently they refused to take up the mantle of change. They refused to be reformers. Their idea of aged care was to manage it as best they could, in a political way. They did not really commit themselves to the change they needed to make. 


The Productivity Commission's draft report Caring for older Australians has really made it clear that the Howard coalition government utterly failed with respect to aged care. It has made clear that there is great disparity in wages and conditions for aged-care sector staff; that the system is difficult for people to work out; that we need a different model, a different method, for funding the aged-care sector; and that we need a gateway agency to allow people to navigate the system, with different methods of assessment, different methods of sanction and different methods of accreditation. There is a lot to be done—the legislation here is really transitional—before that happens.


We think that making changes to the aged-care sector will improve the lot and lifestyle of our senior citizens. We think a more flexible range of care and support services will make a difference. We want to make sure there are safety and quality standards across the sector. We want to make sure that the regulatory commissions and bodies involved in it are transparent, accountable and open. We want to make sure that there is a simplified gateway that is easily understood so that assessments of care and information can be given to consumers and customers. We want to make sure that where there are gaps in service delivery we can fix them.


The legislation here is part of that process as we transition to major reform. This is a priority of a reformist Labor government. The fact that we have to do it is testimony to the failure of those opposite who, for 11½ years, fudged and fumbled aged care because they did not have the wisdom or wit to do the reform that needed to be undertaken.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (17:02):  Aged care in Australia is a topic that confronts and challenges us all. I spoke in my maiden speech about the importance of social connectedness and active ageing. To put the potential impact of an ageing population into perspective, it is worth noting the statistics. By 2050, one in two voters will be aged over 50 and by 2055, 78,000 Australians will be aged over 100. We need to acknowledge not only the cost but also the potential benefits of age. Australians aged over 55 contribute an estimated $74.5 billion per annum through voluntary, unpaid and caring work. We must not dismiss their enormous contribution and potential. That is our challenge.


The government is not meeting this challenge. We are here today debating yet another amendment—another stop-gap measure; a bandaid solution—that still does not resolve the bigger issue. The government came to the 2007 election claiming 'new directions for frail and older Australians' and claimed that it would make the transition from hospital to aged care a priority. Yet the reality is: another Labor priority policy area; another Labor government failure.


After delivering so little for this sector during its first term, this Labor government refused to commit to any substantial reform during last year's election campaign, leaving aged care to be swept under the rug once again. This government has failed to make the tough decisions needed in the aged-care sector, yet again dodging the key issues and then passing the buck to the Productivity Commission inquiry. The findings of this inquiry will not be released until after the 2011-12 budget, providing the government with yet another excuse to delay any real action in this vital area.


This amendment bill aims to strengthen consumer protection for accommodation bonds paid to aged-care facilities as well as to improve the arrangements for the handling of complaints about Commonwealth funded aged-care services. Given the recent experience of one of my constituents, I agree with the government that at the very least there are major issues within this area that need to be addressed. Ms Linda Fitzgibbon recently contacted my office to share her experience when dealing with an aged-care facility. Ms Fitzgibbon placed her two elderly parents into care last year, paying an upfront accommodation bond of $300,000 for each parent—$600,000 in total up-front just for the bond—in addition to the fees she would be paying for their care.


As Ms Fitzgibbon points out, she was lucky to have been able to afford this outlay up-front, as the interest charged on paying this bond off over time was, at that point, over seven per cent per annum. Sadly, she has lost both her parents over the course of the past year, her mother in September and her father in March. During this grieving and stressful time she also faced, due to circumstances beyond her control, a delay in her parents' wills going to probate. 


As you would appreciate, this was a very distressing time for Ms Fitzgibbon. That stress was compounded by the fact that, due to the delay in the will going to probate, the aged-care facility would not release her parents' accommodation bond. Unfairly, neither was that bond earning interest at the same rate that the constituent would have been charged had she not paid that bond up-front. That rate has now increased to 8.94 per cent. With this in mind, I do find the proposals to strengthen consumer protection for accommodation bonds and improve arrangements for the handling of complaints to be warranted, and we on this side will continue to support sensible policy measures. It will help to curb aged-care facilities investing these accommodation bonds—substantial amounts of money—in high risk investments, reducing the possibility of the bond being lost. The proposals will also, hopefully, encourage aged-care providers to upgrade their facilities for residents, which I am sure residents and their families would appreciate.


But the question we must ask is: why is this happening within the aged-care industry? It is happening because the sector does not receive enough support from the government. As the Productivity Commission report stated, the aged-care industry is close to crisis, with 40 per cent of aged-care providers operating in the red as at June 2010. Yet the population of over 85-year-olds, the main users of aged care in Australia, is set to swell from 400,000 in 2007 to 1.6 million by 2047. Increasingly, seniors are struggling to access the care that they want, they need and they deserve, with 2,000 aged-care beds and 786 bed licences lost since 2007 alone. The government clearly have not faced the reality of our ageing population and they do not appreciate the dedicated and committed individuals working in aged-care facilities. Aged-care nurses on average earn 20 to 30 per cent less than their acute-care colleagues.


Whilst the amendments we discuss today are both needed, they are not enough. This government's entire treatment of the sector is simply inadequate. Those in the industry have already raised the alarm that the system is difficult to navigate, confusing and underfunded. The whole industry is already overregulated, yet here we are today discussing stopgap regulation but not real reform. Back in 2007 the government promised to cut one regulation for every one it introduced—one in, one out. So the obvious question is: what is being cut today? The answer to that is: nothing. It is yet another broken promise of this Labor government. In fact it has introduced 220 new regulations for each one it has repealed. Indeed, rather than reducing regulation, the only cut this government has made is a cut to funding for the sector. The assistive technology in community care initiative was cut and, as a result, there is restricted access to vital technology which could assist older Australians in their homes. We have also seen cuts to hearing services through the introduction of a threshold, and funding cuts to preventative measures that assisted our older Australians to keep fit and healthy, increasing the financial burden on the government purse and, sadly, reducing support for our senior citizens. On top of that the Labor government applied one of their most simplistic and lazy 'saving' measures: freezing indexation payable to aged-care providers in the 2009-10 budget, thereby cutting approximately $910 million over four years. The government continues to fail our aged-care sector and therefore fails our seniors, in turn fails their families and then fails our young Australians—for it is our young Australians who will bear the responsibility and the cost in the future for rectifying this neglect. 


The amendments today are a bandaid step, but we need genuine reform if we are to support aged care in Australia. It must be done responsibly and it must be done soon. Aged care is in crisis, and the financial viability and associated issues are of vital importance. As Mike Woods of the Productivity Commission said:


… the system is expected to provide care to over 3.6 million older Australians by 2050. It is inevitable that government expenditure will rise. The challenge is to reform the system, while keeping that expenditure within sustainable limits. 


The more we fail now, the greater the problems for future generations. The more costs and pressures we place now on the aged-care industry, and by extension the health system, the greater the burden we place on future generations. Failing in aged care affects so many facets of our economy and has far-reaching consequences which this government refuses to face. To quote Abraham J. Heschel: 


A test of a people is how it behaves towards the old. It is easy to love children. Even tyrants and dictators make a point of being fond of children. But the affection and care for the old, the incurable, the helpless are the true gold mines of a culture.


Mr Deputy Speaker, let us begin to apply this philosophy to our aged-care sector.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Government Whip) (17:12):  I rise to support the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011 and I commend the minister on bringing this matter to the parliament. A compassionate and responsible aged-care sector is, quite frankly, the hallmark of a modern society. When we look at the costs associated with maintaining that sector I know they sometimes appear horrendous, but one of the things that strikes me these days is that we have seen huge changes, particularly with respect to the standards of accommodation and lifestyle which are associated with aged-care facilities. One of the reasons for that is not just that it is what society expects for its aged community; it is what we expect for our parents. If you personalise that point, it is what we are looking forward to for the care of our mums and dads—and I suppose we might possibly inherit that degree of care from our kids as well—and it shows that there is a reason why we constantly review, upgrade and look forward to progress being made in this sector. We pride ourselves on advancing our own standards of living and lifestyle, and clearly in taking care of our aged these things are no less important. That is the hallmark of a modern society and a modern community, which we are all very happy to support. That is the reality of the position. In my electorate I have—as, no doubt, every member has—a number of aged-care facilities. I take the opportunity to visit them regularly. I would like to mention two that I have been to very recently. One is the Cardinal Stepinac Village and the other is the Indo-Chinese Elderly Hostel. They are fantastic organisations. These organisations cater for a significant ethnic population in my electorate. I have mentioned many times that my electorate is the most multicultural electorate in the country. The work that those two organisations do—Cardinal Stepinac Village with respect to the Croatian community and the Indo-Chinese Elderly Hostel with respect to the Indochinese population—is extraordinary. A lot of the residents have limited English. That has not always been the case. Regrettably, as people grow old and with the onset of dementia, a lot of people return to their original tongue. Hence, these two facilities cater very significantly to the ethnic aspects of the elderly in my electorate.


I would like to refer to Harry Tang and his team. Harry is the President of the Indo-Chinese Elderly Hostel and Veronica Hon is the CEO. They do a wonderful job. As a consequence, the government rewarded them only recently with approval for another 32 aged-care beds as part of the second round approval process. That is significant in my area, particularly around Bonnyrigg where they are located. When I was at Cardinal Stepinac Village the chief executive officer, Matt Smolcic, presented me with a cheque for $40,000 to top up the Premier's Disaster Relief Appeal in Queensland. I thought that what the Croatian community did was pretty good—that they still thought about others.


Getting back to the bill—I know I have digressed—these amendments will strengthen consumer protection around accommodation bonds and will make the processing of complaints easier and probably more flexible as that applies in this sector. In particular, it will amend the Aged Care Act to address the current legislative inadequacies around accommodation bonds in aged-care facilities. It will go a long way to clearing up the confusion and uncertainty—certainly in the minds of some of the industry operators but, more particularly, in the minds of residents and families of residents—about what these bonds can and cannot be used for.


Bear in mind that these bonds are a form of interest-free loans to operators. They are certainly worth a significant amount of money and it is only right that we protect the consumer—often that is the family of the aged-care recipient—make sure that their investment is protected and that the money is used for proper processes. As I understand it, when the bonds were introduced in 1997, they were designed to apply to infrastructure—the bricks and mortar associated with accommodation. However, since then, without prescription provided by the legislation, there has been the opportunity for some operators to use the money, which has effectively been held in trust for recipients, to do other things. This bill is designed to bring it back to what these bonds were originally intended to do. The bill gives greater clarity in that respect. It will ensure that what the bonds in the aged-care sector are for—the money is held in trust—and what the bonds can be used for by the operator is clearly understood. The amendment, which will take effect on 1 October 2011, will make it clear to all operators, residents and, in particular, the families of residents that the bonds are to be used strictly for capital improvement and not, under any circumstances, used for other operational purposes.


The two-year transition period will give the aged-care providers the opportunity to prepare for the changes. In addition, the compliance and enforcement regime will change under these provisions. That will be enhanced around these bonds. It will introduce new offences where misuse of funds has been identified. It will also provide for new and better information-gathering powers for the department to follow up on when there are complaints or allegations of misuse of accommodation bonds.


The second aspect of the bill removes restrictions on the use of income derived from accommodation bonds, which technically gives aged-care providers an unrestricted source of income. The amendments to the Aged Care Act will strengthen and improve the compliance scheme in the aged-care area. It will replace the investigation principles with a new complaints based principle. That will broaden the department's scope for dealing with and following up on concerns.


At present the department is limited to only being able to investigate complaints and establishing whether a breach of the act has occurred. If that is proven to be the case, it would go down the prosecution route and adversarial aspects in terms of compliance with the act. This amendment will make the scheme more flexible. It will introduce the aspect where the department can employ a wide range of mechanisms to assist in resolving complaints, not waiting until there has been an established breach of an act. Those mechanisms include early resolution, conciliation and mediation to work in collaboration with residents, families of residents—the complainants in this case—and the operators of an aged-care facility. At the end of the day, it is not in our interests or the department's interests to establish a prosecutorial regime. We want to show leadership in the standards and the services that are being administered by aged-care providers, and we want their obligations to be understood not only by the providers but also by the residents and the families of the aged. This will lend greater flexibility in trying to resolve issues so that people can undertake their work—that is, to look after the aged.


These recommendations came out of an independent report commissioned by the then Minister for Ageing, Justine Elliot, into how the industry responded to concerns. I acknowledge the former minister's good work and I wish her well in her new portfolio. For what it is worth, I think she applied herself diligently in the ageing portfolio with a view to making a difference for the people in aged care.


The last element of the bill will make some minor operational changes to remove the redundant provisions of the Aged Care Act. These amendments were developed through extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including aged-care providers, residents and their families, and aged-care advocacy groups. These amendments will get the balance right. That is not to say that once we pass this bill everything will come to a stop, because this is an ongoing reform of aged care. Changes will obviously occur from time to time, but we are trying to make sure that the administration of our aged-care residents reflects the contemporary standards that one would expect in a society such as ours.


We intend to protect residents and their families from unscrupulous operators. There are profits to be made in this area, there is no question about that. It is not simply an altruistic industry. We want to make sure that people do not cut corners that prejudice the lifestyle of residents. As a consequence, continued monitoring of this industry will be needed and that is why a further review will take place two years after these changes are implemented.


As I said, we are setting about to protect the community from unscrupulous operators, but that is not meant to cast aspersions on all of the good operators out there who are the vast majority. However, where operators and their senior staff abuse the rights of others we need to be able to give a level of assurance to the aged and those who effectively fund the accommodation bonds. This government will do all we can to support Australians who are being cared for in aged-care facilities and to support the industry so that they can provide the highest possible standard of care to our aged. As such, the government will continuously monitor the effectiveness of these changes. As I have said, once they have been implemented there will be a subsequent review that will take place in 2014 or 2015.


The elderly certainly have the potential to continue playing a very significant role within our community and that is why we need greater flexibility in aged care. One of the things that drives the development of the aged-care industry is what we expect for our own parents. I support these amendments because they will introduce changes that are needed, but they do need to be continually reviewed. The best thing we could do to provide a greater degree of assurance for those in aged care is establish mechanisms that can quickly and appropriately address complaints instead of simply looking for breaches to prosecute in the courts. I think these amendments will take us a long way down that track. I think it shows that we are committed to making sure that the processes work not only on paper but also in ways that fundamentally deliver good results for the aged-care sector and, more importantly, for those who are cared for in the aged-care sector. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (17:27):  I am very pleased to speak on the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. As previous speakers have mentioned, this bill introduces a number of amendments to the Aged Care Act 1997 which are part of the reform agenda to strengthen consumer protection for accommodation bonds paid to aged-care services and to improve the arrangements for handling complaints about Commonwealth funded aged-care facilities. If this bill is passed it is proposed that the reforms regarding accommodation bonds for approved providers will take effect after 1 October 2011 and the new complaints mechanisms will take effect on 1 September 2011. I am sure that my colleagues have already mentioned that there will be a transition period, so I will not just repeat what everyone else has said about these matters.


There was a need for reform because things have happened with accommodation bonds. The original policy was that they were to be used for capital funding for investment in the building of stock; however, the principal amount of the accommodation bond was not clearly articulated in the legislation. In other words, the act needed clarification and that is what this bill does. It makes it clear that bonds must not be used for purposes other than those related to providing aged care to recipients. The bill also provides that, where a bond is charged, the approved provider is entitled to income derived from that bond and the principal can be deducted from it for specific purposes. The bonds were generally invested in deposit-taking institutions, such as banks et cetera, but they did venture into other areas, such as credit unions, syndicates and other sorts of trusts. There has been a very wide use of bonds and there has been a lack of consistent interpretation regarding permitted uses of bonds. There have been a number of anomalies which have been identified by the Department of Health and Ageing. These included using accommodation bonds to make loans to related parties, related entities and individuals, and failing to meet existing prudential standards relating to bonds.


Grant Thornton, in his Aged care performance survey in November 2007, found that 40 per cent of all providers were operating in the red. Without going through all the issues, that is why we are here today. Let us get on to some of the real issues in relation to why there is a crisis in aged-care funding. I suspect that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, would be the only one who has been in this House long enough to know that in 1997 there was a massive argument in this House about the charging of bonds and it essentially brought down the minister of the day, the member for Pearce. She was attacked roundly by the member for Jagajaga for trying to charge accommodation bonds where it related to the family home.


I will not revisit that whole experience, other than to say that we supported sensible arrangements to charge bonds because no government can afford the growing aged-care industry capital spending that is required. There needs to be a blend of funds from government, the investment sector and individuals. As we know, at that time, many people entering aged-care facilities had a home and they could have used the value of that home to help provide capital for accommodation by providing a bond to the aged-care facility. But that proposal was not supported, and people like Francis Sullivan from the Catholic association helped the Labor Party opposition at that time savage us over this issue.


There are still massive underspends in what is required for aged-care accommodation. I see on the opposite side of the House the former minister for aged care. I am sure as she travels around this country she would hear—as all members hear in their electorates—that they are desperate for funds in this area. At the moment, there is not only a crisis but also a massive underspend because these facilities cannot create a business case. I have met with my aged-care providers, and earlier this year the member for Hasluck and I met a delegation of aged-care providers at Amaroo Village in Perth. We met with David Fenwick—who is very vocal on these issues—Trudi Hodges, from Dale Cottages, and a number of other providers. They said that we had to do something about supporting their parlous situation and they wanted us raise this issue in the parliament—and this debate gives me the opportunity today.


What is happening in Western Australia—and it is happening right across Australia—is that they are handing back the allocation of funds for beds and they are handing back licences because they cannot make a business case. Charitable organisations, churches, community based aged care et cetera cannot make a business case at the moment. As a result, they are experiencing real problems trying to expand or even do with what they have now.


I feel very, very chastened because during the election campaign I visited one of my aged-care facilities, the Graceford Hostel, an independent living facility in Byford in my electorate, and they pleaded with me: 'Mr Randall, can you do something about helping us?' While showing us through the home, they said, 'We are in a desperate situation here for a whole number of reasons: we are swamped by regulation, we are swamped by the massive amount of compliance and we can't get aged-care nurses.' They are not very well paid. I think they are 30 per cent under the average nursing payment ratio, particularly agency nurses. They cannot get qualified nurses or even nurses who want to work in the sector. As you know, Western Australia has a shortage of labour in a whole range of areas, and this is exacerbated in the aged-care area. This home had no ability to get capital funding to expand the services even though they had a massive waiting list.


All of these aged-care facilities are asking me, 'Can you help us?' One of the things that they came up with at the forum that I attended with the member for Hasluck was: 'If there is all of this money being offered for beds—and 2,000 in Western Australia alone have been handed back—obviously there is a massive underspend in that area because they are not taking them up.' They said—and I am sure that the member for Hasluck will corroborate this—'If there is this massive underspend and the money is not getting out the door, why can't you cobble it together and put out more per bed to make a business case out of it, because at the moment the amount per bed just will not make a business case for any organisation that wants to invest in age care?'


What is the end result to this? In 2007, Kevin Rudd said that he would end this logjam in hospitals, where aged people were being parked up in hospitals. He was going to do something about it, but it never happened. It did not happen through the Rudd years and it certainly has not happened through Prime Minister Gillard's years. There is a logjam and people, particularly in rural and regional areas, are getting parked in hospitals rather than going into aged-care facilities. The residents at Quambie Park in my electorate are so frustrated that Ken Landwehr, the CEO, sent me a petition from them. It said:


Let Canberra know about the needs of older Australians—their right to quality care and support now and in the future.


This is how desperate they are.


Pam Corker and Quambie Park have actually opened a further expansion of their dementia facilities. But they did this largely through legacies left to them by former residents and the community. The strange thing about it is that the legacy left to them by one of their former residents made it more difficult for them to get ongoing and recurrent funding. They were told, 'You have too much money.' The system is just not flexible enough. Since the Labor Party has taken over, compliance has, if anything, increased and made it harder for people to get on and do the actual job of nursing. In addition to compliance, as I said, you cannot make a business case out of the funding available.


The tsunami is coming and this government is not prepared for it. In 2007, there were 400,000 people over 85—1.7 per cent of the population. There will be 1.6 million people in this age group by 2047—that is the size of the aged-care exercise that is heading our way. In addition to that, the growing incidence of dementia means that specialist facilities have to be built—in other words, more capital funding. In 2009, 245,000 people were deemed to have dementia. By 2030, it is predicted that there will be 591,000 and the prediction for 2050 is a staggering 1.13 million. And yet this is an underfunded area. It is not a priority of the Gillard government; aged care is not a priority area for the Labor Party at all. In fact their failure to act is indictable. 


We have an ageing population. In 2007, there were six working people to support every person aged 67 and over; by 2047, there will be only 3.2 people for each aged person. So where is the plan for the future? Where is the investment for the future in this sector? That is what aged-care providers in my electorate are asking me to raise here. At their meeting with the member for Hasluck and me, they even asked: 'Can you get someone to have the courage to look at the housing situation again? Obviously any way of freeing up capital for aged-care facilities, nursing homes et cetera would be a blessing for us, because we cannot make a go of it.' As I said, rather than expanding their services, many of them now are reducing their services or even selling them. Who is buying them? It is the large aged-care providers in Australia. There are economies of size, but you do not get the same level of care from these large providers as is provided by the hands-on community aged-care facilities found in many suburbs and rural and regional areas. Ageing in place? That is ideal and it should happen. Without economies of scale, however, it is harder.


I say in the House today to the government: investment in this area has not so far been a priority of yours. While we were in government under John Howard, we made it a priority and we certainly made sure that there was accreditation and that standards were lifted. We are asking you, on behalf of the aged and frail of Australia, to finally get off your hands and do something about getting funding into this sector. (Time expired)

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (17:42):  I am delighted to speak on the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. This bill once again demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that older Australians receive the best possible care available. This bill again demonstrates that protections are in place to ensure that money paid by those entering assisted living is being returned in capital investment. These amendments will also strengthen the arrangements for managing complaints concerning facilities providing subsidised care by creating more flexibility in the resolution process.


This is not new. The Gillard government has taken a number of steps to improve aged care for older Australians and to ensure the aged-care system is both sustainable and responsive to care needs. The Gillard government will give $55.4 billion for aged care over the next four years. This year's budget will support continued investment in the aged-care industry to meet the increasing demand for services.





(Quorum formed) When entering a care facility, residents are often required to pay a bond, much like any other individual entering into an accommodation arrangement. The value of these bonds has increased to more than $10.6 billion. Currently we can see an increase in value of more than 20 per cent every year. These bonds are, in essence, an unsecured loan paid by care recipients to the approved provider. Given the significant and increasing amount of bonds, it is appropriate that care recipients can be assured that their funds are being used for the intended purposes and that there is transparency of, and accountability for, that use.


While the intent of the legislation was always that the bond would be used for capital funding, a lack of clarity in the language—being that bond money should be used for expenses related to 'providing' aged care to care recipients—has allowed some service providers to fund a wide variety of other purposes. The danger is that certain expenditure of bonds, especially those which fund day-to-day operational costs, makes having bond money on hand for repaying recipients on leaving the care facility extremely difficult. This does introduce unnecessary concern and it is resulting in a higher chance of default on these important payments.


This legislation ensures that we clearly articulate what these bonds can and cannot be used for. The legislation is not about making life more difficult for providers by taking away a potential source of income; rather, this legislation is about ensuring that what is a significant part of each resident's life savings—and we are talking about a sum of about $167,000 per individual on average—is used to provide the necessary capital improvements that are just a part of maintaining a home.


Similarly, the amendments in this bill will enshrine that these bonds can be invested in term deposit accounts and act as interest-bearing investments. While some providers have done this in the past, it was never expressly known as a possibility, as previously it did not meet the requirement that it was spent on providing care to recipients. My electorate of Robertson, and the Central Coast as a whole community, is an aged and ageing community. We do have a large cluster of young people at the other end but aged care is definitely part of the landscape of the Central Coast.


In our care facilities we have a high population of retirees who downsize from the long-held family homes in the region and use a proportion of the profit from the sale of their home to fund their accommodation bond. Often making this move into a new facility—a change at the later stages of life—can be very daunting. Whatever we can do as a government to give more certainty to those individuals will ensure that people have confidence in the sector. It is important that people have confidence. It is important they know that the facility and the management are doing the right thing and that when it is time for their bonds to be returned, the money will be available.


These amendments are for the care of recipients. These amendments are aimed at improving the quality of aged care for the care recipient through increased investment in capital works. These amendments will increase the reliability of refunding of bonds and add more transparency and more certainty to ensure that bonds are not squandered but reinvested. This certainty will, in turn, provide longer term benefits to the providers themselves. The removal of restrictions on the use of income derived from bonds will provide aged-care providers with a legitimate cash flow and will reduce the current regulatory burden.


The introduction of criminal offences, which this amendment bill provides, is a reflection of the moral importance that we as a government put on ensuring that money which is essentially 'loaned' to providers is spent properly. It is our intention to protect the rights and the interests of care recipients, who are often in a vulnerable situation. There was considerable support for the introduction of criminal penalties, and we are very aware of this from the submissions to the inquiry. Submissions urged the department to carefully structure any penalties to ensure that key personnel could not unintentionally be caught up under any new offences. The legislation was also structured to ensure that the new offences did not dissuade people from taking up roles within aged care and that offences would only apply to those individuals in the worst cases where an individual has deliberately acted in a way that has caused a provider to misuse bonds.


These changes in the legislation have received wide consultation. The government has spoken to consumer groups, peak bodies, providers of aged care and the financial services sector. A total of 33 submissions were received: six from peak industry bodies, 23 from approved providers, one from a consumer group and three from other interested organisations. It is important to note that the aged-care sector supports these changes. It is also important to note that we are not responding in panic; rather, it is a much-needed and carefully considered response to the reality that exists in our communities.


The bill provides much more clarity in the language, This will ensure that providers know precisely what they can and cannot do, and that has to be a massive improvement for aged-care recipients who are participating in transactions. The consultation period yielded a great sense of a need for this change. Providers and consumer groups all recognised the issues that currently existed within the unclear language and they all agreed that action had to be taken to review what options were available. The government was open and responsive to these needs and, with wide contribution from all those participants in the formation of the legislation, we know that we have brought the best legislation before the House.


We also do not propose to blind side the industry with these changes. We understand that there will be some immediate compliance costs with the changes, as providers make the necessary changes to their financial affairs. The government is proposing that the changes take effect from 1 October 2011 for all bonds received on or after that date. Bonds received before that date can continue to be used in accordance with the existing rules or may be used in accordance with the new rules. This ensures that the changes do not have any retrospective impact but also gives approved providers the flexibility to choose to treat all bonds in the same way.


A two-year transition period is also proposed, whereby approved providers may use bonds for existing purposes associated with aged care. This will provide the department with the data necessary to determine if further adjustments to this proposal should be made to assist the cashflow management of approved providers and will provide industry with a reasonable transition period to become familiar with these important new arrangements.


This legislation is effective in clarifying our aged-care bond system. It is absolutely effective in providing a more positive outlook for service providers and care recipients. It is a practical reform that is not based on some ideological rhetoric; rather, it is based on a genuine consideration of the needs of the system and those who use it and on the way in which accommodation bonds could and should be used. I commend the bill to the House.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (17:55):  I rise to speak to the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. The bill introduces a number of amendments that aim to strengthen consumer protection for accommodation bonds paid to aged-care service providers and aims to provide an increased focus on consumer complaint resolution and on the achievement of outcomes for complaints rather than just investigation.


The coalition will not be opposing this bill, which takes steps to protect some of the most vulnerable members of our community. However, there is so much more that needs to be done, encompassed within a framework of reform of the aged-care sector—reform that should see a vibrant aged-care sector that provides for the holistic needs of older Australians and a sector that is valued for the work that it does.


The ageing of Australia's population is undoubtedly one of the nation's biggest social challenges. Over the last two decades, the median age of the population has increased by 4.8 years, whilst over the same period the number of children aged between 0 and 14 decreased by three per cent. The first cohort of baby boomers will leave the workforce this year, but the number of young people joining it will decline. In 2007 there were seven people working to support every person over the age of 67. By 2047, this figure is expected to almost halve to 3.2 people supporting every Australian over the age of 67. Australians are expected to live longer, further increasing the pressure on the aged-care sector. More and more people are expected to live well into their 80s. By 2047, there is expected to be an increase from 1.7 per cent to 5.6 per cent of over-85-year-olds requiring the services of our aged-care sector.


There is evidence that the aged-care sector is already struggling to provide the excellent levels of care that we want for our older Australians, who have contributed so much to our community. This Labor government has delayed any meaningful reform of the sector by commissioning report after report, whose conclusions only point in one direction: a crisis in the sector. Forty per cent of aged-care facilities are operating in the red. There are a record number of provider liquidations and undersubscription to aged-care places.


In the context of the current legislation at issue, accommodation bonds payable were originally intended for capital funding. The legislation as it stands provides for the use of accommodation bonds paid for by someone going into care for the purpose of providing aged care for recipients. However, there are ambiguities around what this actually means, so accommodation bonds have been used for a wide variety of purposes, including meeting operational costs. There is no clarity around the ability of service providers to invest the money in, for example, long-term bank accounts or, alternatively, to use the money to provide loans. There is currently no data that reveals the true extent of the problem. However, anecdotal evidence from discussions with service providers indicates that bonds are being utilised for operational purposes.


At the moment there are restrictions on how an approved aged-care provider can use income derived from an accommodation bond. However, the restrictions that currently apply do not reflect the comparative risk and create a situation whereby the administrative burden of the regulations may impact on cashflow, thereby increasing the possibility that bonds may be used for operational expenses. The financial viability of the aged-care sector is a major issue, an issue that will only gain greater prominence in Australia. In its 2011-12 budget submission, the Aged Care Industry Council stated that a snapshot of the industry at the start of 2011 indicates a sector that is unsustainable. Hours of service are decreasing, hours of care provided under Community Aged Care Packages are decreasing, new residential care beds are not being built, many services are not operating at a profit and liquidations have increased.


At a time when Australia is likely to see increasing demand for aged care, the sector is struggling. In 2008-09, 2,000 beds were cut in the aged-care approvals round, and industry is rejecting government funded beds. The last two aged-care rounds were undersubscribed, as opposed to the situation under the coalition government, where aged-care places were prized. Providers are handing back licences, and beds are being left empty, with older Australians having to wait longer for a bed and travel greater distances. This is particularly the case in rural Australia.


In my electorate, this is an issue for the community. I have had to deal with several cases of older constituents waiting for months in hospital beds because there is no other place for them to go. This is not representative of a system that recognises the holistic needs of individuals. If people from Bribie Island in my electorate are in hospital in Brisbane, their partners have to commute for up to three hours a day to visit them. This has the obvious effect of causing social dislocation and isolation. It also has the effect of placing extra pressure on an already overcrowded public hospital system. This situation is causing distress and anxiety in my community.


This legislation is designed to increase regulations on the amount of accommodation bond principal; however, it will reduce the regulations on income derived from the bond, retention amounts and accommodation charges. The regulation would then better reflect the risk associated with the principal. This would permit improved oversight of the bond, which is effectively an interest-free loan made by a resident, and other sources of income derived from the approved provider. Permitted uses for the accommodation bond would be limited to the original policy intent of providing funding for increased investment in capital works, in certain products and to pay debt related to the provision of aged care. From talking to local aged-care providers, it would seem that it is the provision of capital-intensive mortar and bricks that provides the greatest financial hurdle for the sector. The Department of Health and Ageing will have increased information-gathering powers to ensure that service providers that might be at risk are able to repay accommodation bonds.


Because the sector is struggling and aged-care providers have had to go into liquidation, the Accommodation Bond Guarantee Scheme has been utilised to the tune of $24.5 million, meaning around 150 accommodation bonds. This legislation proposes that there be new penalties introduced for approved providers that use bonds for non-permitted purposes that might trigger the guarantee scheme. While this is a step forward in safeguarding the contributions of older Australians and making the sector more financially viable, there is more that needs to be done.


Unfortunately, as in many other areas of government policy, the Labor government's record is littered with broken promises. For example, the attraction and retention of nurses in the aged-care sector is becoming increasingly difficult. However, despite promises of a fix, Labor recruitment policies have failed. The Bringing Nurses Back into the Workforce Program was abolished, with the program delivering only 139 nurses out of a promised 1,000 by February 2010. In 2009-10, only 8,200 out of 13,100 training places for aged-care workers had been delivered. Of the 2,000 transition places promised, only 698 had become operational by April 2010.


The bill is also designed to improve complaints handling by changing the focus to resolution of complaints rather than just their investigation. It is intended that the handling of aged-care complaints will be improved, with an increased focus on the achievement of outcomes for care recipients, their families and other representatives. A range of approaches such as mediation, conciliation and investigation will be employed by the Department of Health and Ageing to resolve complaints cooperatively with care recipients and providers of care. This should go some way to reassuring care recipients and their families that issues relating to their care will be dealt with rather than just investigated, and as such the coalition welcomes the change.


The coalition is committed to providing the highest possible standards of aged care. We believe that this is one way of giving back to those who have contributed so much to this country in the past and continue to contribute in a number of ways. My electorate is full of senior people who continue to make a full and meaningful contribution to the community. Some of them have the time and are able to volunteer in various ways that provide invaluable support for the community. However, there are those that are more vulnerable and require different levels of care. These people and their families should expect and receive the very highest possible standards of care. Whilst this bill is a step in the right direction, the whole aged-care sector is in need of serious attention, not just tinkering around the edges.


The Labor government has failed the aged-care sector and with it many of our most vulnerable senior Australians. The coalition, on the other hand, remains committed to the provision of $935 million over a four-year period in order to provide for the increasing challenges the aged-care sector will face as there is increasing demand for its services from an ageing population. Central to the coalition policy is the development of an aged-care provider agreement with the aged-care sector that will be designed to reduce red tape and paperwork so that medical professionals can actually get on with the job of providing care rather than jumping through bureaucratic hoops. The agreement would provide more certainty for older Australians and those involved in their care.


For a start within this coalition policy the agreement would see the provision of $50 million over four years for professional aged-care programs and services. There would be payments of $30,000 for 3,000 aged-care places as part of the implementation of the aged-care bed incentive program. Importantly, the coalition would work cooperatively with the aged-care sector in order to identify areas of greatest need in order to establish a framework for the allocation of the places. As with many other areas in health, the coalition believes that it is the people on the ground and in the communities, not bureaucrats in Canberra, who are best placed to know and make decisions about what is needed. Importantly for my community, the coalition has promised to establish a convalescent care program, with funding of $300 million over four years to assist up to 20,000 Australians waiting in hospital to return home. As I mentioned before, this is an issue that has been raised with me on many occasions by the senior members of my community who are waiting for months to return home and are impeded from doing so because there is no-one able to care for them. The convalescent care program would provide up to 21 days in a residential aged-care facility, relieving pressure on our hospitals and adding to aged-care providers' funds. Uncertainty is plaguing the aged-care sector and the coalition's plans for an aged-care provider agreement would provide much-needed certainty for aged-care providers with the added benefit of increasing security of employment in the aged care workforce.


Labor has neglected the needs of older Australians and the aged-care sector is in urgent need of reform to meet the coming challenges of Australia's ageing population. Older Australians have every right to feel they are going to be well cared for in their twilight years and the coalition is committed to meeting care needs now and into the future. This legislation is a step forward; however, broader reform of the aged-care sector is needed. The coalition's sustainable plan would see the needs of our seniors met and would provide a framework for the real reform the sector so urgently needs in constructive partnership with them.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (18:07):  I took great interest in listening to the member for Longman read his speech to this parliament. There were a number of items in his speech that I think really need to be dealt with. His speech demonstrated to me that he was unaware of what happened in the Howard government era. He was unaware of the lack of spot checks, the people in aged-care facilities being given kerosene baths and the total lack of receptiveness of the Howard government to the needs of older Australians. He talked about the aged-care sector struggling. It was struggling as it was under enormous pressure at the time of the Howard government. As for reviews, we had the Hogan review. What happened following the Hogan review, a review which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was so proud of at the time?


And what of operating in the red, as he suggested? Well, I know that in the Howard government era aged-care facilities were really struggling. Time and time again the facilities people came and talked to me about the need for compensation, workers compensation, electricity, water and wages—all the issues that the Howard government ignored. As for 'unsustainable', he talked about people waiting for aged-care beds. In the Howard government era one out of every 10 beds in the Shortland electorate only existed on paper—phantom beds! I think it is beholden upon me to remind the House of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing report about the blame game that was brought down in the parliament in, I think, 2007. As a member of the committee, I spoke to a number of people who were involved in aged care and the one thing that was pointed out to me by those people was the number of people waiting for aged-care beds who were languishing in hospital because the Howard government refused to act.


Here we have before us today legislation, in the form of the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011, that is bringing about real change, legislation that strengthens protection for accommodation bonds paid by care recipients to providers of residential and flexible aged-care services—something that is good for the aged-care facilities and good for those people that make those facilities their home. I am really pleased to say that the minister at the table was previously the Minister for Ageing who was responsible for the reviews that have been bringing about the changes that we are seeing now. If it were not for her efforts, we would not have this really proactive good legislation before us today. Legislation limits the permitted use for accommodation bonds taken after 1 October 2011, so that providers of aged care can still use these bonds for capital improvements to aged-care services. That is really important for those facilities. I talk to the aged-care facilities people in my electorate on a regular basis, just as I talk to the people that live in those aged-care facilities and those people that may need those facilities in the future.


Shortland is one of the oldest electorates in the country—it is the 11th oldest electorate—and this is an issue that is very dear to my heart and I need to know that the aged-care facilities we have, and also the care that those people who choose to live in them will receive, will be outstanding. This change to the use of the bonds is really important. The fact that bonds cannot be used for operational purposes is a very important change. The introduction of the new criminal offences where there has been a significant misuse of bonds is about the government facing up to and dealing with the problem, not burying its head in the sand and hoping it will go away and not acting and so ignoring the needs of older people and the needs of the aged-care industry. This is a government that actually deals with the problem and does not mouth platitudes or make statements that just sound good. We act, we do and we address the problem. The legislation is introducing new information-gathering powers to enable the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing to better monitor approved providers that may be experiencing financial difficulties or using bonds for non-permitted uses. This will allow the department to help these aged-care providers. It is about making sure that there is continuity of aged care and making sure that older Australians have security about where they live. There is also a move to remove restrictions on the use of income derived from bonds, retention amounts and accommodation charges. This gives aged-care providers an unrestricted source of income, offsetting the proposed restrictions on the bonds. That is a really good news story. It is about making the aged-care providers more viable and, by doing that, making aged care safer and more secure for those older Australians who will require aged care over a period of time.


I referred earlier to the Parliamentary Secretary for Trade, who is at the table. On 12 April 2010, when she was the Minister for Ageing, she announced that the government would increase protection for aged-care residents' savings. She made that announcement as part of the announcement entitled 'More support for older Australians in the National Health and Hospitals Network'. She has always been committed to the needs of older Australians, and I know she also represents an electorate in this House that has an older population.


This legislation has been subjected to extensive consultation with the industry, community, government and stakeholders on the options for enhancing prudential regulation of accommodation bonds to identify the best means by which to ensure as far as possible that the financial interests of the residents are protected; to maintain effective regulatory safeguards for accommodation bonds; to provide a regulated source of capital funding for investment in aged-care infrastructure; to provide a regulatory framework that is commensurate to the risk associated with the exponential growth of accommodation bond holding; and to promote public confidence in the aged-care system. I emphasise that that last point, promoting public confidence, is very important.


Unlike the previous government, this government believes in consultation. We believe in talking to the people who will be operating the aged-care facilities. We believe in talking to those people who will be using the aged-care facilities. We also believe in talking to those people who will be regulating the facilities. This is a far cry from the type of consultation that took place in the last parliament, where there was cover-up after cover-up after cover-up, no spot checks—and now spot checks are regular occurrences—in aged-care facilities and a culture that enabled elderly people to be given kerosene baths.


As a result of this consultation process it is proposed that there will be changes to the act to strengthen the accommodation bond. This will address the lack of clarity in the act, which I think is really important, and introduce new criminal offences where misuses of bonds are identified. Once again, that is a really important change to the legislation. It is dealing with a problem that exists. It is proposed that the changes will take place from 1 October this year. There will be a two-year transition period to allow the sector to become more familiar with the new requirements, and I think that that is very important.


The other major change in this legislation involves the proposed amendments to the complaints scheme. It is proposed to amend the act to enable investigation principles which currently describe the investigation process in relation to complaints to be replaced with a complaints principle. This means that concerns relating to the delivery of residential, community and flexible aged care subsidised by the government can be investigated. They will be investigated. There is going to be a strong focus on resolution of complaints rather than investigations of complaints.


Investigating a complaint is all very well. Like me, all members of this parliament would have been visited by a constituent who had a problem with an aged-care facility. You would ring the aged-care complaints line. They would investigate it. And still that person who came to see you, more times than not, would be unsatisfied with the result. It was about investigation; it was about looking at it. It was not about dealing with the issue. It was not about resolving the issue.


These changes will allow those issues to be resolved rather than an investigation taking place that will deliver no outcome whatsoever to the person who has lodged a complaint. I think the fact that this legislation brings about a change that focuses on resolution rather than investigation is a very proactive and good change. The bill shifts the focus of the system from investigation to a more flexible scheme where the department can employ a range of mechanisms to assist to resolve a complaint, including early resolution, conciliation, mediation and encouraging the departments to resolve the issue themselves.


The changes that are outlined in this bill are essential. They come out of the government reviewing the system, looking at it and then, after consulting widely with the community and the sector, putting in place changes to the 1997 act that was introduced by the Howard government. Changes have caused quite a few problems within the community. We only have to look back to the time when the member for Mackellar was the Minister for Aged Care to see the kinds of problems that can be caused if governments do not consult widely with the community. The community and the aged-care sector need to have input into the direction of legislation, because good legislation is not imposed on a sector or on the community; good legislation is developed in consultation with all parties. I congratulate the minister for developing legislation that builds on the work of the previous minister and brings about legislation that is workable, that takes account of the interests of all parties and that will benefit those vulnerable frail aged people in the electorates of each and every member of this parliament. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (18:23):  I rise tonight to raise various points concerning the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011. The first point I would like to address is that of regulation, which we are once again seeing. The merits of that regulation are yet to be tested and it is yet to be seen whether they will be worthwhile. But we are seeing regulation occurring without the government honouring its commitment of 'one regulation in-one regulation out'. This is a sector that is continually suffering from the stifling impacts of regulation, so we need to address that.


We also need to look at where the aged-care sector stands at the moment. The Rudd government came into power promising all sorts of things for this sector, but it delivered next to nothing. We then need to compare that with how the coalition would go about addressing the problems and issues confronting the aged-care sector. We have a proven track record on this. Ever since we introduced the Intergenerational Report and forecast what was going to occur with the ageing of our population we have had a policy that has fitted neatly with that budget summation as to where spending on aged care is going to go as Australia's population continues to age. I would then like to look at some of the impacts the aged-care sector is facing in my seat of Wannon and make some reference to Sea View House and a way forward on that issue at the moment.


This bill introduces a number of amendments as part of the governments health and hospital reform agenda. It plans to, and hopefully will, strengthen consumer protection for accommodation bonds paid to aged-care services. It also plans to improve arrangements for the handling of complaints about Commonwealth funded aged-care services. The government released an issues paper in October 2010 and, following submissions, undertook a series of industry and consumer stakeholder meetings. A consultation paper was released in February 2011 followed by industry, consumer and regulatory stakeholders in February and March 2011.


As part of the government's health and hospital reform agenda, it is committed to strengthening consumer protection for accommodation bonds and this is what this legislation seeks to do. If the bill is passed the reforms regarding accommodation bonds will take effect on and after 1 October 2011 and the new complaints principles will take effect on 1 September 2011. However, there will be a two-year transition period, until the end of September 2013, for the changes to the permitted use of accommodation bonds, which will allow the sector to become familiar with the new requirements. A post-implementation review will be conducted in 2014-15.


In its 2011-12 budget submission, the Aged Care Industry Council stated:


A snapshot of the industry at the start of 2011 does not depict a sustainable system: only 40% of residential aged care services are operating in the black; hours of service are decreasing; hours of care provided under community aged care packages have fallen; and many providers are not building new residential care beds. The situation is worse in rural and regional areas where providers face generally higher costs with less ability to manage their income streams.


This does not portray a sector that is heading in the right direction. This does not portray a sector that is ready to meet the ageing of Australia's population. This does not portray a sector that is going to deliver, especially for older Australians in regional and rural areas. What it does portray is a sector that is in urgent need of reform. It also portrays a sector that needs a government that will listen to it and address its problems, and this does not seem to be occurring. As a matter of fact, if there is a constant theme that I am hearing in my community and I am witnessing when I come into this place every day the parliament sits, it is that this government does not seem to want to listen to the Australian people. It has its own agenda and it seems hell-bent on forcing that agenda on the Australian people.


The difficult part about this bill is that we do not really have a clear understanding of the regulatory impact. Also, given that we are introducing more regulation, what regulation are we taking out of the aged-care sector to help it meet the incredible demands it is going to be facing in the coming years?


The coalition understands that the very best care, whether in the community or residential, should be balanced. We need a clearly articulated policy that balances the community care and the residential care. We put forward at the last election a clear policy that first admitted the reality that the ageing of the population is an enormous social challenge facing Australia. We have a rapidly ageing population, and we are seeing that played out more in regional and rural areas. Australians are living longer and, as a result, are facing more complex health conditions. Disease patterns are changing as a result of Australians living longer. We are also seeing a shift in the size and composition of households, which means that there is not the family support there once was to help Australians as they age.


What does this mean? It means that our budget cannot sustain Australia's demographic changes. The declining workforce will generate insufficient tax revenue to meet the health and aged-care demands of our ageing population. On this point, we have to look at where the Australian budget is at the moment. The budget just handed down has a deficit of $47 billion—a budget deficit the size of the whole of the Victorian budget. We do not have a government that is getting our budgetary position in place to deal with the ageing of our population. We have a government that has forgotten about the Intergenerational report and how it set out clearly what we need to do as a country to make sure we are ready to meet the ageing of our population.


We have a budget deficit forecast for next year of $21 billion. All this has led already to a net debt position of $106 billion, with repayments of $135 million per day. Imagine what that money could do if it were put into productive use in our aged-care sector. Sadly, though, we will see this money being used to repay debt and not to deal with these enormous challenges we are facing today in the aged-care sector.


In 2007 Kevin Rudd and the Labor government promised the world for this sector. They pointed out that there were issues about providing enough aged-care beds and people becoming 'blockers' of acute care hospital beds. Kevin Rudd announced that we were going to get a new direction. He promised the world. What has he delivered? As I quoted before from that damning indictment in the prebudget submission, we did not get that at all. The Aged Care Industry Council has stated that the snapshot of the industry at the start of 2011 does not depict a sustainable system—and we must work towards a sustainable system.


A key to producing a sustainable system will be making sure there is appropriate funding and also making sure we do not stifle this sector with regulation. Sadly, it is a habit of this government to try to fix every problem with regulation. Maybe it should step back and listen to some very wise advice, which is that trying to fix every problem with regulation often just creates more problems.


In visiting aged-care facilities across Wannon—in Ararat, Stawell, Casterton, Hamilton, Portland, Warrnambool and Mortlake, just to name a few—I see communities dealing with constant issues, especially workforce issues. This is not made easier by governments promising to deliver—for instance, promising to deliver new nurses, especially in regional and rural areas—and not delivering on those promises. These centres are dealing more and more with constraints on accessing the labour they need. Not only that but they then have to deal with extra regulation that requires them to have professionals with certain qualifications and does not allow them flexibility as to where they get those professionals and how often they can use them.


One of the key things for regional and rural communities is to ensure that as people age in their communities they can stay in those communities. One of the key components of the coalition's policy approach before the last election was to ensure that there was flexibility in the system to enable people to age gracefully in the communities in which they grew up. Sadly, we are not seeing that from this government. What we are seeing from this government are regulations that continually make this more and more difficult—regulations that seem to support large facilities in urban areas and do not have the flexibility to enable the smaller aged-care facilities to operate.


Finally, I will point to a very simple example. Sea View House in Portland is a 56-bed supported residential service that has had the rug pulled from underneath it by Portland District Health. At the moment it is trying to deal with the question of what will become of it. The community has rallied and is keen to buy Sea View House so that it can continue to provide services. I would like to take this opportunity to say how much I support what the community is trying to do to save Sea View House. Glenda Carswell, the spokeswoman from the community group which has been set up, the Sea View House Support Group, has been doing an excellent job to make sure that the facility can continue to provide its services to the people in residence there. They have provided bonds to make sure that they are in a situation where they can live the last parts of their lives in a very comfortable way and in an environment which they have freely chosen. The support group are doing a terrific job and I hope that they will be able to get a purchaser for that facility so that it can continue to provide its services. I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this bill.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (18:38):  The Aged Care Amendment Bill 2011 introduces a number of amendments, which form part of the government's health and hospitals reform agenda. This bill plans to improve arrangements for complaints handling of Commonwealth funded aged-care services and to strengthen consumer protection for accommodation bonds paid to aged-care services. The history of this bill is an interesting one and for once demonstrates that those on the other side sometimes consult and listen to key stakeholders. Especially on an issue as important as aged care, we would expect the government to undertake consultations. The issues paper on enhanced prudential regulation of accommodation bonds, released in October 2010, resulted in a consultation paper released in February this year, which was followed by a number of industry, consumer and regulatory stakeholders meetings with the government to work through the issues raised. 


In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander society elders are consulted because of their knowledge, wisdom and life experiences. Their guidance helps to shape our future and teaches us humility, compassion and understanding. Ageism is not a factor; nor is age. Members of this House need to fully appreciate that if we apply the same approach in our wider society then we are more likely to provide the level of aged-care services and facilities that reflect aged people's needs, including staying in their own home. It is that generation that built and continued to build this great country of ours and the lifestyle we enjoy; therefore, we should take care of them.


The current regulation around the use of accommodation bonds is not consistent throughout the industry. The Department of Health and Ageing has identified, through monitoring and compliance activity and financial reports from a range of providers, that the lack of consistency of interpretation as to the permitted uses of bonds has led to many providers misusing them. The Aged Care Act provides that if an accommodation bond is charged to the care recipient by the aged-care provider then the provider must not use the bond for a purpose that is not related to 'providing aged care to care recipients.' It also stipulates that where a bond is charged then the provider is entitled to the income derived from the bond and may also deduct retention amounts from the bond principal. However, there are restrictions on how these amounts can be used. As mentioned before, the Department of Health and Ageing has found that a number of providers are using bonds to make loans to related parties and meet operational costs, making loans to related entities and to individuals with variable practice in documenting the loans, repayment arrangements and interest charges, and failing to meet the existing prudential standards relating to bonds. Since the prudential requirements were introduced in 2006, over 15 per cent of the aged-care industry has been found to be noncompliant.


Our aged-care system is a mess under this government. According to a Grant Thornton aged-care performance survey in 2007, over 40 per cent of all providers were operating in the red. I find that fascinating in this day and age. The Aged Care Industry Council stated in its 2011-2012 budget submission:


… only 40% of residential aged care services are operating in the black; hours of service are decreasing; hours of care provided under community aged care packages have fallen; and many providers are not building new residential care beds.


This is important, because in my own electorate I have a large demographic, but part of that demographic are retirees and ageing Australians who will remain in their homes for a period until such time as they are unable to continue in independent residential living and move into a facility that will provide the levels of support that they require. In some instances those who need more intensive care move from my electorate into two other regions of the metropolitan area because the aged-care facilities that are established in our electorate do not have the capacity to meet the numbers.


This industry needs urgent help. No-one knows this better than Mr David Fenwick, in my electorate of Hasluck, who I work extremely closely with on the issues that impact on the industry. Mr Fenwick is the Chief Executive Officer of Amaroo Village in Gosnells. Amaroo provides independent living units, 92 high-level care places and 81 low-care places. Amaroo is an outstanding example of how the industry is making it work. They struggle to meet operating costs but recognise that there is a need in the area and continue to work towards the best outcomes possible for the residents.


Back in January, my colleague the member for Canning and I were presented with petitions from aged-care providers in our electorates of Canning and Hasluck. The aim of the petitions was to 'let Canberra know about the needs of Older Australians—their right to quality care and support they deserve now and in the future'. Their voices deserve to be heard. The pity is that the petitions did not meet the rigour of the requirements for petitions to be tabled in the House. Nevertheless the message was quite strong. 


The management and care team at Amaroo are passionate about their work and they deserve to be supported by governments. This is consistent in all of the aged-care facilities that I have visited in Hasluck. Instead, the government has broken its election promise to repeal one regulation for every new regulation. Red tape and bureaucracy is holding the industry back. The burden of growing regulation is a disgrace. The coalition is committed to reducing Commonwealth regulation by at least $1 billion per year. Unlike those on the other side, we want to see industry encouraged to innovate, grow and provide the best possible services to those who need them the most.


We need to be supporting the aged-care industry now because we remember that, one day, we will all most likely need to access the services provided by the aged-care industry. When we grow old and need support, the aged-care industry, and the carers and providers, who are extremely passionate, will be looking after us. Unfortunately, only when that day comes for those opposite will they realise that they should have been much more supporting of the aged-care industry than they are now. The aged-care industry is becoming financially unviable and the number of providers going into liquidation has increased. However, many are being absorbed by larger facilities, thus not giving an accurate representation of the state of the industry.


The changes proposed by this bill strike a balance between explicit regulatory requirements and a risk based approach. It is difficult to accurately quantify the regulatory impact of these proposed changes due to the lack of available data. The changes include the provision of a regulatory framework that is equal to the risk associated with the strong growth of accommodation bond holdings and the increasing of incentives for bonds to be used in a prudent and sustainable way to meet the policy objective of allowing providers to charge bonds. Further, any costs to providers due to changes to ensure that bonds are only used for permitted purposes will be minimised by removing current restrictions on the use of income derived from bonds, retention amounts and accommodation charges and giving providers complete flexibility over how such income is used. There will be a transition period of two years, which will allow approved providers time to comply with the new arrangements. The changes also ensure that the financial interests of care recipients are protected.


These proposed changes will take effect in relation to accommodation bonds taken by approved providers on or after 1 October 2011 and the new complaints principles will take effect on 1 September 2011. A two-year transition period will conclude at the end of September 2013 to allow the changes to permitted uses of accommodation bonds to take effect and to allow the sector to become familiar with the new requirements. A post-implementation review will take place in 2014 or 2015. This review will be extremely important to the industry and I certainly look forward to seeing the outcome and what the challenges are.


Another key element of this bill is the management and resolution of complaints about aged-care services. The bill proposes that the investigation principles be replaced with new complaints principles. This will provide greater flexibility for complainants and will result in a range of options being available to assist in resolving a complaint, including early resolution, conciliation and mediation. I support this measure as people accessing the industry deserve to be looked after.


In my electorate of Hasluck, there are 22 approved aged-care providers providing a total of 321 community care places, 313 residential high-care places and 610 residential low-care places. I have been privileged to visit a number of these providers and they provide outstanding service to those in Hasluck who need it. I will always fight for the needs of the aged-care sector because it is an important part of the Hasluck community. We all know someone who is accessing aged-care services and, as such, we all have a duty to stand up and argue to improve the quality of the industry. This is a passion of mine. As I stated in my first speech to the House:


Elders within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies are revered and respected, and hold a special place—they do not go away but remain as wisdom-givers and guides in our future. The same concept has to be applied to all seniors and retirees, and the support they require should be accorded to them.


In the short time I have represented the electorate of Hasluck I have enjoyed the privilege of meeting people within residential care and, equally, those who have made the decision to remain living at home. The level of support provided in the home has been welcomed; what is disappointing, though, is that where there are increasing numbers there is not the financial capital to build the infrastructure required to provide the number of beds that are needed. I hope that in the future the Productivity Commission report and the work that we do on this side will help contribute to solutions that will make a difference across this nation for our elders, who will need the services and opportunities that are provided, both socially and from the point of view of accommodation at secure facilities that provide them with a bed and the comfort of support.


I revere our seniors. I believe that they provide opportunities for us to learn of the past, to take their knowledge and use it for the future and to understand our history in this nation. When I was teaching, the school had a relationship with an aged-care home and I saw many children enjoy the relationship with older people. Those who did not have grandparents enjoyed the relationship with seniors in those villages. They liked the fact that they were talking to people who had lived through a history, where they had seen the transition from horse-and-cart days to the types of vehicles and technology that we have in this day and age. I just hope that this government gives due attention to the needs of our elderly and to aged-care services.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (18:51):  The aged-care system in Australia is rapidly approaching crisis point. The number of people over 65 is set to double over the next 20 years and the industry is desperate for additional funding particularly for capital works. There are a number of indicators that should alarm all policy-makers in this House in the provision of residential care in particular, and I would like to talk about some of these.


Last year the federal government allocated 1,564 additional residential aged-care places to Western Australia. However, only 314 of the beds were taken up—just 20 per cent. In the preceding year, of the 1,208 beds on offer, only 507 or 42 per cent were taken up in WA. What is worse, over the last three years 786 aged-care bed licences, the licence that provides the funding for aged-care beds, were handed back to the government and 283 of them were from Western Australia. We are now some 2,400 beds short of our aged-care requirements in WA. The situation is going to get worse.


This is happening at a time when the group referred to as the 'baby boomers', those born between 1946 and 1964, start to enter retirement. They are looking at retirement and at aged-care solutions. I would suggest that several members in this House right at this moment may be part of that group and may feel as though they are being made responsible for a lot of the world's problems. Some of us do, however, represent a significant increase in the ageing population, which makes the debate on how we care for our ageing community perhaps even more urgent for some members here.


In my electorate of Forrest there are around 19,000 residents over the age of 65 and that number will increase rapidly. We have 30 aged-care facilities; however, the number of facilities and their capacity has to expand as the age demographic within my electorate increases. I note that in its 2011-12 budget submission the Aged Care Industry Council stated:


A snapshot of the industry at the start of 2011 does not depict a sustainable system: only 40% of residential aged care services are operating in the black; hours of service are decreasing; hours of care provided under community aged care packages have fallen; and many providers are not building new residential care beds. The situation is worse in rural and regional areas where providers face generally higher costs with less ability to manage their income streams.


This is exactly the case in my electorate, and I would expect it is also the case in other rural and regional electorates. It is extremely difficult for aged-care providers to invest in new facilities. The financial viability of the sector is critical to the ongoing provision of appropriate aged care in this nation.


As well as the viability issue, as we engage in the debate about aged care, there are several other questions. One of them is: what is the most appropriate form of care? Historically senior members of our community were cared for by their families in the homes. While in some circumstances this may have resulted in some forms of neglect, in most cases it did not. In many countries in the world it is still the primary form of aged care. Some constituents of mine with a strong history in the aged-care sector visited Italy in recent years and did some research on the aged-care industry there. It was extremely limited, of course, because most of the aged care in Italy centred on care in the home, by the family, with the support as needed. We have some similarities. They have a baby boomer population entering retirement, as does most of the developed world. There are increasing numbers of families who can no longer care for their ageing relatives at home although Italy, as you would imagine, starts from a much lower base on this.


Most Australians want to live in their own homes as long as they possibly can. When people cannot do so, they will most certainly enter residential care but, because it will be later in life, they will be in a much more frail state with far more serious health issues, as the member for Mackellar frequently advises us. They will potentially need high care, which brings me to the bill before the House. Accommodation bonds are an acknowledgement that the individual does have some responsibility to contribute to their own aged care. The bill tightens the rules for the use of bond money. Greater certainty in the area is required, but it is another tinkering around the edges of aged-care provision. This is an industry that is overwhelmed with compliance already, yet the government is adding to that burden, and more and more resources within these facilities are being directed to compliance and less into patient care where it is so badly needed. Again, the government has broken its promise to repeal one piece of legislation and regulation for every other piece that it passes. As I said, the industry is swamped with complex, overlapping and costly regulations.


The government must also consider the specific and individual needs of smaller, community based aged-care providers such as Tuia Lodge in Donnybrook in my electorate, which is a 26-bed facility employing 30 very caring staff members. Lui Tuia has been the driving force, as the member for Mackellar knows. It has been Lui's leadership and endless volunteering, the commitment from the local community and constant community fundraising that has provided the people of Donnybrook with a great quality, caring aged-care facility. In this small community not only does Tuia Lodge provide aged care but it is one of the major employers in the town. I am told that, in general, aged care employs more people than retail. Facilities like Tuia Lodge need to be able to expand to meet the growing demands of Donnybrook. There will be an explosion in the need for high-care provision within three years in this area, but they need the capital funding to expand and, of course, it has to be a profitable outcome to proceed and be sustainable. Tuia Lodge needs all the help and consideration of its specific needs from this government not only to continue to provide quality services but to continue to expand to meet the needs of the community.


Another issue confronting rural and regional communities is the fact that parents with disabled children of a mature age have no aged-care accommodation facilities that provide for their specific needs. The task ahead, the future of aged care will take bold vision and strength of resolve that not only is not in this legislation but is also lacking from this government.


An aged-care provider in the town of Collie in my electorate, Southern Cross Care, has a 64-bed residence which currently has a waiting list of 22 people. One poor lady has recently had to leave the town she has lived in for 66 years and move 50 kilometres to Bunbury. There was no other option for the lady and, of course, it is particularly difficult for her family.


I did want to briefly touch on palliative care, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I see that my time has run out. I believe there are other matters in this House that are about to be dealt with, so I will conclude my remarks.

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2011-06-01,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (19:00):  I rise in the House today to speak again about another blow to regional Australia from the federal Labor government. I will provide you yet again with evidence that this government has absolutely no regard for the people who live outside the big cities and towns. In a cruel blow to the small communities throughout Flynn, the Labor government has closed 24 Medicare Australia access points in the electorate and will close a further three within the next year or so. Towns like Wowan, coal mining towns like Tieri, Blackwater, Moura and Theodore, which has just been devastated by floods for the second year in a row, and communities like Boyne Island, with an aluminium smelter, and Tannum Sands are being affected. People are now being told they have to either access Medicare information via the internet or travel to larger towns or cities to conduct their Medicare business.




Mr McCormack:
  It is not good enough. It is a shame.




Mr O'DOWD:
  It is a shame. It is unacceptable. What about elderly residents and those with illnesses or disabilities? Some people do not know how to access the internet or for one reason or another cannot travel long distances to these towns to carry out such basic day-to-day functions. Some people have no cars and rely on public transport. I can tell you that there is no public transport in a lot of these towns. There are no taxi services. There are no bus services.


The government are out of touch with the needs of the regional communities. This decision by an uncaring Labor government must be overturned and overturned soon. It is like everything else they do. They hide behind the curtains and leave the delivery of bad news to the store owners and business owners who they have just sacked. Let me quote from the notice sent out to the store owners who for years have provided this service to their communities and have been sacked by Medicare Australia. The letter to those people, who had been faithful over all those years, said:


It is your responsibility to notify all customers who intend to use the Medicare Australia access point facility that it will no longer be available.


Let us get this straight: the federal government sack the store owners and then require them to do the government's dirty work by delivering the bad news to the people of these smaller towns. We all know this is a 'good news only' government. All they want to speak about is the good news, all the good things.




Mr McCormack:
  There is not much of that.




Mr O'DOWD:
  There is not much of that either. You are right.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  The honourable member for Riverina ought not to interject from outside his seat.




Mr O'DOWD:
  We all know that this is all spin and no substance. But for pity's sake, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is beyond the pale. Twenty-seven Medicare Australia access point facilities are being taken away from my electorate. We have not heard from the member for Capricornia how many are about to be stripped from my neighbouring electorate, but bad news does not sell very well so I guess we will not hear much from her on this issue. Over 800 of these Medicare Australia access points are being closed Australia-wide. Do not tell me none are being closed in Capricornia. Or is it just a case of Labor members not wanting to face up to the honest truth, which is that this government has absolutely no regard for regional Australians? (Time expired)

Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (09:30):  One way or another, about 53,000 people in my electorate of Hinkler will suffer under the Labor-Greens plan to means test private health insurance rebates. Almost 40,000 adults in my electorate hold private health insurance, covering 53,000 people, including children. Every single one of these, not just those in higher income brackets, will be hurt by the Labor-Greens plan to means test private health insurance rebates. You might ask, 'How?' The reality of life is that if you hit millions of Australians with increased premiums and many of those people then dump their private health insurance entirely you leave the remainder of the policyholders with higher premiums. In a double whammy, those people who have left private health insurance will turn to the public system, again adding pressure where pressure already exists. It is self-defeating.


Around 5.6 million Australians with private health cover earn less than $50,000 each year and around one million of those have incomes of less than $24,000. Yet people on these very modest incomes come into my office with private health insurance. Many people in Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Childers and other communities in my electorate fit into this category, including self-funded retirees, to say nothing of pensioners, DVA benefit recipients and battlers with young families. Many are trying to do the right thing and care for their own health needs by spending their own money on private health insurance. Yet this government wants to punish them by making it even tougher. Another consideration is the impact on existing and planned private hospital facilities, such as St Stephen's in Hervey Bay and the Friendly and Mater hospitals in Bundaberg. Any drop in the number of privately insured people accessing these hospitals will limit their ability to recruit specialists and offer a wide range of innovative services.


Hinkler has one of the largest over-65 demographic profiles in the country. Any weakening in private health insurance and hospital facilities in the region only adds to the strain on the existing public sector. As someone who worked very hard in the previous coalition government and played a significant role in getting the health insurance rebate lifted for over-65s to 35 per cent and for the over-70s to 40 per cent, I find this particularly offensive and I remind my Labor colleagues that it is going back on a promise that they made to the Australian people.

  Before the debate is resumed on this bill I remind the Committee that, pursuant to the resolution agreed to by the House on 10 May 2011, this order of the day will be debated concurrently with Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2011-2012 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (10:00):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 and cognate bills. Today, being 1 June, we are coming up to the anniversary of when the government entered its second term, and this is Labor's fourth budget since it came to office. Since that time we have seen what amounts to a record spending spree in Australian history. So I want to do a few things today. Firstly I want to talk in a macro sense about how damaging this budget is to the national interest, secondly I want to say something about its negative effect on my electorate, and thirdly I want to say something about its devastating effect on our national security and border protection policies.


In a macro sense, since coming to office Labor have accumulated over $150 billion worth of deficits. To fund these deficits, they borrow $135 million per day—every day, seven days a week—which means that the Australian taxpayer will be spending $7.5 billion on interest payments by 2014. That is $7½ billion that will be wasted every year on interest payments for a debt that Labor have run up since they came to office, $7½ billion that could be spent on much more important things than interest payments on Labor's debt. That does not even begin to look at repaying the principal on that debt, which of course will fall to us when we come to government, as it always does, because every time the Labor Party get into government they do exactly the same thing. They spend wastefully, they ran deficits, they run up debt and they pay interest on that debt. Every time, we are called to come into government and clean up their mess. We will accept that burden again, although quite frankly it should not be that way.


The News Limited newspapers have revealed the total cost of Labor's wasteful spending on government programs alone. Just for failed programs, and I am talking about things like the home insulation disaster and the school halls disaster, every household in my electorate will be liable for $567. So, just for those failed programs, every household in Stirling is going to have to stump up $567 to pay for that gross waste. This is a terrible indictment on the performance of the Rudd-Gillard government and it is another example highlighting the fact that the current debt and deficit really is an astonishing squandering of the inheritance that Labor had when they came to office.


The result of this wasteful spending and this running up of debt and deficit particularly falls on the shoulders of my home state of Western Australia. You only need to look at the record of this government to see that they view Western Australia solely as a cash cow. Even last week a Labor senator coming in through the doors confirmed this. Senator Doug Cameron from New South Wales came through the doors last Wednesday and he said: 'I will be arguing strongly that we cannot have a position where, because of natural resources, because of luck, one state can have a standard of living that is way beyond what everybody else can achieve and everybody else is left to make it up how they can. It's not on.' This is what he said in response to the Western Australian government taking away the concession for the royalty on iron ore fines. That is a very good example of how the Labor Party looks at Western Australia. They think that Western Australia should just pay the bills they are running up at the astonishing rate I have already outlined.


When the Prime Minister comes to Western Australia she pretends that she knows a little bit about what is going on. What is going on there is the most incredible economic transformation that any state in Australia has seen in the history of this country. When she comes to Western Australia she says that she would like to see Western Australia get its fair share. This is the same sort of thing that her predecessor, Kevin Rudd, said when he came to Western Australia, but their actions belie that rhetoric because they only see Western Australia as a cash cow.


I could spend the rest of my time outlining where Labor have failed Western Australia, but I want to highlight a couple of great examples of the damage they are doing to my home state. Firstly, Labor excluded small miners and brokered a secret deal to impose a $10½ billion mining tax. The astonishing thing is that they negotiated with BHP, Rio Tinto and Xstrata, who ran rings around them because Labor had no idea what they were doing. Those companies ran rings around Wayne Swan and the upshot is that they will not be paying any of this tax. The burden will fall on small miners, particularly in Western Australia. That $10½ billion will not be paid by the big resource companies; it will be paid by the junior miners. Quite frankly, the Western Australian mining community is outraged about that.


Seven billion dollars of this tax will come from Western Australia, so about 70 per cent of this tax will come from one state. What we get in return from this government is quite frankly contemptuous. Labor will return only 6c out of every dollar taken from Western Australia under the mining tax. So 70 per cent of that tax will be paid by Western Australians, but we will get only six per cent of it back. Labor have failed to fix the GST arrangements which see Western Australia receive only 68c for every dollar we pay in GST, while other states receive either equal to what they put in or, in the case of some states, substantially more than they put in. Labor have also broken their promise and are considering a carbon tax, which will drive up electricity prices in Western Australia and seriously damage the Western Australian economy for, sadly, no net environmental benefit.


Western Australia suffered because the Labor Party withheld $350 million in extra health funding because the Western Australian government refused to hand over GST funding within the health agreement. Labor have also announced a new detention centre at the town of Northam, which means that Western Australia bears far more of the burden of Labor's failed border protection policies. People smugglers are incarcerated in Western Australian jails at a cost to the Western Australian taxpayer. Western Australia houses more detention centres and more of the detained population than anywhere else within Australia.


Of the funding we provide to this Labor government, very little flows back in funding to my state. The government announced 28 GP superclinics, but only three of those will be in Western Australia. Western Australia will receive only seven per cent of GST revenue and that will fall to less than six per cent in coming years, and of course our contribution to that is significantly greater.


As I said, I could go on forever about the ways in which the Labor government are doing bad things to Western Australia, but the truth is that they really do not understand what is happening there and the only way that Western Australia will get a fair go is when this government is turfed out. Fortunately, I can report that my fellow Western Australians are very keen to do that and they will be coming for the member for Brand, the member for Perth and the member for Fremantle at the next federal election. Not long after Kevin Rudd won the 2007 election he stood in Kings Park while overlooking the city and promised that under his government Western Australians would not miss out, but sadly the facts belie that.


I will turn to my electorate of Stirling. If the coalition had won the last election my electors would be substantially better off not only for all the reasons I have outlined but also because the Labor Party did not make one commitment to the electorate of Stirling in the last election campaign. Through the whole election campaign the Labor Party did not commit to spending $1 in my electorate of Stirling. The Labor candidate there astonishingly did not seem to have enough pull to get her party to make any commitment, which is rather extraordinary considering I was on a relatively small margin. 


If we had won we would have addressed some of the electorate's concerns. We have in the past installed closed-circuit television cameras at crime hotspots, and we would have expanded that program throughout my electorate if we had been given the chance to do so by forming government. We were going to increase funding to the City of Stirling for the security services that they run. We would have installed a synthetic playing surface at the Scarborough Sportsman's Club and we would have spent money upgrading local roads. Sadly, there have been endless promises from both state and federal Labor to upgrade local roads in my electorate and not once have those promises been delivered. It has been up to the Barnett Liberal government to fund some of those commitments without $1 of federal money, which is shameful considering that Labor has promised this to my constituency at every single federal and state election since 2004. The Barnett government has come in and will solely fund the overpass at Reid Highway in Mirrabooka Avenue. I am very pleased it is doing that, but I am very disappointed that the federal government has not committed any money. If we were in government we would have committed $10 million to that project.


Crime remains one of the most prevalent concerns of my electors and during the years of the Howard government we pursued our best efforts to have the Commonwealth government play a role in fighting crime in our local communities. We funded the City of Stirling's Safer Suburbs plan which delivered more security patrols through local neighbourhoods and closed-circuit television cameras at Scarborough Beach and throughout the electorate. It also delivered crime prevention methods such as electronic message boards and all-terrain vehicles.


Unfortunately, the Labor Party has not shown the same sense of urgency when it comes to addressing the alarmingly high crime rates across my electorate, across Western Australia and across the country as a whole. In the last federal election the coalition promised to recommit money to the National Community Crime Prevention Program, and I believe that we will be doing the same in the next election because we believe it is very important for the Commonwealth government to use the resources at its disposal to make its contribution to securing our streets. We will pursue real action to boost crime fighting and to do all we can at the Commonwealth level to fight crime. Unfortunately, just as Labor is all talk and no action in Western Australia, it is also all talk and no action in my electorate of Stirling. We will change that once the government changes. 


I turn very briefly to my shadow portfolio. The issue I was raising about crime rates within my community is very important because, while the Commonwealth does not have primary responsibility for local crime fighting, it does have significant responsibility to do all it can to protect our borders. We know very well about its failure in border protection, about the flow of illegal boats that has resulted from Labor's changes to our robust border protection system since it came into office; but there is another issue that is less focused on and that is its failure to protect our borders from illicit drugs, its failure to protect our borders from illegal weapons and its failure to stop illicit cargo coming into this country at both our ports and airports because it has massively cut funding for the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to run those checks. Air cargo inspections are down a staggering 75 per cent because of the budget cuts that Labor has introduced since it came into office. Sea cargo inspections are down 25 per cent. What this means is that it is easier for organised crime to smuggle things into Australia. 


The Labor Party's border protection failure is not just its failure to dissuade people smugglers from bringing people down to Australia illegally but its failure to do its job to fight local crime and to stop illegal substances and illegal weapons coming onto our streets in the first place. You cannot trust these guys with any national security issue and the Prime Minister has shown through her behaviour that she really does not see her role in national security as one of her primary considerations. She did not even bother turning up for the National Security Committee of Cabinet. When she came to office as Prime Minister she astonishingly axed the Border Protection Committee of Cabinet. She said that that was going to be one of her priorities and her first act was to axe the cabinet committee that actually looks at border protection.


Labor's failure within my portfolio has been enormous. Every front-line national security agency received a cut in this budget: the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, the Australian Crime Commission and every single one of our intelligence agencies. And since the Labor Party came to office there are now 24,000 extra public servants and fewer front-line personnel dealing with national security and crime issues, which is a good indication that they just do not have the right priorities for our country.


This is a budget that failed not only Australia but Western Australia and it failed my electors in Stirling. The hardworking people in my suburbs will be the ones called on to pay Labor's debt, and it is a shameful, wasted opportunity for the country.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (10:15):  I rise today to speak on the appropriation bills that have been brought before the parliament: Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2011-2012 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012. But I would first like to make an observation that the Treasurer looked like a man under pressure in the weeks before delivering his fourth budget. He had every real reason to feel that pressure not because, as he would have the Australian people believe, he is yet again a victim of circumstances—a high Australian dollar, natural disasters and the financial crisis, all conspiring against him—but because even he understands that, deep down, after delivering three budgets the tired web of excuses does not stack up when you look at the economic data. 


If you think of the budget as a 100-metre sprint, it is one thing to complain that you had to carry a heavy bag while competing. But when you start the race at the 80-metre point and are kitted out with all of the equipment to run it well, those excuses look hollow. The reason why the Treasurer looked under pressure is that he knows that he has not done the work that needs to be done by a Treasurer of this country. Using my sporting analogy, far from preparing for the event, doing the hard work, this Treasurer has done the equivalent of rocking up to compete after a big night out. He has squandered not only his opportunity but the opportunity of millions of Australians. This government's legacy of waste and mismanagement will be felt not just by this generation but by generations to come.


The Treasurer looked under pressure because Australians are now wise to the promises thrown around like confetti by this government—promises of a surplus but, instead, delivering deficit after deficit; promises of reduced spending, yet at the same time increasing borrowing; promises that it will reduce the cost of living for Australian families, while at the same time hiking up their private health insurance bills and slapping them with multiple new taxes. The budget very clearly reveals that this government does not have any plan other than to tax more and hope that our historic terms of trade and our high commodity prices will continue. There is no plan B. More disturbingly, there is no plan A.


Good budgets are about four things: accountability and discipline, providing for immediate needs, providing for challenges when they come, and long-term planning. Families know this. If a family spends more money on one area, such as repairs to the house or a health crisis, they cut back somewhere else because it goes to their bottom line. They understand that they have to exercise discipline because there is only so much money. They also know that they have to balance their immediate needs with their long-term goals, whether it be to own a home, send their children to a school of their choice or to take a holiday. They also know that they should prepare for that rainy day in case it interferes with their plans. Business also knows this. The coalition knows this. But it is clear that, after four budgets, the Labor Party and this government still have not worked this out. The budget failed on all of these four fronts.


In the time available, I wanted to touch on a couple of the key things in the budget that leapt out at me. Despite the talk of surpluses that have not yet been delivered and rapid fiscal consolidation, the government did a very curious thing. You only need to look at Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 to see this. In this bill the government has provisioned to amend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911—the CIS Act—to increase the limit on the face value of stock and securities that can be on issue under the Treasurer's standing borrowing authority. What this means is that the government is seeking to increase its gross debt ceiling from $200 billion to $250 billion. But, more than this, this government is seeking to give itself full discretion to do this. It would not have to provide reasons. This comes not long after a previous increase. It was not all that long ago that the government's gross debt ceiling was $75 billion. This was increased up to $200 billion. So this government, while talking about making tough decisions, reducing spending and reducing the debt, at the same time has hiked up the debt on the nation's credit card. This is a government that says one thing and does another.


We should look to the current deficit that this government has delivered. It has soared to $49.4 billion, and the forecasted deficit in 2011-12 has already blown out by $9.6 billion to $22.6 billion. In November we were told that net debt would peak at $94 billion. On budget night that figure went up—no surprises there—to $107 billion. Not only that but net debt is going to stay above $100 billion for at least the next four years. This is a government that is continuing to borrow $135 million a day. With that borrowing comes interest payment bills that Australian families will have to pay. Labor's debt will mean an interest bill of $7 billion a year. In fact, the cumulative interest on Labor's net debt will be more than $26 billion over the next four years.


If we can, let us just stop for a moment and think about the real cost to Australian families of this interest bill. $26 billion is a lot of money. That money could be paying for real infrastructure investment. That sort of money could be invested in solving some of the long-term problems and challenges that Australia faces, such as escalating medical costs through the ageing of the population and the like.


This budget is very unkind on Australian families. It is worth noting that, since Labor was elected, electricity prices have gone up by 51 per cent, gas has gone up by 30 per cent and water has gone up by 46 per cent. Education costs have also risen by 24 per cent, health has gone up by 20 per cent and rent has gone up by 21 per cent. When my electors go to the grocery store, they can see that their bills have gone up by an average of around 14 per cent. Yet this is the first budget in eight years that has not provided tax cuts for everyday Australians, tax cuts that would help Australians with the cost of living. This government of course cannot do that because it has refused to be tough on itself. Instead, it would prefer to be tough on Australian families. I think it is fair to say that Australians are being squeezed tighter than the Treasurer's drinking glass. The government is stripping away $2 billion from families by freezing key family tax payments and thresholds. All families receiving family tax benefits will have some of their benefits stripped. At the same time Labor is hitting Australians with $6 billion worth of new taxes, including a flood tax. In my electorate of Higgins many residents, many electors, contributed very generously to the disaster relief in Queensland and Victoria. Yet they have been now slugged twice because of the mismanagement of this government.


My electors in Higgins have also been slugged through the changes within these budget bills to the private health insurance rebate. Seventy-seven per cent of my electorate in Higgins have got private health insurance. This will have a very real impact on their ability to keep and hold their private health insurance. It will have a very real impact on their ability to access quality health care. More importantly, because of this ideological war that is being waged by the Labor Party on Australian families, it will have a very real impact on the public health budget as well. It does not make a great deal of economic sense.


Interest rates will definitely go up. This budget has done nothing to reduce the pressure on Australian families and inhibit the Reserve Bank from increasing interest rates. Already the Reserve Bank has warned in its monetary statements that it will need to do this, and this budget has done nothing to stall that. Interest rates have risen seven times since the end of 2009 and are forecast to rise again twice over the next six months. We cannot forget, either, that when we talk about those debt and deficit figures it is not without very direct meaning for Australians. The fact that Labor's debt will reach $107 million means that that is $4,700 for every man, woman and child in Australia.


This government, as everybody knows, has presided over great waste and mismanagement. We have seen that with the installation of pink batts in roofs that are combustible and the resulting bill to fix that up. We have seen that with the mismanagement of the Building the Education Revolution program where some schools were paying double or triple the price they would pay in other ordinary commercial circumstances to build those buildings. We have seen blowouts in the processing of asylum seekers in Australia at a cost to this budget of $1.75 billion. We have seen money raided from the higher education endowment fund with the balance now down to $2.5 billion from $6 billion when the coalition established it. This government does not know how to manage taxpayer money.


Very revealingly, this budget is engaged in a number of deceptions on the Australian people. The budget papers show that revenue from the mining tax will be down by $5.9 billion from the figures that the government released just three months ago. So already the government has had to adjust. The budget says nothing about the carbon tax that it will be introducing before the next budget next year. This carbon tax will have a huge impact on our economy. There is nothing in this budget about the impact that it may have. Let us not forget that one of the greatest deceits in this budget is the handling of the NBN—the off-balance-sheet treatment of the NBN. It makes an absolute mockery of the projected surplus that the Treasurer keeps talking about. It is in fact the most creative accounting that we have ever seen in any set of budget papers.


Another deception is the claim by this government that it has brought forward $22 billion worth of savings. Yet included in this $22 billion worth of so-called savings is the flood tax, which comes to almost one-third of that amount. The government also claims it is going to increase spending on important initiatives like mental health care reform. It claims that it is spending up to $2.2 billion on this, but when you actually look closely at the figures you can see that, in fact, it is going to cut $580 million of GP rebates to fund it and that the real new spending is more like $530 million. This budget has failed the Australian people, this government is deceitful with the Australian people and we look forward to an election where the Australian people can cast their judgment.

Mr SLIPPER
 (Fisher—Deputy Speaker) (10:31):  I am particularly pleased to be able to join the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 and cognate bills. The budget from this government, once again, fails my constituents on the Sunshine Coast. Families are worse off, and the budget indicates that the government is simply out of touch with families on the Sunshine Coast and elsewhere. Unfortunately, there is very little in the budget for families, and the budget does not contain the prescription needed to restore the situation in this country. Unfortunately, through the government's failed border protection policies millions and millions of dollars are being spent. However, if the policies of the former Howard government were adopted that would not be necessary and those funds would be available to provide very necessary infrastructure for the Sunshine Coast and, indeed, for other growth areas of Australia.


The deficit of the budget this year has soared to almost $50 billion and is forecast to be in this situation for some time. In fact, the budget deficit forecast for 2011-2012 has blown out by $9.6 billion to $22.6 billion. That is a matter of grave concern. The Treasurer tells us that the government will be returning the budget to surplus within a very finite period. I hope that the Treasurer's predictions are correct. However, on the indications, and on the performance of this government in the past, one cannot be optimistic that this will occur. Net government debt has climbed to a record $107 billion in 2011-12 and is forecast to remain above $100 billion across the forward estimates. This amounts to more than $4,700 debt for every Australian.


This is another typical old-fashioned Labor budget that is big on taxes and big on spending but fails to help households battling higher costs of living on items such as petrol, electricity, gas, groceries, health costs and home repayments. We also find that the government is launching a $2 billion assault on families by freezing the indexation of key family tax payments and income thresholds for three years. This is the first budget in eight years that has not provided tax cuts for everyday Australians. This government is being tough on Australian families because it has failed to be tough on itself. I mentioned before the money which has to be spent because Labor has lost control of Australia's borders. Offshore unauthorised arrival management has blown out by a record $1.75 billion since last year's budget. The current approach by the government is in complete disarray. The new arrangements for taxing company cars will slug small business operators, tradesmen, farmers and the taxi and hire car industry with increased costs at a time when they are already doing it tough. Regional Australia has again been short-changed by a citycentric government that has cut $500 million in regional funding. There is not a single new cent in this budget for road or rail projects across Australia. Since coming to power in 2007, the government has employed 24,000 additional public servants and the government is asking people on the Sunshine Coast to tighten their belts but is refusing to do the same to itself. Australians are looking for stability and certainty from their government and most Australians would be sorely disappointed, firstly, by what is in this budget and, secondly, by what is not in this budget.


The Sunshine Coast is one of the fastest growing areas of Australia. Because we are a fast-growing area, we never seem to have the infrastructure we require to meet the needs of our growing population. We need to upgrade the Bruce Highway to six lanes all the way from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast. The former Howard government invested money to upgrade the Bruce Highway from Brisbane to Caboolture and, at the time, that removed the worst bottleneck between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast. But as road traffic continues to grow, delays seem to be inevitable. The existing four-lane highway—that is, two lanes in each direction—desperately needs upgrading to six lanes. Not to do so is completely unacceptable.


On the Sunshine Coast we have a wonderful lifestyle, we have a very hospitable population but what we do need on the Sunshine Coast are more jobs, particularly jobs for young people. We need clean and green industries and we need government policies which will encourage the development of job opportunities so that young people are not forced to leave the Sunshine Coast to seek employment. The University of the Sunshine Coast is doing a wonderful job. It is giving large numbers of students in our community the opportunity to study in an increasing range of disciplines. We hope that many of those graduates will find work on the Sunshine Coast.


Not only is the Sunshine Coast a rapidly growing area; it is a very interesting area because demographically it is one of the oldest parts of Australia. Lots of people retire to the Sunshine Coast from around the country, and that is entirely understandable because it is a wonderful place to live. But we also have lots of young families and those young families are extremely concerned about the employment opportunities for their children. Part of our unemployment problem on the Sunshine Coast is imported, I suppose. Compare being unemployed in some of the southern parts of Australia and being unemployed in a place that has wonderful beaches and a wonderful lifestyle and it is hardly surprising that people often choose to move to an area where there is less employment but a better lifestyle. That is why quite often our unemployment rate is higher than one would normally expect, because lots of people who would be unemployed elsewhere choose to move to the Sunshine Coast. 


It is a pity that the Liberal-National Party coalition was not elected at the last election because we were able to promise a range of infrastructure projects for the Sunshine Coast which would have provided incredible benefits for our local community. I have also spoken in the parliament and I have written to the government to seek to have these infrastructure projects implemented, despite the fact that the Labor Party was elected to office and the Liberal-National Party coalition is still in opposition. We would like to see the Bruce Highway upgraded, we would like to see $2.5 million given to upgrade the Caloundra Aquatic Lifestyle Centre and we would like to see $700,000 for a viewing platform for Maleny's Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve. The latter would enable people to view the Glass House Mountains in a safe way. At present, the view, which is spectacular, often entices people to wander across the road, placing their safety at risk.


It is also important to recognise that the government needs to invest more in tourism, particularly on the Sunshine Coast. People on the Sunshine Coast are particularly concerned over the fact that the government said prior to the election that it would not introduce a carbon tax and yet a carbon tax is now on the government's agenda and could well be legislated for by the parliament. It is important that, when you stand up prior to an election and say that you are going to pursue a certain policy, once you have received the support of the Australian people, you seek to carry out the pledge that you made.


Very few people on the Sunshine Coast support a carbon tax. Most people, if given the choice between a clean environment and a less clean environment would certainly choose the former. However, given that Australia is a relatively low emitter, if the carbon tax is brought in—and we have heard of the range of charges which will be imposed on Australian families, from $300 to $1,000, depending on the rate at which the carbon tax is struck—Australian families will be slugged, our businesses will be less competitive and our exporters will not be able to compete in world markets as they are currently able to. And, if the rest of the world does not follow a similar policy, there will be no improvement in the world environment. So, on the one hand, our own industry will be committing a form of economic suicide, costing jobs and so on, and, sadly, on the other hand, the world environment will be no better as a result of that action.


I would ask the government to consider a world solution rather than seeking to move unilaterally. I think Australia is a good international citizen. I think we have proven over the years that we are prepared to work with other countries to improve the environment. But to move forward unilaterally is not in our interests and would do very little at all for the environment. That is absolutely unacceptable.


I would also like to talk about the need for safety throughout the Sunshine Coast. We have a very good area; however, it would be very useful if we were able to get CCTV surveillance cameras to boost public safety in key parts of our community. Prior to the last election, we were able to pledge $300,000 for CCTV surveillance cameras and extra lighting in the central business district of Caloundra, $100,000 for CCTV surveillance cameras at the Mooloolaba shopping and tourism precinct and $100,000 for CCTV surveillance cameras in the Kawana Waters community. This commitment was also made prior to the election in 2007. Unfortunately, with the election of the current government, we have not yet been able to get that funding.


The funding would mean that we could better showcase our community as one which people could visit as tourists or move to to become residents. These surveillance cameras would improve the safety of people who are out having a good time. The Sunshine Coast is a relatively safe and law-abiding destination, but I think these cameras would provide a lot of reassurance and would help to boost our tourism numbers. For a relatively small investment, half a million dollars, public safety would be boosted, and that would be a very positive thing. It is important, I believe, to protect our environment. The environment is not the possession of any particular side of politics and I believe that, particularly with the Green Corps, the Howard government will go down on the record as one of the greenest governments in Australia's history, but it will never be given credit for that. But I think it is important to recognise that we do hold our environment in trust for future generations and that it would be wonderful if we were able to leave the environment of Australia in a much better situation when we depart this world than it was in when we arrived. So it is important that all of us, regardless of where we stand politically, focus on the need to make sure that appropriate funding is made available to protect and enhance our environment. We had, prior to the election, promised certain funding for a range of environmental groups on the Sunshine Coast, and I call on the current government to accept that they are very worthy causes and that our environment will be enhanced if those funding announcements prior to the election are implemented by this current government. 


This budget does fail the Australian people. It is not a prescription that our country needs at this time, and I would ask the Treasurer to reconsider the budget with a view to bringing in something more appropriate. I thank the House.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (10:46):  We have a national epidemic of obesity. We have gone from the fittest country in the world to one of the fattest. There are any number of television shows, with titles such as The Biggest Loser, which dramatically tell the story of the desperate actions required to address situations of obesity—the hardship, the heartbreak and the humiliation. Today I am talking about our government's obesity and the radical action that will be required to address this country's problems of excess and waste. The parallels between the two are worth noting because, in the days when our sportsmen and women dominated the fields of endeavour, virtually all Australians would try to emulate their sports stars on the weekend, resulting in their wellbeing, health and fitness. At this time, we enjoyed lean government and we were a creditable nation. 


No truer words have been spoken than those contained in the warning by Senator Barnaby Joyce when he said that he had never seen a big problem that did not begin as a small one and that if this rate of waste and misguided spending continued there would come a time when we would not be able to pay back our debt. Credibility and trust borne out of honesty should be the currency that a government or a political party trades on. Broken promises and treacherous behaviour do not build a sense of trust. The promise to build the Epping to Parramatta Rail Link, devoutly made in the heat of battle to win government during an election campaign, fades on even the most casual examination and exposes the fact that this promise to build would be dependent on the government winning a second term, the government being in surplus and the state government putting up the first $500 million. The very people who lose our trust and confidence with such transparently ingenuous undertakings deserve serious scrutiny when they make other promises. The promise made during the recent budget of a $3 billion surplus to come in the third year would be equally dependent on a number of factors and so has equal 'substance' to the promise made by the federal government to build the Epping to Parramatta railway line. Setting this aside, the government's representations put the promise of a $3 billion surplus into perspective. It will follow two more years of excessive deficit—$55 billion last year, followed by $50 billion, followed by $23 billion, and totalling $107 billion of debt. To have the audacity to say that a $3 billion surplus in year 3 is some kind of triumph beggars belief. This is a government that has come to dine at our table. They take more and more every time they need it. They go to their favourite dish—more taxes—creating the weight of debt to fund their lazy, misguided and, above all, wasteful practices. What could have nourished families, small business and industry has been squandered by inept government and criminal waste. It is so plain to see that history is repeating itself. The Howard government when elected inherited some $96 billion in debt. The Abbott government, when it is elected, will inherit a greater debt. The hallmark of the Rudd-Gillard government is that of quick-fix fast food, not the nutrition that our country needs. When we were crying out for vital infrastructure that would build our country and add value we got pink batts, and we got school halls when classrooms and libraries were needed, coated with lashings of waste.


Julia Gillard has justified this by saying that in large projects there will always be waste. This is an extraordinary position to take and it is difficult to imagine that somebody who has found their way to the position of Prime Minister could not understand the dynamic that when building more than one school hall, with a high level of architectural design and requiring no variations during construction, the marketplace will effect lower prices with greater quantity.


And we have the situation of pink batts in roofs, where those who entered the industry after promises and undertakings from the government committed themselves, their businesses and their assets to this new industry, then mercilessly had the rug pulled from under them after more empty reassurances. The government, which should be in the practice of building industries, was setting these poor souls up for a brief boom and an inevitable bust. In the solar industry we had the same scenario. And all the while the government was feasting on taxes, growing bureaucracies, growing inefficiencies and growing the obesity of debt. The next competitor in the Biggest Loser will be Australia after the final great feast—a carbon tax.


Personal obesity accounts for more than 50 per cent of our health costs—combined with other lifestyle choices, an imposition of over 70 per cent of our total health cost. The single best thing that you can do for your physical health or mental health is to exercise. When you exercise in the form of participation in a sport, the component of socialisation is added, which is a key component in the prevention of mental illness.


In the budget there was a promise of $1.5 billion for mental health. A little examination will tell you very quickly that sadly those who need help most are denied. The reduction from 12 appointments with a psychologist to 10 might not have been a devastating blow to many but on a little further examination we learn that those with more acute need for psychological intervention, who would previously have had the right to a further six visits, have now lost those visits.


This is another graphic example of short-term thinking, small savings and long-term cost. Tragically, the cost in this scenario is measured not just in dollars. Headlines this week—a week where there has been many major news events—have found the manner in which the Gillard government attempted to lure FIFA's affections in a bid to host the Soccer World Cup was consistent with their poor ability to manage and ensure value for our tax dollars. We have heard allegations of bribery. There are allegations of $11.4 million of the $45 million given by this government having gone missing and of two sets of books being maintained by the FFA. Despite an inquiry on this reporting back in March, this report has still not seen the light of day and it seems another $39 million has now been sent down the same rabbit hole. On reflection, what is fundamentally wrong with the way in which we attempted to win the World Cup bid is that it was largely contrary to our sporting heritage, which is such a vital part of our nation's history. The building of our character and what we stand for has always lain in the fact that we have previously put all our efforts into excelling in sports on the field, not in fancy hotels and restaurants. We host cricket tests with the greatest cricket nations in the world because we are one of those great nations. We host a grand slam tennis tournament because when the grand slam was declared we were one of only four nations who had won the Davis Cup—we earned our position on the court. We have hosted the Olympic Games twice, punching way above our weight, because we have always punched way above our weight. Australian sportsmen more than anything else have been the epitome of sportsmen: modest in victory and gracious in defeat, playing by the rules and playing fairly.


Without a knowledge of the past and an appreciation of history we are vulnerable not to learn from the past and to allow history to repeat itself. There is a great cost, whether for the individual or for the government, in becoming obese, and there is a great price to be paid for getting back into shape in order to be fully productive and enjoy a long and healthy life. To achieve this goal, an individual needs to take personal responsibility for their diet in the same way as a government needs to take responsibility for the economy and an obese way of living.


If history repeats itself, this government will leave office with a massive debt to be repaid. No doubt this will be undertaken by a lean and fit-for-the-purpose Abbott coalition. The path we then embark upon should be sustained, and we should learn from the past and not repeat the mistakes that have been made. With our dollar at record highs, there has never been a better time to undertake immediately the repayment of our debt.

"Crook, Tony, MP",NatsWA,2011-06-01,"



Mr CROOK
 (O'Connor) (10:57):  This being my first budget as the federal member for O'Connor, I must say that I receive it with very mixed emotions. This government has made much of the expected surplus in 2013, but this surplus is based on very thin margins and on legislation that the parliament is yet to see. It is also based on the premise that state governments must do as the federal government wants, which, as we all know, is not likely to happen—and I will talk more of that later.


I welcome the bipartisan support that this place has given to mental health and the increased funding that it has received in this budget. With around one in four people being affected by mental health issues, the allocation of $1.5 billion over the next five years is very welcome. Of this, $491 million is allocated to children, teens and young adults for 30 additional headspace centres and 12 early psychosis prevention and intervention centres across Australia. Having recently visited the headspace centre in Albany, I now have a far greater appreciation of the work they do. They are a tremendous asset to Albany and the Great Southern. I certainly hope to see a number of these headspace centres located in regional Western Australia and specifically in the electorate of O'Connor.


The only real concern is that the bulk of this money will be spent in the out years, not in the short term. If my visit to the Albany headspace centre taught me anything, it is that a timely, discreet and professional response to the issues that are here and now is critical. The window to address mental health issues can sometimes be very minute, and adequate resources are needed urgently. It is, however, disappointing that GP mental health funding is to be reduced, because in many cases these are the people at the front line—they are the first point of contact and sometimes the difference between some people's receiving urgent care and not receiving it.


I also welcome the $1.8 billion over six years from the Health and Hospitals Fund to support the development of health infrastructure in regional Australia. As welcome as this is, one cannot help but question, firstly, whether it will be enough and, secondly, what the value of these facilities will be if they are not staffed by well trained health professionals. Not enough is being done to address the gross shortage of doctors in regional Australia, particularly Western Australia. Country local governments across my electorate are literally forking out hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to provide GPs to their communities. One shire is putting up over $900,000 worth of incentives to retain a GP in their community. To put that in context, this investment equates to around 15 per cent of the total expenditure of this local government.


I would like to take this opportunity to mention the state government's announcement of $565 million to substantially reform and improve access to health care for residents of the southern inland of Western Australia. The southern inland health initiative is the centrepiece of the state government's spending on health in 2011 and 2012 and is funded under the Liberal-National government's very successful Royalties for Regions program. This package, to be funded from July 2011, includes $240 million of investment in the health workforce and provision of health services over four years and includes $325 million in capital works over five years. This initiative will fund an equivalent of 44 extra doctors to secure ED services and GP services across eight districts. The most unfortunate thing about the Western Australian government committing to this initiative is simply that they should not have to be doing this.


This is the first budget where we have actually seen a real indication of the much talked about mining tax, or mineral resource rent tax, and where this revenue might be spent. There has been much talk of the windfall that regional Australia will see from this tax. The first attempt is disappointing, to say the very least. Any return to regional Australia from the mining tax is via the Regional Infrastructure Fund. The Regional Infrastructure Fund is a $6 billion fund over 11 years and, according to the budget papers, is 'reinvesting the proceeds of the resource boom in mining communities'. $960 million has been allocated in this budget and the biggest single project, worth $480 million or 52 per cent of that, is a metropolitan project, Gateway WA, which is for the upgrade of Tonkin and Leach highways as well as the freeway. I fail to see how this is reinvesting in mining communities.


There has been much criticism, particularly from the Treasurer, about the Western Australian government's decision to raise royalties on their—and I stress their—iron ore. It is totally unfair of this government to assume that no states will alter their budgets or financial management practices just so the Treasurer can meet his surplus promise. At least 25 per cent of the royalties that the Western Australian government imposes are guaranteed to be delivered back to regional Western Australia via the Royalties for Regions fund, a fund that really does mean regional and is not just tokenism. Western Australia will be the main source of the mining tax revenue for this government and there is no better time than the present for this government to make a fair dinkum investment in mining communities and match the Royalties for Regions funding. 


The mining industry is planning to invest $76 billion in 2011 and 2012. If this government wants to reap the rewards of the mining industry by taxing it, the very least it could do is support infrastructure in those regional and mining communities that are delivering this dividend. Both the carbon and mining taxes are set to test, unnecessarily in my view, Australia's competitiveness in the global economy. I have concern for the impact on small to medium business and in turn jobs in Australia if we go down the path of taxing them out of existence in comparison to their global competitors.


On a more positive note, I welcome the extension for an additional year of the drought pilot program that has been running in conjunction with the Western Australian state government. Over the last two years many areas of Western Australia have experienced one of the driest seasons in recorded history. This has had a devastating impact on many of our regional communities, families and businesses who depend heavily on the agricultural sector. Last year the state and federal governments launched a drought pilot program to assist those farmers and families doing it tough through the drought.


This program has provided vital assistance to 67 local governments across WA, allowing farmers in these areas to access a range of support services including Centrelink, financial counselling services and strategic farm management workshops. More than 400 farming businesses and 300 families have benefited from these measures. As indicated in the budget, the federal government and the Western Australian state government will commit a combined $55 million to expand the drought pilot program significantly for the next 12 months. This commitment has effectively doubled the scope of the program and will allow the drought pilot program to be expanded into the south-west region covering a total of 130 local governments. The previous support services will still remain available, including farm business grants of up to $30,000 to help farmers better manage and prepare for future challenges and Farm Exit Support grants of up to $170,000 to support farmers who decide to sell their farm to cover relocation and retraining expenses. The drought pilot program is a very good program for regional WA and I am very pleased to see this program expanded into the south-west region. Many WA farmers have been suffering under the worst seasons ever recorded and it will be reassuring for them to know that their pain has been recognised by the federal government in this budget.


I would like to thank the federal government and the WA state government for ensuring this program is continued, and I would particularly like to acknowledge the work of the WA Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Hon. Terry Redman, for his hard work in ensuring this program continues to assist our primary producers and our regional communities during the dry season. That said, nothing can replace rain and it is slightly reassuring that there was some rain through the wheat belt of Western Australia on Monday night which will no doubt boost the morale of farmers and small businesses that support these communities. We must do all we can to assist our farming communities through tough times like the one that they are currently working their way through.


Education, particularly regional education, has been highlighted in this parliament, as have the inequities of youth allowance. Motions in both the House of Representatives and the Senate have supported a major review of youth allowance. Access to university and higher education continues to be a major issue for families living in the electorate of O'Connor and across regional WA. Due to the tyranny of distance, many students from regional areas have no choice but to leave the family home and relocate to Perth to attend university. This relocation to study is a major financial concern for many regional families who struggle to jump through the necessary hoops required to gain access to youth allowance.


The current youth allowance system as it stands does not afford regional families any flexibility when applying for the payment. The youth allowance system operates on a one-size-fits-all basis and leaves regional families at a major disadvantage compared to their metropolitan counterparts. I have heard numerous stories over the past few months of parents and students who have gone to great lengths to access higher education in the city. Some families choose to relocate to the city, and many students who wish to access university instead seek other career paths as they do not want to feel like they are any burden to their families. If this government is serious about creating sustainable and resilient regional communities, it is vitally important that we remove the barriers to higher education that are disadvantaging so many of our young people.


According to the Australian Council for Educational Research, in the seven years after leaving school, close to half of metropolitan students gain a university or TAFE degree, while only a third of regional students gain a qualification in that time. Many families across regional WA, including my own, are anxious to see the results of the federal government's review into youth allowance which is expected to report on 1 July. This review must deliver a fairer outcome for the thousands of regional students who are struggling to sustain themselves financially while living away from home; unsupported by the federal government. This review must call for greater flexibility for regional students and remove barriers such as the 18-month waiting period which forces students into employment while they study and in many cases takes them out of the education pathway forever. I welcome this review and look forward to seeing the government deliver better outcomes for our regional students.


Many of my constituents have contacted me with their concerns around the mining and carbon taxes. I have listened to their concerns about what this will mean to their families, their businesses and their livelihoods, and I will continue to do so.


I might now make a brief statement finally on the opposition's proposed amendment to this motion. I am not beholden to this government and I have no agreement to take any particular position on this matter. I am also cognisant of the constitutional risks to the institution of parliament when the opposition moves effectively to block supply, which is the basis on which government business and administration has continuing security. That said, and as the House has just heard, I have made it very clear that I have profound objections to a number of measures within the budget. I have just made that position clear in respect of the proposed mining and carbon taxes. I also believe that in processes such as raising borrowing limits the government should be accountable to the parliament. I finish today where I started, with mixed emotions surrounding the benefits for regional Australia and my electorate from this budget.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (11:09):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 and cognate bills. Families are at the very centre of our society. Helping families stay together, supporting their communities and ensuring that families can give children the best start in life are not aspirational goals; they are fundamental responsibilities for the parliament and for the government. Over the past 30 years, family policy in Australia has evolved. Family support has developed and to date both sides of politics have generally been supportive. Labor have to their credit kept in step with the coalition, but now, regrettably, things have changed. While Labor are in government, the Greens are in power. Senator Brown has his weekly meetings with the Prime Minister, who calls his party extremists yet remains in a formal alliance with them. The Greens are ideologically opposed to providing real support to families. They would rather pursue their radical agenda of social reform than participate in the continued development of sound family policy. What we have now seen over the past two successive budgets is an unparalleled attack on families. The Labor-Green alliance is undoing the work of the coalition government both economically and socially. 


Regarding the cuts to family services, the well-received coalition government's family relationship centres and initiatives have been targeted by a government starved of funds after a spending binge. Labor have stripped $50 million from family relationship services, including ripping $4.5 million from marriage counselling services and snatching $43.9 million from the family relationship centres. These centres are designed to help families experiencing difficulties. They help families stay together. At a time when cost-of-living pressures are hurting families and placing couples under growing stress, these services are designed to offer some assistance and yet they are being targeted with cuts in the government's budget.


The government have decided not to replace for Family Court judges. So family relationship centres will be under even more pressure, unable to provide the same level of support and, at the same time, family law cases will take even longer to be finalised. Indeed, family service agency personnel are reporting that there are waiting lists and growing waiting lists for people wanting to use their services and saying that they will continue to grow as a result of these changes and indeed many couples may not even get to have the services provided which they desperately need. On top of this, the Australian Institute of Family Studies, which suffered a cut of 10 per cent in its total appropriation in last year's budget, is now facing even more cuts.


Family tax benefit indexation has been frozen. The plan to freeze until 2014 indexation of the family tax benefit part A supplement, which is $726.35, and the part B supplement, which is $354.05, will mean that the recipients of FTB A, which is approximately 1.7 million Australian families, and the recipients of FTB B, which is approximately 1.4 million families, will all will be worse off. By freezing the supplement payments for families for both FTB A and FTB B for three years until July 2014, the value of the payment will be eroded over time due to inflation. Recent payment rates over the past three financial years demonstrate this. Without indexation, FTB A recipients will be $81.28 worse off per child by 2014-15 while FTB B recipients will be $39.62 worse off per family by 2014-15. We are now learning that the plan to freeze family benefits was devised by the government before the federal election. This is yet another deception from a Prime Minister whose directionless government will be long remembered as perpetrating a deception on the Australian people in the days prior to the 2010 poll. This budget does little to address the cost-of-living pressures facing Australian families. Across Australia, from the December quarter 2007 when Labor was elected to government at the national level to the March quarter 2011, a number of things are quite evident. Electricity prices have increased by an average of 51 per cent; gas prices have increased by an average of 30 per cent; water and sewerage rates have increased by an average of 46 per cent; health costs—that is, hospital, optical, dental, and pharmaceutical costs—have increased by an average of 20 per cent, and this is not even considering Labor's proposed changes to the private health insurance rebate; education costs—school fees and the other education costs that parents have to meet on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis around Australia—have increased by an average of 24 per cent; interest rates have increased seven times since September 2009, increasing repayments on the average mortgage by over $500 per month—that is an increase of $500 per month in a little under 18 months; the price of bread has gone up by 11 per cent and the cost of fruit has gone up by 28 per cent—the cost of food overall has gone up by 13 per cent; and the amount of rent that people are now paying has increased by 20 per cent. This is a substantial, a significant and a very real slug to the cost of living for ordinary Australians families.


Since 2007, Labor has announced 14 new or increased taxes, including the alcopops tax on mixed spirit drinks, an increase in the luxury car tax, the mining tax, the flood levy, the LPG excise increase, a new tax on Australians working overseas, a cut in the amount Australians can put into superannuation that is tax free, new restrictions on business losses claimable for tax purposes, changes to the employee share scheme, ethanol tax increases, tighter restrictions on tax claims for medical expenses, fringe benefit tax changes announced in the 2011-12 budget and, of course, the carbon tax. This is the tax that this government is gung ho on introducing for all Australians, yet it is not even covered, not even mentioned and does not have a place in the budget. The most substantial tax that possibly any government has proposed to introduce in Australia and which is proposed for the coming financial year—and the appropriation bills which we are now debating in this parliament deal with government expenditure and government revenue—this most significant tax which the government talks about every day and which it is trying to convince Australians will be good for them, is not even in the budget.



Ms Grierson interjecting—




Mr ANDREWS:
  The honourable member opposite says, 'Because it is cost neutral.' We had Professor Garnaut out yesterday with his latest report suggesting that families should be compensated—what?—55 per cent of the amount which is raised by the tax. Try and tell ordinary Australian families that taking away $1 from them and giving them back 55c is going to be cost neutral. And what did Professor Garnaut also say? There is a suggestion in his report that the level at which compensation should cut out is $80,000. Try and tell ordinary Australian families that have got two parents in the workforce who would be earning in the vicinity of—




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—




Sitting suspended from 
11:19
 to 
11:34





Mr ANDREWS:
  Prior to the break for the division in the House, I was responding to the interjection by the honourable member for Newcastle, who said that the reason the carbon tax is not included in this year's budget, in these appropriation bills that we are debating, is that it would be revenue neutral. Even if we assume, for a moment, that that is true—and I will come to why I do not believe most Australians believe it to be true—there are administrative costs associated with the new tax. Costs are set out in the budget for expenditure relating to each department—as to what it is actually going to cost. That ought to be in the appropriation bill, even if it is a revenue neutral measure. But, of course, we do not see that whatsoever.


The reality is that the government's idea of revenue neutral, from what we have learned to date from Professor Garnaut's report, is that for every dollar that this government will take by way of tax—tax which will ultimately be paid by Australians—just 55c will be returned by way of some sort of compensation. I do not think Australian families believe that taking a dollar and giving back 55c—even 60c or 65c—is in any way revenue neutral. The reality is that this is a great big new tax on ordinary Australian families, who will be paying for it on top of all the other mismanagement by this government they have to pay for. Indeed, since assuming office, Labor has managed to do what it does best. It has turned a $20 billion surplus into a $50 billion deficit. It has turned $70 billion of net assets into $107 billion of net debt. It took a decade to pay back Labor's previous $96 billion debt. Now we have gone from having net assets of $70 billion to having $107 billion worth of net debt, and that has been achieved in just four years under this Labor administration—this Labor maladministration—of Australia.


If you look at the carbon tax, you will see that it is going to hit household budgets on top of all the other increases in the cost of living that people are already suffering. Let us take the widely touted figure of $26 per tonne. A $26 per tonne carbon tax would add 25 per cent more to electricity bills. I said earlier that Australians face electricity bills that have gone up by an average of 51 per cent over the last four years. Here we go again with further increases, because the carbon tax will further increase their electricity bills by 25 per cent. Every time you go to the petrol bowser to fill up your car to take the kids to school, to go shopping, to drive to work or to drive home from work, let alone use it for any recreational purpose, it will cost you 6.5c or more per litre for your fuel bill. I say to ordinary Australians: when you go to the bowser next and think about filling up, how much it is costing and how petrol prices have gone up, just think that, when the carbon tax comes in, you will not be paying the $1.28, the $1.32, or the $1.40 or whatever it might be from day to day or week to week in various parts of Australia. Add 6½c a litre to that, and that will give you some sense of just one cost which will flow to you as a result of this tax.


We know that $26 a tonne is only a starting point. That is before the price automatically begins to increase by at least four per cent each year—and that is if $26 a tonne is the starting point. We have already heard from the Greens that they want a starting point of between $40 a tonne and $100 a tonne. The compensation will drop out over time. Even if the compensation were maintained at the same level, the result of inflation means that the real valuation of that compensation would decrease, just like the real value of family payments has decreased because of the freeze that has been put upon them by this Labor government. The working families of Kevin Rudd's 2007 have become Julia Gillard's forgotten families of 2011. On top of that, this tax will cost jobs. Some 45,000 jobs will disappear from industries such as steel, aluminium, cement, glass, chemicals and motor vehicles, and some 23,000 mining jobs will be lost. Once again, that is just the beginning.


This budget has delivered nothing new for families. Well, that is not quite true. It has delivered something new for families: more costs. What is not in the budget, the great big fiscal elephant that is sitting in the middle of the room—namely the carbon tax—is going to deliver even more significant costs for Australian families. It will hurt families, it will hit household budgets and it will put families who are already under pressure under even more pressure. The Labor government has no mandate to pursue this antifamily agenda and it has no mandate to introduce a carbon tax. It is time that Labor kicked its Greens habit. It is time that Labor stood up for Australian families. It is time that Labor called an election to get a mandate, if it proposes to introduce this antifamily carbon tax.

While I am in this place I will do whatever is possible to ensure that my electorate of Solomon and indeed the Territory gets its fair share of funding from Canberra.


Despite the endless talk from Labor in the lead-up to the budget, this was not a tough budget. In fact, the Prime Minister was right when she said this was a traditional Labor budget—another big deficit, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes. In November 2010 we were told the deficit for 2010-11 would be $41.5 billion. On budget night it was revealed it had blown out to almost $50 billion. In November 2010 we were told that net debt would peak at $94 billion. On budget night it was revealed that that figure was $107 billion. Not only that but the net debt is set to stay above $100 billion for at least the next four years.


The government continues to borrow $135 million a day, and interest on Labor's debt will be a staggering $7 billion a year. Cumulative interest on Labor's net debt will be more than $26 billion over the next four years. Think of the hospitals, roads and ports that could be built in this country with the interest payments alone. Labor does not like to admit that we have the highest interest rates in the OECD and among the highest home mortgage rates in the world. Unfortunately, Labor's reckless spending and borrowing has seen interest rates higher than they would otherwise be and my electorate of Solomon has been hit hard hit.


Since budget night there has been near universal consensus amongst independent market economists that Labor's budget will have absolutely no impact on the Reserve Bank's need to raise interest rates. But, still, the Reserve Bank is facing myriad inflationary pressures, particularly as the federal Treasurer is predicting the economy will add 500,000 extra jobs over the next two years, bringing the jobless rate down from 4.9 per cent to 4.5 per cent. As a result, it is encouraging variable rate mortgage borrowers to consider fixing their loans as they prepare for one or even two interest rate rises in the second half of 2011.


Although house prices fell in Darwin and Palmerston in the first three months of this year, the median price for a house in Darwin still remains extremely high at $550,000, with a median price of $465,000 in Palmerston. Buying a house in Darwin is becoming increasingly unaffordable even for key workers such as teachers, police, nurses, firefighters and ambulance officers. According to the latest research from Bankwest, Darwin house prices have increased by 69 per cent over the past five years.


In addition to rising interest rates and unaffordable housing, families in Solomon are feeling the squeeze. Since Labor was elected, electricity prices are up 51 per cent, gas prices are up 30 per cent, water prices are up 46 per cent, education costs have risen 24 per cent, health costs have risen 20 per cent, rent costs have risen 21 per cent and grocery prices are up 14 per cent. In addition to this, a $26 a tonne carbon tax would add a further 25 per cent to electricity bills and at least 6½c to a litre of fuel. This proposed carbon tax will in fact see even higher prices for everything in the Territory. But who knows what the final price on carbon will be and what the ongoing impacts will be? The people of Solomon are very concerned about the increasing cost of living and, as I have already stated, they are paying record house prices and the highest prices in any capital city for groceries, petrol and rent, on the back of soaring power bills and interest rates. Unfortunately, the carbon tax will affect every aspect of people's lives and in particular those families that are already struggling to make ends meet. Many of my constituents will simply be unable to afford the power they use. As I mentioned in this place just three months ago, the carbon tax appears to be a tax on remoteness and on the Territory. The tax stands to increase the cost of living and directly impact key industries in the Northern Territory and my electorate such as primary production, mining, tourism and construction. All of these industries will be hit hard by a carbon tax. In just three months, the already high petrol prices in my electorate have significantly increased—without the carbon tax. Last week in Darwin and Palmerston, according to the NT Labor government's Fuelwatch website, the mean unleaded price for petrol was 152.8c a litre. That is up 10.9c from February this year.


How can the Gillard Labor government be trusted when the Prime Minister said before the election 'there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead', and now continues to pursue the introduction of a carbon tax, a tax on electricity and on petrol and a tax that is going to affect all Australians, particularly Territorians, ultimately increasing the already high cost of living? This budget is based on a lie. The carbon tax revenue and associated spending, tipped to be in the order of $11.5 billion, was not included. It is a tax Labor should be ashamed of and a tax that the Prime Minister said would not happen under the government she leads.


My electorate of Solomon is in desperate need of infrastructure to make its economy more productive. As already mentioned in this place by my colleague the member for Hasluck, the Perth to Darwin Highway, in the north of his electorate, is vital for both Western Australia and the Northern Territory in terms of transport infrastructure. Heavy haulage transport engaged in the movement of machinery and goods south from Darwin and north from the electorate of Hasluck is being sadly neglected by this government. Trucks are being forced to operate within a curfew. Gigantic mining trucks being transported fight for space on rural roads, the same roads used by tourists.


In Solomon we are also in desperate need of health infrastructure to give our people better access to health services. Giving credit where credit is due, I was very pleased to see the inclusion of funding for the first stage of a hospital in Palmerston. I have long advocated for better medical facilities for Palmerston and the rural area. Along with the many other advocates for improved health services in the Territory, I will be keeping an eye on this program, making sure that what is promised is actually delivered.


This government has not got a good track record in delivering what they promise. There is a fair amount of spin involved in most of their announcements. This is something my electorate is tired of. I was pleased to see a small increase in the funding for mental health but, as with the hospital finding, I will be watching this carefully to ensure that there is indeed an improvement in services in the Solomon electorate. I want to make sure that this funding does translate into better mental health services for my electorate.


There are more disappointing elements to the budget, in particular that families have been targeted and the perception of a wealthy family is now a family on $150,000. With the high cost of living continuing to apply pressure on family budgets and interest rates, we all know that a family on $150,000 is far from wealthy. In the budget a massive $1.7 billion blow-out as a result of Labor's failed border protection policies was revealed. Families are paying for Labor's failed border protection policies through cuts to family payments.


Many people in my electorate, and family and friends across Australia, have raised with me their concerns regarding the significant expenditure on housing associated with asylum seekers in the Territory. The view is that this money could be spent on infrastructure to build on the Territory's potential and on funding longer term projects within my electorate. 


The budget clears the way for $2 billion to be gouged from families through the freezing of indexation of family tax payment supplements and upper income thresholds. Families in Solomon will continue to feel the pinch. For example, a family with two children and a stay-at-home parent stands to lose up to $147 worth of benefits, while a family with both parents working will be $116 worse off. Families struggling to make ends meet on an income of $45,000 will also be hit.


This Labor government's short-sighted measures and poor fiscal management are set to continue the pain for families within my electorate of Solomon. Despite Labor talking down the impact of these changes, the truth is that, at a time when families are struggling with cost-of-living pressures, these changes will hurt two million families in some way, shape or form. I remind this House of the waste by this government associated with the failed pink batts, school halls and solar panels spend up. In this budget one of the biggest savings was on the $1.7 billion flood levy. It is a disgrace that this government has wasted so much money, yet incomprehensibly it could not find $1.7 billion in a $360 billion budget for allocation to natural disasters. It was extraordinary that, given this government's track record of wanton waste and failed program implementation, Labor's big budget eve announcement was a plan to spend $376 million on set-top boxes for pensioners. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, let me remind the government that a postbudget survey revealed that 60 per cent of pensioners do not want a set-top box. Additionally, we know that Gerry Harvey said he could provide and install them for $168 a unit, compared to Labor's budgeted cost of $400.


The Prime Minister was asked by the member for Denison what Labor would do with the promises made by Labor candidates in seats where Labor did not win. The Prime Minister stood at the dispatch box hand on heart and said, 'Our promises were fully costed, every one of them. Of course they will be delivered. Of course they will. We don't go around making promises that we won't fulfil.' Like the member for Herbert, I also have concerns regarding the statement made by the Prime Minister. Following on from her passionate statement of commitment in the chamber, I wrote letters to the Prime Minister on behalf of my electorate asking for clarification as to when the pre-election commitments made by Labor will be delivered in my electorate of Solomon—promises such as $37,000 for Dragon Boat Northern Territory to maintain their current fleet and construct new dragon boats, and the $1.5 million all-weather world championship level BMX track for the NT BMX.  A new music and dance festival, the Big Day Without, was planned in March at Palmerston Senior College, in April at Darwin Middle School, in May at Casuarina Secondary College and in June at Sanderson Middle School. Well, March, April and May have come and gone and no events have occurred, and when I contacted the schools they were not aware of plans for any of these events. Then there was the promise of 1,200 new affordable rental homes in the Northern Territory, priced at least 20 per cent below market rates, under the National Rental Affordability Scheme. This promise was rebadged from the previous election.


It turns out that yet again there is an issue with delivery. Both NT BMX and Dragon Boat Northern Territory have been advised that they do not have the funding, despite all the pre-election hype. These groups now have to apply for grants through the usual process—no guarantee of funding at all. I wonder if this has something to do with the fact that these two commitments were also made by the coalition. This is a very tricky government, one that has been caught out before. For example, this government has taken the high moral ground on education in Closing the Gap programs. However, in the lead-up to the 2010 federal election, the Gillard Labor government committed to the Indigenous Funding Guarantee program, which affects schools in my electorate. The commitment was to provide increased funding to non-remote boarding schools that house more than 50 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students from remote Indigenous communities. Like the community groups NT BMX and Dragon Boat Northern Territory, schools such as Kormilda College, St John's College and O'Loughlin Catholic College were under the impression the funding was guaranteed and was to be backdated. Frustratingly, these schools still seek assurance as to whether the promised but delayed payments of the remote rate for remote students based at their school will indeed be backdated to include 2010. I have raised this issue a number of times, and once again I pose the question to the Prime Minister: when can Kormilda College, St John's College and O'Loughlin Catholic College in my electorate expect to hear the government's decision on whether or not this funding will be backdated? Additionally I ask the Prime Minister: when will the pre-election commitments made by Labor in my electorate of Solomon be delivered?


If the coalition were in government, the people of Solomon would have RAAF base houses available to them. The coalition committed to excising the suburb of Eaton from defence, making 396 houses available for a variety of housing options for Territorians. This is in clear contrast to the current situation, where this Labor government continues on its path of waste and mismanagement. Two hundred and five of the 396 houses sit vacant in the middle of a housing crisis. Is this an example of a government that values taxpayer resources? I do not think so. This is a government that expects everybody else to pay for its mistakes. Labor's working families of 2007 have become the forgotten families of 2011.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (10:00):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 and cognate bills. Today, being 1 June, we are coming up to the anniversary of when the government entered its second term, and this is Labor's fourth budget since it came to office. Since that time we have seen what amounts to a record spending spree in Australian history. So I want to do a few things today. Firstly I want to talk in a macro sense about how damaging this budget is to the national interest, secondly I want to say something about its negative effect on my electorate, and thirdly I want to say something about its devastating effect on our national security and border protection policies.


In a macro sense, since coming to office Labor have accumulated over $150 billion worth of deficits. To fund these deficits, they borrow $135 million per day—every day, seven days a week—which means that the Australian taxpayer will be spending $7.5 billion on interest payments by 2014. That is $7½ billion that will be wasted every year on interest payments for a debt that Labor have run up since they came to office, $7½ billion that could be spent on much more important things than interest payments on Labor's debt. That does not even begin to look at repaying the principal on that debt, which of course will fall to us when we come to government, as it always does, because every time the Labor Party get into government they do exactly the same thing. They spend wastefully, they ran deficits, they run up debt and they pay interest on that debt. Every time, we are called to come into government and clean up their mess. We will accept that burden again, although quite frankly it should not be that way.


The News Limited newspapers have revealed the total cost of Labor's wasteful spending on government programs alone. Just for failed programs, and I am talking about things like the home insulation disaster and the school halls disaster, every household in my electorate will be liable for $567. So, just for those failed programs, every household in Stirling is going to have to stump up $567 to pay for that gross waste. This is a terrible indictment on the performance of the Rudd-Gillard government and it is another example highlighting the fact that the current debt and deficit really is an astonishing squandering of the inheritance that Labor had when they came to office.


The result of this wasteful spending and this running up of debt and deficit particularly falls on the shoulders of my home state of Western Australia. You only need to look at the record of this government to see that they view Western Australia solely as a cash cow. Even last week a Labor senator coming in through the doors confirmed this. Senator Doug Cameron from New South Wales came through the doors last Wednesday and he said: 'I will be arguing strongly that we cannot have a position where, because of natural resources, because of luck, one state can have a standard of living that is way beyond what everybody else can achieve and everybody else is left to make it up how they can. It's not on.' This is what he said in response to the Western Australian government taking away the concession for the royalty on iron ore fines. That is a very good example of how the Labor Party looks at Western Australia. They think that Western Australia should just pay the bills they are running up at the astonishing rate I have already outlined.


When the Prime Minister comes to Western Australia she pretends that she knows a little bit about what is going on. What is going on there is the most incredible economic transformation that any state in Australia has seen in the history of this country. When she comes to Western Australia she says that she would like to see Western Australia get its fair share. This is the same sort of thing that her predecessor, Kevin Rudd, said when he came to Western Australia, but their actions belie that rhetoric because they only see Western Australia as a cash cow.


I could spend the rest of my time outlining where Labor have failed Western Australia, but I want to highlight a couple of great examples of the damage they are doing to my home state. Firstly, Labor excluded small miners and brokered a secret deal to impose a $10½ billion mining tax. The astonishing thing is that they negotiated with BHP, Rio Tinto and Xstrata, who ran rings around them because Labor had no idea what they were doing. Those companies ran rings around Wayne Swan and the upshot is that they will not be paying any of this tax. The burden will fall on small miners, particularly in Western Australia. That $10½ billion will not be paid by the big resource companies; it will be paid by the junior miners. Quite frankly, the Western Australian mining community is outraged about that.


Seven billion dollars of this tax will come from Western Australia, so about 70 per cent of this tax will come from one state. What we get in return from this government is quite frankly contemptuous. Labor will return only 6c out of every dollar taken from Western Australia under the mining tax. So 70 per cent of that tax will be paid by Western Australians, but we will get only six per cent of it back. Labor have failed to fix the GST arrangements which see Western Australia receive only 68c for every dollar we pay in GST, while other states receive either equal to what they put in or, in the case of some states, substantially more than they put in. Labor have also broken their promise and are considering a carbon tax, which will drive up electricity prices in Western Australia and seriously damage the Western Australian economy for, sadly, no net environmental benefit.


Western Australia suffered because the Labor Party withheld $350 million in extra health funding because the Western Australian government refused to hand over GST funding within the health agreement. Labor have also announced a new detention centre at the town of Northam, which means that Western Australia bears far more of the burden of Labor's failed border protection policies. People smugglers are incarcerated in Western Australian jails at a cost to the Western Australian taxpayer. Western Australia houses more detention centres and more of the detained population than anywhere else within Australia.


Of the funding we provide to this Labor government, very little flows back in funding to my state. The government announced 28 GP superclinics, but only three of those will be in Western Australia. Western Australia will receive only seven per cent of GST revenue and that will fall to less than six per cent in coming years, and of course our contribution to that is significantly greater.


As I said, I could go on forever about the ways in which the Labor government are doing bad things to Western Australia, but the truth is that they really do not understand what is happening there and the only way that Western Australia will get a fair go is when this government is turfed out. Fortunately, I can report that my fellow Western Australians are very keen to do that and they will be coming for the member for Brand, the member for Perth and the member for Fremantle at the next federal election. Not long after Kevin Rudd won the 2007 election he stood in Kings Park while overlooking the city and promised that under his government Western Australians would not miss out, but sadly the facts belie that.


I will turn to my electorate of Stirling. If the coalition had won the last election my electors would be substantially better off not only for all the reasons I have outlined but also because the Labor Party did not make one commitment to the electorate of Stirling in the last election campaign. Through the whole election campaign the Labor Party did not commit to spending $1 in my electorate of Stirling. The Labor candidate there astonishingly did not seem to have enough pull to get her party to make any commitment, which is rather extraordinary considering I was on a relatively small margin. 


If we had won we would have addressed some of the electorate's concerns. We have in the past installed closed-circuit television cameras at crime hotspots, and we would have expanded that program throughout my electorate if we had been given the chance to do so by forming government. We were going to increase funding to the City of Stirling for the security services that they run. We would have installed a synthetic playing surface at the Scarborough Sportsman's Club and we would have spent money upgrading local roads. Sadly, there have been endless promises from both state and federal Labor to upgrade local roads in my electorate and not once have those promises been delivered. It has been up to the Barnett Liberal government to fund some of those commitments without $1 of federal money, which is shameful considering that Labor has promised this to my constituency at every single federal and state election since 2004. The Barnett government has come in and will solely fund the overpass at Reid Highway in Mirrabooka Avenue. I am very pleased it is doing that, but I am very disappointed that the federal government has not committed any money. If we were in government we would have committed $10 million to that project.


Crime remains one of the most prevalent concerns of my electors and during the years of the Howard government we pursued our best efforts to have the Commonwealth government play a role in fighting crime in our local communities. We funded the City of Stirling's Safer Suburbs plan which delivered more security patrols through local neighbourhoods and closed-circuit television cameras at Scarborough Beach and throughout the electorate. It also delivered crime prevention methods such as electronic message boards and all-terrain vehicles.


Unfortunately, the Labor Party has not shown the same sense of urgency when it comes to addressing the alarmingly high crime rates across my electorate, across Western Australia and across the country as a whole. In the last federal election the coalition promised to recommit money to the National Community Crime Prevention Program, and I believe that we will be doing the same in the next election because we believe it is very important for the Commonwealth government to use the resources at its disposal to make its contribution to securing our streets. We will pursue real action to boost crime fighting and to do all we can at the Commonwealth level to fight crime. Unfortunately, just as Labor is all talk and no action in Western Australia, it is also all talk and no action in my electorate of Stirling. We will change that once the government changes. 


I turn very briefly to my shadow portfolio. The issue I was raising about crime rates within my community is very important because, while the Commonwealth does not have primary responsibility for local crime fighting, it does have significant responsibility to do all it can to protect our borders. We know very well about its failure in border protection, about the flow of illegal boats that has resulted from Labor's changes to our robust border protection system since it came into office; but there is another issue that is less focused on and that is its failure to protect our borders from illicit drugs, its failure to protect our borders from illegal weapons and its failure to stop illicit cargo coming into this country at both our ports and airports because it has massively cut funding for the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to run those checks. Air cargo inspections are down a staggering 75 per cent because of the budget cuts that Labor has introduced since it came into office. Sea cargo inspections are down 25 per cent. What this means is that it is easier for organised crime to smuggle things into Australia. 


The Labor Party's border protection failure is not just its failure to dissuade people smugglers from bringing people down to Australia illegally but its failure to do its job to fight local crime and to stop illegal substances and illegal weapons coming onto our streets in the first place. You cannot trust these guys with any national security issue and the Prime Minister has shown through her behaviour that she really does not see her role in national security as one of her primary considerations. She did not even bother turning up for the National Security Committee of Cabinet. When she came to office as Prime Minister she astonishingly axed the Border Protection Committee of Cabinet. She said that that was going to be one of her priorities and her first act was to axe the cabinet committee that actually looks at border protection.


Labor's failure within my portfolio has been enormous. Every front-line national security agency received a cut in this budget: the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, the Australian Crime Commission and every single one of our intelligence agencies. And since the Labor Party came to office there are now 24,000 extra public servants and fewer front-line personnel dealing with national security and crime issues, which is a good indication that they just do not have the right priorities for our country.


This is a budget that failed not only Australia but Western Australia and it failed my electors in Stirling. The hardworking people in my suburbs will be the ones called on to pay Labor's debt, and it is a shameful, wasted opportunity for the country.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (10:15):  I rise today to speak on the appropriation bills that have been brought before the parliament: Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2011-2012 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012. But I would first like to make an observation that the Treasurer looked like a man under pressure in the weeks before delivering his fourth budget. He had every real reason to feel that pressure not because, as he would have the Australian people believe, he is yet again a victim of circumstances—a high Australian dollar, natural disasters and the financial crisis, all conspiring against him—but because even he understands that, deep down, after delivering three budgets the tired web of excuses does not stack up when you look at the economic data. 


If you think of the budget as a 100-metre sprint, it is one thing to complain that you had to carry a heavy bag while competing. But when you start the race at the 80-metre point and are kitted out with all of the equipment to run it well, those excuses look hollow. The reason why the Treasurer looked under pressure is that he knows that he has not done the work that needs to be done by a Treasurer of this country. Using my sporting analogy, far from preparing for the event, doing the hard work, this Treasurer has done the equivalent of rocking up to compete after a big night out. He has squandered not only his opportunity but the opportunity of millions of Australians. This government's legacy of waste and mismanagement will be felt not just by this generation but by generations to come.


The Treasurer looked under pressure because Australians are now wise to the promises thrown around like confetti by this government—promises of a surplus but, instead, delivering deficit after deficit; promises of reduced spending, yet at the same time increasing borrowing; promises that it will reduce the cost of living for Australian families, while at the same time hiking up their private health insurance bills and slapping them with multiple new taxes. The budget very clearly reveals that this government does not have any plan other than to tax more and hope that our historic terms of trade and our high commodity prices will continue. There is no plan B. More disturbingly, there is no plan A.


Good budgets are about four things: accountability and discipline, providing for immediate needs, providing for challenges when they come, and long-term planning. Families know this. If a family spends more money on one area, such as repairs to the house or a health crisis, they cut back somewhere else because it goes to their bottom line. They understand that they have to exercise discipline because there is only so much money. They also know that they have to balance their immediate needs with their long-term goals, whether it be to own a home, send their children to a school of their choice or to take a holiday. They also know that they should prepare for that rainy day in case it interferes with their plans. Business also knows this. The coalition knows this. But it is clear that, after four budgets, the Labor Party and this government still have not worked this out. The budget failed on all of these four fronts.


In the time available, I wanted to touch on a couple of the key things in the budget that leapt out at me. Despite the talk of surpluses that have not yet been delivered and rapid fiscal consolidation, the government did a very curious thing. You only need to look at Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 to see this. In this bill the government has provisioned to amend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911—the CIS Act—to increase the limit on the face value of stock and securities that can be on issue under the Treasurer's standing borrowing authority. What this means is that the government is seeking to increase its gross debt ceiling from $200 billion to $250 billion. But, more than this, this government is seeking to give itself full discretion to do this. It would not have to provide reasons. This comes not long after a previous increase. It was not all that long ago that the government's gross debt ceiling was $75 billion. This was increased up to $200 billion. So this government, while talking about making tough decisions, reducing spending and reducing the debt, at the same time has hiked up the debt on the nation's credit card. This is a government that says one thing and does another.


We should look to the current deficit that this government has delivered. It has soared to $49.4 billion, and the forecasted deficit in 2011-12 has already blown out by $9.6 billion to $22.6 billion. In November we were told that net debt would peak at $94 billion. On budget night that figure went up—no surprises there—to $107 billion. Not only that but net debt is going to stay above $100 billion for at least the next four years. This is a government that is continuing to borrow $135 million a day. With that borrowing comes interest payment bills that Australian families will have to pay. Labor's debt will mean an interest bill of $7 billion a year. In fact, the cumulative interest on Labor's net debt will be more than $26 billion over the next four years.


If we can, let us just stop for a moment and think about the real cost to Australian families of this interest bill. $26 billion is a lot of money. That money could be paying for real infrastructure investment. That sort of money could be invested in solving some of the long-term problems and challenges that Australia faces, such as escalating medical costs through the ageing of the population and the like.


This budget is very unkind on Australian families. It is worth noting that, since Labor was elected, electricity prices have gone up by 51 per cent, gas has gone up by 30 per cent and water has gone up by 46 per cent. Education costs have also risen by 24 per cent, health has gone up by 20 per cent and rent has gone up by 21 per cent. When my electors go to the grocery store, they can see that their bills have gone up by an average of around 14 per cent. Yet this is the first budget in eight years that has not provided tax cuts for everyday Australians, tax cuts that would help Australians with the cost of living. This government of course cannot do that because it has refused to be tough on itself. Instead, it would prefer to be tough on Australian families. I think it is fair to say that Australians are being squeezed tighter than the Treasurer's drinking glass. The government is stripping away $2 billion from families by freezing key family tax payments and thresholds. All families receiving family tax benefits will have some of their benefits stripped. At the same time Labor is hitting Australians with $6 billion worth of new taxes, including a flood tax. In my electorate of Higgins many residents, many electors, contributed very generously to the disaster relief in Queensland and Victoria. Yet they have been now slugged twice because of the mismanagement of this government.


My electors in Higgins have also been slugged through the changes within these budget bills to the private health insurance rebate. Seventy-seven per cent of my electorate in Higgins have got private health insurance. This will have a very real impact on their ability to keep and hold their private health insurance. It will have a very real impact on their ability to access quality health care. More importantly, because of this ideological war that is being waged by the Labor Party on Australian families, it will have a very real impact on the public health budget as well. It does not make a great deal of economic sense.


Interest rates will definitely go up. This budget has done nothing to reduce the pressure on Australian families and inhibit the Reserve Bank from increasing interest rates. Already the Reserve Bank has warned in its monetary statements that it will need to do this, and this budget has done nothing to stall that. Interest rates have risen seven times since the end of 2009 and are forecast to rise again twice over the next six months. We cannot forget, either, that when we talk about those debt and deficit figures it is not without very direct meaning for Australians. The fact that Labor's debt will reach $107 million means that that is $4,700 for every man, woman and child in Australia.


This government, as everybody knows, has presided over great waste and mismanagement. We have seen that with the installation of pink batts in roofs that are combustible and the resulting bill to fix that up. We have seen that with the mismanagement of the Building the Education Revolution program where some schools were paying double or triple the price they would pay in other ordinary commercial circumstances to build those buildings. We have seen blowouts in the processing of asylum seekers in Australia at a cost to this budget of $1.75 billion. We have seen money raided from the higher education endowment fund with the balance now down to $2.5 billion from $6 billion when the coalition established it. This government does not know how to manage taxpayer money.


Very revealingly, this budget is engaged in a number of deceptions on the Australian people. The budget papers show that revenue from the mining tax will be down by $5.9 billion from the figures that the government released just three months ago. So already the government has had to adjust. The budget says nothing about the carbon tax that it will be introducing before the next budget next year. This carbon tax will have a huge impact on our economy. There is nothing in this budget about the impact that it may have. Let us not forget that one of the greatest deceits in this budget is the handling of the NBN—the off-balance-sheet treatment of the NBN. It makes an absolute mockery of the projected surplus that the Treasurer keeps talking about. It is in fact the most creative accounting that we have ever seen in any set of budget papers.


Another deception is the claim by this government that it has brought forward $22 billion worth of savings. Yet included in this $22 billion worth of so-called savings is the flood tax, which comes to almost one-third of that amount. The government also claims it is going to increase spending on important initiatives like mental health care reform. It claims that it is spending up to $2.2 billion on this, but when you actually look closely at the figures you can see that, in fact, it is going to cut $580 million of GP rebates to fund it and that the real new spending is more like $530 million. This budget has failed the Australian people, this government is deceitful with the Australian people and we look forward to an election where the Australian people can cast their judgment.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",Ind.,2011-06-01,"



Mr SLIPPER
 (Fisher—Deputy Speaker) (10:31):  I am particularly pleased to be able to join the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 and cognate bills. The budget from this government, once again, fails my constituents on the Sunshine Coast. Families are worse off, and the budget indicates that the government is simply out of touch with families on the Sunshine Coast and elsewhere. Unfortunately, there is very little in the budget for families, and the budget does not contain the prescription needed to restore the situation in this country. Unfortunately, through the government's failed border protection policies millions and millions of dollars are being spent. However, if the policies of the former Howard government were adopted that would not be necessary and those funds would be available to provide very necessary infrastructure for the Sunshine Coast and, indeed, for other growth areas of Australia.


The deficit of the budget this year has soared to almost $50 billion and is forecast to be in this situation for some time. In fact, the budget deficit forecast for 2011-2012 has blown out by $9.6 billion to $22.6 billion. That is a matter of grave concern. The Treasurer tells us that the government will be returning the budget to surplus within a very finite period. I hope that the Treasurer's predictions are correct. However, on the indications, and on the performance of this government in the past, one cannot be optimistic that this will occur. Net government debt has climbed to a record $107 billion in 2011-12 and is forecast to remain above $100 billion across the forward estimates. This amounts to more than $4,700 debt for every Australian.


This is another typical old-fashioned Labor budget that is big on taxes and big on spending but fails to help households battling higher costs of living on items such as petrol, electricity, gas, groceries, health costs and home repayments. We also find that the government is launching a $2 billion assault on families by freezing the indexation of key family tax payments and income thresholds for three years. This is the first budget in eight years that has not provided tax cuts for everyday Australians. This government is being tough on Australian families because it has failed to be tough on itself. I mentioned before the money which has to be spent because Labor has lost control of Australia's borders. Offshore unauthorised arrival management has blown out by a record $1.75 billion since last year's budget. The current approach by the government is in complete disarray. The new arrangements for taxing company cars will slug small business operators, tradesmen, farmers and the taxi and hire car industry with increased costs at a time when they are already doing it tough. Regional Australia has again been short-changed by a citycentric government that has cut $500 million in regional funding. There is not a single new cent in this budget for road or rail projects across Australia. Since coming to power in 2007, the government has employed 24,000 additional public servants and the government is asking people on the Sunshine Coast to tighten their belts but is refusing to do the same to itself. Australians are looking for stability and certainty from their government and most Australians would be sorely disappointed, firstly, by what is in this budget and, secondly, by what is not in this budget.


The Sunshine Coast is one of the fastest growing areas of Australia. Because we are a fast-growing area, we never seem to have the infrastructure we require to meet the needs of our growing population. We need to upgrade the Bruce Highway to six lanes all the way from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast. The former Howard government invested money to upgrade the Bruce Highway from Brisbane to Caboolture and, at the time, that removed the worst bottleneck between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast. But as road traffic continues to grow, delays seem to be inevitable. The existing four-lane highway—that is, two lanes in each direction—desperately needs upgrading to six lanes. Not to do so is completely unacceptable.


On the Sunshine Coast we have a wonderful lifestyle, we have a very hospitable population but what we do need on the Sunshine Coast are more jobs, particularly jobs for young people. We need clean and green industries and we need government policies which will encourage the development of job opportunities so that young people are not forced to leave the Sunshine Coast to seek employment. The University of the Sunshine Coast is doing a wonderful job. It is giving large numbers of students in our community the opportunity to study in an increasing range of disciplines. We hope that many of those graduates will find work on the Sunshine Coast.


Not only is the Sunshine Coast a rapidly growing area; it is a very interesting area because demographically it is one of the oldest parts of Australia. Lots of people retire to the Sunshine Coast from around the country, and that is entirely understandable because it is a wonderful place to live. But we also have lots of young families and those young families are extremely concerned about the employment opportunities for their children. Part of our unemployment problem on the Sunshine Coast is imported, I suppose. Compare being unemployed in some of the southern parts of Australia and being unemployed in a place that has wonderful beaches and a wonderful lifestyle and it is hardly surprising that people often choose to move to an area where there is less employment but a better lifestyle. That is why quite often our unemployment rate is higher than one would normally expect, because lots of people who would be unemployed elsewhere choose to move to the Sunshine Coast. 


It is a pity that the Liberal-National Party coalition was not elected at the last election because we were able to promise a range of infrastructure projects for the Sunshine Coast which would have provided incredible benefits for our local community. I have also spoken in the parliament and I have written to the government to seek to have these infrastructure projects implemented, despite the fact that the Labor Party was elected to office and the Liberal-National Party coalition is still in opposition. We would like to see the Bruce Highway upgraded, we would like to see $2.5 million given to upgrade the Caloundra Aquatic Lifestyle Centre and we would like to see $700,000 for a viewing platform for Maleny's Mary Cairncross Scenic Reserve. The latter would enable people to view the Glass House Mountains in a safe way. At present, the view, which is spectacular, often entices people to wander across the road, placing their safety at risk.


It is also important to recognise that the government needs to invest more in tourism, particularly on the Sunshine Coast. People on the Sunshine Coast are particularly concerned over the fact that the government said prior to the election that it would not introduce a carbon tax and yet a carbon tax is now on the government's agenda and could well be legislated for by the parliament. It is important that, when you stand up prior to an election and say that you are going to pursue a certain policy, once you have received the support of the Australian people, you seek to carry out the pledge that you made.


Very few people on the Sunshine Coast support a carbon tax. Most people, if given the choice between a clean environment and a less clean environment would certainly choose the former. However, given that Australia is a relatively low emitter, if the carbon tax is brought in—and we have heard of the range of charges which will be imposed on Australian families, from $300 to $1,000, depending on the rate at which the carbon tax is struck—Australian families will be slugged, our businesses will be less competitive and our exporters will not be able to compete in world markets as they are currently able to. And, if the rest of the world does not follow a similar policy, there will be no improvement in the world environment. So, on the one hand, our own industry will be committing a form of economic suicide, costing jobs and so on, and, sadly, on the other hand, the world environment will be no better as a result of that action.


I would ask the government to consider a world solution rather than seeking to move unilaterally. I think Australia is a good international citizen. I think we have proven over the years that we are prepared to work with other countries to improve the environment. But to move forward unilaterally is not in our interests and would do very little at all for the environment. That is absolutely unacceptable.


I would also like to talk about the need for safety throughout the Sunshine Coast. We have a very good area; however, it would be very useful if we were able to get CCTV surveillance cameras to boost public safety in key parts of our community. Prior to the last election, we were able to pledge $300,000 for CCTV surveillance cameras and extra lighting in the central business district of Caloundra, $100,000 for CCTV surveillance cameras at the Mooloolaba shopping and tourism precinct and $100,000 for CCTV surveillance cameras in the Kawana Waters community. This commitment was also made prior to the election in 2007. Unfortunately, with the election of the current government, we have not yet been able to get that funding.


The funding would mean that we could better showcase our community as one which people could visit as tourists or move to to become residents. These surveillance cameras would improve the safety of people who are out having a good time. The Sunshine Coast is a relatively safe and law-abiding destination, but I think these cameras would provide a lot of reassurance and would help to boost our tourism numbers. For a relatively small investment, half a million dollars, public safety would be boosted, and that would be a very positive thing. It is important, I believe, to protect our environment. The environment is not the possession of any particular side of politics and I believe that, particularly with the Green Corps, the Howard government will go down on the record as one of the greenest governments in Australia's history, but it will never be given credit for that. But I think it is important to recognise that we do hold our environment in trust for future generations and that it would be wonderful if we were able to leave the environment of Australia in a much better situation when we depart this world than it was in when we arrived. So it is important that all of us, regardless of where we stand politically, focus on the need to make sure that appropriate funding is made available to protect and enhance our environment. We had, prior to the election, promised certain funding for a range of environmental groups on the Sunshine Coast, and I call on the current government to accept that they are very worthy causes and that our environment will be enhanced if those funding announcements prior to the election are implemented by this current government. 


This budget does fail the Australian people. It is not a prescription that our country needs at this time, and I would ask the Treasurer to reconsider the budget with a view to bringing in something more appropriate. I thank the House.

"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (10:46):  We have a national epidemic of obesity. We have gone from the fittest country in the world to one of the fattest. There are any number of television shows, with titles such as The Biggest Loser, which dramatically tell the story of the desperate actions required to address situations of obesity—the hardship, the heartbreak and the humiliation. Today I am talking about our government's obesity and the radical action that will be required to address this country's problems of excess and waste. The parallels between the two are worth noting because, in the days when our sportsmen and women dominated the fields of endeavour, virtually all Australians would try to emulate their sports stars on the weekend, resulting in their wellbeing, health and fitness. At this time, we enjoyed lean government and we were a creditable nation. 


No truer words have been spoken than those contained in the warning by Senator Barnaby Joyce when he said that he had never seen a big problem that did not begin as a small one and that if this rate of waste and misguided spending continued there would come a time when we would not be able to pay back our debt. Credibility and trust borne out of honesty should be the currency that a government or a political party trades on. Broken promises and treacherous behaviour do not build a sense of trust. The promise to build the Epping to Parramatta Rail Link, devoutly made in the heat of battle to win government during an election campaign, fades on even the most casual examination and exposes the fact that this promise to build would be dependent on the government winning a second term, the government being in surplus and the state government putting up the first $500 million. The very people who lose our trust and confidence with such transparently ingenuous undertakings deserve serious scrutiny when they make other promises. The promise made during the recent budget of a $3 billion surplus to come in the third year would be equally dependent on a number of factors and so has equal 'substance' to the promise made by the federal government to build the Epping to Parramatta railway line. Setting this aside, the government's representations put the promise of a $3 billion surplus into perspective. It will follow two more years of excessive deficit—$55 billion last year, followed by $50 billion, followed by $23 billion, and totalling $107 billion of debt. To have the audacity to say that a $3 billion surplus in year 3 is some kind of triumph beggars belief. This is a government that has come to dine at our table. They take more and more every time they need it. They go to their favourite dish—more taxes—creating the weight of debt to fund their lazy, misguided and, above all, wasteful practices. What could have nourished families, small business and industry has been squandered by inept government and criminal waste. It is so plain to see that history is repeating itself. The Howard government when elected inherited some $96 billion in debt. The Abbott government, when it is elected, will inherit a greater debt. The hallmark of the Rudd-Gillard government is that of quick-fix fast food, not the nutrition that our country needs. When we were crying out for vital infrastructure that would build our country and add value we got pink batts, and we got school halls when classrooms and libraries were needed, coated with lashings of waste.


Julia Gillard has justified this by saying that in large projects there will always be waste. This is an extraordinary position to take and it is difficult to imagine that somebody who has found their way to the position of Prime Minister could not understand the dynamic that when building more than one school hall, with a high level of architectural design and requiring no variations during construction, the marketplace will effect lower prices with greater quantity.


And we have the situation of pink batts in roofs, where those who entered the industry after promises and undertakings from the government committed themselves, their businesses and their assets to this new industry, then mercilessly had the rug pulled from under them after more empty reassurances. The government, which should be in the practice of building industries, was setting these poor souls up for a brief boom and an inevitable bust. In the solar industry we had the same scenario. And all the while the government was feasting on taxes, growing bureaucracies, growing inefficiencies and growing the obesity of debt. The next competitor in the Biggest Loser will be Australia after the final great feast—a carbon tax.


Personal obesity accounts for more than 50 per cent of our health costs—combined with other lifestyle choices, an imposition of over 70 per cent of our total health cost. The single best thing that you can do for your physical health or mental health is to exercise. When you exercise in the form of participation in a sport, the component of socialisation is added, which is a key component in the prevention of mental illness.


In the budget there was a promise of $1.5 billion for mental health. A little examination will tell you very quickly that sadly those who need help most are denied. The reduction from 12 appointments with a psychologist to 10 might not have been a devastating blow to many but on a little further examination we learn that those with more acute need for psychological intervention, who would previously have had the right to a further six visits, have now lost those visits.


This is another graphic example of short-term thinking, small savings and long-term cost. Tragically, the cost in this scenario is measured not just in dollars. Headlines this week—a week where there has been many major news events—have found the manner in which the Gillard government attempted to lure FIFA's affections in a bid to host the Soccer World Cup was consistent with their poor ability to manage and ensure value for our tax dollars. We have heard allegations of bribery. There are allegations of $11.4 million of the $45 million given by this government having gone missing and of two sets of books being maintained by the FFA. Despite an inquiry on this reporting back in March, this report has still not seen the light of day and it seems another $39 million has now been sent down the same rabbit hole. On reflection, what is fundamentally wrong with the way in which we attempted to win the World Cup bid is that it was largely contrary to our sporting heritage, which is such a vital part of our nation's history. The building of our character and what we stand for has always lain in the fact that we have previously put all our efforts into excelling in sports on the field, not in fancy hotels and restaurants. We host cricket tests with the greatest cricket nations in the world because we are one of those great nations. We host a grand slam tennis tournament because when the grand slam was declared we were one of only four nations who had won the Davis Cup—we earned our position on the court. We have hosted the Olympic Games twice, punching way above our weight, because we have always punched way above our weight. Australian sportsmen more than anything else have been the epitome of sportsmen: modest in victory and gracious in defeat, playing by the rules and playing fairly.


Without a knowledge of the past and an appreciation of history we are vulnerable not to learn from the past and to allow history to repeat itself. There is a great cost, whether for the individual or for the government, in becoming obese, and there is a great price to be paid for getting back into shape in order to be fully productive and enjoy a long and healthy life. To achieve this goal, an individual needs to take personal responsibility for their diet in the same way as a government needs to take responsibility for the economy and an obese way of living.


If history repeats itself, this government will leave office with a massive debt to be repaid. No doubt this will be undertaken by a lean and fit-for-the-purpose Abbott coalition. The path we then embark upon should be sustained, and we should learn from the past and not repeat the mistakes that have been made. With our dollar at record highs, there has never been a better time to undertake immediately the repayment of our debt.

"Crook, Tony, MP",NatsWA,2011-06-01,"



Mr CROOK
 (O'Connor) (10:57):  This being my first budget as the federal member for O'Connor, I must say that I receive it with very mixed emotions. This government has made much of the expected surplus in 2013, but this surplus is based on very thin margins and on legislation that the parliament is yet to see. It is also based on the premise that state governments must do as the federal government wants, which, as we all know, is not likely to happen—and I will talk more of that later.


I welcome the bipartisan support that this place has given to mental health and the increased funding that it has received in this budget. With around one in four people being affected by mental health issues, the allocation of $1.5 billion over the next five years is very welcome. Of this, $491 million is allocated to children, teens and young adults for 30 additional headspace centres and 12 early psychosis prevention and intervention centres across Australia. Having recently visited the headspace centre in Albany, I now have a far greater appreciation of the work they do. They are a tremendous asset to Albany and the Great Southern. I certainly hope to see a number of these headspace centres located in regional Western Australia and specifically in the electorate of O'Connor.


The only real concern is that the bulk of this money will be spent in the out years, not in the short term. If my visit to the Albany headspace centre taught me anything, it is that a timely, discreet and professional response to the issues that are here and now is critical. The window to address mental health issues can sometimes be very minute, and adequate resources are needed urgently. It is, however, disappointing that GP mental health funding is to be reduced, because in many cases these are the people at the front line—they are the first point of contact and sometimes the difference between some people's receiving urgent care and not receiving it.


I also welcome the $1.8 billion over six years from the Health and Hospitals Fund to support the development of health infrastructure in regional Australia. As welcome as this is, one cannot help but question, firstly, whether it will be enough and, secondly, what the value of these facilities will be if they are not staffed by well trained health professionals. Not enough is being done to address the gross shortage of doctors in regional Australia, particularly Western Australia. Country local governments across my electorate are literally forking out hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to provide GPs to their communities. One shire is putting up over $900,000 worth of incentives to retain a GP in their community. To put that in context, this investment equates to around 15 per cent of the total expenditure of this local government.


I would like to take this opportunity to mention the state government's announcement of $565 million to substantially reform and improve access to health care for residents of the southern inland of Western Australia. The southern inland health initiative is the centrepiece of the state government's spending on health in 2011 and 2012 and is funded under the Liberal-National government's very successful Royalties for Regions program. This package, to be funded from July 2011, includes $240 million of investment in the health workforce and provision of health services over four years and includes $325 million in capital works over five years. This initiative will fund an equivalent of 44 extra doctors to secure ED services and GP services across eight districts. The most unfortunate thing about the Western Australian government committing to this initiative is simply that they should not have to be doing this.


This is the first budget where we have actually seen a real indication of the much talked about mining tax, or mineral resource rent tax, and where this revenue might be spent. There has been much talk of the windfall that regional Australia will see from this tax. The first attempt is disappointing, to say the very least. Any return to regional Australia from the mining tax is via the Regional Infrastructure Fund. The Regional Infrastructure Fund is a $6 billion fund over 11 years and, according to the budget papers, is 'reinvesting the proceeds of the resource boom in mining communities'. $960 million has been allocated in this budget and the biggest single project, worth $480 million or 52 per cent of that, is a metropolitan project, Gateway WA, which is for the upgrade of Tonkin and Leach highways as well as the freeway. I fail to see how this is reinvesting in mining communities.


There has been much criticism, particularly from the Treasurer, about the Western Australian government's decision to raise royalties on their—and I stress their—iron ore. It is totally unfair of this government to assume that no states will alter their budgets or financial management practices just so the Treasurer can meet his surplus promise. At least 25 per cent of the royalties that the Western Australian government imposes are guaranteed to be delivered back to regional Western Australia via the Royalties for Regions fund, a fund that really does mean regional and is not just tokenism. Western Australia will be the main source of the mining tax revenue for this government and there is no better time than the present for this government to make a fair dinkum investment in mining communities and match the Royalties for Regions funding. 


The mining industry is planning to invest $76 billion in 2011 and 2012. If this government wants to reap the rewards of the mining industry by taxing it, the very least it could do is support infrastructure in those regional and mining communities that are delivering this dividend. Both the carbon and mining taxes are set to test, unnecessarily in my view, Australia's competitiveness in the global economy. I have concern for the impact on small to medium business and in turn jobs in Australia if we go down the path of taxing them out of existence in comparison to their global competitors.


On a more positive note, I welcome the extension for an additional year of the drought pilot program that has been running in conjunction with the Western Australian state government. Over the last two years many areas of Western Australia have experienced one of the driest seasons in recorded history. This has had a devastating impact on many of our regional communities, families and businesses who depend heavily on the agricultural sector. Last year the state and federal governments launched a drought pilot program to assist those farmers and families doing it tough through the drought.


This program has provided vital assistance to 67 local governments across WA, allowing farmers in these areas to access a range of support services including Centrelink, financial counselling services and strategic farm management workshops. More than 400 farming businesses and 300 families have benefited from these measures. As indicated in the budget, the federal government and the Western Australian state government will commit a combined $55 million to expand the drought pilot program significantly for the next 12 months. This commitment has effectively doubled the scope of the program and will allow the drought pilot program to be expanded into the south-west region covering a total of 130 local governments. The previous support services will still remain available, including farm business grants of up to $30,000 to help farmers better manage and prepare for future challenges and Farm Exit Support grants of up to $170,000 to support farmers who decide to sell their farm to cover relocation and retraining expenses. The drought pilot program is a very good program for regional WA and I am very pleased to see this program expanded into the south-west region. Many WA farmers have been suffering under the worst seasons ever recorded and it will be reassuring for them to know that their pain has been recognised by the federal government in this budget.


I would like to thank the federal government and the WA state government for ensuring this program is continued, and I would particularly like to acknowledge the work of the WA Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Hon. Terry Redman, for his hard work in ensuring this program continues to assist our primary producers and our regional communities during the dry season. That said, nothing can replace rain and it is slightly reassuring that there was some rain through the wheat belt of Western Australia on Monday night which will no doubt boost the morale of farmers and small businesses that support these communities. We must do all we can to assist our farming communities through tough times like the one that they are currently working their way through.


Education, particularly regional education, has been highlighted in this parliament, as have the inequities of youth allowance. Motions in both the House of Representatives and the Senate have supported a major review of youth allowance. Access to university and higher education continues to be a major issue for families living in the electorate of O'Connor and across regional WA. Due to the tyranny of distance, many students from regional areas have no choice but to leave the family home and relocate to Perth to attend university. This relocation to study is a major financial concern for many regional families who struggle to jump through the necessary hoops required to gain access to youth allowance.


The current youth allowance system as it stands does not afford regional families any flexibility when applying for the payment. The youth allowance system operates on a one-size-fits-all basis and leaves regional families at a major disadvantage compared to their metropolitan counterparts. I have heard numerous stories over the past few months of parents and students who have gone to great lengths to access higher education in the city. Some families choose to relocate to the city, and many students who wish to access university instead seek other career paths as they do not want to feel like they are any burden to their families. If this government is serious about creating sustainable and resilient regional communities, it is vitally important that we remove the barriers to higher education that are disadvantaging so many of our young people.


According to the Australian Council for Educational Research, in the seven years after leaving school, close to half of metropolitan students gain a university or TAFE degree, while only a third of regional students gain a qualification in that time. Many families across regional WA, including my own, are anxious to see the results of the federal government's review into youth allowance which is expected to report on 1 July. This review must deliver a fairer outcome for the thousands of regional students who are struggling to sustain themselves financially while living away from home; unsupported by the federal government. This review must call for greater flexibility for regional students and remove barriers such as the 18-month waiting period which forces students into employment while they study and in many cases takes them out of the education pathway forever. I welcome this review and look forward to seeing the government deliver better outcomes for our regional students.


Many of my constituents have contacted me with their concerns around the mining and carbon taxes. I have listened to their concerns about what this will mean to their families, their businesses and their livelihoods, and I will continue to do so.


I might now make a brief statement finally on the opposition's proposed amendment to this motion. I am not beholden to this government and I have no agreement to take any particular position on this matter. I am also cognisant of the constitutional risks to the institution of parliament when the opposition moves effectively to block supply, which is the basis on which government business and administration has continuing security. That said, and as the House has just heard, I have made it very clear that I have profound objections to a number of measures within the budget. I have just made that position clear in respect of the proposed mining and carbon taxes. I also believe that in processes such as raising borrowing limits the government should be accountable to the parliament. I finish today where I started, with mixed emotions surrounding the benefits for regional Australia and my electorate from this budget.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (11:09):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 and cognate bills. Families are at the very centre of our society. Helping families stay together, supporting their communities and ensuring that families can give children the best start in life are not aspirational goals; they are fundamental responsibilities for the parliament and for the government. Over the past 30 years, family policy in Australia has evolved. Family support has developed and to date both sides of politics have generally been supportive. Labor have to their credit kept in step with the coalition, but now, regrettably, things have changed. While Labor are in government, the Greens are in power. Senator Brown has his weekly meetings with the Prime Minister, who calls his party extremists yet remains in a formal alliance with them. The Greens are ideologically opposed to providing real support to families. They would rather pursue their radical agenda of social reform than participate in the continued development of sound family policy. What we have now seen over the past two successive budgets is an unparalleled attack on families. The Labor-Green alliance is undoing the work of the coalition government both economically and socially. 


Regarding the cuts to family services, the well-received coalition government's family relationship centres and initiatives have been targeted by a government starved of funds after a spending binge. Labor have stripped $50 million from family relationship services, including ripping $4.5 million from marriage counselling services and snatching $43.9 million from the family relationship centres. These centres are designed to help families experiencing difficulties. They help families stay together. At a time when cost-of-living pressures are hurting families and placing couples under growing stress, these services are designed to offer some assistance and yet they are being targeted with cuts in the government's budget.


The government have decided not to replace for Family Court judges. So family relationship centres will be under even more pressure, unable to provide the same level of support and, at the same time, family law cases will take even longer to be finalised. Indeed, family service agency personnel are reporting that there are waiting lists and growing waiting lists for people wanting to use their services and saying that they will continue to grow as a result of these changes and indeed many couples may not even get to have the services provided which they desperately need. On top of this, the Australian Institute of Family Studies, which suffered a cut of 10 per cent in its total appropriation in last year's budget, is now facing even more cuts.


Family tax benefit indexation has been frozen. The plan to freeze until 2014 indexation of the family tax benefit part A supplement, which is $726.35, and the part B supplement, which is $354.05, will mean that the recipients of FTB A, which is approximately 1.7 million Australian families, and the recipients of FTB B, which is approximately 1.4 million families, will all will be worse off. By freezing the supplement payments for families for both FTB A and FTB B for three years until July 2014, the value of the payment will be eroded over time due to inflation. Recent payment rates over the past three financial years demonstrate this. Without indexation, FTB A recipients will be $81.28 worse off per child by 2014-15 while FTB B recipients will be $39.62 worse off per family by 2014-15. We are now learning that the plan to freeze family benefits was devised by the government before the federal election. This is yet another deception from a Prime Minister whose directionless government will be long remembered as perpetrating a deception on the Australian people in the days prior to the 2010 poll. This budget does little to address the cost-of-living pressures facing Australian families. Across Australia, from the December quarter 2007 when Labor was elected to government at the national level to the March quarter 2011, a number of things are quite evident. Electricity prices have increased by an average of 51 per cent; gas prices have increased by an average of 30 per cent; water and sewerage rates have increased by an average of 46 per cent; health costs—that is, hospital, optical, dental, and pharmaceutical costs—have increased by an average of 20 per cent, and this is not even considering Labor's proposed changes to the private health insurance rebate; education costs—school fees and the other education costs that parents have to meet on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis around Australia—have increased by an average of 24 per cent; interest rates have increased seven times since September 2009, increasing repayments on the average mortgage by over $500 per month—that is an increase of $500 per month in a little under 18 months; the price of bread has gone up by 11 per cent and the cost of fruit has gone up by 28 per cent—the cost of food overall has gone up by 13 per cent; and the amount of rent that people are now paying has increased by 20 per cent. This is a substantial, a significant and a very real slug to the cost of living for ordinary Australians families.


Since 2007, Labor has announced 14 new or increased taxes, including the alcopops tax on mixed spirit drinks, an increase in the luxury car tax, the mining tax, the flood levy, the LPG excise increase, a new tax on Australians working overseas, a cut in the amount Australians can put into superannuation that is tax free, new restrictions on business losses claimable for tax purposes, changes to the employee share scheme, ethanol tax increases, tighter restrictions on tax claims for medical expenses, fringe benefit tax changes announced in the 2011-12 budget and, of course, the carbon tax. This is the tax that this government is gung ho on introducing for all Australians, yet it is not even covered, not even mentioned and does not have a place in the budget. The most substantial tax that possibly any government has proposed to introduce in Australia and which is proposed for the coming financial year—and the appropriation bills which we are now debating in this parliament deal with government expenditure and government revenue—this most significant tax which the government talks about every day and which it is trying to convince Australians will be good for them, is not even in the budget.



Ms Grierson interjecting—




Mr ANDREWS:
  The honourable member opposite says, 'Because it is cost neutral.' We had Professor Garnaut out yesterday with his latest report suggesting that families should be compensated—what?—55 per cent of the amount which is raised by the tax. Try and tell ordinary Australian families that taking away $1 from them and giving them back 55c is going to be cost neutral. And what did Professor Garnaut also say? There is a suggestion in his report that the level at which compensation should cut out is $80,000. Try and tell ordinary Australian families that have got two parents in the workforce who would be earning in the vicinity of—




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—




Sitting suspended from

Mr ANDREWS:
  Prior to the break for the division in the House, I was responding to the interjection by the honourable member for Newcastle, who said that the reason the carbon tax is not included in this year's budget, in these appropriation bills that we are debating, is that it would be revenue neutral. Even if we assume, for a moment, that that is true—and I will come to why I do not believe most Australians believe it to be true—there are administrative costs associated with the new tax. Costs are set out in the budget for expenditure relating to each department—as to what it is actually going to cost. That ought to be in the appropriation bill, even if it is a revenue neutral measure. But, of course, we do not see that whatsoever.


The reality is that the government's idea of revenue neutral, from what we have learned to date from Professor Garnaut's report, is that for every dollar that this government will take by way of tax—tax which will ultimately be paid by Australians—just 55c will be returned by way of some sort of compensation. I do not think Australian families believe that taking a dollar and giving back 55c—even 60c or 65c—is in any way revenue neutral. The reality is that this is a great big new tax on ordinary Australian families, who will be paying for it on top of all the other mismanagement by this government they have to pay for. Indeed, since assuming office, Labor has managed to do what it does best. It has turned a $20 billion surplus into a $50 billion deficit. It has turned $70 billion of net assets into $107 billion of net debt. It took a decade to pay back Labor's previous $96 billion debt. Now we have gone from having net assets of $70 billion to having $107 billion worth of net debt, and that has been achieved in just four years under this Labor administration—this Labor maladministration—of Australia.


If you look at the carbon tax, you will see that it is going to hit household budgets on top of all the other increases in the cost of living that people are already suffering. Let us take the widely touted figure of $26 per tonne. A $26 per tonne carbon tax would add 25 per cent more to electricity bills. I said earlier that Australians face electricity bills that have gone up by an average of 51 per cent over the last four years. Here we go again with further increases, because the carbon tax will further increase their electricity bills by 25 per cent. Every time you go to the petrol bowser to fill up your car to take the kids to school, to go shopping, to drive to work or to drive home from work, let alone use it for any recreational purpose, it will cost you 6.5c or more per litre for your fuel bill. I say to ordinary Australians: when you go to the bowser next and think about filling up, how much it is costing and how petrol prices have gone up, just think that, when the carbon tax comes in, you will not be paying the $1.28, the $1.32, or the $1.40 or whatever it might be from day to day or week to week in various parts of Australia. Add 6½c a litre to that, and that will give you some sense of just one cost which will flow to you as a result of this tax.


We know that $26 a tonne is only a starting point. That is before the price automatically begins to increase by at least four per cent each year—and that is if $26 a tonne is the starting point. We have already heard from the Greens that they want a starting point of between $40 a tonne and $100 a tonne. The compensation will drop out over time. Even if the compensation were maintained at the same level, the result of inflation means that the real valuation of that compensation would decrease, just like the real value of family payments has decreased because of the freeze that has been put upon them by this Labor government. The working families of Kevin Rudd's 2007 have become Julia Gillard's forgotten families of 2011. On top of that, this tax will cost jobs. Some 45,000 jobs will disappear from industries such as steel, aluminium, cement, glass, chemicals and motor vehicles, and some 23,000 mining jobs will be lost. Once again, that is just the beginning.


This budget has delivered nothing new for families. Well, that is not quite true. It has delivered something new for families: more costs. What is not in the budget, the great big fiscal elephant that is sitting in the middle of the room—namely the carbon tax—is going to deliver even more significant costs for Australian families. It will hurt families, it will hit household budgets and it will put families who are already under pressure under even more pressure. The Labor government has no mandate to pursue this antifamily agenda and it has no mandate to introduce a carbon tax. It is time that Labor kicked its Greens habit. It is time that Labor stood up for Australian families. It is time that Labor called an election to get a mandate, if it proposes to introduce this antifamily carbon tax.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2011-06-01,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (11:39):  I rise to talk on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 and cognate bills. This is my first budget as the member for Solomon, a role I take seriously and never for granted. While I am in this place I will do whatever is possible to ensure that my electorate of Solomon and indeed the Territory gets its fair share of funding from Canberra.


Despite the endless talk from Labor in the lead-up to the budget, this was not a tough budget. In fact, the Prime Minister was right when she said this was a traditional Labor budget—another big deficit, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes. In November 2010 we were told the deficit for 2010-11 would be $41.5 billion. On budget night it was revealed it had blown out to almost $50 billion. In November 2010 we were told that net debt would peak at $94 billion. On budget night it was revealed that that figure was $107 billion. Not only that but the net debt is set to stay above $100 billion for at least the next four years.


The government continues to borrow $135 million a day, and interest on Labor's debt will be a staggering $7 billion a year. Cumulative interest on Labor's net debt will be more than $26 billion over the next four years. Think of the hospitals, roads and ports that could be built in this country with the interest payments alone. Labor does not like to admit that we have the highest interest rates in the OECD and among the highest home mortgage rates in the world. Unfortunately, Labor's reckless spending and borrowing has seen interest rates higher than they would otherwise be and my electorate of Solomon has been hit hard hit.


Since budget night there has been near universal consensus amongst independent market economists that Labor's budget will have absolutely no impact on the Reserve Bank's need to raise interest rates. But, still, the Reserve Bank is facing myriad inflationary pressures, particularly as the federal Treasurer is predicting the economy will add 500,000 extra jobs over the next two years, bringing the jobless rate down from 4.9 per cent to 4.5 per cent. As a result, it is encouraging variable rate mortgage borrowers to consider fixing their loans as they prepare for one or even two interest rate rises in the second half of 2011.


Although house prices fell in Darwin and Palmerston in the first three months of this year, the median price for a house in Darwin still remains extremely high at $550,000, with a median price of $465,000 in Palmerston. Buying a house in Darwin is becoming increasingly unaffordable even for key workers such as teachers, police, nurses, firefighters and ambulance officers. According to the latest research from Bankwest, Darwin house prices have increased by 69 per cent over the past five years.


In addition to rising interest rates and unaffordable housing, families in Solomon are feeling the squeeze. Since Labor was elected, electricity prices are up 51 per cent, gas prices are up 30 per cent, water prices are up 46 per cent, education costs have risen 24 per cent, health costs have risen 20 per cent, rent costs have risen 21 per cent and grocery prices are up 14 per cent. In addition to this, a $26 a tonne carbon tax would add a further 25 per cent to electricity bills and at least 6½c to a litre of fuel. This proposed carbon tax will in fact see even higher prices for everything in the Territory. But who knows what the final price on carbon will be and what the ongoing impacts will be? The people of Solomon are very concerned about the increasing cost of living and, as I have already stated, they are paying record house prices and the highest prices in any capital city for groceries, petrol and rent, on the back of soaring power bills and interest rates. Unfortunately, the carbon tax will affect every aspect of people's lives and in particular those families that are already struggling to make ends meet. Many of my constituents will simply be unable to afford the power they use. As I mentioned in this place just three months ago, the carbon tax appears to be a tax on remoteness and on the Territory. The tax stands to increase the cost of living and directly impact key industries in the Northern Territory and my electorate such as primary production, mining, tourism and construction. All of these industries will be hit hard by a carbon tax. In just three months, the already high petrol prices in my electorate have significantly increased—without the carbon tax. Last week in Darwin and Palmerston, according to the NT Labor government's Fuelwatch website, the mean unleaded price for petrol was 152.8c a litre. That is up 10.9c from February this year.


How can the Gillard Labor government be trusted when the Prime Minister said before the election 'there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead', and now continues to pursue the introduction of a carbon tax, a tax on electricity and on petrol and a tax that is going to affect all Australians, particularly Territorians, ultimately increasing the already high cost of living? This budget is based on a lie. The carbon tax revenue and associated spending, tipped to be in the order of $11.5 billion, was not included. It is a tax Labor should be ashamed of and a tax that the Prime Minister said would not happen under the government she leads.


My electorate of Solomon is in desperate need of infrastructure to make its economy more productive. As already mentioned in this place by my colleague the member for Hasluck, the Perth to Darwin Highway, in the north of his electorate, is vital for both Western Australia and the Northern Territory in terms of transport infrastructure. Heavy haulage transport engaged in the movement of machinery and goods south from Darwin and north from the electorate of Hasluck is being sadly neglected by this government. Trucks are being forced to operate within a curfew. Gigantic mining trucks being transported fight for space on rural roads, the same roads used by tourists.


In Solomon we are also in desperate need of health infrastructure to give our people better access to health services. Giving credit where credit is due, I was very pleased to see the inclusion of funding for the first stage of a hospital in Palmerston. I have long advocated for better medical facilities for Palmerston and the rural area. Along with the many other advocates for improved health services in the Territory, I will be keeping an eye on this program, making sure that what is promised is actually delivered.


This government has not got a good track record in delivering what they promise. There is a fair amount of spin involved in most of their announcements. This is something my electorate is tired of. I was pleased to see a small increase in the funding for mental health but, as with the hospital finding, I will be watching this carefully to ensure that there is indeed an improvement in services in the Solomon electorate. I want to make sure that this funding does translate into better mental health services for my electorate.


There are more disappointing elements to the budget, in particular that families have been targeted and the perception of a wealthy family is now a family on $150,000. With the high cost of living continuing to apply pressure on family budgets and interest rates, we all know that a family on $150,000 is far from wealthy. In the budget a massive $1.7 billion blow-out as a result of Labor's failed border protection policies was revealed. Families are paying for Labor's failed border protection policies through cuts to family payments.


Many people in my electorate, and family and friends across Australia, have raised with me their concerns regarding the significant expenditure on housing associated with asylum seekers in the Territory. The view is that this money could be spent on infrastructure to build on the Territory's potential and on funding longer term projects within my electorate. 


The budget clears the way for $2 billion to be gouged from families through the freezing of indexation of family tax payment supplements and upper income thresholds. Families in Solomon will continue to feel the pinch. For example, a family with two children and a stay-at-home parent stands to lose up to $147 worth of benefits, while a family with both parents working will be $116 worse off. Families struggling to make ends meet on an income of $45,000 will also be hit.


This Labor government's short-sighted measures and poor fiscal management are set to continue the pain for families within my electorate of Solomon. Despite Labor talking down the impact of these changes, the truth is that, at a time when families are struggling with cost-of-living pressures, these changes will hurt two million families in some way, shape or form. I remind this House of the waste by this government associated with the failed pink batts, school halls and solar panels spend up. In this budget one of the biggest savings was on the $1.7 billion flood levy. It is a disgrace that this government has wasted so much money, yet incomprehensibly it could not find $1.7 billion in a $360 billion budget for allocation to natural disasters. It was extraordinary that, given this government's track record of wanton waste and failed program implementation, Labor's big budget eve announcement was a plan to spend $376 million on set-top boxes for pensioners. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, let me remind the government that a postbudget survey revealed that 60 per cent of pensioners do not want a set-top box. Additionally, we know that Gerry Harvey said he could provide and install them for $168 a unit, compared to Labor's budgeted cost of $400.


The Prime Minister was asked by the member for Denison what Labor would do with the promises made by Labor candidates in seats where Labor did not win. The Prime Minister stood at the dispatch box hand on heart and said, 'Our promises were fully costed, every one of them. Of course they will be delivered. Of course they will. We don't go around making promises that we won't fulfil.' Like the member for Herbert, I also have concerns regarding the statement made by the Prime Minister. Following on from her passionate statement of commitment in the chamber, I wrote letters to the Prime Minister on behalf of my electorate asking for clarification as to when the pre-election commitments made by Labor will be delivered in my electorate of Solomon—promises such as $37,000 for Dragon Boat Northern Territory to maintain their current fleet and construct new dragon boats, and the $1.5 million all-weather world championship level BMX track for the NT BMX.  A new music and dance festival, the Big Day Without, was planned in March at Palmerston Senior College, in April at Darwin Middle School, in May at Casuarina Secondary College and in June at Sanderson Middle School. Well, March, April and May have come and gone and no events have occurred, and when I contacted the schools they were not aware of plans for any of these events. Then there was the promise of 1,200 new affordable rental homes in the Northern Territory, priced at least 20 per cent below market rates, under the National Rental Affordability Scheme. This promise was rebadged from the previous election.


It turns out that yet again there is an issue with delivery. Both NT BMX and Dragon Boat Northern Territory have been advised that they do not have the funding, despite all the pre-election hype. These groups now have to apply for grants through the usual process—no guarantee of funding at all. I wonder if this has something to do with the fact that these two commitments were also made by the coalition. This is a very tricky government, one that has been caught out before. For example, this government has taken the high moral ground on education in Closing the Gap programs. However, in the lead-up to the 2010 federal election, the Gillard Labor government committed to the Indigenous Funding Guarantee program, which affects schools in my electorate. The commitment was to provide increased funding to non-remote boarding schools that house more than 50 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students from remote Indigenous communities. Like the community groups NT BMX and Dragon Boat Northern Territory, schools such as Kormilda College, St John's College and O'Loughlin Catholic College were under the impression the funding was guaranteed and was to be backdated. Frustratingly, these schools still seek assurance as to whether the promised but delayed payments of the remote rate for remote students based at their school will indeed be backdated to include 2010. I have raised this issue a number of times, and once again I pose the question to the Prime Minister: when can Kormilda College, St John's College and O'Loughlin Catholic College in my electorate expect to hear the government's decision on whether or not this funding will be backdated? Additionally I ask the Prime Minister: when will the pre-election commitments made by Labor in my electorate of Solomon be delivered?


If the coalition were in government, the people of Solomon would have RAAF base houses available to them. The coalition committed to excising the suburb of Eaton from defence, making 396 houses available for a variety of housing options for Territorians. This is in clear contrast to the current situation, where this Labor government continues on its path of waste and mismanagement. Two hundred and five of the 396 houses sit vacant in the middle of a housing crisis. Is this an example of a government that values taxpayer resources? I do not think so. This is a government that expects everybody else to pay for its mistakes. Labor's working families of 2007 have become the forgotten families of 2011.


Debate adjourned.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (16:01):  I wish to take up the great honour of speaking on this condolence motion and paying tribute to Sergeant Brett Mathew Wood MG. He is the 24th soldier to have lost his life and paid the supreme sacrifice for our nation in Afghanistan. I honour Sergeant Wood and I honour his family for the sacrifices they have made and for their struggles in the time of great sadness that they are enduring at the moment.


There are some things in this world that are worth fighting for. There are some things where there cannot be any other way apart from picking up a weapon and fighting. It is tragic, but that is the sad reality. The other part of that reality is that when people fight someone ends up dying, and that is what we are here to talk about today. Sergeant Wood, an exemplary soldier with impeccable credentials and years of dedication to the service and interests of his nation, has given his life in combat in Afghanistan. That is a tragedy, and we are here to pay tribute to his life and to his contribution to our nation.


Sergeant Wood was a veteran of Bougainville, of East Timor, of Iraq and of Afghanistan. He had been pretty much everywhere on behalf of his country; when the nation called him to all those spots he answered. Above all that, on 17 July 2006, he was awarded one of the highest bravery decorations that this country can bestow on anybody. On that day he was incredibly important in assisting an infantry company of the United States Army, the 10th Mountain Division, to regain their momentum. Despite being wounded early in the battle, he fought throughout the entire afternoon, providing leadership, determination and outrageous courage and bravery to see the enemy defeated and the momentum of the advance resumed. We are not talking about just any complicated battlefield. We are talking here about difficult visibility. We are talking about the enemy firing from compounds which in many ways are akin to small forts—a very difficult situation indeed. Sergeant Wood was the sort of highly professional soldier that we know Australians are capable of being. He was the one who, despite his own injuries, his own wounds and his own concerns was able to continue to fight and turn the tide of the battle on that day, 17 July 2006. And so it was, as a result of his efforts on that day, that he was awarded the Medal for Gallantry.


Unfortunately, on 23 May this year, Sergeant Wood MG was killed by an improvised explosive device. When you consider what this man had been through throughout his career, his overseas service and the events of 2006, I suspect he was the sort of person who could not be killed by the enemy directly. The only way the enemy could take him out was by this tragic incident involving an improvised explosive device. It is a tragedy that this great man, this great Australian, lost his life.


When we think about those sacrifices that Australians have made, about the soldiers who have died and the families who have lost their loved ones it is normal for some Australians to think: what is the point? There is no doubt that there have been advancements. Ground has been taken and provinces within Afghanistan are much safer now than they used to be. Military objectives have been achieved. We are proud of that and we absolutely support that. But there is more to it than just that. There is a societal return for the sacrifices that our soldiers are making. Our soldiers have turned the path and have made life for the Taliban and the terrorists extremely difficult in Afghanistan. But they have also made great advancements for society in Afghanistan.


Whilst we may not ever see the sort of democracy that we know and love here in Australia implemented in Afghanistan—although I certainly hope for that—we have seen a different attitude, as was reported last year, in that 70 per cent of Afghan people believe that the future for their children will be a safer and better one. There is a lot to be said for that. So many young girls are now allowed to go to school. That is a good thing and worth fighting for. Literacy levels are up and the total number of children who are going to school is up. These are good things and they have been achieved by the Australians, the Americans, the Dutch, the Macedonians and others. Those people have been fighting there and have been prepared to say: 'It is a good thing to be here; it is a good thing to be prepared to fight for a better world and a better Afghanistan—an Afghanistan where the future will be moderate and where, as much as possible, the future will be democratic and where terrorism will never again be allowed to reign in Afghanistan.'


When we look back on the sacrifices of Sergeant Wood MG and others and on the tragic loss of the latest two soldiers, we should be very certain that what they died for was a good cause. As I said at the start, there are good things in this world and sometimes we have just got to fight for them.


I pay tribute to Sergeant Wood, to his service to our great country and I extend my condolences to his family for the loss they have suffered. We in this place share a bipartisan approach to Afghanistan: we will be there until the job is done. I applaud all those who fight for our country and we honour them as great Australians. On this occasion we honour the very great and most excellent soldier Sergeant Brett Matthew Wood MG.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (16:09):  I commend the member for Cowan on his comments and his heartfelt appreciation for the services of Sergeant Wood. One of the great things about parliament is the way we are able to rally around our troops in a bipartisan way. One of the signal beauties of this parliament is that we can do that. It is based on an understanding and a knowledge of the people we are talking about. We share the experiences of having to go to the ramp ceremonies together and meeting and dealing with the families and getting out there and meeting with the men and women of the ADF as well. It has been tremendous in these last few years in particular to see the participation by members of parliament in the ADF's parliamentary exchange program. Many members have voluntarily taken the opportunity to get out there and meet with all our men and woman and understand all they go through not only in the service in operations but in all of the hard work and sacrifices they make to even be in the position to deploy into those environments. So I salute all members of parliament who have participated in that and have shared the experiences of our men and women, including, of course, the member for Kooyong, who is here today, who was with me most recently on that exchange program in Afghanistan.


Now we come to salute the service, the life and the achievements of Sergeant Brett Wood, and it is so fitting that we do so, because if there is one individual who really epitomises all that is fine, all that is good in the men and women of our defence forces it certainly is Sergeant Brett Wood. This was in every way an outstanding soldier and a soldier who was one of our excellent senior NCOs. How much do the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force depend on the high quality of our NCOs? In these sorts of environments in Afghanistan they often talk about the role of the strategic corporal, the strategic NCO, because these environments place so much pressure, so much responsibility on the decisions that the corporals and sergeants make on the ground. They can make or break a mission by what they do and how they perform. 


Sergeant Brett Wood was a man who typifies a lot of the reservists in our organisation today who have had previous experience in the Regular Army and in his case coming from Ferntree Gully in Victoria he joined the Regular Army in 1996. After recruit training he was part of one of our finest units, the 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, which itself has a wonderful history going back to its days in Vietnam and Long Tan, a very storied regiment that I was proud to have a lot of association with. He went on to undertake the very demanding, very rigorous commando selection and training processes which are incredibly demanding of the individual in every possible way, mental and physical stress. He met the standards of excellence above and beyond what we normally ask for from the men and women of our Defence Force to become part of the 4th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, now known as 2 Commando, in November 1998.


The member for Cowan has mentioned his operational service in Bougainville and Timor and Iraq. He was involved in his third tour of his operational experience in Afghanistan when he met his untimely death in the circumstances of an improvised explosive device detonation. These devices are such an insidious weapon. People should appreciate the extra stress and strain that that adds to just the daily experience of patrolling in that environment, never knowing when you will encounter one of these devices and whether it will mean the loss of limbs or your death, knowing that in some cases serious maiming is a worse fate to endure than death itself. It is an incredibly stressful experience to go through and we ask our men and women to do that on a daily basis in Afghanistan, and they do it. While we were in Afghanistan just recently, the member for Kooyong and I were briefed on the latest developments in the improvised explosive device tactics of the enemy. It is something that we focus on very heavily in terms of our countermeasures. We have a counter-IED task force in our weapons technical intelligence teams constantly working on ways to improve the way we approach dealing with these insidious weapons, which it must be said injure and kill far more civilians than they do the military personnel in Afghanistan. It is a devastating weapon for all those civilians as well as our own dearly appreciated and loved casualties. Sergeant Brett Wood was a special soldier. As mentioned by the member for Cowan, he received the Medal for Gallantry which indicates what a courageous man he was. This medal ranks second in the gallantry decorations and is awarded to military personnel for acts of gallantry in action or hazardous circumstances. It was a richly deserved decoration for the performance that Sergeant Brett Wood rendered in very difficult and demanding circumstances in the field.


He was in every way a professional, in every way an outstanding soldier, and he will be a great loss to our organisation. Every time you come here to speak—I know the member for Cowan will feel the same way, and I am currently still a member of the reserves as well—you always feel like you have lost someone in the family when we experience this. It never gets any easier. Of course, it will be doubly so for the members of Sergeant Brett Wood's family and particularly his loving wife and family.


We take to our heart, our thoughts and our prayers his family today and we make that commitment to be with them through this. They have made some wonderful statements, as we have heard from the Prime Minister today. That is one of the very special experiences which I think we have all had in dealing with these families—how courageous they are in the face of these losses. They have almost universally indicated that they feel their sons were doing an important job and that they would like the nation to maintain faith with our men and women in the field for the work that they are doing.


They are incredibly courageous people. Other members of the commando fraternity have had dealings with families through the loss of Private Greg Sher, who was another wonderful example of that outstanding fraternity, and his family is just so impressive and so inspiring. I continue to be in contact with his parents who are outstanding members of the community in Melbourne and proud members of the Jewish community there.


I salute you, Sergeant Brett Wood. You will not be forgotten. You have written an outstanding page in the fine traditions and history of the Australian Army, which has a tradition full of so many wonderful stories. Your story will stand out in that collection.


As the member for Cowan mentioned, in the circumstances of these losses we reflect on where we are at in Afghanistan and whether those losses continue to be worth while and continue to mean something. Certainly, having just returned from Afghanistan, we have seen some tremendous signs of progress on the ground. I feel it is one of the proud achievements of the government that we were able to reorient the strategy that was being applied on the ground in Afghanistan. We see there now a deeper understanding of how we apply counterinsurgency tactics in a situation like this.


It is one of the reasons we created the Civil-Military Centre of Excellence in Queanbeyan, which is doing an outstanding job of reorienting the approach of a whole-of-government strategy for environments like this. We see that perfectly illustrated on the ground in Afghanistan in the way the provincial reconstruction team—which I should emphasise is a multinational effort directed primarily by the efforts of AusAID personnel—is at the centre of the primary scheme of manoeuvre of the commanders in Combined Team Uruzgan.


This is exactly how the mission should be shaped. Instead of being an orphan child or an adjunct to that mission, the mission is wrapped around them because this is the way that we achieve our ticket out of Afghanistan. We build the capacity of governance, of rule of law, of the security sector in Afghanistan and we can get our people out of harm's way. We cannot leave it—as has been said so often—as a vacuum for those terrible terrorism elements to continue to exploit as they had prior to operations in 2001, when they had the full resources and capability of the state to support their effort.


We observed some of the wonderful projects that are underway there—the Sorkh Murghab mosque in Oruzgan that has been completed and is in operation; the wonderful girls school, a beautiful facility, that is not far from completion and that will cater for 750 children; the boys school, which is already complete; and the trade and training centre, at which our engineers are operating and training Afghans, sending them out equipped with tools to go straight into jobs in the construction industry. The wonderful work our Australian Federal Police are doing at the Defence Police Training Centre is starting to make some progress now in an area which has been problematic. But it is one area where we are seeing signs of improvement and I really salute the work of our Australian Federal Police in that effort in difficult circumstances. There has also been great progress in creating that security bubble within which good governance can flourish.


We were at Patrol Base Wali, which is seeing that integration with Afghan security forces in increasing the security space beyond where it has ever previously been in our experience in Afghanistan. There has been tremendous progress in that respect in the last eight months. The key to the effort there is whether that can be sustained through the so-called fighting season of the summer months. It will be challenging and we will face the risk of further casualties, but if those gains can be held during this period we will have made significant strides towards ultimate success for our efforts and for our blood and treasure in Oruzgan province.


The proof of the pudding for our efforts there comes from comments that Combined Team Uruzgan has received from other sources in Afghanistan, particularly General Terry, the Commander of Regional Command South, who has singled out Oruzgan province and said, 'That is what success looks like, they are on the right track; look at what is being done there.' That is the message that I would emphasise and get out there because what is being done in Oruzgan province is not being completely replicated throughout the rest of Afghanistan. We do need to improve that civil-military integration. The way in which that operation is being conducted in Oruzgan needs to be replicated as a model right across the country if we are to advance this cause at a more rapid rate.


The main mission in which our military is involved in the training of the Afghan National Army is probably making the greatest progress of all elements of our activities there. This tragic incident that has occurred in the last couple of days would give people cause to consider whether or not we are succeeding there and whether it is worth our effort, but the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade has achieved great standards and improvements and the Kandaks are being assessed rigorously. Just recently, one of them was given a very high rating for the progress he had made. So we are making progress. We will endure from time to time setbacks of this nature, which will lead us to question and test the resolve of our mentors and trainers on the ground in relation to how they interact with their colleagues in the Afghan National Army. That will be a challenge for them, but they are disciplined professionals and they will put this behind them and move on to achieve ultimate success.


Over in Afghanistan we also visited the men and women who are serving in embedded positions in Kandahar. We should not forget those people. They are often left out of references to what is being achieved there and what is going on. They are doing a fantastic job in the embedded arrangements they have with other components of the ISAF effort in Afghanistan and it is so important that they are doing this job because they are value-adding in key positions. I salute their service.


Finally, before I finish today, this is a day where we have also experienced the changeover of leadership in the Australian Defence Force. I firstly pay tribute to the outgoing service chiefs, particularly the CDF who has been an honest, decent and highly competent commander of this organisation through two terms which have been incredibly demanding, and I know that he has put body and soul into this effort. He was a fine man for me to have worked for in the Defence Force and to have worked with in the Defence portfolio. I wish him and his wife all the best for their future. I also salute the selections that the Minister for Defence has made. General Hurley is one of the finest men I have ever worked with, a man of outstanding honesty, who always looks to do the right thing and is incredibly competent in that. He understands the challenges we face in our theatres in Afghanistan and elsewhere, having been a commander on the ground in Somalia of the 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment. He is an outstanding choice, as are his support service chiefs: the Vice Chief of the Defence Force, Mark Binskin—a wonderful man as well and a fine leader of men and women; the Chief of Navy, Admiral Griggs; and General Morrison, who will also do a fine job, as will Brown in relation to the Air Force. So I salute those selections and I wish them the best and look forward to helping them in any way I can.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (16:24):  I join with the members for Eden-Monaro and Cowan and colleagues on both sides of this House to pay my respects following the death of Sergeant Brett Wood during operations in Afghanistan. Sergeant Wood's death is a tragedy for his family and a tragedy for our nation. Sergeant Wood was the 24th Australian soldier to lose his life in Afghanistan, and with two more casualties in recent days that number has risen to 26.


Only 32 years of age, Sergeant Wood was widely respected for his decency as a human being and his bravery on the battlefield. In the words of the outgoing Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, Sergeant Wood was 'an exceptional leader, a great warrior'. There could be no higher praise. A Victorian by birth, Sergeant Wood joined the Army 15 years ago, trained with the 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment and undertook commando selection and training before becoming a member of the 2nd Commando Regiment, based in Sydney.


Sergeant Wood served his nation on numerous deployments abroad—Bougainville in 2000, East Timor in 2001 on Operation Tanager, Iraq in 2003 on Operation Falconer and more recently Operation Slipper in Afghanistan in 2006. It was for his efforts in Afghanistan in 2006 on the first of three deployments there that he in his role as team commander was awarded the Medal for Gallantry. It is therefore appropriate to read from that citation for gallantry. It says:


Corporal Wood displayed extraordinary leadership and courage, inspiring his team and the remainder of the commando platoon to repel the continued attacks … Only after the engagement had been completed and the threat to the platoon subsided did Corporal Wood inform his commander of the fragmentation wound that he had sustained during the original contact earlier that day.


That is why he was awarded a medal for bravery and gallantry, because he put the interests and the lives of his fellow soldiers before his own.


Having been to Afghanistan in recent weeks as part of a bipartisan parliamentary delegation, I saw first-hand the work that Sergeant Wood and his comrades in uniform, men and women of the Australian Defence Force, were undertaking to make Afghanistan a better place so that it can never again become a haven for terrorism. We are making improvements in this difficult cause. It is a worthwhile cause, and we are not alone. We, Australia, are serving with many other nations, many other NATO countries, and much of the heavy lifting is being done by our most important ally, the United States. We need to stay the course, and it would be wrong to leave the battlefield precipitously.


Sergeant Wood will be sadly missed by his family, his friends and, in particular, his wife, Elvi, who described him as:


… a much loved son, grandson and brother who inspired his family with his dedication and generosity.


I have not only lost my husband, I have lost my best friend. The past six years with him were the happiest of my life and it was the biggest honour ever to become his wife and to be part of his family.


There can be no greater tribute to a man who lived his life to the fullest and who will never be forgotten. Sergeant Wood, your grateful country salutes you.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (16:29):  I rise today to support the condolence motion for Sergeant Brett Wood, who was tragically killed on 23 May, Afghanistan time, as a result of the explosion of an improvised explosive device. Sergeant Wood was a much decorated and respected member of the Sydney based 2nd Commando Regiment. He was only 32 years of age and leaves a young wife and a close group of family and friends. His ramp ceremony was held on Tuesday at RAAF Base Richmond where members of 2 Commando formed a guard of honour to receive his casket. His family and special forces personnel were also at the ramp ceremony.


This will be a dreadful week for his family, and I imagine that the coming years will be dreadful too. However, I would like them to know that our thoughts and prayers are with them as they face the grim reality of life without a much loved and devoted husband, son, friend and colleague.


Sergeant Wood was a Victorian by birth, harking from Ferntree Gully. He joined the Army in 1996 at the age of 18 and, following training, he joined the 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment. He successfully undertook commando training and then joined the then 4th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment—now 2 Commando—in November 1998. So a commando he was by the age of 20. Clearly, Sergeant Wood was a man with significant skills and leadership qualities to achieve so much so quickly.


Two years later he was deployed to Bougainville for his first significant operational experience. Further major operational experience followed with deployment to East Timor on Operation Tanager in 2001. In 2003, he was part of Operation Falconer in Iraq and, in 2006, he was deployed to Operation Slipper in Afghanistan. He was deployed again to Operation Slipper in 2009 and 2011, and it was this last tour of duty that resulted in his tragic death. It was during Operation Slipper that he was awarded the Medal for Gallantry for leadership in action as team commander.


Other awards Sergeant Wood received for his outstanding service include the Australian Active Service Medal with clasps: East Timor, International Coalition Against Terrorism and Iraq 2003; Afghanistan Campaign Medal; Iraq Campaign Medal; Australian Service Medal with clasps: Bougainville, Counter Terrorism and Special Recovery clasp; Defence Long Service Medal; Australian Defence Medal; United Nations East Timor Medal; NATO ISAF Medal; Special Operations Command Australia Commendation; and Unit Citation for Gallantry. He was also awarded the Infantry Combat Badge. These are all incredible achievements for such a young man and a testament to his courage and leadership.


Like my colleague who spoke before, I met soldiers like Sergeant Wood during my recent tour of Afghanistan. I was there for five days about two weeks ago in Tarin Kowt, Kandahar and Kabul as part of the Defence Subcommittee tour. I was overwhelmed by the gritty and determined Australians who are focused on stamping out terrorism and building a safe Afghanistan.


Soldiers are a very loyal bunch. They feel the loss of their fellow soldiers very deeply and they also honour them very deeply. While I was there I met a number of commandos. They are a whole different group of people. They work very closely together in incredibly challenging conditions and are doing incredibly challenging jobs. They are like a brotherhood. Whenever one of their brothers is killed in action or is injured, they make little bracelets. A number of them had bracelets commemorating each of their brothers who had died in action in Afghanistan. Some had a string of bracelets with a number of names on them, some had bands with knots on them with each knot signifying one of their brothers, and others had particular necklaces. They had different, personal ways of remembering their brothers. As I have said, they are a very close group who do incredibly challenging work in incredibly challenging conditions. They are a deeply loyal, incredibly fit and incredibly well-trained group of young men—an extraordinary group of men. I imagine that this loss will be like a knife through their heart. They will be grieving the loss of their mate very seriously. They will also be grieving the loss of a colleague, a fine soldier and an exemplary leader. They need to know, as they do, that they are making Afghanistan and this world a better place. They have a very strong commitment to bringing about a safe, secure and stable Afghanistan. They are very clear about the mission and are very driven to achieve that mission.


Sergeant Wood's tragic death has no doubt caused his colleagues to pause and contemplate their own mortality. I can only pay tribute to them all for their selfless act of supporting a country that, until it received the support of countries like Australia, had struggled to find safe haven. I really do commend them for their hard work in dealing with incredibly challenging conditions.


As Sergeant Wood's death was the 24th death in action in Afghanistan, no doubt he also considered his own mortality. His courage and bravery in persisting with his chosen career, and in making Afghanistan a safer country, were extraordinary. It is no surprise that he had been much decorated as a result of his extensive operational experience, his leadership talent and his dedication.


Life in Afghanistan for our service men and women is difficult and challenging, as I observed during my recent trip. We heard this morning about winters getting to minus 20. I was there on the edge of summer, which promises to get up to about 50 degrees, and it was about 42 degrees then. It is hot and dusty and it can be pretty uncomfortable, but our service men and women endure these conditions with great tenacity. They get on with it, as Australian soldiers do. And they do so with a sense of humour, as Australians tend to do, as well as a strong sense of commitment, vision and purpose as to why they are there.


Our service men and women are responsive to the local people and their needs. I sat in on many meetings and could not help but be impressed with the sense of dignity that surrounded those meetings. The Afghanis are being helped by Australian service men and women and are grateful for the great sacrifice that is being made. I am sure that they will be grieving the loss of Sergeant Wood as well, as they have come to respect people like him. They have depended upon his skills, expertise, leadership and quiet dignity.


The Afghani people are a proud people who appreciate the support of Australia and of dedicated people like Sergeant Wood. They want a life like other citizens in the world, one in which their families are safe, their economic and financial safety can be developed and they can evolve as a country which is not a haven for terrorists and thugs. Above all, they want emotional security. Sergeant Wood made, and Operation Slipper is making, a difference to the lives of the people of Afghanistan.


I say to Sergeant Wood's family, friends, mates and colleagues that we will never forget him. We will remember the contribution he made to the safety and wellbeing of his colleagues and the people of Afghanistan. We are grateful that he chose the profession of serving his country, a profession he chose at the tender age of 18. We thank the leaders who supported his development into a fine soldier and commando at such a young age and who nurtured his leadership qualities. Above all, we thank him for his dedication to duty.


In our grief we will remember the Afghani people, who have lost the support of Sergeant Wood and, after yesterday, that of Lance Corporal Andrew Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Case. These fine Australians were serving their country courageously. Their dedication to the very difficult task that I observed during my recent tour is extraordinary. The service ethos that I encountered is a hallmark of Australian service men and women. They are strongly committed to bringing stability, security and viability to Afghanistan.


In closing, I say to Elvi, Sergeant Wood's wife: your husband was a well-respected and much loved Australian, we all feel your grief, we acknowledge the huge contribution from your husband and we thank you.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (16:39):  I rise to support the words of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition on this condolence motion in respect of the memory of Sergeant Brett Wood. May I also congratulate the member for Canberra for her fine speech. Sergeant Wood, known as 'Woody' to his mates, was serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan when he was tragically killed in action as a result of the explosion of an improvised explosive device on Monday 23 May 2011. He was a much loved husband, father, son, grandson and brother. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Elvi, and their son, his family and his friends as they struggle to come to terms with this dreadful news, as their grieving begins. It is a time of great sadness for them. Whilst this motion is in no way likely to ease their pain, we mourn the death of a brave soldier who had so much life ahead of him. We sincerely wish those close to him courage and strength into the future.


Sergeant Brett Wood was born in Ferntree Gully, in my electorate in outer eastern Melbourne, in 1978. He was just 32 years of age when he died. He was a genuine professional, an outstanding soldier with 15 years operational experience, having joined the Army in 1996. Sergeant Wood was first deployed in Bougainville, in 2000. In 2001, he was deployed to East Timor on Operation Tanager and, in 2003, to Iraq on Operation Falconer. In 2006, Sergeant Wood was deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Slipper. For his actions during a critical battle in southern Afghanistan, he was awarded the Medal for Gallantry for leadership in action as a team commander. It is one of the nation's highest military honours for bravery under fire.


Following this, Sergeant Wood received a Special Operations Commander Australia commendation for service with the Tactical Assault Group East in 2007, and in 2009 he returned to Afghanistan as a section commander. Sergeant Wood was finally deployed to Afghanistan, for the third time, in March this year, and of course never returned.


He was clearly one of our finest soldiers. We will honour his life and mourn his passing. Sergeant Wood was the 24th Australian killed in Afghanistan. Just yesterday we learnt of the deaths of Lance Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Case, tragically bringing to 26 the number of people who have been killed in Afghanistan. I imagine that, at the time of the deaths of Sergeant Wood, Lance Corporal Jones and Lieutenant Cases, it will also be difficult for the families of the other 23 soldiers who have died in the battle in Afghanistan.


Whilst our soldiers have died tragically, they have died with great honour, serving our nation in the cause of making Afghanistan safer from terrorism. Their sacrifice is not in vain. We honour their memory and the memory of Sergeant Wood by remaining true to the cause that they so well served. Lest we forget.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (16:43):  I also rise today to talk about the tragic death of Sergeant Brett Wood. What has occurred to such a fine Australian soldier is, obviously, an absolute tragedy—as we have learned, he was one of our finest. His record serving the nation speaks for itself. It is a record which, through deployment upon deployment, shows an outstanding military career. It is absolutely certain that the lives which have been lost in fighting this war in Afghanistan are tragic in every sense of the word, because—as we have heard and seen with every moving speech, every moving funeral and with all the words that families and friends have had to say about all the soldiers that have died—they have an enormous impact on those families, friends and military personnel. But with every one of these deaths we must remember that it is important that these deaths do not take place for a cause which we would walk away from. These deaths are a reminder to us of why we should be in Afghanistan and why we need to continue to be there.


Sergeant Brett Wood, and other soldiers, have given their lives so that we can defend this cause. It is beholden on us to make sure that we remain resolute on the reasons we are there. There are three reasons we must continue in Afghanistan and see the job done. The first, as I have already outlined, is the 26 tragic deaths that we have seen. Each of these soldiers have done the most admirable thing: they have been prepared to give up their lives—and ultimately they have given up their lives—serving our nation. And there cannot be a more honourable deed.


The second reason we need to stay the course is the reason we are there—that is, the fight against terrorism. In fighting international terrorism in Afghanistan we are helping to keep safe not only Australian citizens but citizens across the world who believe in freedom and democracy and who believe that terror is not the way of the world. We must continue to fight terrorism. And if that means that we must continue the battle in Afghanistan, as hard as that may be, we need to do so. Our resolve must not weaken, because if we are seen to weaken we give heart to the terrorists and they will continue to pursue us, not only in Afghanistan but across the world. And the last thing any of us needs to see is another September 11, another Bali. The tragic consequences for our nation and for the world from these events is why we are in Afghanistan and why we must continue to be there.


The third reason we need to continue the course is because of our alliances—in particular our ANZUS alliance. It was September 11 that led us to invoke the ANZUS alliance and it was largely the reason we have ended up in Afghanistan. That alliance continues to be our most critical alliance today. We must stay the course with the US and make sure, as far as the alliance is concerned, that we are in lock-step with the US in winning this battle in Afghanistan. 


The other alliance that we must ensure that we continue to honour is that with our British colleagues—and through them, with NATO—who are also there with us fighting in Afghanistan. It is incredibly important that we continue to play our part, along with NATO, who have done the lion's share in Afghanistan, and make sure that we continue to give them the support they deserve. 


I would like to use this opportunity to pay my respects to Sergeant Brett Wood and his family and friends for the tragic loss of life and also to say that his life will not be forgotten because he, along with the 26 others, have made the supreme sacrifice for this nation. It was a supreme sacrifice to ensure that we do everything we can to rid the world of international terrorism and make sure that we protect our key alliances with the US, the UK and NATO.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (16:50):  I thank earlier speakers, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Defence and his opposition counterpart. Condolence debates are among the most difficult things we do in this place, but one of the things that relieve the pain just a little is the bipartisan approach we see to not only motions such as this but also our contribution in Afghanistan. I do not know whether I ever met Sergeant Brett Wood; I may have. He was part of one of our elite special forces groups. But I do know one thing, and that is that he would have really believed in what he was doing, he would have been absolutely committed to what he was doing, he would have enjoyed what he was doing and as a volunteer he would have fought very hard against any attempt to deny him the opportunity to do what he was doing. Based on my experience as defence minister, it is more than likely that his family and friends felt exactly the same. They would have come to the conclusion some time ago—a long time ago, in his case, I suspect—that this was what he wanted to do, this was what he trained hard to do and this is what he dreamt of doing. And, based on what we have been told, he did it with a high degree of distinction, and his family and friends would have been very supportive.


The bipartisan approach to our role in Afghanistan is very important to all of our troops and to their families and broader loved ones, including their mates. I continue to appreciate it. Let us all work very hard to ensure that that bipartisan approach to our operations in Afghanistan continues, because it might get hard. I have said for a few years now that the longer we are in Afghanistan and the more people we lose the more difficult it will be to maintain broader community support for our operations there. If community support declines, then the temptation emerges to capitalise on community discontent. Let us all hope and pray that both sides of parliament will work together to ensure that that is never the case and, to the extent that that requires bringing the opposition further into the inner circle of decisions, and consulting them more, then let us do it, because I think that is critically important.


Tragically, the next time we are here in this chamber we will have another condolence motion before us, as kicked off by the Prime Minister today, taking our loss in Afghanistan to 26—I hope I have got that right—which is too many. One is too many; 26 is far too many. But, given the size of our involvement in Afghanistan, it is relatively low, and we can be thankful for that. Canada, a country of about 30 million people, had lost over 90 the last time I counted, which is tragic. So let us hope that we continue to operate in a way that keeps our losses to a minimum, and I say again: one is too many. Let us hope we do not go beyond 26.


I said that Sergeant Wood would have believed in what he was doing. So do I and, I judge from earlier contributions, so too do most people in this place. It is important work, and it is not a time to give up. We are making ground. I remain in contact with people on the ground in Afghanistan and, in fact, one said to me, 'You would be very proud of what has been happening in Afghanistan because in Oruzgan province, at least, the environment has substantially changed and it is a far more peaceful and much safer place for ordinary citizens'. In his view we really are making significant ground.


Of course, not so long ago now we reconfigured our operation to focus on the training of the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police. This is a transition out of Afghanistan, which will produce an ability in Afghanistan on the part of the security forces to maintain their own security and to enforce their own rule of law. That is why we are there: we are there to build a government, to build a democracy, to help to build an economy and, of course, to build the strength of the security forces. When we get the 4th Brigade up to speed and do more work with the Afghan National Police then we will be in a position to do what we have wanted to do for a long time, I am sure, and that is to get out of Afghanistan. I am sure that that success, while we do not know exactly when it will be, is not too far down the track.


I hope I will be excused by the family, because it is relevant on this occasion to congratulate the new Chief of Defence Force. I know that he is committed to our troops and our work. I know the new service chiefs, including the new Vice Chief, although I do not know the new Chief of Navy or the new Chief of Army all that well. But I know the leadership very well, and I know they are all committed not only to success but to the safety of our troops. It is one of the reasons we have had a relatively—and I underline relatively—low casualty rate, and I wish them all the very best of successes. They take on the heavy responsibility of not only helping to manage an organisation that is 80,000-strong and with a budget of somewhere around $26 or $27 billion but also ensuring our success in Afghanistan. Just as importantly, if not more importantly, they take on the responsibility for the safety of our troops in Afghanistan.


My thoughts, again, are with Sergeant Brett Wood's wife, his family, his mates and all those who were close to him, including those who have served with him not only in Afghanistan but in other places. He was a highly-decorated soldier, again, part of our elite special forces. I know them well, and I know how amazing they are. To have qualified to be one of them he must have been something special. I just close by appealing to everyone to ensure that the loss of his life will not be one in vain.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (16:59):  Sadly, this parliament and this nation again pause and reflect upon the ultimate price that one of our brave soldiers has paid so that we and others may live in peace. We honour the death of another fallen soldier. In doing so, we are reminded of the sacrifice these men and women gave and continue to give to citizens of other nations so that they can experience the freedoms we mostly take for granted each and every day.


When our service men and women leave this country to serve overseas they know in their hearts and in their minds, and we appreciate it, that it comes with an element of great risk. Unfortunately, that knowledge does little to ease the pain or reduce the shock when the terrible news arrives that one of our soldiers has fallen.


Sergeant Brett Matthew Wood was the 24th soldier to be tragically killed in action in Afghanistan. We must feel comfort in the words of recent Victoria Cross for Australia recipient, Ben Roberts-Smith, who said, 'There is no doubt we are making progress for the people of Afghanistan. We make that progress because of the sacrifice and dedication of our soldiers.' Sergeant Wood was a decorated soldier who had been deployed to Afghanistan in March this year on his third tour of duty. Sergeant Wood had also served in Bougainville in 2000, East Timor in 2001 and in Iraq in 2003. Awarded the Medal for Gallantry for leadership in action as team commander on his tour in Afghanistan in 2006, Sergeant Wood became the man on whom many could rely and who would live and die by his motto 'foras admonitio'—without warning. On Monday, 23 May 2011 Afghanistan time, without warning, Sergeant Wood was tragically killed as a result of an improvised explosive device. Five other soldiers, two of whom were with Sergeant Wood and some of whom were critically injured, suffered wounds as a result of separate actions in Afghanistan over that same tragic 24-hour period in which our courageous digger died. My thoughts go to them and their families for the frightening realisation in which it could have easily been anyone one of them who lost his life. This must indeed bring home the reality of the dangerous jobs that they do each and every day. 


The spirit of the Australian Army is strong and the camaraderie which binds them together will help them all get through these tough times—tough times which have claimed another two brave souls since Sergeant Wood's death. So our thoughts are also with the brave Australian men and women who are carrying on the work that Sergeant Wood did in Afghanistan. They will miss their mate dearly. We can be very proud of the work they are doing. They are a tight-knit group who look after each other. I know this because my home town is Wagga Wagga—home of the soldier, the Army Recruit Training Centre at Kapooka. 


Just 32 years young, Sergeant Wood leaves behind a loving wife and a loving family. In the words of Brett's grieving widow, Elvi:


Brett was extremely proud to be part of the 2nd Commando Regiment and he considered many of his colleagues to be his second family. He was an excellent soldier, a true leader and a friend to his entire unit. Brett, you have done your country proud and you will always be remembered.


Sergeant Brett Wood, in the words of St John and in a line chiselled into so many war memorials dotted right across this country: 'Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.' 


To walk away from Afghanistan now would be an injustice to the 26 Australians who have laid down their lives for their friends. There must be no safe haven for terrorists. There must be no nursery for terrorism. We must continue to fight the good fight with our American and other allies. We must stay the course. We must continue to do our duty to serve, to play our part. Sergeant Brett Wood, lest we forget.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (17:02):  Today flags flew at half-mast at the Holsworthy Barracks as soldiers gathered for a memorial service to farewell their fallen comrade, Sergeant Brett Woods, and to add his name to its honour roll of comrades killed in action. Sergeant Brett Woods becomes the seventh member of the 2nd Commando Regiment to pay the ultimate sacrifice. His name joins those of Lance Corporal Jason Marks, Lieutenant Michael Fussell and Privates Luke Worsely, Tim Aplin, Ben Chuck and Scott Palmer on the memorial cairn outside the regiment's headquarters. 


Sergeant Wood had served with the 2nd Commando Regiment, the predecessor of the 4th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, 4RAR, for 13 years when he was tragically killed in action as a result of an explosion from an improvised device on Monday, 23 May 2011. Sergeant Wood was also the holder of the Medal for Gallantry and he had stood up against evil on tours to Bougainville in 2000, East Timor in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. In addition, he served on no fewer than three tours of Afghanistan. 


As the English philosopher Edmund Burke once famously said, 'All that is needed for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.' Sergeant Brett Wood was one of those good men, someone who was prepared to make a stand against evil—a stand for which he gave his life. And today our hearts go out to his wife, Elvi, his family, his entire regiment, his mates and his friends as they grieve his and our nation's great loss. It is worth remembering the evil that Sergeant Brett Wood was fighting against: the Taliban and the sponsors of international terrorism. Throughout history there have been many evil regimes but few as evil as the Taliban. This is a group that has used children with Down syndrome and mentally impaired women as suicide bombers to kill civilians and spread terror. This is a group that has brainwashed and coerced children as young as nine to strap explosive devices to their bodies and blow themselves up in crowded marketplaces. This is a group that turned the dusty, dried-out football field of Kabul stadium into a killing field where black-turbaned Taliban would force men and women to kneel prior to being publicly executed, or where they would amputate limbs for crimes ranging from robbery to adultery and then hang the severed arms or legs from the goalposts for all to see. This is a group that deliberately destroyed one of the great architectural relics of the world, the Buddhist statues at Bamyan. This is a group that subjects women to oppression and violence and denies them education. This is a group that seeks to deprive people of the joys of music and it even bans the innocent practice of kite flying. This was the evil that Sergeant Brett Wood was making a stand against.


And he was making a difference. The Afghan nation is making progress. Kabul stadium is now covered with green grass and residents now go there to cheer their favourite local soccer teams. Schools are being built and girls are now receiving education. Sport, including the game of cricket, is growing in popularity not only amongst men but also amongst women. For example, more than 100 young women are currently playing cricket in Kabul and the Afghanistan Cricket Board is about to create a national women's cricket team. Construction of the Kabul National Cricket Stadium is almost complete and the renovated stadium will serve as the main hub for hosting both domestic and international events, and it will accommodate more than 6,000 cricket fans. It is a project that will enhance the lives of Afghanistan's young people through sport. One of the reasons that this progress was being made was that men like Brett Wood were prepared to stand up against such evil by being ready, willing and able to fight.


A test of a person's character is what their mates think of them. As his mates from the 2nd Commando Regiment said at their farewell, Brett was a man amongst men, a soldier's soldier, an outstanding leader, a great mate, a loving husband, and courageous and professional to a fault. Sergeant Wood is also remembered by our American friends and allies for his actions in 2006 that earned him the Medal for Gallantry. The citation states:


On the 17th of July 2006 during Operation PERTH, the Commando Platoon was tasked to conduct the clearance of an Anti Coalition Militia sanctuary in the Chora Valley, Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan.


The Platoon was partnered in support of an Infantry Company of the United States Army 10th Mountain Division.


At approximately 1pm, the Infantry Company came under heavy rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire on multiple flanks, resulting in six wounded and one soldier killed in action, effectively halting their advance.


Through thick vegetation, facing large numbers of dispersed Anti Coalition Militia and under heavy fire, the Commando Platoon commenced manoeuvring to provide assistance to the element which was pinned down.


During this move, the Commando Platoon received a volley of four rockets which impacted in the centre of the platoon’s position, resulting in six Australian soldiers wounded in action, a loss to the platoon by one third of its force.


Unknown to the Commander at the time, Corporal Wood had also been wounded in the foot by fragmentation from the rocket-propelled grenade barrage.


In order to regain the initiative, Corporal Wood’s team was tasked by the Commando Platoon Commander to assault forward and clear a group of compounds from which they were receiving Anti Coalition Militia fire.


Under these daunting conditions, Corporal Wood commenced this task without hesitation, completing a rapid and aggressive clearance of numerous threat compounds.


Once achieved, both the United States and Australian elements were free to continue with the battle, providing the necessary time to effect the back loading of the wounded by helicopter to the Forward Operating Base.


Throughout the afternoon, numerous and relentless probing attacks by a determined opponent followed.


Corporal Wood displayed extraordinary leadership and courage, inspiring his team and the remainder of the Commando platoon to repel the continued attacks.


He then successfully led a marksmanship team to infiltrate the Anti Coalition Militia-held territory, killing seven Anti Coalition Militia.


Only after the engagement had been completed and the threat to the platoon subsided did Corporal Wood inform his Commander of the fragmentation wound that he had sustained during the original contact earlier that day.


Corporal Wood was then evacuated to the Casualty Collection Point where he was provided with medical treatment and later extracted.


Corporal Wood’s actions on the 17th of July 2006, as a Commando Team Commander during Operation PERTH, were testament to his leadership, fortitude and sense of duty to his team and the platoon.


His determination to continue to lead his team during the battle in extremely hazardous circumstances despite being wounded ensured that the Commando Platoon regained the initiative and contributed significantly to a decisive victory.


His gallantry and leadership in the face of the enemy has been of the highest order and in keeping with the finest traditions of Special Operations Command Australia, the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force.


Even the US mourns his loss. The US Ambassador to Australia recently said:


He fought bravely as part of our common mission to eliminate terror from the lives of the Afghan people to restore their home to them and to ensure that our own nations are safe.


Sergeant Brett Wood was a man of honour. He was killed leading his unit from the front, as he always did. He made a real difference. The world is a better place for the way he served our nation, with distinction and courage. He will always have the gratitude of this parliament and the nation. Vale Sergeant Brett Wood.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (17:11):  I rise to speak on the condolence motion for Sergeant Brett Wood. I start by offering my most sincere sympathy to his wife, Elvi, his parents, his family and his 2nd Commando Regiment. Brett has been acknowledged as one of our most decorated soldiers who was serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan when he was killed in action as a result of an improvised explosive device. I would also like to pass on my thoughts and prayers to the two commandos from the 2nd Regiment who were seriously wounded in the same incident in Kandahar.


I also acknowledge Major-General Angus Campbell, who travelled from Al Minhad base to Tarin Kowt to accompany Brett back from the war zone. I met Major-General Campbell recently during a parliamentary visit to Afghanistan. I know that his thoughts, his memories and his grief during that trip will stay with him all his life. I am aware of just how much he respects and cares for each of those fine young men. The crew of the Hercules and Brett's comrades on board would have stayed with Brett's casket right through that repatriation journey. What a tough flight that would have been, but how privileged they would have felt to bring the body of this warrior, their mate, back. They would not have wanted to be anywhere else but with him at that time.


Brett was 32 years old and had significant operational experience in Bougainville, East Timor and Iraq. He was serving his third deployment in Afghanistan. His Special Operations Task Group commander described Brett as 'a man amongst men, a soldier's soldier, an outstanding leader, a great mate, a loving husband, courageous and professional to a fault'.


Elvi Wood, his wife, released a statement dedicated to her soul mate and friend. She said:


Brett was extremely proud to be part of the 2nd Commando Regiment and he considered many of his colleagues to be his second family. He was an excellent soldier, a true leader and a friend to all in his unit.


Elvi described Brett as 'a much loved son, grandson and brother who inspired his family with his dedication and generosity'. Really, this tells us all just how much Brett was loved and respected. It also tells us that he will live on in the hearts and minds of his family and friends, such as those with the Special Operations Task Group, who were immeasurably blessed to have Brett in their lives.


Elvi recognised her time with Brett as the happiest of her life. I will conclude with the words of Elvi Wood. She said:


Brett, you have done your country proud and you will always be remembered. 


Lest we forget.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (17:15):  Along with others, I would like to offer my sympathy at the death of Sergeant Brett Wood and express my condolences to his wife, Elvi, and his family, friends and comrades. As others have said, Elvi has described Brett as a much loved son, grandson and brother, who inspired his family with his dedication and generosity.


We know that operational deaths are felt deeply across the wider Defence family and, I think, across the wider community. But I think it is important that we let the fine men and women of the Australian Defence Force know that our thoughts are with them during events like this—at this time of sorrow and mourning. I think it is also important that we acknowledge the five young Australians who were wounded in incidents in Afghanistan on the day of Sergeant Wood's death and wish them a speedy recovery.


I rise in parliament for the third time this year to express my sympathy at the death of an Australian soldier. That mere fact and the fact that we are here today underline the dangerous nature of the mission that our troops face in Afghanistan. This is further underlined by the more recent reporting of two more deaths in Afghanistan of brave Australian soldiers. On this day I also remember the family and friends of Corporal Richard Atkinson and Sapper Jamie Larcombe, the brave men killed in action earlier this year.


Sergeant Brett Wood was serving, as we know, with the Special Operations Task Group when he was tragically killed in action by an IED on Monday 23 May 2001 Afghanistan time. We know he was born in Ferntree Gully in 1978 and joined the Army in 1996. After recruit training he joined the 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment. He then undertook the quite rigorous entry requirements for commando selection and training and joined the then 4th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, 2nd Commando, in November of 1998. He was just 32 at the time of his death, with much more to live for.


During his service in the Australian Army, Sergeant Wood deployed on the following operations—Operation Bel Isi II in Bougainville in 2000, Operation Tanager in East Timor in 2001 and Operation Falconer in Iraq in 2003. He was also deployed in Operation Slipper in Afghanistan three times—that is, he had three deployments to Afghanistan in 2006, 2009 and 2011. He was not only a professional digger with significant operational experience but also a much decorated soldier. He was awarded the Medal for Gallantry for leadership in action as a team commander during his 2006 tour of Afghanistan.


It is worth explaining and noting why Sergeant Wood was awarded this Medal for Gallantry. On 17 July 2006, during Operation Perth, the commando platoon was tasked to conduct the clearance of an anti-coalition militia sanctuary in the Chora Valley in Afghanistan. The platoon was partnered in support of an infantry company of the United States Army 10th Mountain Division. At approximately 1 pm, the infantry company came under heavy rocket-propelled grenade fire and small arms fire on multiple flanks, resulting in six wounded and one soldier killed in action, effectively halting their advance. Through thick vegetation, facing large numbers of dispersed anti-coalition militia and under heavy fire, the commando platoon commenced manoeuvring to provide assistance to the element which was pinned down. During this move the commando platoon received a volley of four rockets which impacted in the centre of the platoon's position, resulting in six Australian soldiers wounded in action—a loss to the platoon of one-third of its force.


Unknown to the commander at the time, Corporal Wood, as he then was, had also been wounded in the foot by fragmentation from the rocket-propelled grenade barrage. Corporal Wood's actions as a commando team commander during Operation Perth were testament to his leadership, fortitude and sense of duty to his team and the platoon. His determination to continue to lead his team during the battle, despite his wound and in extremely hazardous circumstances, ensured that the commando platoon regained the initiative and contributed significantly to a very decisive victory. His gallantry and leadership in the face of the enemy was of the highest order and in keeping with the finest traditions of Special Operations Command Australia, the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force.


He was also recognised for his work back in Australia, receiving a Special Operations Command Australia commendation for service with the Tactical Assault Group (East) in 2007. Sergeant Brett Wood was also awarded the Australian Active Service Medal with clasps for East Timor, International Coalition against Terrorism and Iraq 2003; Afghanistan Campaign Medal; Iraq Campaign Medal; Australian Service Medal with clasp for Bougainville; the Australian Defence Medal; the United Nations East Timor Medal; the NATO ISAF Medal; the Unit Citation for Gallantry and the Infantry Combat Badge. He was also posthumously awarded the newly instituted Counterterrorism and Special Recovery clasp to the Australian Service Medal, and the Defence Long Service Medal at his repatriation ceremony in Sydney on Monday. 


At Sergeant Wood's return to Australia at a ramp ceremony at RAAF Base Richmond, the Chief of Army said, 'Army has lost an incredibly talented and truly courageous soldier, and his wife has lost a very loving husband.'


Sergeant Brett Wood died serving his country and is owed an enormous and special debt of gratitude that, of course, we can never repay. He has followed a noble path which has been trod by so many before him. He pulled on the uniform of the Australian Army, as many others have done. He did that and he did what was asked of him by the Australian government. 


As Major General Gilmour, Special Operations Commander, said, and this has already been quoted: 'Sergeant Wood epitomised the values of courage, dedication to duty, loyalty and mateship.' He secured our nation on our behalf. He served as an Australian soldier. I think that, as we continue to do these things, it is very, very important that we recognise what this really means. Anyone who puts on one of these uniforms puts themselves in a position where they too could be in the position of Brett Wood. They put themselves in a position where they can ultimately be in danger in a war action and be killed or wounded, and they do it on our behalf. So those of us who sit here in Parliament House, in our neat suits and lovely ties or beautiful dresses, need to understand that these people are fighting for us. They are down and doing it dirty. And when they do that, when they put themselves in harm's way in the way that they do, they do that for all of us. We must give them thanks for all of that work. This morning I met with a number of Australian wounded diggers—people who have been casualties of the wars that we have fought. To see the courage of these men who have come back from battle, to be in rehabilitation recovering from terrible injuries, and to see the courage they have shown not only in the adversity they have conquered but in seeing their lives before them, we can have nothing but admiration for those people. Sergeant Brett Wood epitomised the courage of Australian men and women in uniform, and for that we thank him. 


I acknowledge all of those who have spoken in this discussion—it is hardly a debate—because it is important that we recognise, as I have done, that across the parliament there is unanimous support for the work of our soldiers in Afghanistan. We need to ensure that they understand that our support is ongoing and that the sacrifices of people such as Sergeant Brett Wood are not in vain. Lest we forget.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (17:26):  It is a privilege to stand in this chamber and acknowledge Sorry Day. It is surprising how one little word—the word 'sorry'—in any context can heal the hurt and re-establish a relationship of trust and respect. An individual's psyche changes from one of pain to one of being valued. Sorry Day is an opportunity to celebrate the apology delivered by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on 13 February 2008, when he finally uttered the words that many across this great nation of ours had waited for. Before I cite his words, let me say that it was probably one of the defining speeches in the Australian parliament. It was a speech that transcended the politics of a party and in fact represented the views of the members of the House—whilst there were some who dissented. It conveyed to all Australians the genuine sense that Australia had reached a watershed level of acknowledging an aspect of our history. To that extent, the importance of the member for Griffith's speech on that day will, I think, be etched in the minds of many Australians—both Indigenous and non-Indigenous—and will not be forgotten. The Prime Minister said:


For the pain, suffering and hurt of these Stolen Generations, their descendants and for their families left behind, we say sorry.


To the mothers and the fathers, the brothers and the sisters, for the breaking up of families and communities, we say sorry.


And for the indignity and degradation thus inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture, we say sorry.


We the Parliament of Australia respectfully request that this apology be received in the spirit in which it is offered as part of the healing of the nation.


The work of the healing of this nation has taken a leap forward, but it is far from over and there is still much to be done. When you consider the context of the speech and what was derived from that speech, the passion and the drive of an individual within the parliament in a leadership role probably shifted Australia's psyche considerably to one of compassion, to one of understanding and to one of finally recognising that there is a duality. In a sense we have a duality: a British heritage from the colonisation of the country and also an Indigenous heritage from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who have existed on this land for 40,000 years. We as a nation have never really acknowledged the fact of the duality of both cultures, and yet we seem to separate them at times and look at one as prevailing over the other, depending on which group you belong to. But nevertheless it is about a nation—and Australia is a great nation.


Tom Calma, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, also highlighted the fact that the apology was only just the beginning when he responded to the then Prime Minister's speech. He said: 


This is not about black armbands and guilt. It never was.


It is about belonging …


That devastation cannot be addressed unless the whole community listens with an open heart and mind to the stories of what has happened in the past and, having listened and understood, commits itself to reconciliation.


For today is not just about the Stolen Generations—it is about every Australian.


Sorry Day is a time to celebrate, a time to honour the memory of those who were affected and a time for all of us to commit to working together to change the future. A pivotal foundation stone of the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's speech is:


The truth is, a business as usual approach towards Indigenous Australians is not working. Most old approaches are not working. We need a new beginning—a new beginning which contains real measures of policy success or policy failure; a new beginning, a new partnership, on closing the gap with sufficient flexibility not to insist on a one-size-fits-all approach for each of the hundreds of remote and regional Indigenous communities across the country but instead allowing flexible, tailored, local approaches to achieve commonly agreed national objectives that lie at the core of our proposed new partnership; a new beginning that draws intelligently on the experiences of new policy settings across the nation.


The intent of the 42nd Parliament to set a destination for the nation, to have a clear point to guide our policy, our programs and our purpose, was meritorious and the work has been progressed, but not as far as I would have expected.


I think when we look across the work that was undertaken under his leadership, the COAG reforms with respect to Indigenous affairs focused on some very key and critical areas: health, in terms of life expectancy and infant mortality; education, in academic attainment and pathways that would allow children to acquire literacy and numeracy skills commensurate with those of any child within Australia; and employment, with employment opportunities where Indigenous Australians would take their place in the workforce alongside any other Australian. In the early years, the focus of that work was to look at the first eight years of a life but also to look at mothers in pregnancy to ensure that the birth of a child and birth weight were of a quality that meant that the child born had a good foundational start to life. That intent was committed to and put into place and it came in under the title of Closing the Gap. It contains significant merit within its construct, but the bilateral agreements that impinge on the Closing the Gap strategies that are part of those key planks are also affected by the relationship and the commitment of various jurisdictions.


But I think the other thing that is more challenging is that Closing the Gap and the strategies around it are not universal. One would think that in a country where there are 800,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who reside in all jurisdictions, we would and should be able to case manage families whose experiences leave them challenged in the context of both social deprivation and the underlying social determinants in life. We should be far more effective in the implementation. I want to put this proposition. If we had 800,000, we would have to take one quarter of those 800,000. That top quartile will be those employed in good positions, would be part of the Australian workforce and would have the same success rates and achievements across the continuum of life that gives benefit to quality of life, good health, good education, good employment and career path opportunities. 


But the other side to that is that the other three quartiles, 600,000, require degrees of intervention, and I use the word 'intervention' in terms of support, in order to bring them to a point where their place within Australian society would in the decade reach a point where they are commensurate or very close to that of any other Australian. One of the challenges in the Close the Gap strategy is that they are targeted. I know that in my own home state when I was involved in the process five targeted communities formed the basis of the early years initiatives, which meant that all those outside those communities did not get the same intensity of support and the preventive measures that were identified within those strategic approaches. It means we also have the challenge of people living within capital cities and large urban settings not having access to the services that we sometimes assume they have. One of the sad facts that still prevails is that racism is an issue we have not fully grappled with in this country, and this parliament has had a debate on the issue in recent times. 


There is also a sense that, when you do not have the level of education, you do not have not so much the strength of character but the confidence to challenge those who are far more articulate in language than somebody who does not purport to be. The classic example of this is that when any of us go to a doctor and a doctor prescribes and tells us what our symptoms are then we accept in absolute terms that description of our illness. In Australian society we make an assumption that standard Australian English is equally understood by every Australian. But it is an assumption that we should not make, because the levels of acquisition of literacy vary substantially. If we look at the NAPLAN results and look at what is on the My School website, we can see the variations demographically, and we can certainly see them by socio-economic status. So there are some challenges in how we use the foundation stone of the apology to still lever the changes that are required in this country.


I think the other part is that we have to change the way in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people become proactive participants in the partnerships with governments and their instrumentalities, that is the agencies, and not be passive recipients. When we sit in committees or in organisations then we come to those tables with an equal understanding to a high degree. We have an understanding of those who sit opposite us so that when we renegotiate we have got some common understanding. We have access to information that makes it very easy to accept the way in which we negotiate. We also know that if we have outcomes then we want to work to win-win situations, not win-lose or win-plus versus win-minus. So those negotiations are absolutely critical. When I was working in Sydney I spoke to a colleague in the private sector and said, 'If you are doing a takeover of a company or you are making a major change in the relationship with another group that is a competitor, how do you go about it?' What he described to me was that whole notion of having equalness in understanding of the parameters in which the negotiations occur, having equalness in terms of the information that you have. And you have the right people at the table. And you make sure that it is a reflection of the corporate companies that are at the table, no different to the way in which we operate within the committee structure of this House. I want to suggest seven simple steps to real engagement for sustainable change based on the work of an author whose book I read on a flight between Sydney and Perth. What I liked about the book was the fact that he talked about human relationships. He also said that if we negotiate then why not share information equally and allow a decision to be arrived at by mutual agreement based on all of the information because you get a better result, you get sustainability and you get the acceptance of responsibility.


When we did the COAG work we worked as jurisdictions. Normally it is the Commonwealth versus the states and territories, but on the Indigenous health one we transcended our jurisdictions, we said, 'Let's identify the responsibilities.' So we identified what the Commonwealth responsibilities would be—and it was not just funding; it was around the way in which Commonwealth agencies that had resources would support the directions we were seeking. Then we identified what the states and territories were responsible for and then we looked at the joint responsibilities. That process enabled us to set a course for the reforms that are occurring—albeit limited by nature of the regions and areas they have selected.


The following are the seven steps that I would suggest, because I think these would make a difference and the Alice Springs setting and context would not be problematic. The first step is in terms of the client. I will use the word 'client' in the context of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We need to understand the community and the problem. We need to understand the problem or the reason that we want change but, equally, we need to ask: what is the implication if we do nothing? In the context of the cornerstone of the member for Griffith's key words, we cannot afford to leave the status quo nor operate within the way of the old.


The second point I would make in the seven-stage process is to clarify and find out what is really going on—what is the reason for the current situation and how do you ensure a community voice is heard in that context? I would equally challenge any member of this parliament, both senators and House of Representatives members, as to how much they really know about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities within their electorates. Indigenous Australians are our constituents but how often do we in this House as individuals engage in order to address the gaps that exist? I think that is something that members of this House, leadership within this country and the agencies involved should do.


My partner had a phone call from Canberra where she was asked about the tri-state region of Western Australia, and it was to do with an aged-care facility. The Commonwealth voice on the phone said to her, 'We want you to do a surprise visit,' and she said, 'Okay; tell me how we are going to do a surprise visit, because we will have to charter a plane and fly over the community and somebody will have to come and pick us up.' The Commonwealth officer said, 'Just get a Budget hire car. When you land, take the Budget hire car or hire car and drive into the community to the nursing home and do a spot check.' It is the reality that communities face, and we have to close that gap.


I think the next step is to make it happen. Is the change negotiated and agreed to by and acceptable to both parties and who will have the necessary power to make the decisions? I do not envy ministers and shadow ministers for Aboriginal affairs, because they carry an extraordinary burden on their shoulders to try to be responsible for the resolution of very complex situations. But they often operate without major portfolio agencies and they have to negotiate with each agency to deliver the types of services within Aboriginal communities. That in itself is challenging, particularly if your colleagues are not walking with you. It is easy to agree to things within a party context or within cabinet but, when it comes to the implementation stage or to make it happen, you then say, 'The minister for Aboriginal affairs can do that; that is part of their portfolio.' We have to change that.


The next step is to confirm: make sure that what we have talked about and what we were going to deliver happens. What processes will be established to have open dialogue on the measures, outcomes and sustainability of achievements? In order to do that we are going to have to make sure that that occurs. Next there is continue: make the change stick. What can be done jointly and singularly to ensure change is achieved and sustaining?


If we combine all of those steps then we should achieve all of those facets and the key elements of the COAG reforms that the previous Prime Minister put into place with his cabinet. We should be seeing achievable gains. Skills development and economic participation are absolutely vital. It should not be left just to the mining or resources sectors. There has to be encouragement across the board, and certainly there is much more to do.


One of the things people on the ground say to me is that they do not want touchy-feely, feel-good approaches, because they never deliver and they continue to fail. We have to make some hard choices, but we also have to be upfront. I reaffirm that all members of this Australian parliament, regardless of their political affiliation, need to genuinely identify the gaps in Aboriginal communities and organisations within their electorates if we are serious as a parliament to the commitment that was made in the 42nd Parliament. Unless we do that we will never know the true extent of the problem. But I also want them to identify the jewels in the crown, because there are things that are working and working well. I believe we should identify those and celebrate them. Remember that it is not the exclusive responsibility of the minister for Indigenous affairs or a shadow minister; it is our collective responsibility.


I again reaffirm that I am extremely grateful for the work of the previous Prime Minister, because he has charted a course that enables all parties in this House and all governments, regardless of who is in power, to take a leadership role, to make a difference and, in two decades, to close not just the gaps but to celebrate the bicultural element of this nation: to acknowledge the British heritage alongside that of the first nations people, who have been here for some considerable time. To that end, I thank the previous Prime Minister for the apology, and certainly I thank the parliament for acknowledging Sorry Day in the parliament last week.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (17:48):  I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land we are gathered on and thank them for their continuing stewardship. While I do so, I am going to make a political statement, and that is to condemn the Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu for deciding to make it an option for his ministers to give that traditional acknowledgement when they speak at public events. Has so big a man ever been so small? I think that is such a small-minded gesture. To balance out that condemnation of the Liberal Premier of Victoria I would like to commend the member for Hasluck for his contribution on the Sorry Day motion and generally for the contribution he has made to harmony and the entire spirit of reconciliation since he came to the parliament. I commend him for that contribution. I just want to give a little bit of background information before I touch on the event that we acknowledged in the parliament last week—I would not say celebrated, but in a way we do celebrate it. I am going to go back to 10 December 1992, and to an inner suburb of Sydney called Redfern, where the new Prime Minister of Australia, Paul Keating, made the following comment in his now famous Redfern speech. It was on the eve of the International Year for the World's Indigenous People, which was the context of the speech. I do not know what went on in former Prime Minister Keating's head at the time, but he made the speech not in the Northern Territory, or North Queensland, or Western Australia, or the Kimberley or somewhere like that, where he could have had Uluru or Kakadu or something like that in the background. He did not go there to make a speech on the eve of the International Year for the World's Indigenous People, instead he went to Redfern—an inner-city location that was a much more significant choice in a way, because that is the reality for so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They are not in Kakadu or the Kimberley, they are actually in an urban environment and coping with different sorts of challenges. This does not diminish the challenges that come with living in a remote community where, as the member for Hasluck says, there is not a Budget hire car and some of the things that we associate with urban environments.


It was also in the context of the Mabo decision having been made on 3 June 1992; this was 10 December 1992, not that long after. And whilst we now accept native title as a fact of life, back then it was a major challenge to be accepted by the hierarchy, I guess you could say—the accepted history and judicial fabrication that this land was developed on. But to the words of Paul Keating:


It will be a year of great significance for Australia.


It comes at a time when we have committed ourselves to succeeding in the test which so far we have always failed.


Because, in truth, we cannot confidently say that we have succeeded as we would like to have succeeded if we have not managed to extend opportunity and care, dignity and hope to the Indigenous people of Australia—the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people.


That speech in 1992 was a great framing process for what happened afterwards. You can go on YouTube and see the speech. You can see different versions of the speech: there is one where it is set to music. It is a great piece of oratory and I think it does work as a bit of poetry as well as oratory. But when you actually see the raw footage, a fair swag of people were heckling him; there was a lot of tension and a lot of people were ignoring him. It was typical of a politician at an event in the park: most people were down the back just having fun with the kids and doing what you do in Australia. You are not really interested in politicians, whoever they are, even if they are a brand-new politician with a vision.


Nevertheless, the words certainly live on and, as I said, they framed an approach to a number of things. There had been a lot of work going on in the few years surrounding that. Prime Minister Keating then commissioned the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families. I think the Attorney-General was a Queenslander at the time, Michael Lavarch, and he established it on 11 May 1995. I would also specially mention the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Robert Tickner, now the head of the Red Cross, who also was a significant player in that process. So we think of that flow of events, from the Redfern speech through to commissioning the national inquiry, and they are quite significant. That inquiry was primarily conducted by Sir Ronald Wilson, the then President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and Mick Dodson, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. But I am also going to take this opportunity to mention the co-commissioners: Annette Peardon, Marjorie Thorpe, Dr Maryanne Bin Salik, Sadie Canning, Olive Knight, Kathy Mills, Anne Louis, Laurel Williams, Jackie Huggins—a great Queenslander and one of my constituents—Josephine Ptero-David and Professor Marcia Langton. The inquiry also benefited from the appointment of an Indigenous advisory council, and there are some names in here that people would recognise: Annette Peardon, Brian Butler, Yami Lester, Irene Stainton, Floyd Chermside, Barabara Cummings, Grant Dradge, Carol Kendall, Lola McNaughton, Isabel Coe, Peter Rotimah, Nigel d'Souza, Maureen Abbott, Margaret Ah Kee, Bill Lowah, Matilda House and Jim Wright—and I will come back to Matilda House later. Seven hundred and seventy-seven submissions were received, and hearings took place in all of the territories. Basically, the commissioners and the co-commissioners went all over Australia to receive evidence.


From there, we flowed to the report actually being presented to the Howard government, as it then was, on 26 May. Since then, we have held National Sorry Day every year on the anniversary of the tabling of the Bringing them home report in parliament. In between times, some other great things have occurred. We have the Stolen Generations Testimonies Foundation, with its 40 oral history testimonies from members of the stolen generations. Apparently, that will be available online from July. We have the National Library of Australia's Bringing Them Home oral history project, an online collection of 191 oral history interviews with people who were involved in or affected by the removal of Indigenous children from their families.


But one of the most significant things to occur was on 13 February 2008. I said earlier that I would return to Matilda House, one of the Indigenous Council Advisory members. I will start with her on 13 February 2008, which was my first day on the job in this House, and the member for Deakin's as well. Before we actually started, we had a welcome to country, performed by Matilda House. I remember it was raining and Parliament House was leaking, in all sorts of ways, and she made a very good joke about that. From there, we moved into the House of Representatives chamber, where then Prime Minister Rudd began the very first order of business of the 42nd Parliament, reading out his own handwritten apology to the forgotten Australians. I want to quote from that apology on 13 February 2008, at 9 am Eastern Standard Time, when Mr Rudd tabled the apology as the first order of business on the opening of Australia's 42nd Parliament. I will not read the entire apology, because it is well known to most of us and also respected as a great piece of literature and oratory at the time—famous throughout the world, in fact—but just some parts:


We the Parliament of Australia respectfully request that this apology be received in the spirit in which it is offered as part of the healing of the nation.


For the future we take heart; resolving that this new page in the history of our great continent can now be written.


We today take this first step by acknowledging the past and laying claim to a future that embraces all Australians.


A future where this Parliament resolves that the injustices of the past must never, never happen again.


That was certainly very well received by both sides of the parliament—I would almost say unanimously. It was supported unanimously. There might have been a few hiccups in the chamber in the process, but in the spirit of the goodwill of this day I would say it was passed unanimously, which was a significant thing. I note that in his response to Prime Minister's National Sorry Day statement, the Hon. Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, said:


I should also acknowledge former Prime Minister Rudd for having the vision to say sorry on behalf of our nation. That was an historic day and we all pay tribute to him for that act of statesmanship.


Those are fine words indeed. I do not say that very often about the Hon. Tony Abbott, but on this occasion I can say that. On that note, I recognise that there is work yet to be done and that, until we actually close the gap, apologies and fine words are only part of the job. There is still a lot to be done before we actually have a nation that is truly reconciled with the strange circumstances that formed it. With that, I commend the statement on Sorry Day to the House.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (18:00):  I rise today to lend my support to this motion and to express my sorrow for what has happened to our Indigenous population in the past. I think it is very befitting that we have the opportunity to continue to reflect on things that occurred in the past, but I think we should also use this opportunity to reflect on where we are today and where we hope to find ourselves in the future. I started to reflect on that, given that I have one of Australia's largest Indigenous populations in my electorate of Leichhardt. I have the home of the Torres Strait people, one of our two Indigenous populations. I also have a very significant, large and diverse Aboriginal population, particularly in Cape York, many of them still living in their own homelands. Sorry Day of course was very significant to these people, as it was to so many other Australians.


I look at Sorry Day and I hear other slogans, such as Closing the Gap, that reaffirm a commitment to our Indigenous people and I think to myself that, if we are going to use this sort of terminology and these sorts of slogans, we seriously have to start to evaluate the outcomes we have set so that it is not just a matter of using hollow words or of standing here in a suit in this place and expressing a particular view by repeating these slogans. We need to look seriously at what we have actually achieved.


I have been very specific and looked at my own electorate. I will start with Cape York. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure you are aware of the debate we have had on wild rivers in recent times. I was living in Cape York when Indigenous people began to recover some of their own country, to get back some of the cattle properties that they either were born on or had a close association with. It has taken a couple of decades, but they have achieved that. They are now one of the largest holders of pastoral leases in Cape York. They are very excited by this fact. A lot of hard work and effort has gone into achieving this. Then they come across governments beholden to rabid green movements who decide that they are going to take away the rights of these landholders and deny them the right of economic development. So there has been a campaign by the overwhelming majority of Cape York Indigenous people to get control of their own land. Unfortunately, governments are so beholden to the Greens and dependent on them for votes that they have walked away from the needs and aspirations of these Indigenous landholders. They are effectively taking away their right to do anything at all on their land.



Mr Craig Thomson interjecting—




Mr ENTSCH:
  It is all right for these people in metropolitan areas who go up there for five minutes and blow their wind in Cape York—they have no understanding of the area. Most of the information they are provided with, as we see from the member for Dobell, would have been provided by the Wilderness Society. He would not have spoken to some of those landholders like Alan Creek, who recently got his country near Coen back, who are very concerned about the impact that that is going to have. The overwhelming majority of Indigenous leaders up there are vehemently opposed to what is occurring at the moment and what is being imposed on them.


I am sorry that they have to continue their battle with government and with bureaucracy as they attempt to have some say in what they can or cannot do on their own land. I am also sorry for the traditional owners and the landholders at the Sherga Air Force base, because this is where the government decided to put a detention centre, and they did not even have the courtesy to talk to these freehold landholders to seek their advice or approval to put a detention centre there. The traditional landholders found out about it in the media—the same as others—even though questions had been asked of the government and of the bureaucracy, and in each case no answers were given. As recently as last week, I got communiques from representatives of the traditional owners, who continue to express their frustration, disappointment and anger at the fact that the government and the bureaucracy continue to make decisions in relation to their land without any consultation whatsoever.


There are other issues that are having a significant impact on the lives of our Indigenous people, and we should be saying sorry for that. There is an organisation called EyeFlight which operates in Northern Australia under the Visiting Optometrists Scheme. Funding for this scheme has been provided in recognition of the fact that eye disease in our Indigenous population is six times more prevalent than in the mainstream population. You would think that this is something we would get behind, support and fund to a point where we could guarantee that we would get outcomes. Two million dollars has been made available to this scheme to cover 32,000 patients per year. You can see that figure is not great in relation to the amount of money that is provided for a very significant service.


Recently, I was talking to the providers of EyeFlight, which operates through the Visiting Optometrists Scheme throughout the Torres Strait and the Northern Peninsula Area. They only go there twice a year. At the moment the organisation receives $88,000 to do two flights per year into the area. At this stage, they are funding from their own resources a shortfall of over $50,000. We are talking about an eye disease that is six times more prevalent in our Indigenous population, and for the sake of a relatively small sum of money we cannot even make sure they have the resources to provide appropriate treatment. I am sorry that we are not able to do that. I have written to the minister and I have asked that he reconsider that.


If we are going to make commitments to programs like the Visiting Optometrists Scheme then we need to acknowledge the fact that we have a very significant problem with eye disease. Surely to goodness, the measure of the success of this program is to reduce that six to one figure to something significantly less than that. Even if it takes additional resources, I believe that it is absolutely appropriate that we do this. There are other issues in the Torres Strait that I would like to raise as well. For example, there are renal units that have been mothballed for many years. There is a high incidence of diabetes throughout our Indigenous population. When I was the member some years ago, I was able to secure funding to build renal units in Weipa, Bamaga and Cooktown to accommodate the need that was there. Unfortunately, after they were built the state government saw fit to close those units down because they did not want to provide the nursing staff necessary to assist. They have relocated families that are reliant on this into Cairns, and some of them have been living in Cairns for up to six years. Lency Stephens is one such person. She has been living in a cheap motel in Cairns for six years while waiting for the perfectly functional renal unit in Bamaga to get a nursing sister there to assist with her dialysis. Late last year Queensland Health committed to reopening the unit by Christmas and the family arranged to go back there. It is now the beginning of June and unfortunately they are no closer to opening that unit. I find that very disappointing, and I think we should be saying sorry to the Cape York communities for not finding the resources to open that unit.


If you go to the hospital on Thursday Island you could describe it as Third World at best. There are some serious infectious diseases in the Torres Strait. In the last 12 months there were outbreaks in our northern neighbour Papua New Guinea, which is only a couple of kilometres away from the islands of Saibai and Boigu. We have seen cholera, encephalitis, tuberculosis and malaria, and yet we do not even have an isolation ward in the Thursday Island hospital to protect our local residents. I think we should be saying sorry about that as well. We should be saying sorry for the fact that a hospital that was built to last 10 years has been there for 13 years and is starting to fall down around their ankles. There is not even appropriate accommodation for the nursing staff to provide necessary services. I think we should be not only saying sorry but also providing the resources to ensure that the health of our Indigenous people, particularly of those in the NPA and Torres Strait community, is protected.


Another good example up there which we need to say sorry for is in relation to how we deal with those who are deceased. In the clinics it has built right throughout the Torres Strait Islands, Queensland Health has provided rooms that can be used as temporary mortuaries. Unfortunately, through budget restraints, it has not been able to equip them with the necessary refrigeration to make them work. So for a whole series of islands across the Torres Strait there is only one functional mortuary, which is on Darnley Island. There is another standalone one on Badu Island which does not meet any of the standards and is not likely to remain open. This means that any deceased person from any of the outer islands has to be brought back to Thursday Island to be prepared for burial and taken back. For these low-income families it costs $12,500 to $13,000 to have their deceased loved one ferried back to Thursday Island for preparation. The Thursday Island mortuary is in the process of being closed down and they are going to replace it with a refrigerated shipping container. Quite frankly, I do not think this is the sort of respect that we should be showing for those loved ones who have passed away in these areas. I believe this is another area where, rather than saying sorry, I would suggest very strongly that we do something to make sure that this is addressed. Another thing we should be apologising for is the fact that we have taken away the Navy presence from up there. They have pulled out the immigration boats and the Customs boats and they have recently pulled out the Navy boats and actually taken the Navy people away. We are a seafaring people, and this is one of the only international borders, and they have shut this facility down, leaving our borders up there totally exposed. This is another area where we should be not only saying sorry but looking at recommissioning it.


I could go on. There are a lot of issues which I believe that, rather than saying sorry, we should be looking to fix. Some $22 million is needed to repair the seawalls in the outer islands of the Torres Strait. I was up there just before Christmas. It was gut-wrenching to walk with the community down to their cemetery and find that half of it had been washed out into the ocean. It is a $22 million project to do the seawalls on six islands. It is very doable, and the proposal has been around for a long time, but the only solution we have had so far is $400,000 to continue to measure the tidal surge. That does not help the families of those whose tombstones and deceased relatives have already washed out to sea. I think this is an absolute disgrace and needs to be addressed.


So if we are going to start talking about sorry—and it is something I absolutely believe in and am totally committed to—we need to match it with action rather than just words. I say sorry for all of the things that we have not done that are impacting on the lives of Indigenous people today. This is only a very small example of what is out there. By all means let us have a National Sorry Day and be sorry for the past, but what about our treatment of Indigenous people and what we are doing today and tomorrow? Rather than rhetoric, let us measure our real commitment to our Indigenous people by actions and outcomes.

Mr RUDD
 (Griffith—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (18:17):  Sorry Day provides opportunities for us all to reflect upon the past and connect with those who suffered as a result of previous government policies. When I say previous government policies, these are governments of all political persuasions, not just one. Last Thursday I was fortunate to share some time with members of the stolen generation, and their friends, who were in Canberra—Matilda House, Sally Fitzpatrick, Margaret Evans, Maryanne Allan, Siani Jones, Helen Moran, Trish Smith, Ruth Bell, Lester Maher, Peter Beal, Steve Ridgeway, Rebecca Curtis, Sandra Kitchen, Julie Shelley, Aunty Martha, Janet Milera, Lyn Jones, Peter Hawkins, Jenny Carty, Jilpia Jones and Jenny Smith. I asked them a very simple question. I asked them what their experiences have been since the apology was delivered three years ago. Have things improved? What are the challenges they now face? What can be done to continue to improve the lives of our Indigenous brothers and sisters? They told me that the apology was not only for the surviving members of the stolen generations but also for those no longer with us—the mothers whose children were ripped from their arms; the brothers and sisters who never knew of each other; the children who grew up without ever knowing their land, their totem, their skin, their people.


These humble souls spoke quietly at first, telling me of the hurt and suffering they still struggle with every day. They spoke of the loss of family, of closeness, of community and of culture. Their stories began when they were small children, taken from their families, sometimes in the middle of the night, and forced into a strange new world that lasted a lifetime. They were taken from communities across the country and forced into homes thousands of kilometres away from their land. In fact, many of them said to me that, when the whitefellas came, they said this: 'Now we are taking you on a holiday.' The absolute devastation of being 'taken on a holiday' never to see your mother again is something that those of us who are non-Indigenous Australians can barely understand—the depth of the hurt, the pain and the scarring which occurs to such people. They were taken from their communities across the country, forced into homes thousands of kilometres away from their land. Through their tears they shared the challenges that we as a nation face in making things right and the importance of supporting the work of healing services offered through Link Up, the Healing Foundation and the many other terrific organisations at work out there in the Indigenous communities of Australia. They spoke of the urgency with which we must act to ensure that the work of these fantastic organisations can continue. They expressed the need for understanding and compassion for members of the stolen generations and their families. They said that what happened must never be forgotten, that we must always remember the hurt and suffering that was inflicted upon these First Australians.


Their decision to share with me their stories was their way of making sure that I could walk away from our gathering with a better sense of where to go from here and that as a whitefella I could begin to understand the importance of what lies ahead and that, while the apology has invoked a tremendous healing process, the journey towards reconciliation has only just begun. But it has begun. They also spoke of their vision for the future—one in which we all can come together to honour our differences, share our struggles and celebrate our successes.


Joining me for this special Sorry Day event was the Koori Mail. The Koori Mail is proudly 100 per cent Indigenous owned and funded and is a true Aboriginal success story. With more than 90,000 readers every fortnight, it is regarded as the voice of Indigenous Australia. The Koori Mail is one of the most important sources for Indigenous people to share their stories, connect with their communities and bridge the gap between what we see in the mainstream media and what is really happening in our communities. I thank the Koori Mail for attending the event and am sure that, like me, they recognise that closing the gap is the beginning of this very long journey.


Fourteen years ago the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report, Bringing them home, was tabled in this parliament, providing a blueprint for this journey. Dr McKendrick assisted in the writing of the report and found that:


… when Aboriginal people (who were removed) come to have their own children, they've really got no idea how to parent in either the conventional Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal way … so their children are very often removed from them (by welfare agencies) which sets up this terrible cycle which goes on for generations.


The findings showed that much needed to be done to repair the damage caused to Indigenous Australians since settlement and that, if the intergenerational psychological scarring inflicted on the stolen generations was ignored, the cycle of disadvantage would continue. A healing process therefore needed to begin.


One of the key recommendations of the Bringing them home report was for an official apology to be given by the governments of Australia. Every state and territory leader delivered a formal apology in the late 1990s. But a gap remained. As the late and great Rick Farley argued, 'Until the community has a common understanding of what has occurred in the past, there is no foundation for moving ahead together.' There needed to be an acceptance by the wider community that Indigenous Australians were the traditional owners of the land, that the British came and colonised the continent, that atrocities such as those endured by the stolen generations took place and that Indigenous Australians still suffer severe levels of disadvantage.


The apology gave us the opportunity to do that. In the lead-up to the 2007 election, I promised that, if Labor were elected, I would apologise to the stolen generations. I said sorry on 13 February 2008. This was an important day for all of us. I am pleased that it was an important day in the lives of so many people around the country. Since then, the government has used the momentum of the apology to kick-start a comprehensive agenda to improve the lives of our nation's first people.


Closing the Gap is based on six targets and the Australian government has implemented programs to decrease the gaps that exist. The first target is closing the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a generation. Under the federal government, expenditure on Indigenous-specific health programs has increased by 87 per cent to almost $1.2 billion since 2007-08. Some $58.3 million has been allocated over four years to deliver a major increase in services to address trachoma with the expansion of the Visiting Optometrists Scheme. These changes to Aboriginal life expectancy must be measured into the future so that we can judge the extent to which we are succeeding or the extent to which we are not.


The second target is halving the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under the age of five by 2018. Between July 2008 and June 2010, children in remote Northern Territory communities and town camps received nearly 8,000 dental services, 4½ thousand audiology services and 3,000 ear, nose and throat services. The government will also be delivering new and expanded maternal and child health services and more access to antenatal care. Once again I sound a note of warning: let us wait for the figures to come in to see if these mortality rates for little children under the age of five across Indigenous Australia do in fact come down. This again must be the subject of rigorous measurement.


The third target is to ensure access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities by 2013, with $970 million being invested to reach this goal. Progress has been made, with enrolment rates for Indigenous children in New South Wales increasing from 79 per cent to 88 per cent in one year. That is not insignificant. That is an important step forward. The Australian government is investing $59.4 million to improve the quality of 140 early childhood services, including approximately 100 Indigenous services. Again, we need to see the measurements to ensure that we are in fact realising that gap concerning the provision of early childhood education for littlies under the age of four in Indigenous communities. 


Target No. 4 is to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievement for Indigenous children by 2018. The government is assisting schools to expand intensive literacy and numeracy approaches that have previously been successful with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, with $54.6 million over four years. Once again, we wait for the measurements to come in. The inputs are there. Let us measure the outcomes when they are there for the whole community to be seen. 


The fifth target is to halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020. The government is providing $2.6 billion through the Smarter Schools National Partnerships. The government has invested record amounts in education and it is starting to pay off, with school attendance in Aurukun increasing from an average attendance rate of 37 per cent in July 2009 to 63 per cent in July 2010. Again, this is a good number. It reflects measureable progress. What we do need to see, however, is how this is reflected across Indigenous communities throughout the nation.


Finally, target No. 6 is to halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians by 2018. The government has implemented reforms to employment programs so that more Indigenous people can gain employment. Since 1 July 2009, more than 28,750 Indigenous Australians have been placed into employment by Job Services Australia. 


The apology was a first step towards reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Much has been achieved since then, but there is still much to be done, including the recognition of Indigenous peoples in the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. It has instilled upon future generations an ongoing commitment to justice for Indigenous Australians. Specific, detailed reporting will hold the nation accountable for reaching our targets in the future. It will guide us as a nation as we continue to work together, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to close the gap. 


As I met with these representatives of the stolen generations only a few days ago in this, the parliament of the Commonwealth, it was a moving experience listening, one by one, to each member of the stolen generations as to what had happened to them over the last three years. I wish I could stand here and say before the parliament that it has all worked really well. The truth is that it has not in all cases. That is the truth. Not one of them, however, said that the apology was not important to them; it was. Since that time it has opened up new possibilities and new hopes but has also created some new challenges. 


Think of this for a moment, those of us who do not come from Indigenous Australia: if you have been physically removed from a member of your family for 20, 30 or 40 years and are reintroduced for the first time, how do you pick up the traces again? How do you really pick up the traces again? How do you really establish contact again? How do you really forge an emotional bond again? What has happened in those respective lives over that intervening 40-year period? One by one, I heard these stories about how difficult and painful that road has been. The other thing I heard very clearly was the importance of services like Link-Up being able to stay with these folk of the stolen generation into the future and to have the resources to support them once contact has been established. If you look across the sheer numbers and the physicality of those whom we call the stolen generation we are talking about tens of thousands of our Aboriginal brothers and sisters. And if you begin to think of the case management of this through Link-Up Australia, it is a phenomenal task—that is, for a case management officer to attach themselves to a member of the stolen generation, often with very few research tools, and then commit themselves to walking with that person through a very difficult evidentiary process to establish who the family was, where they have gone and often, worst of all, whether they have died in the meantime. This takes time, energy and resources. I know the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, is working hard on how to make sure that Link-Up is properly resourced into the future so it is able, first of all, to manage the caseload, the sheer numbers of people who still have not had the link re-established.


Then there is a second point. Think about this by putting yourselves into the circumstances of one such person. You are in Melbourne. You have discovered that you have a living relative—a brother, a sister, even a mother or a father—in Perth. You are flown to Perth, where the arrangements have been made to link up after 20, 30, 40 years or sometimes half a century. That occurs, and the difficulties and the joy, the mixture of both that I described before, all unfold; they all happen. What do you do then? It is pretty hard, because our Indigenous brothers and sisters are often living in pretty difficult financial circumstances. So how do you then sustain that contact into the future? What are the mechanisms to provide that ongoing support? If we as a nation have a genuine debt of responsibility towards these for whom successive parliaments—of all political persuasions, state and federal, over the generations—have acted in the people's name in removing the stolen generation, then what do we do at least to make sure that these bonds, once established and often fragile, are sustained? That is a second practical problem which the good folk at Link-Up are having to wrestle with.


I am not for a minute beginning to pretend that any of this is easy for that wonderful band of people at Link-Up who are doing the absolute best they can. But we are dealing with very damaged lives and very damaged souls. It is very important therefore that, in the spirit in which the apology was delivered, it is not just words, it is deeds; that we make sure that what we have committed to we then, in fact, do; and that we stay with these most wounded Australians until healing does occur for as many of them as is possible.


As we reflect on National Sorry Day and where we have come from, there are so many good things to talk about. There are so many things that we do not know because we cannot yet measure them. But for each of these lives, at a very personal and individual level, let us reflect on how hard each of those journeys is and on what we can still do as a civilised and caring community to support these, our brothers and sisters, on their path to healing.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2011-06-01,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (18:33):  I too wish to rise to acknowledge Sorry Day, which was last week. I had the privilege of growing up in northern Victoria surrounded by the physical evidence of the traditional owners in that part of the world, the Dja Dja Wurrung. Unfortunately, there were no people left; just the kitchen middens, the scarred trees, some spearheads and so on. So I have to say that, growing up as a fifth-generation on that property, I was conscious of the original owners but knew nothing about them. I think that is pretty typical of a lot of people in Australia today. While 'sorry business' became part of the Australian lexicon, I believe a lot of people still do not understand and there is a lot of confusion. I also had the privilege of being on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation for a number of years as we tried to bring forward a document that would encapsulate exactly what Australians needed to know and understand and how we were to be reconciled. That was a very important document and I do not think we refer to it enough today or look back at the words that were crafted at that time. I want to begin by talking about 1788, when the huge fleet of over 2,000 souls arrived in the Port Phillip-Botany Bay area under the guidance of Captain Phillip, an amazing man, who bore with him instructions from the British Admiralty. Those instructions said that he was to deal with the natives, as they were called at the time, in a way that was kind—the actual words were 'kindness and amity'. There was a bit of an undercurrent running through the instructions along the lines that, if they were dealt with kindly, they may be found to be of use to the new colony. Certainly they might be able to supply information which could be of great use in understanding what the resources of this new country were.


But you can imagine the impact the 2,000-plus British convicts, soldiers and a few free settlers had on the very small nation of owners of that country, only numbering several hundred, who very quickly saw their food supplies run down. Fish stocks were very quickly depleted by the use of the colonists' nets. The kangaroos were very quickly driven away. The birds, especially the water birds, were very quickly out of the reach of the traditional owners with their traditional hunting methods. Even access to the Tank Stream, which had been critical to the original owners, was severely restricted. There was no understanding at that first settlement that the Indigenous Australians, the local owners, could not simply fall back a little way towards the Blue Mountains and beyond once it became obvious there was not enough food to share with those hungry mouths, those starving new arrivals. 


Then very quickly there was despair when the settlers saw so many of the traditional owners of the area falling sick and dying. There were a lot of early descriptions of the caves full of the dead and dying Aboriginal people with smallpox scars covering their bodies. It is a very sad thing to read those early documents. I spent several years researching these periods and producing a documentary history—which alarmed me because by the time I produced it I had already completed an anthropology degree specialising in traditional Australian culture, but I had not until then learned about how the transition occurred from traditional Australian culture to the time of fringe dwelling, extreme poverty, sickness and despair that is the lot of so many Aboriginal Australians today. I think every Australian, at the time of Sorry Day, should check their own knowledge of our Australian history. 


We need to go back and understand that too many of the things that happened to Australia's original owners were the result of policies which were well meaning, were philanthropic in intent at the time, but which had the most dire consequences for the people. I will mention, for example, the protectorate system in Victoria. When the settlers in Victoria were pushing so hard into all of the pasture lands and the water supplies to settle their sheep and their beef cattle, which were protected by the convicts assigned to them, it became a case of frontier war with the local Aboriginal people. This was particularly so in Gippsland, where the forest cover made it very hard for the new settlers to win those skirmishes. They quickly found that, if an Aboriginal person was in heavily timbered country and the pursuers on horseback had to get off their horses, it became an equal fight. Too often the traditional owners won those skirmishes and that eventually led to the protectorate system—but before that, in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, it led to a native police system. 


There were royal commissions that looked at the native police, particularly in Queensland in the 1830s, and what they found was that this was a force which was under white leadership, under white officer direction, but which was not to have written instructions. It was to respond to pastoralists who called for protection of their livestock due to depredations, incursions or attacks on that livestock from the local Aboriginal peoples. When someone had a few cattle speared or had a few sheep speared or just had livestock under threat—perhaps there were individuals involved in hand-to-hand combat—then the native police would be called up. They consisted of Aboriginal troopers. Many of those troopers had been in the prisons under charges of assault or even murder. They were put into a uniform and told that if they went out and joined the native police force, they would be free men—they would be given a rifle and a horse and the spoils of their activities would be theirs. They referred to the outcomes of those contacts with the traditional peoples charged with stealing livestock or worse as 'dispersal'. The official title of those activities was 'dispersals', typically carried out at dawn or dusk in the form of raids. According to the documentation at the time, those who survived the dispersals—and I mean that literally—moved themselves to towns or bigger regional centres in an effort to be safer and often to work in the abattoirs or the fishing industry or to get some other job. Those native police were very much a part of the settlement of Australia, but not many people understand why they were formed and how they worked. I have to say that we still need to address the curriculum in Australia to ensure the real Australian history is understood—not to be ashamed of it, not to say it is something that can never be remediated in Australia, but it is important to know the facts about Australian history.


When the protectorates were set up in Victoria, the idea was, again, as the name implies, to give protection to the tribes who remained, but what they in fact did was bring together disparate tribes who spoke different languages and who were traditional tribal enemies. They were brought together and contained in, or confined to, small areas under the control of a person employed by the colonial government. They were not allowed to speak their own languages and their children were required to go to school. There was no employment for anybody. And, because the remnants of the different tribal groups were pushed together onto these protectorates, you can imagine how intertribal warfare accelerated, especially when the traditional tribal enemies obtained guns and used them against each other or when there was even more revenge killing than usual because of all the deaths. So the protectorates, far from giving protection to the remnants of the Aboriginal tribes in Victoria, hastened their demise and certainly destroyed the remnants of their cultures. I have to say that today it is a sad thing when the Aboriginal peoples in my area strive as hard as they do to try and find some parts of language remaining or to capture from their elders some of the last stories about those earlier periods, because very little was documented at the time for them. There were some photos but not much else survived.


We then get to the stage of the stolen children—that was called a miscegenation policy. The idea was to 'rescue' the children of mixed unions. The idea was that, given they had 'white blood', they 'deserved'—as the documents said at the time—an alternative upbringing and, ideally, could then be trained to work as unskilled labourers on pastoral stations or in laundries and so on, filling a much needed part of the workforce that Australia has always had difficulty filling. That might have worked too; but, unfortunately when you look at where the children were placed—so-called orphanages or compounds where they were supposedly to be educated and supported into this new life—again and again you see from the government records and the Hansards of the day, that those programs were underfunded and badly managed, with often the cruellest people left in charge. There were often triumphs too with very kindly souls, some missionaries, who did very good work. But, when you read time and time again the reports, the annual statements and the press releases, and look at the photos and the health reports of the children in places like the Telegraph Station at Alice Springs or in the Darwin compound in the 1940s, it is quite shocking to see what conditions had to be survived and particularly the lack of respect for the people of mixed descent who, at the time, were called names like octoroons, quadroons and half-castes. There were different policies proposed for those different so-called mixes of blood.


Australia has a very complex past in terms of our race relations. As I said a minute ago, often the policies were aimed at a good outcome for all but too often they were based on wrong assumptions about the dying-out of the traditional owners, and the expectation that Darwin was right and so they said, if you were of a darker colour or a so-called full-blooded Aboriginal, you were therefore one of the lowest orders of human evolution. We have come a very long way, to now be standing in parliament once a year and expressing our sorrow and the fact that we are sorry about that past. But I think that is only the beginning and it is not enough. We have to make sure that every government program, whether it is at the local, state or federal level, actually delivers great outcomes for Aboriginal peoples, is delivered in cooperation with those individuals and is in fact always led, as far as possible, by the Indigenous people themselves. After all, they are members of the longest continuous surviving culture on earth. We have to learn from the Aboriginal peoples now about environmental sustainability. We have to learn about how families in good circumstances can be supportive of one another. But we also have to understand the legacy of generations of oppression, poverty, disease and, more recently, alcohol and drug addiction.


One of the things I want to do most in this parliament now is to address foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or FASD. This is not just an Indigenous problem at all, but a lot of our Indigenous communities have great difficulty now with levels of alcohol consumption. Too often we have children being born with FASD, which leaves the child with permanent brain damage and a lifelong limitation on their opportunities and their chances to reach their full human potential. So there is still a lot of work for us to do in this parliament. It is work we must do with bipartisan support I am very pleased to stand up and support this 'Sorry' motion. I want to make sure that all that I do helps in the future, becauset I am an Australian and every Australian has a responsibility to make sure all Australians, of whatever background, have a fair go.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:47):  During National Reconciliation Week, I think it is appropriate to support this motion. We need to take every opportunity to acknowledge the important contribution that Indigenous Australians have made throughout the history of our country, to acknowledge the important history and the achievements of Indigenous Australians. I also want to take the opportunity to reflect on our history, to express contrition, to say sorry and to reaffirm our commitment to closing the gap—to making sure that we do everything we possibly can to give our brothers and sisters of Indigenous background the same opportunities that those of us not from that background enjoy in our country.


National Reconciliation Week is a very significant week in the life of our country. It is my honour to be the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I will talk in a few minutes time about what we are doing in our inquiry into the incarceration of Indigenous juveniles and young adults.


When I was elected in November 2007, I came to this parliament on the first day, in February 2008, acknowledging that it was our party's policy to say sorry. I knew that was important. Ipswich, where I live, has a very large Indigenous community. In fact, in the whole Ipswich-Logan corridor there is a very large Indigenous community—and great workers. Indeed, the electorate of Blair is named after Harold Blair, an Indigenous opera singer, civil rights campaigner and former Labor candidate who grew up in the Purga Mission south of Ipswich. I pay tribute to the Purga elders who are still there doing good work and the great organisations in my electorate like the Kambu Medical Centre, which provides health services, dental services and a whole range of allied health services to the people of the western corridor and Ipswich. But I did not really realise the implications of saying sorry in my heart. I knew it in my head. I want to pay tribute to the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, now our foreign minister, for expressing on behalf of our country that we are sorry. It was a brilliant and moving speech. I would have to say that, apart from that, the two greatest speeches that I have heard in my lifetime are the 'It's time' speech by Gough Whitlam back in 1972, when I was a young fellow—that was pretty good—and Paul Keating's Redfern speech, which was simply superb. Mr Rudd made his apology speech on 13 February 2008, and it was extraordinary. He acknowledged the mistreatment of the stolen generations, that blemished chapter in our nation's history, and the fact that it was time for our country to turn the page. He apologised for the laws and policies of successive governments which caused profound grief, loss and sorrow, especially the removal of Indigenous children from their mums and dads. He said acknowledgement was the first step towards reconciliation and a future in which the injustices of the past would never be repeated. 


But there could not have been the sorry speech of former Prime Minister Rudd without the sorry speech, if I can put it like that, of Paul Keating. He talked of Australia as 'truly the land of the fair go and the better chance'. He gave that speech in Redfern, which was an appropriate place to do it, on the occasion of the Australian launch, on 10 December 1992, of the International Year of the World's Indigenous People in 1993. He wanted to recognise the plight of Aboriginal Australians, and he said these words, which I think bear repeating:


… the starting point might be to recognise that the problem starts with us non-Aboriginal Australians.


It begins, I think, with the act of recognition. Recognition that it was we who did the dispossessing. We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditional way of life. We brought the disasters. The alcohol. We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practised discrimination and exclusion.


It was our ignorance and our prejudice. And our failure to imagine these things being done to us. With some noble exceptions, we failed to make the most basic human response and enter into their hearts and minds. We failed to ask—how would I feel if this were done to me?


Mr Keating went on to say:


I think what we need to do is open our hearts a bit.


All of us.


You can see what a wonderful speech it was. And the speech of former Prime Minister Rudd could not have happened without that earlier speech.


We must never, ever again pursue policies of discrimination. We must redouble our efforts to close the gap. Two centuries of white settlement have brought great benefit to this country, and we embrace with pride and respect what we have done, but there has also been heartache. We have caused grief and despair and loss—the loss of language and the loss of loved ones stolen away. There are huge gaps between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. There are areas of disadvantage: life expectancy and lifestyle, alcohol and abuse, family violence and foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, education and employment, health and home, and income and incarceration.


It is that last matter, incarceration, that I want to look at for a couple of minutes. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is about to table a report that acknowledges, in the 20 years since the report by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the shameful history under all governments of our record with respect to the incarceration of Indigenous youth and young adults. Prisoner census data shows that, between 2000 and 2010, the number of Indigenous people incarcerated increased dramatically—Indigenous men by 55 per cent and Indigenous women by 47 per cent. It is a sorry state of affairs and, with Sorry Day just past, it is appropriate to acknowledge this shameful state of affairs and commit ourselves to working in partnership with our Indigenous brothers and sisters to close the gap.


I would like to acknowledge a couple of people who came forward to give evidence on the record in the inquiry. There were so many across about 110 submissions and 17 public hearings, including a roundtable in Redfern which was quite poignant and moving. Shane Phillips, from the Tribal Warrior Association in Sydney, is mentoring young men to be productive and strong leaders in their communities. Duncan Smith actually taught the committee a traditional song from his homeland to take to New Zealand when we engaged with the Maori leaders there. He runs an enterprising dance and culture business here in Canberra. But there are so many other notable people and organisations across the country, including in my home state of Queensland, up in Cape York, and in my electorate as well. People involved in mentoring programs, family support, maternal and child welfare and health services, and, I have to acknowledge, the Aboriginal Grannies—they are groups across our country who work at change at a local level. That is why it is so important—because Indigenous women are 35 times more likely to be hospitalised as a result of spouse or partner violence than non-Indigenous women.


Our inquiry heard some pretty shameful statistics about the rates of detention and incarceration. But we heard some inspirational stories as well: people from Indigenous and non-Indigenous backgrounds who are focusing on the future, yet facing the past and trying to move on. We will focus on prevention and early intervention; we will identify strategies to reduce the alarming detention and incarceration rates across the country. Two statistics are most stark to me—the detention rate for Indigenous juveniles is currently 28 times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous juveniles, and for Indigenous adults of 17 to 24 years of age it is 15 times the rate. What a tragedy.


Our inquiry brought together magistrates, state police, NGOs, academics, social researchers, drug and alcohol counsellors, justice organisations and so many others involved in diversion and intervention. The problems surrounding juvenile justice, incarceration and alternative strategies to divert people away from incarceration are very complex and longstanding. But we must harness the knowledge and commitment of all of us, particularly those who work in the field, to bring real change and opportunities for the future.


We in the federal Labor government are committed to finding solutions to reverse the trend of increasing numbers of juveniles and young adults of Indigenous background being entrapped in the criminal justice systems across the country. I am thoroughly offended when I hear law and order campaigns perpetrated and perpetuated by political leaders and parties, particularly at a state level, when they want to simply whip up hysteria in their campaign for votes. This has often resulted in more young people and young adults becoming involved in the criminal justice systems in this country.


We are committed to breaking the cycle of Indigenous disadvantage, intergenerational poverty and the cycle of offending and recidivism. We are committed to increasing educational retention and expanding employment opportunities. We need to provide better homes and better health for Indigenous people across the country, to provide accommodation options for Indigenous young people at risk and after release, and to ensure rehabilitation and appropriate health care.


It is very easy to say sorry. I was not planning to make any political points in this speech but when I heard the member for Leichhardt ranting and raving in his criticism of us, and of the Queensland state Labor government, I have to say that the former Prime Minister John Howard never seemed to be able to say he was sorry. Those words never seemed to pass his lips as he floundered and fumbled on Indigenous issues and affairs. I am proud to say that we did, as the first act that we could undertake legislatively, in February 2008, simply say 'sorry'.


The tears, the pain and the anguish we saw that day was mingled with joy and happiness, relief and elation, not just here but back in our schools, our communities, our business places and our homes. That is a start, and only a start, as we tackle these Indigenous issues. It is appropriate we redouble our efforts to ensure that we do close the gap. It is not just rhetoric. It becomes reality.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:59):  I rise tonight in support of the Prime Minister's statements on National Sorry Day. In doing so I wish to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land we are meeting on, the Ngunawal people. I also wish to acknowledge and pay my respects to their continuing culture and the contribution they make to the life of this city, this region and my electorate. The 26th of May is a very important day for Australia and marks the day when we as a country recognise the wrongs that have been committed to our Indigenous people. It is the day that the Bringing them home report was tabled in this parliament, a report that detailed quite clearly what had occurred to the stolen generation and acknowledged the forced separation of Indigenous children from their families. It was a report that caused more than a few tears to be shed, both in this chamber and across Australia, amongst both the Indigenous community and the non-Indigenous community.


National Sorry Day is about more than simply admitting any personal fault. National Sorry Day is about sending a powerful message that you care about and recognise the hurt that has been caused, irrespective of whether or not you were personally responsible for it. It is a very important symbolic gesture and it occurs at the beginning of National Reconciliation Week, a week that recognises two events: the day when 90 per cent of Australians voted in a referendum to recognise Indigenous Australians as citizens and Mabo Day, which is a day honouring the man who gave a name and a face to the important issue of land rights and recognised the historical and cultural significance this continent has for Indigenous people. 


However, it goes beyond just symbolism to have practical and tangible effects on the community. To this end I was very fortunate to be invited to attend a special assembly last Friday to honour National Reconciliation Week at Richardson Primary School in my electorate. Richardson Primary School has students from all backgrounds, from many diverse communities. It is also a school with a very large Indigenous community. I have been fortunate enough to visit Richardson Primary School on a number of occasions and each time I have been impressed by the inclusive community and the real commitment to learning and to developing and growing the students. This shone through particularly well at this special assembly. I was especially impressed with the work the students had put into message sticks they displayed at the assembly. They were quite large message sticks and they each had little motifs on them of particular cultural significance to the students. The sticks honoured the Indigenous culture and history of the people around Canberra and also the people around Australia.


The students worked on these sticks not just as part of a class activity but also during their lunch hours, which shows true commitment to the importance of reconciliation. They were really into them and they were very proud of them afterwards. The students, already at this young age, had understood that this week is about bringing together Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to share our stories and most importantly to understand each other. It is about recognising the importance of those stories and what each of us individually contributes to our country. Our stories are unique and important, whether we are Indigenous or not. It is particularly important to point out the need for language to continue, because language is essentially what keeps cultures alive. So it is very important that we keep the many Indigenous languages throughout Australia alive and being spoken. As soon as the communities stop speaking them, essentially that little part of the community, that culture, dies. It is very important that we not only keep these stories alive but also keep the language that tells them alive. Sorry Day and Reconciliation Week are more than just symbolic. They are also about ensuring that we as a parliament and a country are bridging the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I would therefore like to use this opportunity to honour the work being done in my electorate by the Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service. Winnunga Nimmityjah was founded in 1988 and has grown into a significant and important Indigenous health provider. It is located in a mad old 1960s or 1970s building in Narrabundah that I think was gifted to the community by the Whitlam government. I have been very fortunate to have visited Winnunga on a number of occasions. One occasion was with Warren Snowdon and Tom Calma to launch a health day for Indigenous communities throughout Australia. 


Winnunga have played a very pivotal role in ensuring Indigenous health in Canberra and the region for many years. In fact, they service not only the community here in Canberra but also around 25 per cent of the region. People come from far and wide to use the services at Winnunga. The services are many and varied. There are dental health services. There are a number of doctors who work there part time, often on a pro bono basis, to help the Indigenous community. They do basic medical checks—such as blood pressure checks and cholesterol checks—and a whole range of things. They also provide diabetes checks, which are particularly important given the incidence of diabetes in the Indigenous community, and they offer physio services. What I was particularly heartened by was the fact that they also offer infant welfare services. Infant welfare services are not structured in the same way that they used to be when my mother used to take my sisters and me to get our needles and have health checks in the 1960s and 1970s. So it was great to see that these services are there to help new mums, particularly new young mums, with advice on infant welfare and to support the mothers in breastfeeding and on a range of other issues.


Speaking about Winnunga, I would also like to acknowledge Dr Peter Sharp. He worked at Winnunga and I just heard last week that he has been diagnosed with cancer and the diagnosis does not look that good. I just want to acknowledge and honour the work he has done for the Indigenous community in Canberra, particularly at Winnunga. He has dedicated his life to helping to improve the health of the Indigenous community. It was tragic news for everyone in Canberra, particularly the Indigenous community and those at Winnunga, to hear that Dr Sharp was suffering from cancer. We wish him well and we wish him a recovery from the illness. It was a deep blow to hear that news last week.


In closing, I would like to say on behalf of the people in Canberra that, when we said sorry, everyone here was absolutely elated. We were very proud of the fact that a Labor government had done it. I think that Canberrans are deeply committed to improving the health, welfare, education and prosperity of the Indigenous community not only here in Canberra but also throughout Australia. It was a great day for all Canberrans. It is also a great honour to be able to acknowledge that day today and speak during National Reconciliation Week.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-06-01,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (19:08):  In speaking to the Prime Minister's statement on National Sorry Day, I begin by acknowledging the traditional owners. I also acknowledge that this week is National Reconciliation Week, as is always the case between 27 May and 3 June. Both dates are significant in our calendar, with 27 May being the date of the 1967 referendum where 90 per cent of Australians voted to give the Commonwealth the power to make laws for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and to recognise them in the national census and 3 June 1992 being the date the High Court delivered its landmark Mabo decision about Aboriginal land rights. National Sorry Day, as other members have said, occurs each year on 26 May. That is the date on which the Bringing them home report, also known as the stolen generations report, co-authored by the late Sir Ronald Wilson and Mick Dodson, was presented to parliament. I had the privilege of inviting Sir Ronald Wilson to the city of Salisbury when I was the Mayor of Salisbury. As part of our Reconciliation Week events, I invited Sir Ronald Wilson to come and address the local community about his report. In fact, I think it was the first public address he made with respect to it after having presented it to parliament. I well recall him describing the emotions he went through and the feelings he had as he was taking evidence from people from around Australia in the preparation of that report. I know how strongly he felt about the issue and the recommendations that he prepared for the parliament.


The report talked about the forced removal of Indigenous people in this country in the period 1909 to 1969. Of course, we know that forced removal of Indigenous people occurred both before and after those dates. Interestingly there were 777 submissions made and, of those, 500 were confidential. The reason they were confidential was that the people who made submissions did not want to talk openly about their experience. They just felt so emotional about it that they were only prepared to make those submissions in confidence to Sir Ronald and those that were with him as part of the inquiry. I remember him making a very strong point about that. 


His final report had some 54 recommendations, which included three key ones that I want to briefly touch on: firstly, that funding should be provided to ensure that the stories and the records of those people were in fact compiled; secondly, that reparations should be made with respect to those people that had been forcibly removed as children; and, thirdly, that the Australian government should issue an apology. As we have heard from other speakers, that was done on 13 February 2008 by the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd. Again as other speakers have mentioned, I think it was a historic day for this nation. I felt very proud to be a member of this House and of the government that provided that apology. It is certainly one of the memorable events in my time since having been elected to this place. 


The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was conducted by Justice Elliott Johnston and concluded in 1991. It is notable that 50 per cent of the deaths investigated by the royal commission related to people who had been removed from their homes. That is an interesting correlation between the two reports. Justice Johnston addressed a community forum in my community on that very topic, and I can recall his personal insight into the inquiry that he conducted. 


The issues of both Aboriginal deaths in custody and reparations bring me to the issue of legal aid for Indigenous people in this country. Aboriginal legal rights services commenced throughout Australia in the early 1970s. The Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement of South Australia commenced on 21 January 1973. These services were essentially established to provide legal support and advice to Aboriginal people for mainstream legal matters—typical civil and criminal matters—but also to provide legal aid for members of the stolen generations. With respect to the need for legal aid assistance to Indigenous people I want to quote a report entitled Issues of equity and access by Professor Chris Cunneen and Melanie Schwartz. The report says:


The difficulties experienced by Indigenous people in their interactions with the criminal justice system have been well documented and are regularly reported upon through the Review of Government Service Provision (Productivity Commission) process. The extent of over-representation of Indigenous prisoners has deepened since the landmark Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1991, and, as the recent 2007 Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage Report noted, ""Indigenous people's involvement with the criminal justice system continued to deteriorate"". Some relevant headline statistics—


and these are critical—


At 30 June 2006—


and I realise that these dates are now a few years old, but I suspect that little has changed—


Indigenous prisoners represented 24% of the total national prisoner population, the highest proportion since 1996. The actual number of Indigenous prisoners at 30 June 2006 was 6,090—a dramatic increase from 3,275 10 years earlier.


Between 2002 and 2006, the imprisonment rate for Indigenous women increased by 34% and for Indigenous men by 22%.


Currently, Indigenous people are 13 times more likely to be imprisoned than non-Indigenous people.


At 30 June 2005, Indigenous juveniles were 23 times more likely to be detained than non-Indigenous juveniles.


In 2002, some 16% of Indigenous people reported being arrested at least once in the previous five years.


The last national police custody survey (2002) showed that Indigenous people comprised 26% of all police custodies in Australia and were 17 times more likely to be held in police custody than non-Indigenous people.


Deaths in custody still occur at unacceptably high levels. Of the 54 deaths in custody in 2005, some 28% involved Indigenous detainees.


There are other matters within that report that I would love to quote, but time will not allow me tonight.


The point I would make about that is that the need for Aboriginal legal aid is clearly evident when you look at those statistics and the court presentations that would flow from them. The issue in respect of the legal assistance to members of the stolen generations was also highlighted on 1 August 2007 when in the South Australian Supreme Court Justice Thomas Gray awarded $775,000 to a person who had been taken from his family. Regrettably, that person, less than a year later, passed away.


I just want to finish on this point, because I note that the member for Lingiari is here and also wants to make a contribution to this debate before our time expires. Both the CEO of the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement, Neil Gillespie, and chairperson of that movement, Frank Lampard, have raised with the government their concerns about the adequacy of Indigenous legal aid funding and have also raised the question of responsibility for that funding between the federal government and the states. It seems to be an ongoing issue as to who should be responsible.


They have also highlighted that Aboriginal people will not access mainstream legal aid services for various reasons. Again, I could go into that if I had the time, but I will not. But the fact is that they will not access mainstream legal aid services. The Aboriginal legal rights services around this country are losing experienced lawyers because of the shortfall in funding. These are important matters and, since they are related to the Sorry Day statement that we are debating tonight, I bring them to the government's attention. I am pleased to be able to support the government's statement with those remarks.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (19:18):  I thank my colleague who has just spoken for his contribution and all those other people who have involved themselves in this debate on National Sorry Day—the members for Hasluck, Moreton, Leichhardt, Griffith, Murray, Blair and Canberra. I firstly acknowledge the Ngunawal traditional owners of this country on which we are meeting. It is my own birthplace, by the way. Ngunawal country is something I must say I did not know a lot about as a kid, but I have learnt a lot about it since.


Last week we celebrated National Sorry Day, a day that meant so much to all Australians. Its significance is recognised each year and the momentum is building to better the lives of members of the stolen generations, their families and their communities. We remember the apology, initiated by the member for Griffith when Prime Minister, to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It was delivered on 13 February 2008. In the years that I have been in the parliament, and there have been a lot of them, I cannot think of a prouder day than the day that we issued that national apology, and I want to thank the member for Griffith for that initiative and for the way in which he delivered what was a very fine speech. I think the sentiments in it epitomised the feelings of all the people in the parliament and I am very pleased to have been there that day. I have many friends from the stolen generations who were also present and I know what it meant to them.


On National Sorry Day last year, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, and I launched the Stolen generations working partnership. This seeks to harness the efforts of government and non-government organisations in supporting members of the stolen generations to heal the grief of past practices of forcible removal. While much has already been done towards achieving the priorities outlined in the document, there is still much to do. 


The Australian government acknowledges the importance of ongoing advocacy of the stolen generations. Part of demonstrating this is the acknowledgement of the recently released National Sorry Day Committee scorecard. The scorecard is a measure of progress in the first 12 months of operation of the Stolen generations working partnership. I am pleased to commit to ongoing dialogue with the stolen generations. We welcome their engagement in the planning and implementation of future activities. I know a lot of people who are members of the stolen generations and their families. Their stories, as we all know from what was said in the parliament the day that the Prime Minister gave the apology, are heart wrenching. People were taken away from their parents. In the case of people from Central Australia, many were taken to Croker Island, off the coast of the Northern Territory, never to return. Or they were taken to other places, Bathurst and Melville Island and other parts of the Northern Territory, never to return. When they have returned in later years as adults, often their parents are no longer there, and the sadness of that and what it means for all families should be obvious to all of us. 


The 2011-12 budget recognises that members of the stolen generations need ongoing support for their journey of healing. The government announced the expanded investment of $54.4 million over five years to continue counselling, family tracing and reunion services for members of the stolen generations, currently provided under the Bringing Them Home and Link Up programs. In addition, the national mental health reform package provides expanded access to allied psychological services with a particular focus on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Some $10 million will go towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander specific suicide prevention and mental health services under the ATAPS program over the next five years. The expansion of this program will involve funding of support services to 18,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.


Sorry Day is a national day of commemoration and remembrance in the Australian calendar. We recognise and acknowledge the stolen generations and all that they have endured as a result of the forced removal policies of the past. We will continue to work together to improve on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. As the Minister for Indigenous Health, I have great pleasure in talking to Aboriginal people across this country on a regular basis about how we can empower them to have greater control over their lives—in this case, through the delivery of health services. We fund nationally around 152 community controlled health organisations, and they are very fine examples of comprehensive primary health care being delivered for and by Aboriginal community controlled organisations. They have much to be proud of. But there is more to do; there is a great deal more to do. My friend here has just spoken about legal aid and the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that are before the courts and in the jail system and the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who do not get a good education and who are worried about what their next meal might be. They are the things we need to think about in this country. We need to understand that the original inhabitants, the longest-surviving culture on this planet, deserve a great deal better than they have. We need to be working with them. I say to those members of the stolen generations who have been the subject of these silly policies of the past that it is a sad indictment of the policymakers of the era that they were ever put in place in the first instance. The national apology, I hope, has helped heal some of the hurt. It will never replace family relationships. As a parent, I cannot imagine what it must feel like to have a child taken away. So I am very pleased to be able to contribute to this debate, although, as I have said on an earlier occasion today, this is not a debate; this is speaking to a motion across the parliament, and it is good to see the cross-party support the motion has been given.


Debate adjourned.

Mr Swan:
  The Minister for Finance and Deregulation has supplied the following answer to the honourable member’s question:


The government has previously announced a remediation process relating to the Home Insulation Program and the Green Loans Program is not proceeding.  The Building the Education Revolution program is delivering vital infrastructure to school communities on an unprecedented scale.  


With regard to the wider reform agenda, I refer the member to my speech to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Discussion Forum, “Better Government”, at the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra on Wednesday 8 December 2010.
