Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (09:30):  On behalf of Senator Arbib, I move:


That, pursuant to standing order 25(9), the Senate determines:


   (a)   that the chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee shall be elected by that committee from members nominated by minor parties or independent senators; and


   (b)   that this order remain in effect until the President is duly notified of an agreement that meets the terms of standing order 25(9)(c).


I do not want to take up too much of the Senate's time since we have the continuation of the second reading debate on the clean energy package this morning. So I will be brief. This motion should not take up too much time as it is straightforward. It increases the number of chairs the Greens will hold on references committees. This is in line with previous practice of the Senate.


With the Greens having nine senators from July this year, it is appropriate to adjust their chairing role accordingly. I understand that the Greens raised this adjustment both informally and formally with the opposition—the opposition's response has not been positive—and finally the Greens raised it with the President, who in turn has brought it to the chamber to be resolved, hence the motion we are dealing with this morning. It would have been preferable for the committee itself to sort this matter out. Unfortunately, the committee was unable to settle it without reference to the chamber. That is why the motion is now before us.


Obviously there are differing interpretations of how Senate committee chairs should be allocated. I am certain the opposition will have an interesting inter­pretation to detail to the Senate, but let me outline the government's position on this, which is broadly in line with how the Senate committee system operated between 1994 and 2005. The Senate should have both legislation and references committees. The two sets of committees perform comple­mentary and valuable roles for the Senate. By convention, the government should chair all the Senate legislation committees and that continues. Chairing of the references committees is for the opposition and minor parties, with the opposition having the majority of these chairs, usually around six, and minor parties sometimes sharing and sometimes taking—depending on their proportion of representation in the Senate—both of the other two chairs. That is similar to the arrangement we had when the Australian Democrats were in this place and had similar numbers—nine seats. They were given the opportunity to chair two references committees. This motion reinstates this well-tested and successful allocation of chairs of Senate committees and I commend it to the chamber. 


As I said, it would have been preferable had the committee itself sorted this matter out, but unfortunately they were unable to and so it has been brought before the chamber for resolution. What we are now proposing is in line with the proportional representation of this chamber and such procedure has been in place for a very long time.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:35):  I move:


That the words ""Legal and Constitutional Affairs"" be removed and replaced with ""Environment and Communications"" so that paragraph (a) now reads:


(a) that the chair of the Environment and Communications References Committee shall be elected by that committee from members nominated by minor parties or independent senators.


With all the issues confronting this nation—the carbon tax, the mining tax, the border protection policy in disarray—what is the first item of business the government brings into the chamber today? Another committee chair for the Greens. That is what is at the front of the government's mind—to placate the Greens, to keep their alliance together. I say to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that in fact his party has a signed agreement with the Greens. Who can forget the spectacle of the table set out in the Prime Minister's courtyard, where Senator Brown and other Greens were sitting in their suits, wattle sprigs in their lapels? It had all the makings of a civil ceremony, of a marriage, in effect, between the Greens and the Labor Party.


The main issue we have been debating in recent times, the carbon tax, is proof positive. It was conceived out of that relationship because Labor had gone to the election saying that there would be no carbon tax. It is the Greens who have foisted the carbon tax on the Labor Party. Indeed, Mr Adam Bandt himself bragged about that in a media release which said that, when he met with Ms Gillard, he had said, 'There is one thing we need for an alliance and that is a price on carbon,' and she had said, 'Yes, deal done.'


Today another deal has been done between Labor and the Greens to give another Greens senator a $15,000 pay rise. Why are they giving it to a government alliance partner? These chairs should be going to genuine opposition parties. So for Senator Ludwig to come into this chamber and suggest that somehow the Greens should be seen as the Democrats were is absolutely and patently false because the Democrats never did a dirty deal with a government by signing up with them. They retained Don Chipp's motto—I know it is unparliamentary—which was 'Keep the bastards honest.' They would not side with either side but considered each issue on its merit—not so with the Australian Greens. They have signed up with the Australian Labor Party, and we have a Greens senator nodding in agreement. They have signed up.


What the Greens senators are now saying is, 'We want all the trappings and benefits of government and—whatever few there are—benefits of opposition as well.' This is, of course, typical of the Australian Greens. They love it both ways, don't they? Corporate donations are bad for political parties, unless it is a $1.6 million donation that the leader of the Greens himself negotiated. That is okay. If somebody happens to miss a division, that is bad. It shows a party in disarray—that is, of course, unless the leader of the Greens himself misses a division. That is different: it is all perfectly excusable, all perfectly understandable. 


So what we have yet again in this place today is the suggestion that the Greens should get all the benefits of government and whatever benefits there are of opposition. We as an opposition say that you have to be either fish or fowl in this game. You cannot try to be both. Of course, that is what the Australian Greens are seeking to do throughout. But we believe that, in fact, the Greens should not even have the Community Affairs References Committee chairmanship, because they are part and parcel of the government. To make sure this place operates, we as an opposition were willing to overlook that for the time being to allow the system to keep running as it was. However, now the Greens are moving the goalposts, as is always the case, seeking further and further benefits for themselves. We are going to take a stand on this. We are opposing it. 


It does not seem to be a coincidence that, of all the chairs that the Australian Greens could have chosen, the first one was the community affairs committee. I wonder why? Guess who the chairman of that committee was at the time? Senator Gary Humphries. We then say Senator Humphries is a very good man and should be chairing another Senate committee, and so he becomes the chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Com­mittee. Guess what? The Australian Greens say, 'Oh, we now want that committee as well.' Why are they in such hot pursuit of Senator Gary Humphries? It is because of his capacity to ensure that the Australian Greens do not win a Senate seat in the Australian Capital Territory, and so each and every time they seek to cut the ground from under Senator Gary Humphries. Can I say you will have to do better than that. You will have to have policies that actually resonate with the people of the Australian Capital Territory before you continue to pursue Senator Gary Humphries in this very ham-fisted way. 


But just to assist the Australian Greens and to keep faith with their electorate, we as an opposition are going to move that the words 'legal and constitutional' be deleted from the motion and replaced with the words 'environment and communications'. That will give the Australian Greens the opportunity to tell the Australian people whether the environment is actually their No. 1 issue or whether their social agenda is in fact their real motivation. Indeed, their vote on this amendment will be indicative of whether they are genuinely the watermelon party of the Australian political scene or simply using the green veneer, thin as it is, to cover up a big red centre of social engineering, which we have always said was the case. Today will be the test for the Australian Greens on whether their No. 1 item is the environment or whether it is social engineering and that is why they have been in such hot pursuit of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee chairmanship. 


The Australian Greens, who always want everything, who always move the goalposts, today will be given a free kick by the opposition in relation to the committee of their choice. We will, of course, oppose the Greens getting two committees. We believe they do not deserve one because they have signed up with the government and any committee chairmanships they want should be resolved in their Monday morning meetings between Senator Brown and Ms Gillard when they talk about all the affairs of the nation. I would have thought Senator Brown and Ms Gillard could have come to a solution in relation to this and determined which of the Labor chairs they would be taking. But here we have the Australian Greens wanting to take that which rightfully belongs to the opposition. We will give the Australian Greens the opportunity to vote whether or not they want an environment committee or the legal and constitutional committee. We will be opposing the suggestion that they should be entitled to these two committees. Senator Humphries—



Senator Carol Brown interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  It is a good interjection by Senator Carol Brown as to where Senator Humphries goes next, because one thing I do know is that Senator Humphries will continue to go up and up in the estimation of the people of the Australian Capital Territory and amongst his colleagues and in this place. That will continue to happen irrespective of the Labor Party and the Greens colluding to try to give the Greens a leg-up for another Senate seat in the Australian Capital Territory. To think that the Australian Greens have combined and colluded with the Australian Labor Party to form a government and now somehow claim that they are not part of the government and should get some of the spoils of opposition is indicative of the duplicitous and hypocritical stance they take.


We believe very strongly that this duplicity by the Australian Greens, which seems to know no end, needs to be explored and ventilated so the Australian people get to see what the Australian Greens actually stand for. Some of us get sick and tired from time to time of the puff pieces we see in the Australian media about the Australian Greens. I cannot help but remember the puff piece in the 'hate' media, the Weekend Australian, about Senator Brown and his nice house at Liffey. There were lovely pictures and panoramic views, but something caught my attention in the panoramic view. There was also a nice picture inside the house and something else caught my attention. I thought, 'How does this stand up against the Greens policy of not using wood waste for energy and biomass?' Do you know what was in that panoramic view? Smoke coming out of the chimney at Senator Bob Brown's house. Do you know what caught my eye in the view of his lounge room? The log fire—one of the most inefficient ways to heat a house. But, again, we should not be surprised. People should not be allowed to have wood fires! They should not be allowed to have biomass! Industry should not be allowed to! But, of course, Senator Bob Brown should because Senator Bob Brown is different. All those rules which he seeks to apply to everyone else should not apply to Senator Bob Brown because Senator Brown is the Leader of the Australian Greens. Senator Bob Brown is different and, therefore, the Australian Greens should be treated differently. Of course the list of hypocrisy and duplicity goes on and on.


That is why the Pecksniffian attitude of the Australian Greens needs to be exposed for all to see. The duplicity is there for all to see and today is another example of it. But what is most humiliating in all of this is that the Labor Party would stoop to do their dirty work, that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate would make this move in the Senate for and on behalf of the Australian Greens. There is no sense of shame and no sense of being independent from the Australian Greens. They are doing the dirty work for the Australian Greens, at a time when the Australian Greens are trying to say, 'We aren't really part of the govern­ment; we are really part of the opposition for this debate.' If that is the case, if they are not part of the government, why is it that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate is moving the motion? Why didn't the Australian Greens move it for and on behalf of themselves? Because the Australian Labor Party will do anything and say anything to placate the Australian Greens. And of course they will distort themselves to do it, as they have done in relation to the carbon tax—a tax which the Australian people do not want and that Ms Gillard is willing to implement just to keep the Australian Greens happy.


We were told by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that he would not seek to delay the Senate for long in relation to this issue. I know why—he had no feathers to fly with. There is no justification for the government to do this. There is no argument. So I suppose that is the easiest thing to do if you have no arguments at all. Even if the highly paid spin doctor that the Labor Party got from Tony Blair cannot spin you the lines to try to justify this one, the best thing to do I suppose is to sit down, shut up and hope that nobody notices. Bad luck, Senator Ludwig and bad luck to the Australian Labor Party. We have noticed. Even your highly paid spin doctor from the United Kingdom could not spin you out of this one. He could not give you a form of words to even fill in half of the time that was allocated to you to justify this unprincipled move in support of your Greens alliance partners.


For the Senate to work and for the Senate to work appropriately, you need give and take. You need to accept that there has to be cooperation. That is why, for example, tomorrow the coalition have very graciously given the government time—the private members' time usually allocated to us—for the purposes of the carbon tax debate. That is why, given that there was a heritage issue in relation to the community affairs committee, we were not willing to push the boundaries in relation to Senator Siewert's chairmanship and we were willing to allow that to go through to the keeper. Now, despite the cooperation that they get from the coalition day after day, hour by hour in this place, they are throwing all that cooperation into our face and saying: 'We don't care about all that cooperation. We won't agree with your support in making this chamber move as it should. We will throw all that into your face and take another chairmanship from the opposition for a government alliance partner senator.' If that is the way the Australian Labor Party want to play the game, so be it.


We will continue to be cooperative. We will continue to be a responsible opposition. But what we will do on a regular basis is highlight when the hapless Manager of Government Business in the Senate has to move motions for and on behalf of the Greens because the Greens are too embarrassed to do it for themselves. Why the Australian Labor Party would stoop to such a low level today and make this the No. 1 item for today just beggars belief? The Australian people listening to this broadcast, few though there may be, will know that the top order business for today for the Australian Labor Party government is to give the Greens another chairmanship. Why the Labor Party would stoop so low one does not know. Why don't we know? Because the minister himself was not willing to use the allocated time to try to justify why the Australian Labor Party was doing it.



Senator Ludwig interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  The minister just interjected and said, 'Because we should be talking about the clean energy package.' You know what? I absolutely agree. I am in heated agreement. So it begs the question: why the urgency to move this motion today during a period when we should be debating the clean energy package? Why couldn't you have deferred it until next year, after the clean energy package? Because you wanted to do another deal. It is another down payment on this dirty deal that the Australian Labor Party have done with the Australian Greens.


It is always the way, isn't it, with blackmailers? One demand will be made and as soon as you have succumbed to that the next demand is made and then the next. We know what the first demand in this blackmail was. What was it? It was the carbon tax. The second one was to ruin the Tasmanian forest industry and throw thousands of Tasmanians out of work. We know that that was another part of the blackmailing, and now we have the third example. The Greens are saying: 'We demand a new chairmanship. We want another chairmanship, but we will not be moving it. You, the Australian Labor Party, will move it for and on behalf of the Australian Greens.' The Labor Party will bear all the opprobrium so that when it is passed with a combined vote the Greens can say: 'We didn't really want it. It was the Labor Party that moved it and it was foisted upon us.'


The arrogance of the Australian Greens knows no bounds. We read about this move and that a particular senator would be given the chairmanship before the Senate had the motion before it, because the Greens were bragging about this new chairmanship in the media clips yesterday. They were already bragging about their achievement, pre-empting the vote of the Senate, which indicates they had done a deal with the Labor Party. They were pre-empting the vote of the Senate and they are now dealing with this place with the same sort of arrogance that the Australian Labor Party does. That is why it is quite appropriate that they sign this formal agreement, that is why they are an alliance and that is the reason they do not deserve a second chairmanship. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2011-11-02,"



Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:55):  One thing Senator Abetz can never be accused of is boxing above the belt. The amendment moved by Senator Abetz, which proposes that the Greens be given the chair of the environment and communications committee, says two things. Firstly, it says that Senator Abetz and the coalition agree that a second chair of a committee should be given to the Australian Greens. That is very clear. It is written in this amendment. It also says that the determination of the chair should be made by the opposition. That is nowhere in the history of the Senate. What is proposed here is a very reasonable move for the Greens, with nine members in the Senate, to chair two of the committees. That is exactly the arrangement that the Howard government, which included Senator Abetz, made with the Democrats. When there were nine Democrat senators they had two chairs. That is exactly the parity that the Greens are seeking and that the government has accommodated through this motion.


I propose to amend the amendment moved by Senator Abetz to replace the words 'removed and replaced' with the word 'augmented' and, in section (a), to insert the words 'legal and constitutional affairs and' before the word 'environment'. This would effectively use the talent bank in the Greens ranks. I want to compromise with Senator Abetz here. I come here in a spirit of give and take with Senator Abetz. He has put up a very fine idea. I think it is a very good idea from Senator Abetz. It recognises that there is a talent bank here in the which should be tapped. He is proposing that the chair of another committee as well be taken by the Greens. I will not get into discriminating among the people in my ranks, but I could name a number of them who could take up Senator Abetz's worthy option. I see some here that I would nominate to that position of chair. So, in a spirit of compromise with Senator Abetz, I propose that his option be taken up and that we also take another chair. I move:


That the words ""Legal and Constitutional Affairs"" be augmented with ""Environment and Communications"" so that paragraph (a) now reads:


(a)   that the chairs of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs and Environment and Communications References Committee shall be elected by that committee from members nominated by minor parties or independent senators; and


When it comes to the history of chairs in this place, you simply have to look at what happened between 2004 and 2007, when the Howard government, including Senator Abetz, got control of the Senate, to see what an extraordinary piece of hypocrisy this is from Senator Abetz. They then used their numbers to take over every committee in the place—the whole lot—leaving none to the opposition and the crossbench of the time. Senator Abetz now has the hide to come in here and say that this is in some way or another a travesty, that it is somehow out of keeping or out of whack with Senate form.



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator BOB BROWN:
  The poddy calves are braying in the National Party component of Senator Abetz's coalition now.



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Yes, I was. And so Senator Abetz—




Senator Nash:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I would ask that Senator Bob Brown withdraw the reference to me as a poddy calf.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  I do not think the reference was made directly to you, Senator Nash.




Senator Nash:
  It was.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  I do not think there is a point of order. Senator Brown, you have the call.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  If it helps the senator, I loved feeding poddy calves straight out of a bucket in other parts of my career.


It is the case that the opposition's record in this place when utilising the talent right around the Senate in the committee system, particularly for the chairs of committees, was usurped in a way that will go down in the blacker annals of abuse of parliament in those years where the Howard government, after getting control of both houses of parliament, appointed to itself the chair of every committee in the place. We are not proposing that, even though there would be the numbers in here to do that if the government and the crossbench so decided. But we are proposing that the talent of the crossbench be utilised in the chair. I propose that Senator Penny Wright would be an admirable chair of this committee.




Senator Abetz:
  We read about her in the paper yesterday.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  I am glad to know that Senator Abetz reads the Adelaide Advertiserand reads it carefully. Senator Wright's legal career has included work as a private solicitor, lecturer, mediator and tribunal member. In fact, she was on the Guardianship Board of South Australia from 1996 through to 2010, a mediator with Relationships Australia and a member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal—



Senator Abetz interjecting—




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Yes, a mediator, Senator Abetz. That means somebody who can take into account all sides and move towards resolution of problems. That makes her an admirable fit for a potential role as the chair of a committee.


Senator Nash has proposed that Senator Waters be taken up for the environment position. I do not know what reflection that may be on the current chair, but I would agree. Senator Waters would be an admirable chair of an environment committee. I see a little bit of recognition of the talent of Senator Waters from the good senator there. That suggestion from the National Party that Senator Waters take the environment chair will become available if the opposition supports the Greens amendment to the amendment. This process is a very reasonable one. It is based on precedent. It offers to take up the talent that is available and, of course, the Greens will be supporting it.

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:04):  Senator Brown's comments then would have been laughable if the issue were not so serious. This is just another demonstration of the Greens' insatiable desire and lust for power and control over the processes of this place. We have seen that demonstrated with their formal alliance with the government. We have seen it in relation to the successful and effective way in which they have set the national agenda. And we are seeing it yet again today in the way in which they want to control more of the Senate processes.


Senator Brown was lauding the talent of those in the Greens. I think that it is quite right to acknowledge the talent and experience of your own colleagues, but he is actually suggesting Senator Wright—a new senator to this place—stacks up against Senator Humphries, who has been, if nothing else, the Attorney-General of the ACT. Senator Wright, how does that make you more equipped than him to be the chair of this committee? What an absolute nonsense!


Let me go on. I gave Senator Humphries two seconds to write two lines—




Senator Bob Brown:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator should be addressing her remarks to the chair.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Senator Kroger, I just ask that you observe the usual courtesies.




Senator KROGER:
  I wish Senator Brown would observe the same procedures of the Senate that he is very quick to point out to all other members, including the dress code of this place and recognising the presiding officer.


Senator Humphries is a former Attorney-General of the ACT and Minister for Police and Emergency Services. Is this enough experience for you, Senator Brown?




Senator Fifield:
  Chief Minister.




Senator KROGER:
  He was the Chief Minister, but these are the things that have direct correlation to the experience he brings to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. He was shadow minister for legal and consumer affairs, Treasurer and the list goes on.


There was an interjection by the minister, Senator Ludwig, before he left the chamber before the conclusion of this debate to the effect that the committee could not sort this out. You may be surprised to know that the committee has never discussed dumping—and that is all that you can call it—Senator Humphries from the head of this committee and replacing him with Senator Wright. Not once has this come up in a committee meeting, and it begs the question: why not? I understand that the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee meets on a weekly basis. It does not take a rocket scientist to work out that this committee has met probably close to 30 times already this year, but not once have those on the crossbenches or in the government deemed the democratic Senate process or the committee system important enough to raise in a committee meeting that they were interested in taking the chair's position. That smacks of total hypocrisy. The Greens know they control the agenda of the government. They control what actually happens here and, as Senator Abetz pointed out, they are pursuing and enjoying the spoils of being in both government and opposition. What this all comes down to is: who is actually wagging the tail of the dog of the government? We know that it is the Greens.


The day the Greens signed their formal alliance with the government was a very dark, sad day for this nation. On that day a minor party which managed to garner only 11 per cent of the primary vote—it had an electoral mandate of only 11 per cent—began to dictate to this nation the agenda that we have seen being rolled out. We are seeing it again today. This is an absolute indictment of the Greens. Their thirst for further authority and power knows no bounds, and this motion is yet another demonstration of that. We do not support Senator Brown's amendment to Senator Abetz's amendment. We do not support it at all. We do not question the integrity and the ability of the Greens senators; we question the rationale that a further committee chairmanship should be taken from the opposition. The reason we question it is pretty straightforward. It only takes a fairly sane and rational person to look at the Notice Paper to determine that this position should be taken from the government. 


The opposition makes up about 44 per cent of the composition of the Senate; we are allocated about 43 per cent of committee positions. I am not going to quibble over one per cent. We consider that to be a fair and reasonable representation of our electoral mandate to this place. We know that the government and the Greens are in a formal alliance—others may call it a coalition. We on this side of the chamber, the Liberal and National parties, believe this is a coalition. They have a signed document, which they framed to forge their alliance—a formal alliance, to put it in the words of Senator Brown and the Prime Minister. Together they are seeking to increase their committee representation from over 52 per cent now to 62 per cent, so that three-fifths of the committee positions in this chamber will be allocated to the government and Greens alliance. No sane, rational person could suggest that that is a reasonable suggestion. There is no electoral mandate for this. The purpose of the Senate is that we represent our states, and this motion flies in the face of that.


I can never get past the photo opportunity, the press conference, after the Prime Minister negotiated with the Greens or, more to the point, effectively, the Greens negotiated with the government. I will never forget the day she did an interview after forming her minority government. If you had looked through a crystal ball you would have seen that that photo depicted what we could expect from this Labor-Greens government. In that photo were the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Greens, front and centre. Around them both were the Independents. The smile on the face of the Leader of the Greens was enough to light a light globe—probably all the light globes in this place. The expressions on the faces of those in the photo said it all. In that photo you could see the Prime Minister's realisation of just how far she had gone in selling your souls to the Greens so that you could form a minority government.




Senator Marshall:
  I don't have a soul!




Senator KROGER:
  Yes, Senator Marshall, we have seen that time and time again. I am so pleased that you have indicated you do not have a soul. We know that there are many on that side who do have or who claim to have a soul. This is an alliance that has caused more grief for your colleagues and yourself than for anyone else. This is an alliance whose consequences we will live with until we come to an election.


We do not support the amendment to Senator Abetz's amendment. We think that it is very hypocritical of the Greens to pitch themselves as the moral guardians, if you like, of the environment. They claim to hold that moral high ground, yet, when they sought to take a committee chair from the opposition, they chose not the environment committee, but the community affairs committee. In doing so, as we know, they took that chair from the very able Senator Humphries. Now they are seeking to encroach, to expand their territory, to take on another committee chair, and it is, once again, not the environment committee but the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. What is the hidden agenda here? Is it the social agenda that they are more concerned about than environmental pursuits? I go back to their primary vote at the last election. It is a sad day if a minority party can control the agenda of this country with a primary vote of only 11 per cent. 


In conclusion, Senator Abetz referred to the Adelaide Advertiser article, which I also read first thing yesterday morning before I even saw the red that was circulated in the chamber. It smacked once again, very typically, of the absolute contempt that the Leader of the Greens and his colleagues have for this Senate, contempt in that they would advertise, in advance, something that the Senate had not even voted on. That shows their absolute arrogance and the confidence that they have in their position with the government in their formal alliance. Nothing demonstrates their hubris more than the confidence they have that they will effectively ensure that they can chair another committee. 


As I said at the beginning, this would be laughable if it were not so tragic, to be honest. This is a total indictment of this place. I raised the hypocrisy of the senator in discussing standing orders of this place. What is good for him is not good for everybody else. The same principles apply here. We do not support this. We do not believe that it truly reflects our elected mandate to properly pursue the Senate processes of this place. We strongly reject the Greens' proposal to take the chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2011-11-02,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:17):  This is a very peculiar day, when we find that the Greens are apparently part of the opposition. I refer to page 373 of Odgers: 


Under standing order 25 the chairs of the legislative and general purpose standing committees must be chosen from the government party members, and the deputy chairs from the non-government members. For procedures for electing chairs and deputy chairs, see below … 


It further states that each legislation committee shall elect as its chair a member nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and, as the deputy chair, a member nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Each references committee shall elect as its chair a member nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate or a member of a minority group in the Senate and, as its deputy chair, a member nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The Leader of the Government in the Senate is now nominating someone from the Greens.


It is an interesting start for a person on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee when they do not even know their own Odgers. It is a very interesting position to kick off from, which goes to show, more than anything else, why they are not fit for the position. Let us go through and see how much role they have had with us. I have got a list of votes by the opposition—that is us; apparently it is you now as well, if we believe you—and the Greens. I can go to each one from 4 July. What we are looking for is when I say 'yes, yes' or 'no, no'. In seriatim, this is how we voted: no, yes; no, no. That is one, but the government did not support it either. Then yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; yes, no; no, yes; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; no, yes; yes, no; no, yes—I will not bore you, but you get the idea. We do not generally agree—in fact, never, except for one where the two genuine Independents had a different position. These are the people now coming in here, after reading what it says in Odgers, and saying they are part of our crew. I should have invited them to the Christmas party! I did not know they were part of the team. 


This is absolutely amazing. It shows how absolutely fraudulent the Greens have become, in everything they do. You watch, later on: they will support the guillotine. They are the party that now do not give leave. This is the worst part, and it will stick with you. They are the party that did not support an inquiry into the rape of Annette Harding. That is the one that really irks me. She is an Aboriginal girl and you decided that you were not going to support an inquiry into this. Why you did that, I do not know. It was that day, at that moment, that I just lost you. I just could not work out where you were going.




Senator Bob Brown:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Joyce should be addressing the chair. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Senator Joyce, I ask you to direct your comments through the chair. 




Senator JOYCE:
  That was the time where the last semblance of nobility for the independent position was lost. We had been seeking that inquiry in this place for so long, and so many people have been battling for so long to get that lady her day for some form of justice. When that was denied by the Greens we knew that the whole thing had really started to stink to high heaven in how this organisation is working. 


The Greens are a part of the key positions of the government—it is a Greens-Labor Party-Independent alliance. We all remember the vision of them all standing with their corsages in their lapels as they signed the registry to state that they would be supporting the government and that is how the government would form a government. Now they are completely corrupting the process of the Senate, the chamber that gave them succour and the capacity to have a voice in our nation. They are now completely corrupting that process. They are corrupting it as far as Odgers is concerned. They are corrupting it as far as their actions in what is delivered, the ventilation of a vibrant and analytical form of democracy, is concerned. They are corrupting it as far as their absolutely absurd lack of recognition of the facts as to how the actual votes went is concerned.


What have they sought an inquiry into? They are called the Australian Greens. In the deep recesses of my mind I have this association between the word 'green' and the environment. I thought that that would be the premier issue. When I think about the environment I think green. I think: 'Well, they're always frolicking around in the mushrooms in the forests with the frogs'—the party for frogs—but, no. It is legal and con. It is social engineering that they are really interested in. When you scratch the surface this is the party about social engineering. This is the party that always puts up the flag and collects people around with: 'I love my roses. You love your roses. If you love your garden you love the Greens,' and then we find that what they are really interested in is the social engineering exercise. In their form of Maslow hierarchy of needs, at the very top, before eating or sleeping or anything else that pertains to it, other more banal pursuits of the basic form of human instinct, their main issue is social engineering—to change the whole structure and to work their way into people's lives by the manipulative sense of making you feel good, of righteousness, of: 'We're saving the trees. We're saving the creeks. We are looking after the frogs. We're saving the fish.' But, when push comes to shove, when they have to nominate a committee, they nominate the committee to reorganise the social fabric. That is what they are truly interested in.


So where does this faux nobility go from here? Their eyes are focused. They draw an association between themselves and the Democrats. There are many people, I am certain, who voted for the Democrats who are wondering now where their vote has ended up. Think of people like former Senator Andrew Murray, a person respected on all sides of the chamber. He had his bleats, but the one thing he was not was anybody's patsy. He was his own person. Those people had a capacity to have genuine independence, to voice their views and to stand behind them. The Democrats were an independent party. The Greens are not an independent party. If you want a classic example of that, even within this chamber, I would have to say I have heard Dougie Cameron, as much as I disagree with him, at times say things—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Joyce, I ask you to refer to Senator Cameron correctly.




Senator JOYCE:
  I apologise to Senator Cameron with real deference. I have heard Senator Cameron at times say things that are different from the people in his own party. He has voiced them in the chamber and he has voiced them at the doors. He has not backed them up with a vote, but at least he has had the ticker to say them. So there is a sense within the Labor Party, and you can see it at times, that they will actually do what most rational human beings do: if they have a different point of view, they will actually say it. I have most certainly seen it on our own side. We treasure the liberty of the individual. We treasure the liberty of individual expression if it is required and—not often, but if it is really required—even in how you vote. It is part of why we sit on this side of the chamber. I would have to say that that is in the National Party probably more than anywhere else; it is just part of the culture of the show.


But I know one party here that does not. They always vote as a block. In the time I have been here, they have never split. We have never heard them say anything but the script. That is the Greens. They are a completely centralised, controlled unit. Maybe that is their cunning. Maybe that is how they got ahead. But it is not the expression of the liberty of the individual. I would ask all the people who get attracted to them in tertiary education: why? Why would you join a group which tells you how to think? Why would you join a group in which, manifestly, every word you utter has to go through a centrally controlled unit before you say it? If there is ever one party that should be a thousand miles away from the legal and cons committee it is the one with that attitude, that philosophy. That philosophy should be a thousand miles away. We believe in deference, in the removal and the separation of powers and in those who by their actions, displayed here and in other places, are truly independent.


I know somebody who is truly independent, who by their actions—and sometimes I have disagreed with him—has voted in accordance with his beliefs, and that is Senator Humphries. By his actions he is quite evidently a person who has the dignity of office to stand aside and say, 'I will be an independent arbiter in my deliberations as chair of this committee,' because that is who he is. He has displayed it; therefore, we can trust him with it. But the Greens have not shown anybody in their party who has had the capacity to do that. Therefore, one of the premier committees in this nation has now become a political football as part of this deal. It is quite evident, manifestly evident, in their actions that the Greens were most definitely not part of the opposition. You Greens might say you are not part of the government, but you are. But we can definitely prove by your actions—absolutely, categorically, without a shadow of a doubt—that 99.9 per cent of your votes are not with us, so you cannot possibly be part of the opposition. Therefore, if you follow Odgers, you cannot possibly have the chair, and if you understood Odgers or if you quoted it you would show some competency in it. But you do not even have it. You do not even know it. It has not got nothing to do with the process. This is a dirty little political deal that is completely removed from the reality.


Now Senator Brown is reading the paper. He is probably reading the form guide. What is the day that comes after the Melbourne Cup? It is the Oaks. He is probably looking up the Oaks. This is how bizarre it has become. We have the Leader of the Greens, who is now organising himself to take over the legal and cons committee, reclining in the chamber, ladies and gentlemen who are driving down the highways of Australia, reading the paper—made out of trees, I presume; but I do not know. I thought he would have an electronic form of it. But, no; he is going to read the stuff that they make out of trees—probably out of pulp and woodchips, to be honest. Where is the justification for this? You have not mounted an argument to show your independence. You have not mounted an argument that shows any understanding of Odgers and the position you are seeking. You have not been transparent in the deals that you have made with the Labor Party about why you should have this position. There has been no indication how the Greens candidate is comparable with or has more experience than the current chairman, who has served as Attorney-General and Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory and who by his own actions has shown that he has the courage and the conviction, though others might not agree with him, to cross the floor when he believes that is the right thing to do. You have displayed none of these things. You have taken the legal and constitutional committee and made it your pet project.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT
:  Senator Joyce, please address your remarks through the chair.




Senator JOYCE:
  I am sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is your pet project because the real motivation here is social re-engineering—and we are seeing more and more of it as you fall into this trap of hubris. You are in the spotlight because of the things you are doing to our country, whether it is introducing the carbon tax or closing down fishing, closing down mining or closing down the Murray-Darling Basin. If we pursue this nihilistic approach it will ultimately lead to the destruction of our nation. We will see destruction and bankruptcy and our nation in poverty if we pursue your course. 


The goal that sits behind this is social re-engineering—the destruction of the person; basically taking the person to where they are the equivalent of animals: there are horses and bunnies and frogs and people, and they are all the same. Ultimately a person's rights will be similar to vegetation rights—trees and bushes and people will all be the same. We can see this re-engineering in the carbon tax—we take $56.9 billion a year and send it overseas. We do not just re-engineer Australia; we try to re-engineer the world. Everything is part of this nihilistic approach that takes away from the dignity of the individual, takes away from what we are. This totally serves your purpose. 


This approach also indicates quite clearly that the term 'Greens' is a fraud. It inspires a faux nobility with an ulterior motive, which is the restructure of the social fabric of Australia, and other areas if possible, for your own purpose. It is social re-engineering with a suit and tie on—that is all it is. That is what the Greens do. It is done with totally selfish control and takes away any semblance of the right of the individual within the party structure. I cannot nominate one person in that party structure who I have ever heard make a statement on something that has not gone through their centrally controlled unit.




Senator Bernardi:
  Lee Rhiannon, on communism?




Senator JOYCE:
  That is ultimately where we are going. What is the agreement? Why on earth did we have the nomination for a position that is supposed to be made by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate? You can understand why this mistake could be made with any other committee, but this is the legal and cons committee; this is the one that is supposed to have an understanding of the Constitution. Maybe that is a bit old-fashioned—why would they worry about that? Can you explain to me your interpretation of that? Maybe you would like to get your new chair to stand and display to this chamber her competencies in understanding Odgers—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Joyce, I ask you to address your remarks through the chair.




Senator JOYCE:
  Chair, I would be very interested to see the new candidate stand before this chamber and, as her first act, show us her competency in understanding Odgers and how she believes the process followed thus far accords with the process defined by Odgers—which is the process we are supposed to be following here. If she could explain that to us that would be an interesting foray, an interesting opening, into her new role. But she will not be able to do that, because I have a funny feeling she has not got a clue. 




Senator Conroy:
  You're the bloke who was sacked as the shadow finance minister—sit down!




Senator JOYCE:
  Now they have sent in the 'minister for out there', Senator Conroy. This is all part of shutting down this place. In this new environment, let us see if the new chair of legal and cons supports the guillotine. Let us see how independent she is. Let us see how she allows ventilation of debate. Let us see what she does. It is going to be an interesting start.


This action is completely and utterly disgusting. It is not disgusting because we lose Senator Humphries—although he is an extremely competent chair and does not deserve to lose the position; it is disgusting because, right at the start, you have ignored the principle of how the Senate is supposed to work. The premier committee of this place is supposed to have oversight of the process. Either you are totally and utterly naive or you are pernicious, and I think it is the latter.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-11-02,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:36):  I support the motion and I support the amendment that recognises that the coalition thinks the Greens should have the chair of the Environment and Communications References Committee. If they want to add the environment committee to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Com­mittee—and indeed to the committee which Senator Siewert already so capably chairs, the Community Affairs References Com­mittee—then that would be perfectly fine. We recognise the obvious competence available to chair these committees. But what came to mind as I was listening to the last speaker, Senator Joyce, was the phrase that 'when ignorance is bliss it is folly to be wise', because what we heard in the Senate was an ignorant diatribe from Senator Joyce. What should be putting fear into the hearts of people following this debate this morning is that the person who engaged in that ignorant diatribe aspires to be the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. That is what is so appalling. That is terrifying, and I think people listening would be horrified by that. Yesterday, in the contribution that he made on the carbon price, he articulated that there is a god-given right to pollute, that the atmosphere is free to be polluted. He said that putting a price on carbon in trying to restrain pollution—the polluter pays—was somehow contrary to his god-given right to pollute. So I think people listening would recognise that what we have heard is frightening. It is frightening from this point of view, that this motion is about democratic representation. I recognise that the coalition do not like the fact that they are an opposition party and they do not like the fact that opposition parties should be represented on Senate committees on a pro rata basis. Senator Joyce referred to Odgers on several occasions, and people ought to be afraid when they recognise that he completely misrepresented Odgers. Odgers makes it very clear that crossbenchers have a say in terms of committee chairs and committee operations in this Senate. Odgers makes that very clear, which Senator Joyce did not do.


After the last election, the Greens increased our representation in the Senate to nine senators. There is a recognition, in terms of pro rata, that we have the capacity to chair at least two committees, and that is the basis on which we have argued for the chair of another committee, and the legal and constitutional committee is the case in point. Given the standing orders of the Senate, you do not expect to have the kind of reflection that Senator Joyce engaged in with relation to Senator Wright. I would remind the Senate of Senator Wright's career to date. She has not only acted as a solicitor, both in this country and overseas, but has lectured at Flinders University in public and environ­mental health. She has been a member of a residential tenancies tribunal. She has been a solicitor on the Legal Practitioners Conduct Board of South Australia. She has been on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. She has been a mediator at Relationships Australia and the Deputy President of the South Australian Guardianship Board. So, contrary to the assertions from Senator Joyce, Senator Wright is very able and well qualified and has life experience that will make her an excellent chair  of this committee. I look forward to that being reflected in the make-up of the Senate committee chairs.


I do remind the Senate that what is so extraordinarily hypocritical here is that it is the coalition who opposes at every turn the implementation of democratic principles in Australia. Only yesterday the first of the Greens bills that restore to the ACT and the Northern Territory their democratic rights passed both houses of parliament—and that was opposed by the coalition. They took away the rights of the Northern Territory and the ACT parliaments, they overrode the laws of those parliaments and they continued to do so right up until the last minute yesterday, and in the votes they opposed it. So there we have the coalition, who want to take away the democratic rights of the ACT and the Northern Territory, and here we have the Greens who have restored, with the government, those rights to the ACT and the Northern Territory which the coalition would have continued to see taken away. So, when we talk about where the commitment is to democratic representation, I note (a) there is a pro rata distribution in Senate chairs and (b) there is a commitment of the Greens to democratic representation, as is evidenced by the passage yesterday of that legislation restoring the rights to the ACT and the Northern Territory.


But my experience in the Senate goes back further than that. I was elected in 2004 and took my place in the Senate in 2005, when the coalition government had control of both houses. It was then that we saw their complete belief in a god-given right to rule at any cost while ruling out any democratic representation. The coalition abolished the Senate committee system as it stood prior to that election. Not only did it do that but it took all 10 chairs for itself. There are other people sitting in here today who came into the Senate at that time who will recall that. Senator Polley, my colleague from Tasmania and a Labor senator, came into the Senate at the same time and Senator Polley will recall that is precisely the case—that the coalition abolished the tradition of the Senate committees, abolished the right of the opposition parties to have any chairs in the Senate committees.



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Order, senators! Senator Milne has the right to be heard in silence.




Senator MILNE:
  So this is the hypocrisy of some of the people who have spoken today: they were sitting there and grinning from ear to ear as they took away the democratic representation of any opposition member to chair any committee at that time. Senator Macdonald was sitting there then and was very happy to take away such representation from everybody else. What is more, when the opposition members of the Senate, from the crossbenches or the Labor opposition at the time, put forward proposals for Senate inquiries into a range of very significant matters, they were voted down as a matter of course. Only those inquiries which the coalition were prepared to have were actually allowed to be even investigated at that particular time. One of the great strengths of the committee system in having opposition members and crossbench members chairing Senate committees is that, in a balance-of-power parliament when no-one has all the power, you get investigations into things which the government of the day does not necessarily want to have inquiries into. Not only do you get inquiries into things the government of the day may not want investigated but on the inquiries of the references committees the government does not have the numbers to dominate the outcomes. As a result, you get very significant Senate inquiry outcomes that are taken seriously by the community. During the years when the Howard government had control of both houses, the Senate committee reports were regarded as having very little significance because they were seen as a rubber stamp of the Howard government and the chairs made sure in those reports that they were government reports and that was all there was to them. Here we have people like Senator Joyce standing up and talking about democratic representation while refusing to acknowledge that when the Howard government had power it used that power ruthlessly to destroy democratic representation in the Senate.


This motion is saying that we recognise, as Odgers points out, the right of reasonable pro rata representation across the parliament for Senate committees. The committee system was changed when Labor got back into government so that we had opposition representation, but we have had abuse of that from the coalition. There was an agreement that there would only ever be three select committees at any one time and that they would be for specific periods, yet having agreed to that the coalition abused it. That is just part of what the community must now be worried about. The community should be worried about what would happen if the coalition ever got control of both houses again, because their track record to date is that they want to control everything. What is more, they have no respect for science, no respect for economists, no respect for international lawyers and no respect for anyone who does not agree with them, as we have heard from the leader of the coalition.


The leader of the coalition has cast absolute contempt. He has treated the scientific, economic and legal communities in Australia with contempt. To be truthful, we are now hearing drivel from people who are refusing to acknowledge that the born-to-rule mentality of the coalition showed itself during the Howard government years with the abuse of the Senate. What is even more interesting is that one of the major reasons the Howard government lost government in 2007 was the community's unhappiness with the Howard government having destroyed the democratic representation in the Senate in the manner to which it had usually been given expression. The community wanted to make sure that there were checks and balances and that the Senate was restored as the balance to a majority in the House of Representatives. That balance of democratic representation, with the ability of the government to chair legislative committees and the opposition and the crossbenchers to chair the references committees, means that you get a balance of interest. Because we have a balance-of-power parliament repre­sented here in the Senate, we get the issues that are on the minds of Australians up for investigation by Senate committees. Those Senate committees are taken seriously when they represent a fair cross-section of the Australian community. That is the basis of this motion.


What we are hearing from the coalition is their view that they have a right to all of the chairs and that they should not be shared according to a pro rata distribution or to democratic representation. The coalition simply thinks it should keep all of those chairs. It is anti-democratic. It is anti the rules of the Senate. It is anti the commitment to the Australian people of fair repre­sentation in the Senate and it is restoring what the Howard government tried to take away and did take away for a considerable period. Over those years, I moved several times for inquiries into various aspects of the impacts of climate change on agriculture and other aspects in the Australian community and the upshot of it all—




Senator Nash:
  Why don't you want the environment committee?




Senator MILNE:
  I hear Senator Nash saying that she would support us having the chair of the environment committee as well, so I hope that she will support that amendment when it comes forward.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! On my left. Senator Nash, is there a point of order?




Senator Nash:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, there is a point of order. I think the senator should withdraw that. I did not say the environment committee as well; I said the environment committee instead of the legal and constitutional committee.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator MILNE:
  Thank you for the clarification, because it is now clear that Senator Nash does support the Greens having the chair of two committees. I thank her for that acknowledgement because clearly that is part of the debate here this morning. I look forward to seeing—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Joyce:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, a point of order: I think that is a complete misrepresentation of a statement that was made and a deliberate misrepresentation of another senator. The Greens have just stated that we believe they should have two committees—that has never been stated. They are definitely misleading the chamber if that is what they continue to say.




Senator Bob Brown:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: the Greens have heard the opposition speakers in silence—




Senator Bernardi:
  We didn't tell lies, though. That's what you're doing.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi!




Senator Bob Brown:
  But, as we are hearing now from Senator Bernardi, they are breaching the standing orders, as were Senator Nash and Senator Joyce, by interjecting. They are now trying to defend those interjections. They have no point. The interjections themselves were unruly, and if they had not broken the rules there would be nothing for Senator Milne to be cogently commenting on.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  On Senator Joyce's point of order, Senator Nash has not actually had the call from the chair during this debate. I have no way of knowing what she said. I call Senator Milne.




Senator MILNE:
  As I was indicating, the Greens do want to pursue our responsibilities here in the Senate very vigorously and we are already doing that. Senator Siewert has been and continues to be an exemplary Chair of the Senate Com­munity Affairs References Committee. When I speak to people around the country, of all political persuasions, they say to me that they regard Senator Siewert extremely highly as being a very professional chair. I have absolutely no doubt that Senator Wright, if it is the will of the Senate, will be an equally good, professional chair in that role with the experience she brings to the Senate.


It is time for people to reflect on how we want our democracy to operate in Australia—whether we want it to give effect to the will of the people as shown at elections. The will of the people at an election returned nine Greens senators to the Senate. That means that on a pro rata basis the Greens should have the chair of two committees. We are now moving to ensure that that actually becomes part of the Senate process in spite of the fact that if the coalition had their way they would once again abolish the Senate committee system, once again take away chairs from any opposition party. Make no mistake about it, Mr Acting Deputy President, the contributions we have heard today have just reinforced the extent to which they would ruthlessly destroy a democratic tradition of the Senate since its inception—that is, until the Howard government destroyed it during that particular period.


As I pointed out earlier, Senator Joyce misrepresented Odgers, as Odgers specifically talks about the role of the crossbench in relation to Senate committees. One of the things that seems to confuse and distract Senator Joyce and some of his colleagues, as was evidenced by his speech, is a view—and it must come from his experience in the coalition—that people can only have a similar view about things if they are dragooned into it by the leader's office. I can see that that was a tradition with the Howard government and I can see it is a tradition with the current leader of the coalition. What this points out is something that the Greens alone have in the political process in Australia, which is a consistent philosophical view. It is a consistent philosophical view that is based on the global Greens charter.


One of our great strengths in the 21st century is that, unlike other political parties in parliaments around the world, including here in Australia where they base their views on their opinion polling, on what their focus groups have to say, on what newspapers such as the Murdoch press have to say and so on, the Greens have a philosophical view based on the four pillars of ecological integrity, participatory democracy—and participatory democracy is what we are pursuing here in this parliament—social justice, and peace and nonviolence. Those four very strong philosophical views underpin the Greens, and we bring that perspective to every issue that comes before us. That is why when a matter comes before the parliament you know, as Senator Faulkner and others have said about us in the past, that the Greens have a consistent philosophical view that it is based on a set of principles—unlike the other parties, who actually do not have a philosophical view anymore, which is why they are all over the place on a variety of issues. That is why we are strongly in favour of participatory democracy and the pro rata expression of what came from the 2010 election. I look forward to the Greens taking the second share in the Senate committee process.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (10:57):  At a personal level I am philosophical about—




Senator Conroy:
   Declare your interest.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  My interest has been pretty well declared for me in this debate, thank you, Senator Conroy; more than amply declared for me. I am philosophical about having to give up the chairmanship of this committee. The Greens' intention to take this chairmanship has been evident for quite some time, has been signalled for some time, so I am not surprised that I am in the position today of being deprived of that chairmanship.


But there are two reasons that I feel this is a very sad day for the Australian Senate. One is that this represents a very significant shift in the way in which the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs does things. It is a very well respected committee, one that has had an air of being able to produce reports that are a step or two away, on many occasions at least, from the political dimension of debates on the floor of the Senate. It has been able to produce reports that have garnered respect in the broader community because they have been seen as dispassionate and independent assessments of the evidence before the committee. I have to ask myself whether that kind of reputation can be preserved in a situation where effectively the government and its close ally the Greens control both the references and legislation perspectives of that committee. For those listening to this debate who might be unaware of what the chairmanship of a committee indicates, that committee will have only those two perspectives. Not only does a party get to provide the chair of the committee but, effectively, it gets control of the committee. If two parties, such as the Greens and the Labor Party, work together on the committee then the chairmanship of that committee delivers control of the committee's deliberations—the majority reports of the committee—to the party or parties with that majority control. So, both the references version and the legislation version of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee will now effectively be controlled by the Labor-Greens axis in this place. The party that represents the largest grouping in this Senate—the coalition, the parties that represent half of all the votes cast by Australians at the last federal election on a two-party-preferred basis—will be unable to put a perspective in the majority reports of either of those two committees.


It is important and significant to note that this committee and the Community Affairs Committee of the Senate constitute the committees with the strongest purview over social policy in this country. They represent the vantage point from which the Senate views a whole range of critically important legal and social issues and are a very important part of the work of the Senate overall. Consider some of the issues the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has considered in the last few years. It has had a strong overview of issues of national security and intelligence through supervising issues like the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the intelligence services in Australia. It has looked at issues like child support. It has looked at the Commonwealth Commissioner for Children and Young People Bill. It has looked at migration matters, most recently examining the government's deal with Malaysia for the swapping of asylum seekers between those two countries.


So the committee has looked at critically important issues from a whole range of perspectives. But those issues will now be considered by a committee with two manifestations, both dominated by this Labor-Greens axis. I use the phrase 'Labor-Greens axis' because it is very clearly the case in this Senate that those two parties work so closely together that they cannot be described as anything other than a coalition or an alliance. In the course of this year there has been only one occasion among the hundreds of divisions that have been held on the floor of this Senate when the Labor Party and the Australian Greens did not vote together—just one. If they are not a coalition, not an alliance, not the same party effectively operating as two different factions, then why are they cleaving so closely together on so many votes over so many issues? In fact, Labor and the Greens have always had very close cooperation, generally supporting each other to the tune of more than 95 per cent of all votes conducted on the floor of this chamber. So the suggestion that the Greens are a separate party with a separate perspective that is going to be quite separate from the government is completely untrue.


A vote today that the chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee should be a member of the Australian Greens will deliver to that side of the chamber all the work of this important committee. The voice of the other significant part of the Australian community that does not take that perspective will be lost except in dissenting or minority reports of the committee, which do not carry anything like the same weight as the majority reports of the committee. That would be most unfortunate, and I think it would be a sad degrading of the integrity and capacity of a very important Senate committee.


The other reason I am opposed to this motion is that pretty dirty tactics have been used to get to this point. A little while ago, the minister rose and announced that he had to move this motion on the floor of the Senate today because the committee had been unable to reach agreement on this subject. I am certain that the Labor members of the committee did not tell the minister that. They know that there has been no discussion at all on the floor of this chamber about the chairmanship of the references committee—not one word of discussion about it. It has never been raised.


Coalition members obviously did not make that bizarre representation. I can only assume that the Australian Greens have told the minister that they have sought valiantly to get the chairmanship of this committee on the floor of the chamber and that they have been rebuffed. Where else would that bizarre claim have come from? Was it Senator Bob Brown who told the minister that? Was it Senator Wright? Who told the minister that this was the case? It is not true, is it?


That is just one of the indications of the dirty tactics the Australian Greens have used in respect of this matter. We see these dirty tactics all the time. We have seen them in the application of the Greens policies during election campaigns. We saw them with the passage of the legislation for disallowance of the territory legislation through this place just the other day and through the House of Representatives yesterday. The man who moved legislation in the parliament to overturn Northern Territory legislation because he did not agree with it has now triumphantly declared that he got legislation through the parliament to give the territories more rights—rights that he was happy to take away a couple of years ago. This is the party that has a policy of removing funding from non-government schools in Australia but whose leader was happy, during the last federal election campaign—when he came to campaign in the Australian Capital Territory, where we have the highest level of take-up of non-government education anywhere in the country—to say: 'Oh, no; that policy won't be applied. We're actually not going to do that anymore. We've decided to put that policy to one side.' When asked by a journalist in the National Press Club debate a couple of days later, 'Why have the Greens decided to abandon this policy?' he said: 'We haven't done that. Our policy on this subject still stands. We're not backing away from that policy.'




Senator Conroy:
  What has this got to do with the topic?




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  It is to do with hypocrisy, Minister.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  We were not in bed with the Australian Democrats. We did not sign a deal with the Australian Democrats. The Democrats voted against us more often than they voted for us in this parliament. So, rewarding those sorts of dirty tactics is just unconscionable and I do not believe the Senate should do it.


Imagine if we came back in the next parliament—were we fortunate enough to be on the other side of the chamber—and we said, 'Well, the National Party is a separate party and they are entitled to their own allocation of chairmanships, quite separate from the government's.' What would you people say about that? You would be up in arms. You would be out of your trees with rage. But that is exactly what you are doing here today, and you know it. You know that this is a very bad precedent to be setting. This is not a good way for the Senate to proceed. It degrades the value of a very important process in this Senate. I think the chairmanship of the two manifestations of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee should reflect the voting intention of Australians at the last election and the composition of this Senate. With this motion being passed it will not do either of those things.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:08):  I will not keep the Senate for very long. I want to indicate why I am totally opposed to the Greens chairing yet another committee. My colleagues on this side have pointed out the unfairness and the breach of agreement. I just want to point out that the Greens political party is a party with hypocritical approaches to everything.


We cannot have as chairs of our committees members of a party of such hypocrisy. I do not make this accusation personally to the Greens nominee. She has only very recently come into the Senate. I have little knowledge of her and have had little to do with her. By contrast I know Senator Humphries is a very distinguished and qualified person—someone who has been an Attorney-General and a Chief Minister of a territory—whose chairmanship of this committee in the recent past has demonstrated why he should retain the chairmanship of this committee.


The Greens political party are a party of hypocrisy. You will remember how their leader, Senator Bob Brown, used to rail against the big parties taking donations from big business. Then we learn that Senator Brown personally received a $1.6 million donation for his campaigning funds, which I am told is the biggest single donation ever in the Australian political scene. After all of the Greens', and particularly Senator Brown's, pious speeches against accepting donations from business, here we have Senator Brown accepting $1.6 million, the largest ever individual donation, for a group that we read in the papers has a particular interest in some of the decisions made in Tasmania in relation to environmental and forestry areas.


Then, we have a party that has railed against the monarchy and privilege. Let me tell you a little experience I had when Her Majesty was in the parliament the other day. I could not get to the front row because there were people there who were particularly keen to touch or see the Queen. I just went along to see the gracious lady, so I stood in the background. Then I looked over into the corner and I saw Senator Brown and all his cohorts over there. I thought they would not be interested in getting near the Queen so I would be able to slip in front of them and get a better view. Could I! I could not get anywhere near them. I got there and Senator Brown and all his team were there pushing their way through to the centre. I then worked out why they were sitting there. It was because the Indigenous singer was right in front of them. So, as the attention turned from the Queen to the Indigenous singer—and what a great performance that was—Senator Brown happened to be right in front of them and, would you believe, in a line between the Queen and the television cameras. I then tried to move there but, no, Senator Brown had been tipped off that the Queen was going to walk through this way. Could you get anywhere near there? No, there was a little cordon of staffers around Senator Brown, so that when the Queen came over Senator Brown could say, as he did, 'Hello Your Majesty. Yes Your Majesty. Bow Your Majesty. Welcome from Tasmania Your Majesty.' I am pleased that Senator Brown is showing respect and courtesy to our head of state. I do not criticise him for that. What I criticise him for is the abject hypocrisy of this party.


We hear Senator Brown railing against those multinational mining companies: they are ripping the guts out of Australia and taking all the profits overseas. Yet we had a flood tax you might recall that was imposed on individuals. It was not imposed on these big multinational companies but on individuals. I said to Senator Brown time and time again, 'Why are you passing this tax on individuals and letting go free those horrid multinational mining companies that you are always railing about.' But it did not matter to Senator Brown. He is so hypocritical in his views of legislation. If the Labor Party say they want it, the deal says they get it. And here today we have the pay-off to the Greens. I am still waiting for Senator Brown to explain to me, with these multinational mining companies that are ripping the guts out of Australia and taking all the profits overseas, why did he vote to exclude these multinational mining companies from paying the flood levy, the same as we all paid?


I highlight that Coles and Woolworths, which again Senator Brown is always railing against, got away scot-free. They did not pay a cent towards the flood tax, but the local butcher and the local baker who compete with Coles and Woolworths in every community around Australia had to pay the flood tax. That is what Senator Brown voted for. What a hypocritical approach.


They rail against the use of VIP aircraft, but who is No. 1 on the manifest list when something happens? Senator Brown and his colleagues. Again, I do not blame them for that. I rarely use them but I understand that some people cannot get to and from. That is fine, and a lot of people do use the VIP aircraft. But the hypocrisy of criticising everybody else, leaking to the media how the Labor Party and some Liberals have used these aircraft—yet there we are, when it suits them, away they go. I am glad they use it. If it is convenient to them to get to and from parliament, that is fine, but do not be so hypocritical about it.


This is why I distrust any member of the Greens political party chairing a particular group. I do not want to take much more of the Senate's time. I think it might be worth while, though, if the nominee of the Greens, who is in line for a fairly hefty pay increase, after having been here only a couple of months, with the chairmanship of this committee were to indicate some of her credentials. I know my colleagues have a lot they want to say on this so I am not going to take much more of the Senate's time. I simply emphasise the reason that I will not be supporting the Greens for any other chairmanship is that they are a party that has demonstrated that they cannot be trusted with the conduct of part of this chamber.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2011-11-02,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:17):  Senator Macdonald might have noticed that he just beat me to the call when I wanted to speak earlier, so it is not so much at his invitation that I am standing to speak but that I think it is important that I put my credentials and views on the record, given that people have been quite free in talking about me.


First of all, I would like to say that it would indeed be a great privilege if the Senate were to see fit to support my nomination to chair this important committee—one of the most busy committees of the Senate, I understand—the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which looks into a broad range of significant legal issues affecting Australians.


I would like to acknowledge that I have been on the committee for some four months, since I was first sworn into the Senate. I have had the opportunity to observe Senator Humphries's chairing of the committee and I would certainly acknowledge that he has been a fair and diligent chair, and I have been impressed with his chairmanship. Of course we understand that this is not personal at all. I would also like to indicate that I would intend to continue in that vein, and I might come to that later.


I did find it a bit disappointing that Senator Humphries chose to, perhaps, move away from that stance when he was suggesting that, by virtue of my being a member of the Greens, I would somehow, therefore, not be able to chair the committee in a non-partisan and open-minded way. In fact I think that observation belies the experience and track record of my colleague Senator Siewert's chairing of the Community Affairs References Committee. There have certainly been majority reports of that committee by the opposition and the Greens and not always majority reports involving the government, so I think the evidence speaks for itself, but I will come back to that.


As I said, this is not personal. It seems to me that in a sense this is a principle. If you look at the statistics and at the idea of representation of the Australian vote in the Senate, it is an appropriate situation to come to that there are two committees being chaired by the Greens in this parliament. Of the 16 paired legislation and references committees we know that eight are chaired by the government, seven by the coalition and, up to now, one by the Greens. We have 76 senators in the chamber and, as of 1 July, we have nine Greens, which is 12 per cent of the make-up of the chamber. It is fair that committees be chaired in the same proportions, which do reflect the true representation and make-up of the Senate. For those who have not had their calculators out, 12 per cent of 16 is indeed two. As we know, there is also a precedent for this situation. When there were nine Australian Democrats senators they also held two chairs; presumably that was because at that time it was also considered fair and appropriate that the chairing of the committees represent the proportion of the Australian public's vote for senators.


Senate committees are a great aspect of the Senate's work. I have been in the Senate only four months but I have had an opportunity to observe the work that the Senate does, and I think that the work of the committees is often undervalued and not fully acknowledged by the Australian public. I have been very impressed by the degree of goodwill, collegiality and collaboration that occurs on Senate committees and the depth to which important issues affecting Australians are considered and dealt with on the committees, with a good attitude by all participants. I think the committees are a great opportunity to inquire into a range of important issues affecting Australians and, because of that, I think it is appropriate that there be a democratic representation on those committees in respect of the chairs.


I want to come to my qualifications. I think it is important and I think I do need to be accountable in terms of putting those on the record. I believe I am well suited to this role. I was admitted as a legal practitioner in 1984 and, over the 26 years since then, I have carried out a very broad range of roles. In two states of Australia and also in the UK I have worked as a solicitor and legal practitioner. As well as that, my work has spanned private practice, community work, legal decision making, mediation and teaching. As a result of this broad spectrum of legal work, I believe I have a uniquely broad understanding and insight into the various components which contribute to our strong legal culture in Australia and our adherence to the important and crucial concept of the rule of law. I worked in the civil litigation system as a private practitioner, when I worked in the country. So I also have the experience of being a generalist working with country people in Ballarat. At that time I worked in family law, and I did minor criminal work, but I particularly worked with workers' compensation and personal injury litigation—so I got an interesting and quite deep insight into the difficulties and challenges of civil litigation.


I then went to work in a community legal centre with the Tenants Union legal service. Through that role I gained an understanding of the importance of community legal centres and that movement, and the way they offer an opportunity of access to justice for many Australians, including those who are disadvantaged and would not have any ability to prosecute their legal rights in the absence of those important centres and that sector.


I then went to work in London, in the Borough of Hackney, where I worked with the trauma of child welfare law for a London council department. I experienced there the challenges of a London council with very high needs but few resources.


I have worked in the role of an investigating and conciliation solicitor with the Legal Practitioners Conduct Board in South Australia, and that gave me an insight into the regulation of the legal profession, the handling of concerns about misconduct on the part of legal practitioners and dealing with complaints from the public.


Finally, I think it is important to note that I have been a legal decision maker on three different tribunals, including 10 years on the Residential Tenancy Tribunal and 13 years as a Deputy President of the Guardianship Board in South Australia, which gave me an opportunity to conduct hearings of an extremely sensitive and difficult nature involving people with mental illnesses and disabilities and form views about the appropriateness of appointing decision makers for people who are no longer able to make their own decisions by virtue of mental incapacity. It was important work; it involved considering people's legal rights in a range of ways, and it involved hearing evidence from people who were vulnerable and often had difficulty communicating. Through my work on tribunals I developed skills in conducting hearings, listening carefully to witnesses and weighing up evidence in order to make considered decisions that were then subject to appeal and had to be justified.


Obviously, these are all matters which go to the effectiveness of chairing a Senate committee. As I said, for the last four months I have had the opportunity of observing the Senate committee system, and I have been very impressed with the goodwill and collaboration that I have seen. Committees are one of the most valuable and constructive aspects of the Senate's work and I am committed to participating and playing my part in that. If I am elected to the Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee I would look forward to working with senators across the political spectrum. I have a commitment to dealing with matters openly, fairly and on their merits. I believe that my experience and track record stands me in good stead with this, and I look forward to investigating the important legal issues and helping the chamber fulfil our worthy role as a house of review.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (11:26):  The Senate has very important constitutional responsibilities. The Senate has a very important job to do as part of the checks and balances on government power. The Senate has a job to do to scrutinise the activities and the performance of government, to hold the government to account—that is what the Australian people expect us to do. Naturally, opposition senators are more enthusiastic about ensuring that the activities of government are properly scrutinised than government senators are. And that is of course the way the system has been designed; that is how it is meant to operate.


Senate references committees are a key tool for the Senate in its pursuit of its responsibilities of scrutinising the activities and performance of government. So when we as a Senate make a decision about who should chair a Senate references committee, it is not just about a job for an individual senator; it is about the chair of that committee helping the Senate fulfil its core constitutional responsibilities in scrutinising the activities of government and holding the government to account.


The Greens are a party of government. The Greens have lost all their enthusiasm for scrutinising the activities of government, for holding the government to account, for ensuring that we have open and transparent government. The Greens used to be enthusiastic about scrutinising the activities of government, about holding the government to account. The Greens used to be an enthusiastic opposition party in the Senate. Between 1996 and 2007 the Greens were very enthusiastic about scrutinising the activities of government and holding the government to account. Even between 2007 and 2010 the Greens were still somewhat committed to scrutinising the activities of government. But ever since they signed that little piece of paper, ever since Prime Minister Gillard and Senator Bob Brown met in front of that little table, signed that little piece of paper, signed the alliance agreement—since they joined together to form the government of Australia—they have lost all enthusiasm for holding the government to account.


Look no further than the Greens' conduct in this chamber. There used to be a day when the Greens were completely opposed to the use of the gag. There used to be a time when the Greens thought it was evil to guillotine debate—it was anti-democratic. Now, whenever the Greens are unhappy about where a particular debate is going, whenever the Greens are unhappy that the government is too much on the back foot, is under too much pressure because the Senate is scrutinising the activities and performance of government, because the Senate is holding the government to account, the Greens are at the front of the queue when it comes to gagging debate, when it comes to guillotining debate, when it comes to preventing the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities of holding the government to account. The Greens used to be in favour of openness and transparency in government. In fact, we were led to believe that the inclusion of the Greens as part of this Labor-Green government—with its Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Conroy, who is here in the chamber—was going to be a new era of openness and transparency. What a disappointment that has been. The Greens are now working very hard to help with the cover-up. There has been cover-up after cover-up by a secretive government.


If the Greens were truly committed to openness and transparency in government, why didn't they join the coalition in forcing the government to release all of the information about the mining tax revenue estimates? Why didn't the Greens join the coalition in forcing the government to release all of the information about their carbon tax modelling? Why do the Greens vote again and again with the Labor Party in preventing the Senate getting information out of the government about the activities of government? It is because the Greens political party are an integral part of this government. They have lost all enthusiasm for the job of holding the government to account. Yes, the Greens were successful at the last election. Their representation in this chamber increased and there is a case for the Greens getting additional chairs, but they should not be chairs of the references committees. These committees are part of the Senate activities in holding the government to account; they are there to be filled by enthusiastic opposition senators focused on scrutinising the activities of government. The Greens should get the government chairs on those committees.


People across the community need to understand that there are effectively two committees for each area of policy responsibility. There are legislation committees, chaired by government senators, and there are references committees, chaired by opposition senators. The Greens are a party of government and the increased representation of the Greens in this chamber should be reflected by an increase in their representation in government chairs of legislation committees. But this is not what the Greens are all about. 


Senator Ludlam, who has just been relieved as Acting Deputy President by Senator Cameron, has talked in the past about his commitment to increased openness and transparency from government. That was before the 2010 election. Since the 2010 election Senator Ludlam, along with every single one of the other Greens senators, has been part of the cover-up. He has been part of this constant push by the Labor Party to keep information away from the public. References committees are a very important tool for the Senate to pursue the government and get access to information the government is not readily prepared to release or put in the public domain. Remember, this is part of the deal that the Labor Party signed with the Greens to form a government. There was a clause in there: we were going to have an Information Commissioner. Do you remember that? The Information Commissioner was going to settle disputes between the Senate and the executive government about the release of information when the government refused to put particular information into the public domain. The Greens said there was going to be huge achievement, huge progress and a huge increase in openness and transparency, because the Greens had convinced the Labor Party that the Information Commissioner was going to settle disputes between executive government and the Senate about the release of information that the executive government wanted to keep secret. What has happened to that? We are now 15 months down the track—about halfway through this term of government—and the Information Commissioner is still not in a position where he can fulfil that role. They are just empty words in that particular agreement. It is another example demonstrating the Greens' total lack of enthusiasm for scrutinising the activities of government.


The Labor Party clearly likes the fact that the Greens would take away a chair position from the opposition. It is very convenient for a government that is secretive and non-transparent, that is a bad government that has a lot to cover-up and does not want the pesky scrutiny of an effective references committee with an effective opposition chair who is enthusiastic and committed to scrutinising the activities of a bad government. They would much rather have one of their buddies chair a references committee. If one of their buddies from the Greens chairs a references committee it is going to be much easier to deal with; it is going to be a lot less hard work. They are going to be much less on the backfoot having to provide information that they would rather not have out in the public domain. There are all these stuff-ups out there by the government; there is a lot of information the government wants to keep secret. If you look at the performance of the Greens over the last 15 months, my suspicion is that the Greens will continue to be complicit in helping the Labor Party cover up whatever they can get away with. That is not in the Senate's best interests and not in our national interest.


The Constitution has designed the checks and balances in our system, the checks and balances on government power. The way the Senate is supposed to operate with government parties and opposition parties is clearly for opposition parties to do the best they can holding government to account and scrutinising their performance, and for the government to govern. The Greens are trying to have it both ways. They are trying to be the government and they are trying, badly, to be the opposition as well. And they cannot. That is a schizophrenic approach to the operation of this chamber that is not going to work.


The Labor Party is so keen to have a Green senator chair an opposition committee that the government is moving the appoint­ment. Why are the Greens not putting this proposition to the Senate? That particular question is a very good question that was raised by an earlier speaker. Why is it that a Labor minister—the Manager of Govern­ment Business in the Senate, no less—is moving this appointment of a government senator representing the Greens to be the chair of what is supposed to be an opposition dominated committee. Why is that? No doubt it is because, in this area, the govern­ment is very, very keen to have less scrutiny, to have less pesky questions asked and to have a less enthusiastic pursuer of bad government policy. They want somebody who is going to be part of the government team to take some of the heat off the government, and that is not in our public interest.


The question has been asked: if the Greens want another committee chair, why aren't they focusing on their core business? They want to make people believe that their core business is about caring for the environment. But we all know that is a ruse, we all know that is to make themselves respectable with the mainstream across the Australian community. And it probably has worked to a degree, sadly. People have not really seen the true face of the Greens. But this move today actually shows what really makes the Greens tick. It is not the environment, it is not doing the right thing on so-called green issues, what makes the Greens tick is a social agenda that does not have mainstream support across the Australian community. Therefore they are forever looking for opportunities to weasel their way in, to sneak their way in. In fact, I would be very interested to know what their intended agenda is going to be once they control the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. I just wonder what Senator Ursula Stephens thinks about a Greens senator driving and controlling the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee agenda. Where are the good people in the Labor Party who I know are privately concerned, the same as coalition senators are, about many of the loopy ideas that the Greens want to pursue? Where were they when the Labor Party made the decision to give them this key strategic role where they are going to be able to bring one loopy idea after another before this chamber? Where are they? Silent.


I have to say that people across Australia are increasingly concerned about who is driving this agenda. They know that this is a government with the green tail wagging the red dog. They know that the Greens are running the show and they are concerned about it. None of the issues that we are debating at the moment are issues initiated by the government, whether it is the carbon tax, whether it is gay marriage, whatever it is. It is either the Greens or some Independent that is forcing the government's hand. This Labor dog is just doing as they are told by their Greens and Independent tail. I can tell you that people across Australia are increasingly concerned about it. This move today is just another move that will reduce the level of scrutiny, the level of pressure on executive government that would come from this chamber, which will lead to inferior public policy outcomes. That is not in the national interest.


Like others, I do not really know Senator Wright all that well. I have had a look at her biography on the parliamentary website and I have listened carefully to what she has had to say this morning and she clearly has extensive legal experience. However, she does not have much experience in this chamber. In fact, she does not have much experience as a member of parliament more generally. She has been here for four months and I am sure that throughout her career she will make a fine contribution for her party. Like all of us, it takes a while to get into the job and to learn all the ropes and to learn how to properly perform these sorts of leadership responsibilities as part of the Senate. But what I do know is that Senator Gary Humphries has been a senator for nine years, has been a member of the ACT Legislative Assembly for 14 years, has been a Chief Minister and has been the Attorney-General of the ACT for six years. He is a distinguished parliamentarian and of course, above everything, he is part of the opposition and he is an enthusiastic opposition senator who is enthusiastic about scrutinising the activities of government, which is the job of the chair of the committee. This is not about a job for Senator Humphries. Senator Humphries has clearly got the credentials, the track record and the experience to be a very effective chair of the legal and constitutional committee, as he has been in recent times. But more important than anything is that, given the responsibilities of the Senate, given the responsibilities of Senate references committees as part of our overall role to hold the government to account and scrutinise the activities of government, he will be more motivated to do a good job.


This is not a reflection on Senator Wright as an individual senator, this is a reflection on the position she holds as part of the government. Senator Wright will clearly be less enthusiastic about probing and actively pursuing the activities of this government. I see Senator Wright shaking her head and I admire her idealism. But the truth of the matter is that she will find out very quickly that she will not be in charge of her own destiny in relation to this. She is part of a Labor-Green alliance in government. Senator Bob Brown and Senator Christine Milne will tell her very quickly if she gets out of line. If she is seen to be giving the government too much grief, you watch how quickly Senator Brown and Senator Milne on behalf of Prime Minister Gillard are going to come down on her like a tonne of bricks. There is absolutely no way that a Greens senator who is part of this government is going to be as enthusiastic in scrutinising the activities and performance of this bad government as a senator representing the coalition in this place. And for the coalition there clearly is no senator better equipped to lead the work of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee than Senator Humphries.


That is why the coalition strongly opposes the motion that was moved on behalf of the Labor-Green government by the manager of the Labor-Green government's business in the Senate, Senator Ludwig. That is why, even though we do not agree with giving the Greens, who are part of the government, an opposition position, which will lessen the level of scrutiny of the government, in a spirit of generosity and cooperation we have suggested an amendment which would see the Greens be able to take responsibility for their core area of interest, which we are led to believe is to focus on environmental issues around Australia. Clearly they could not care less about the environment. Not only did they first demand the position of Chair of the Community Affairs References Committee, which has responsibility for a wide range of social policy issues, unrelated to the environment; their second priority is the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which has got nothing to do with the environment whatsoever. This is showing their true colours. As Senator Joyce said earlier, their true priority is to focus, through this particular mechanism, on social engineering and social agendas that are widely opposed across the Australian community. 


This is a dark day when it comes to the Senate's role in scrutinising the activities of government. This is a day when the Senate's capacity to hold a bad government to account will be lessened if this motion gets up. (Time expired)

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2011-11-02,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:46):  Colleagues, for the last little while I have been coming into this place day after day and thinking that it cannot really get any more pear shaped under the Labor-Greens-Independents government. But today we have it. It has got even more pear shaped. You are quite right, I say to Senator Cormann, to call it a dark day. Here we have another one. 


When I came into this place one of the things that struck me was the sense of process. One of the very daunting things when you first come into this place is understanding the processes of the Senate, because so many of them are by convention: you cannot read them in the standing orders; you cannot read them in Odgers. It takes some time to understand the process. While you get an understanding of the process, you also gain a real respect for the process. I think that is one of the most important things about the Senate. Not having spent time in the other place, I cannot really comment on whether they have that same respect for the process. Perhaps those colleagues who have been there, such as Senator Ronaldson, might be able to comment on that at some stage. I very much feel the weight of the respect for the chamber. 


So when we have a situation today, with the nomination for the chair of a committee coming through the government of the day in the Senate chamber rather than through the normal processes, where the committees themselves determine their chairs—as should be the case—it is really quite extraordinary. The respect that should be held for the Senate and the entire processes around that have simply disappeared. To go back to what our leader, Senator Abetz, said earlier—he was very eloquent indeed in his remarks—the role of the committee chairs is, in many respects, to hold the government to account. 


The very simple fact that we have here today is that this is about numbers. The Greens are saying that they are entitled to an extra chair of a committee because their numbers have increased in this chamber. That would be fine and that would be worthy and that would be appropriate if they were not part of the Labor government. This is the problem with the whole premise of what they are putting forward, because the Greens are no longer independent of the Labor Party. Therefore, they are not at liberty to count their numbers separately from the Labor Party. That is precisely why they are not entitled to a second chair. 


Having spent some time as whip and having worked very closely with the then Liberal whip—an excellent Liberal whip, Senator Parry, who has now moved on to Deputy President, having been replaced by the equally able Senator Kroger—I know that so much of the chamber is run on numbers. Because we are in this place and we are respectful of this place, we do the numbers properly in terms of entitlement: what we are entitled to cross-party, what we are entitled to in opposition and what we are entitled to in government. There is a respect for that process and there is an understanding that, even if sometimes we do not like it, what the numbers say leads to the true entitlement. That is why it is so appalling today to see the Greens try to commandeer another chair, because they are simply not entitled to it. The numbers do not stack up that way, because they have given the Australian people a Labor government. 


If the Greens had not agreed to be part of the Labor-Greens-Independent government after the last election, we would not have a Labor minority government now. So, colleagues, by the very simple fact that the Greens agreed to be part of that government—that incredibly bad Labor-Greens-Independent government—they have forgone their right to use their numbers to try and commandeer another chair. That is not hysterical. That is not coming from this side of the chamber railing against the fact that the Greens should not have that position. It is a logical, numerical deduction. Those on the crossbenches cannot, on the one hand, choose to say that they are part of the minority government, and then, on the other hand, choose to say, for the purposes of gaining another chair, 'We, for this particular moment, choose to sit outside of the government arrangement that we have entered into.' It simply does not make sense. The Greens are doing this only because they can and because the government is letting them. As my very good colleague Senator Cormann and other colleagues have asked before me, why is it that the government has moved for the Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References to go to a Greens senator? Why didn't the Greens come and do it? Why didn't the Greens themselves walk into this chamber and put what they believe, through their somewhat erroneous counting of the numbers and putting their numbers the way that they have, to the chamber? Why didn't the Greens come into this chamber and say, 'We believe we are entitled to an extra chairmanship'? Why didn't the Greens do it? Why did the Greens have to hide behind the Labor government and let the Labor government move it? 


It is incongruous. It does not make sense. If the Greens are arguing that their numbers, separate from the Labor Party, entitle them to another chair's position, that means it is an issue entirely separate from the Labor government. So why on earth would the Labor government be moving it on their behalf? I cannot even imagine why they would do that, except for the fact that they are in cohort, working together, which again negates the claim for the extra chairmanship.


Colleagues, as the Greens had increased their numbers by a few in the Senate—a sad day for Australia that was, but we'll get to that at another election—wouldn't you have thought that they would have come in and said, 'We think on our numbers we should have another chair,' put it to the chamber and expected the Labor government to then agree with them? That seems to me to be what the normal process should have been. That seems the proper process to follow. But no. We have the Labor government moving the nomination on behalf of the Greens for something that should have been a decision of the committee. It is quite extraordinary. As I said at the outset, it is yet another pear shaped day in the Senate chamber. 


You only have to look at this situation to see that the Greens are trying to have it both ways. On the one hand they want to say they are part of the government. They want to say they are doing all these things and having all these outcomes by being part of the government. Yet on the other hand they want to say: 'Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no—we're independent of the Labor Party. We're not with them. We are our own Greens party.' It is absolute rubbish and it really does show what we have known all along and what is only just starting to come out now that there is starting to be some scrutiny of the Greens now we have this Labor-Greens-Indepen­dents alliance: there is one rule for the Greens and another rule for anybody else. One thing is okay for them, but there is a different expectation for anybody else. As one of my colleagues said earlier, if we on this side miss a division it is the end of the world and the Greens rail on and on about how terrible it is, but if Senator Brown misses a division that is perfectly okay; there is a perfectly sensible reason for that. That is only one example. 


Thank goodness there is finally starting to be some scrutiny of what the Australian Greens actually do and what they actually say, because they have gotten away for far too long with not having any scrutiny of their activities, of their policy and of what they are doing here in the Senate chamber. Isn't it extraordinary? We have seen the Greens in the past railing against the proper processes of the Senate not happening, but what did we see just a couple of weeks ago, when the carbon tax bills were first brought to the Senate? We saw the government guillotine the debate. Debate ensued, as the phrase has it, on all sides, all around the chamber, and then we had Senator Siewert stand up and give us a dissertation on how dreadful it was that the coalition had in the past guillotined debate in this chamber, how awful it was. Then she supported the guillotine. The entire Greens party supported the guillotine. Why was that, I wonder, given that obviously they have the deeply held belief that the guillotine should never be used? We have heard them speak about it in the chamber before. I know: it was because the Greens are part of the Labor government. Isn't that funny? So Senator Siewert stood there railing about the guillotine and how terrible it was that we were using it and then she voted against the government. To me it would make perfect common sense for the Greens to then vote against the Labor government. But, oh, no—they could not do that, because they are in government. They are in government with the Labor Party.


That is precisely why they are not entitled to this chairmanship position. They are simply not entitled to it, because they are part of the government. You have to count numbers on the other side of the chamber together because they are the government. We do it on this side of the chamber. We are two separate parties in coalition, and our numbers are counted collectively. That makes perfect sense. Within the coalition the Nats have a certain number of senators. We deal with that as the numbers of the whole Senate on this Nationals and coalition side, and we are entitled to certain positions. Exactly the same thing should happen on the government side of the chamber because the Greens and the Labor Party are in government. They are the government numbers. They are total numbers. They are not separate from the Labor Party. There are 39 of them on that side of the chamber. There are nine Greens and 30 Labor. They should be counted together—they are government—and then the chairs should be divvied up. The Greens cannot be treated as separate.


If, as we expect, we are going to be in the position where the Greens are granted a second chair of committee—and for those of you listening out there who are thinking: 'What's all this hoopla about committees?' it is really important that this process is followed properly because those committees do an enormous amount of work and it has to be balanced—if we accept that the government is going to put this through, the real question for the people out there is: why is it that the Greens have chosen legal and constitutional affairs? I note that Senator Collins over there is in fierce defence of the Greens.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Why did you knock them off? This is such hypocrisy.




Senator NASH:
  I will take the interjection because it shows it even more, colleagues. When we have Labor ministers on the other side of the chamber in defence of the Greens, doesn't it carry more weight to the argument that they are in partnership, that they are in coalition? That is precisely why this extra chairmanship should not be granted.


That being the case, let us just have a look at what the Greens have chosen for their second committee: the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Com­mittee. Maybe I am missing something here, but when I think of the Greens I think about them talking about the environment. Colleagues, maybe you might think something different, but when I look at the Greens I think 'the environment'. It sort of goes, like 'horse' goes with 'saddle'. But they want the legal and constitutional affairs committee. Why would the party who call themselves the Australian Greens, who spend their time talking about the environment, not want the environment committee, particularly when the environ­ment committee also covers communica­tions—and I know that Senator Ludlam has a very keen and genuine interest in communications? Why would they not want the chair of the environment and communications committee? That simply does not make sense, and that says to the Australian people that the Greens are duplicitous, because if they truly were the party of the environment they would want to chair the environment committee. I do not think you have to be a rocket scientist to figure that out.


I think there would be a number of people who are listening at the moment, thinking: 'Why on earth don't the Greens want the environment committee? Why do they want the legal and constitutional affairs com­mittee?' This is a question to be asked of the Australian Greens. This is really serious. If the Greens' core business is the environment, why do they not want the environment committee? That, colleagues, is the question for the Australian Greens. You can only surmise, you can only deduce, that the reason they want the legal and constitutional affairs committee is for the purposes of their social agenda. We can only deduce from that that the Greens' social agenda takes priority over the environment.


I would say that there are a lot of people who have supported the Greens over past years—not that there are that many of them when you look at the whole perspective of Australia—who would think, rightly or wrongly, that they are the party of the environment, not that they are the party of the social agenda that they want to prosecute. And yet here today we have the Greens wanting the legal and constitutional affairs committee chairmanship, not the environ­ment committee chairmanship. Colleagues, I cannot for the life of me work that out. I tell you: I am starting to miss the Democrats, because at least they had the courage of their convictions. At least they were prepared to stand up for what they believed in, and at least they made a contribution to this chamber that was not part of a Labor-Greens-Independent government.


What an extraordinary day we have today, when the Leader of the Australian Greens—trying, of course, to upset the Nationals, as he likes to try to do—refers to a National as a 'poddy calf'. If that is the best that Senator Brown can do, I think he is going to have to come up with something a little better. I am a little more thick-skinned than that. I tend not to think of myself as a poddy calf. I thought Senator Brown might have been able to do a little better. What sort of pear shaped day is this? It is extraordinary that we see this situation.


The Greens also like to rail on about transparency and about the processes of the chamber, and yet, today, what do we see? We see that very process being undermined, that very process being manipulated to give an outcome to the government side of the chamber that should not be delivered. It simply should not be.


They know this on the other side of the chamber. They know the numbers do not stack up. They know that they are the government. They know the Greens are part of the coalition. They know. But this will show the Australian people the true face of the Greens. We are seeing today the real Greens. They are, as John Anderson, ex-Deputy Prime Minister, so eloquently put it many years ago, the watermelons: green on the outside and pink in the middle. When you chop a watermelon in half, Senator Ronaldson, you know as well as I do that there is a lot more red than there is green. And that is what has become so clear today, because the Greens have placed their social agenda as more important than their environmental concerns.


My colleagues and I on this side of the chamber have always suspected it. We have suspected that for a long time. But today it has been proven. Today we have the proof that the Greens' social agenda is more important than their environmental agenda. The reason I say that, and the reason that that cannot be argued against, is that they have chosen to take the chairmanship of the legal and constitutional affairs committee and not the chairmanship of the environment com­mittee. This might seem a small issue, but this is a huge, watershed day. This is the day that the Greens showed that they are not an environmental party. This is about their social agenda. This is about social engineering. This is about their social agenda, and we have seen the true Greens today.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (12:07):  I want to reflect on what I thought was a quite undignified spectacle today, about which I hope, on reflection, there will be some regret. I will preface my comments by saying this. Senator Wright and I go back, in the loosest sense, to her days in Ballarat and we do share that aspect. But it was an undignified spectacle today when a new member of this place had to stand up and justify their appointment. What we saw today was one candidate being forced by her leadership to justify her appointment, when the person who should be in the role and who was then sitting behind me, Senator Humphries, had no such requirement to justify his record and his role because his record stood for itself. I hope that Senator Bob Brown reflects on this undignified spectacle today. I hope Senator Brown reflects on what he has forced one of his own to do—to stand up in this chamber and read out her CV to justify this very grubby deal. Senator Brown—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—if that is the way you are going to conduct yourself in this chamber and if that is the pressure that you are going to put your own members under, then I think you need to very much reflect on what has occurred today.


There have been a number of discussions, quite rightly, about the utter hypocrisy of the Australian Greens, but I do not want to repeat those comments. What I do want to talk about today is not those who sit at the other end of the chamber but those who sit opposite us. I say to the Australian Labor Party: are you aware of the extraordinary damage that you are doing to yourselves with this unholy alliance? I know a number of people on the other side of the chamber—not down the other end but on the other side of the chamber—who do not support the Greens' four pillars and do not support the Greens' desire for death duties, and we can run through all their loopy economic policies.




Senator Brandis:
  Compulsory vegetarianism!




Senator RONALDSON:
  Yes, we can run through all of them, and I know there are many on the other side who do not share those ideas. We have got an unholy alliance that will end up eating the party that drove its implementation. The Australian Labor Party will be eaten by this group of nine here and one in the other place. The Australian Labor Party will be eaten by this alliance. It is absolutely fascinating to reflect on the signing ceremony—




Senator Brandis:
  For civil unions.




Senator RONALDSON:
  Yes. If this signing ceremony had been done after the decision by the Independents as to who would form the government then you might say this was a marriage of convenience, but indeed it was not. This signing ceremony was done before the decision of the Independents was known, so this is no false marriage; this is no accident. This was a deliberate decision by the Australian Labor Party to hop into bed with the Australian Greens. There is a very old saying, as you would be acutely aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, that if you sleep with dogs you wake up with fleas. The fleas on the body of the Australian Labor Party will not be small ones; they will be very substantial lumps. We are already seeing the impact of the fleas on the body of what was a great political party, not one that I agree with philosophically but one that has served a very useful purpose in the political process and one that took some decisions, particularly in the early nineties under Hawke and Keating, which I actually thought were good for this country—and I will give credit where credit is due—to open up this economy. So I have given them their due, but the once great Australian Labor Party with this unholy alliance finds itself with a primary vote of 29 per cent. If there is not one senator opposite—not down the back but opposite—who does not think for one minute that part of that is due to this unholy alliance then they are utterly delusional.


We know what the other part is. The other part is the great lie in Australian politics: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. That is part of the 29 per cent, but the other part of the 29 per cent is the Australian Labor Party ceding political ground to the Australian Greens for utter convenience in a desperate attempt to maintain government. We have seen, in a desperate attempt to show that the decision to change from one Prime Minister to another was appropriate, the Prime Minister of this country leave your political party, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, hanging out to dry, not for the short term and not for the medium term but for the long term. It is absolutely decision time now for the Australian Labor Party as to how you are going to conduct yourselves in relation to this relationship. We should not see another example like today's of an unseemly sight when a new senator is required to read their CV into Hansard to justify their position. That is unseemly and that is an exercise in complete and utter futility. As I said earlier, I hope that today's spectacle is not repeated in this place.


I will finish on this note, as I know my colleague Senator Brandis wants to speak as well. If this is not reflected upon today by those of you opposite, if you are not prepared to accept that this relationship and this unholy alliance have the ability to destroy the Australian Labor Party and if you are not prepared to stand up and say, 'We are not prepared to tolerate that,' then you will die by your own swords.




Senator Brandis:
  You will die the death of a thousand cuts.




Senator RONALDSON:
  Yes, the death of a thousand cuts. Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, I know that you are probably philosophically more aligned with the Greens. I also know that the majority of your colleagues in the right of the Australian Labor Party are not aligned with the Greens. The spectacle of the right wing of the Australian Labor Party rolling over to the Australian Greens, knowing what they stand for and knowing what the right of your political party stands for, was undignified for a party that had its roots not far away from where I live. Part of it was where I live. The Australian union movement and Creswick go back a long way, as the Acting Deputy President will know.


This is now a challenge for this political party. Is it going to let itself be destroyed by this alliance or is someone going to wake up at some stage and say, 'We are no longer prepared to see our great party destroyed by this unholy alliance—by this marriage.' This marriage is not driven by convenience; it is, regrettably for the Australian Labor Party, now driven by philosophical alignment. The challenge is there. I hope, for political process and for good government in this country, that the Australian Labor Party realises the damage it has done itself. I hope the Australian Labor Party does not let us have a repeat of what has occurred today.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:16):  I rise to close the debate on behalf of the opposition. I know that these decisions about committee allocations do not necessarily or even largely depend upon the merits of individual senators. I mean no disrespect to Senator Wright in what I am about to say, but if one considers the outcome of what is proposed to displace Senator Gary Humphries as the chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee with Senator Penny Wright, it is a travesty. It is preposterous. I have nothing against Senator Wright—I do not particularly know Senator Wright—but she has been a member of the Senate for four months. She has no experience as a senator to speak of in any respect. The fact that she was reduced to reading her CV onto the record earlier on was a humiliation for her.


I mean no personal disrespect to Senator Wright, but we are being asked to elect her as the chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, one of the most prestigious committees in this chamber, at the expense of Senator Gary Humphries, the only person in this Senate who has been a head of government in this country. He is a former Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory. He is the only person in this chamber who has ever been an attorney-general; Senator Humphries was for several years the Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory. With all due respect to Senator Wright—and this is not meant as a personal slight—to suggest that she is a more appropriate person to chair the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee with no experience as a senator and no experience in government, than former attorney-general and former chief minister Senator Gary Humphries, whose discharge of that role has commanded respect on both sides of this chamber, is ludicrous. There are very few people in this Senate, on either side or on the crossbench, who enjoy the respect that Senator Gary Humphries enjoys.


As I said at the start, these decisions do not turn largely upon the identities of individual senators. We need to see this for what it is: an attempt by the Greens, supported by a slavish government, to take over the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. It is nothing short of a naked power play, and Senator Wright is being used as a pawn in that naked power play.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Brandis, I am reluctant to interject here, but I think you are getting close to breaching standing order 193(3). You are reflecting continually on a senator in a manner that is not proper, and I ask you to bear that in mind.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I bear in mind your guidance, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am sure Senator Wright is a decent person, and I cannot fail to imagine that privately she would feel quite uncomfortable with the position in which she has been placed. This is a power play. Let nobody have any illusions about that. I follow on from some remarks that my friend Senator Michael Ronaldson made about what has driven this power play—that is, not merely the rise of the Greens but the invasion of the Australian government by the Greens.


In this peculiar time in Australian history we have an Australian Labor Party government whose agenda is dictated by the Greens. One of the many reasons we in the opposition regard this as an outrageous misuse of power is the Greens are not a crossbench party in any real sense of the word. They are to all intents and purposes an element, an essential ingredient, of this government, so much so that the government is in power today because of a written agreement executed by the Prime Minister and Senator Brown. No crossbench party has had more power over a government in our history than the Australian Greens have over this Labor government today. That is why we in the opposition say that committee chairmanships reserved for the crossbench parties ought not to be given to the Greens, because the Greens are not, except in a purely theoretical sense, a crossbench party; they are an integral part of the Gillard government.


I am, as some senators may be aware, something of a student of Australian political history and I have had many, many long and enjoyable discussions with my friend Senator John Faulkner about the history of the Australian Labor Party. I acknowledge that although the Australian Labor Party are my party's principal political antagonists the Australian Labor Party nevertheless—as Australia's oldest political party, having been formed during the shearers strike in Queensland in 1891, famously under the Tree of Knowledge in Barcaldine—have a long and honourable place in Australian political history. There are many of the great events of Australian history for which the Australian Labor Party was responsible. In particular, no-one will forget that it was a government of the Australian Labor Party, led by John Curtin, that took Australia through the most critical stages of the Pacific war.


Throughout the decades, we in the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have had bitter disputes on a range of different issues which have decided the course of the history of our nation. Most of the time, I say, the Liberal Party has been right, but some of the time I concede, because I am a generous person, the Labor Party has been right. But in the course of all of those decades the shape and course of Australian history have been charted by the debate between the coalition parties and the Australian Labor Party. Together, through the dialectical process of parliamentary debate and political argument, we have shaped the direction of this country, so that where Australia is today is in some sense the product of both our political traditions: the Liberal tradition and the Labor tradition.


The Australian Greens share no part of that tradition. There is no element of Australia today, the most successful and prosperous nation in the world, that is thanks to anything the Australian Greens have done—nothing—and yet at this particular strange, peculiar point in our nation's story all of a sudden the Greens, opportunistically seizing the circumstance of a hung parliament, have seized control of a Labor government and seized control of its agenda.


Let me give you two examples: the carbon tax and asylum seeker policy. Last year, of the 150 members elected to the House of Representatives at the 2010 election, 148 were elected on a promise not to introduce a carbon tax. Every member of the coalition, every member of the Australian Labor Party and most of the Independents were elected on an undertaking not to introduce a carbon tax. Yet today we are on the threshold of passing legislation in this chamber to introduce a carbon tax, because of the Greens and because of the undue influence the Greens have, the capacity of the Greens to exercise political duress over the Australian Labor Party.


The other great issue of the day is asylum seeker policy. At the 2010 election both the coalition and the Australian Labor Party went to the people promising to build their asylum seeker policy around the policy of offshore processing. Today we do not have offshore processing, once again because of the Greens. The two great issues of the day—a carbon tax and asylum seeker policy—have produced outcomes at variance from that which both sides of politics promised the Australian people only last year, because of the political duress that the Greens have been able to exercise over this government.


I join with my friend Senator Ronaldson in saying to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron—and you and I are quite friendly, we chide each other in the corridors; I can't help liking you, I am embarrassed to admit, though I might be one of the few—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I am at a great disadvantage here. You know it.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I do not say this in a chiding way; I say quite seriously to you, as someone who has given your life to the Australian Labor Party: be careful what you wish for, because these allies of yours at whose behest you formed government are your most lethal political enemies. They are more lethal political enemies for the Australian Labor Party than the coalition are, because we may be the alternative government but the Greens are the alternative party of the Left and they will eat you up, and I know that many, many of your colleagues are deeply concerned about it. Why do you think it is that today, among voters for the left, more than a third would prefer to vote for the Australian Greens than for the Australian Labor Party? That is what the latest opinion polls show: a Labor Party primary vote of 29 per cent and a Greens primary vote of 15 per cent. They have lost a third of their electoral base to these people—a third. If those figures are disaggregated by generation, a voter of left-wing sympathies who is under the age of 30 is just as likely to vote for the Greens as for the Australian Labor Party. And a voter under the age of 25 whose sympathies are with the left is actually more likely to vote for the Greens than to vote for the Australian Labor Party.


I know that the smart people in the Australian Labor Party are deeply, deeply worried about this trend—and so they should be. The Greens are not like the One Nation party in the 1990s, which was a fly-by-night phenomenon—largely a personality cult, driven by the circumstances of the time. The Greens are here to stay. With each passing year, like a flyblown sheep, the Labor Party will be hollowed out by the rise of the Greens. And they brought this upon themselves by being prepared to pay the 30 pieces of silver to Senator Bob Brown in order to get in to government after the 2010 election. The Australian Labor Party should be particularly ashamed and afraid of the new authoritarian tone that the Greens have brought to Australian politics, which Labor has embraced as the price of government.


Patrick Moore, one of the founders of Greenpeace, a few years ago was asked, 'What went wrong with the environmental movement?' He said:


… following the falling of the Berlin wall, and the end of the peace movement, and the end of radical socialist politics in the labor and women's movement, an awful lot of those people drifted into environmentalism. It's been highjacked by political and social activists who are using environmental rhetoric to cloak agendas that have more to do with anti-corporate and class warfare than they do with ecology or saving the environment.


That is the Greens. The mask of environ­mental concern has been stripped away. Nothing could demonstrate that more clearly, in a symbolic fashion, than this motion we are debating today to install a Greens senator with no credentials as the chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee of this Senate in place of a senator of experience who is respected by both sides.


The Greens will use that bully pulpit to prosecute a radical agenda, inconsistent with the values of not only the coalition side of the chamber but of most on the Labor side as well. The Australian Labor Party, for its many faults, has always been a party committed to democratic values. But the Greens are not committed to democratic values. They are a party of zealots. They are a party of cold-eyed fanatics. They are a party that embodies the authoritarian cast of mind. Nowhere can that be seen more clearly than in the fact that, with insouciance and glee, they are prepared to foist on the Australian people a vast new tax that both sides of politics promised at the election last year that they would not introduce.


The Australian Labor Party has embraced its most lethal political enemy. It has disregarded the advice that an appeaser is a person who keeps feeding the crocodile in the hope that he will be the last to be eaten. As I said before, by appeasing the Greens—by embracing them, by allowing the govern­ment's agenda to be dictated by the first truly authoritarian party we have seen represented in the Australian parliament—the Australian Labor Party have signed their own death warrant. They have ceded the ground of the so-called progressive left to their most lethal enemy, who are determined to displace them. Every time the Australian Labor Party goes along with a power play like this and rolls over for the Greens—meekly, timidly, reluctantly but inevitably—they execute, once again, that political death warrant.


So I will close the debate for the opposition by saying that the Senate is being presumed upon this afternoon by a travesty of a resolution, in furtherance of a power play of which, superficially, Senator Gary Humphries is the victim and the proper process of the Senate is the victim. But the true victim of the Greens is the Australian Labor Party and the political tradition it represents. In years to come, when historians write the history of these times and chart the decline of the Australian Labor Party—as, in decades to come, they will—they will locate this parliament and, in particular, the Labor-Greens alliance as the point at which that remorseless decline began.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (09:30):  On behalf of Senator Arbib, I move:


That, pursuant to standing order 25(9), the Senate determines:


   (a)   that the chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee shall be elected by that committee from members nominated by minor parties or independent senators; and


   (b)   that this order remain in effect until the President is duly notified of an agreement that meets the terms of standing order 25(9)(c).


I do not want to take up too much of the Senate's time since we have the continuation of the second reading debate on the clean energy package this morning. So I will be brief. This motion should not take up too much time as it is straightforward. It increases the number of chairs the Greens will hold on references committees. This is in line with previous practice of the Senate.


With the Greens having nine senators from July this year, it is appropriate to adjust their chairing role accordingly. I understand that the Greens raised this adjustment both informally and formally with the opposition—the opposition's response has not been positive—and finally the Greens raised it with the President, who in turn has brought it to the chamber to be resolved, hence the motion we are dealing with this morning. It would have been preferable for the committee itself to sort this matter out. Unfortunately, the committee was unable to settle it without reference to the chamber. That is why the motion is now before us.


Obviously there are differing interpretations of how Senate committee chairs should be allocated. I am certain the opposition will have an interesting inter­pretation to detail to the Senate, but let me outline the government's position on this, which is broadly in line with how the Senate committee system operated between 1994 and 2005. The Senate should have both legislation and references committees. The two sets of committees perform comple­mentary and valuable roles for the Senate. By convention, the government should chair all the Senate legislation committees and that continues. Chairing of the references committees is for the opposition and minor parties, with the opposition having the majority of these chairs, usually around six, and minor parties sometimes sharing and sometimes taking—depending on their proportion of representation in the Senate—both of the other two chairs. That is similar to the arrangement we had when the Australian Democrats were in this place and had similar numbers—nine seats. They were given the opportunity to chair two references committees. This motion reinstates this well-tested and successful allocation of chairs of Senate committees and I commend it to the chamber. 


As I said, it would have been preferable had the committee itself sorted this matter out, but unfortunately they were unable to and so it has been brought before the chamber for resolution. What we are now proposing is in line with the proportional representation of this chamber and such procedure has been in place for a very long time.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:35):  I move:


That the words ""Legal and Constitutional Affairs"" be removed and replaced with ""Environment and Communications"" so that paragraph (a) now reads:


(a) that the chair of the Environment and Communications References Committee shall be elected by that committee from members nominated by minor parties or independent senators.


With all the issues confronting this nation—the carbon tax, the mining tax, the border protection policy in disarray—what is the first item of business the government brings into the chamber today? Another committee chair for the Greens. That is what is at the front of the government's mind—to placate the Greens, to keep their alliance together. I say to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that in fact his party has a signed agreement with the Greens. Who can forget the spectacle of the table set out in the Prime Minister's courtyard, where Senator Brown and other Greens were sitting in their suits, wattle sprigs in their lapels? It had all the makings of a civil ceremony, of a marriage, in effect, between the Greens and the Labor Party.


The main issue we have been debating in recent times, the carbon tax, is proof positive. It was conceived out of that relationship because Labor had gone to the election saying that there would be no carbon tax. It is the Greens who have foisted the carbon tax on the Labor Party. Indeed, Mr Adam Bandt himself bragged about that in a media release which said that, when he met with Ms Gillard, he had said, 'There is one thing we need for an alliance and that is a price on carbon,' and she had said, 'Yes, deal done.'


Today another deal has been done between Labor and the Greens to give another Greens senator a $15,000 pay rise. Why are they giving it to a government alliance partner? These chairs should be going to genuine opposition parties. So for Senator Ludwig to come into this chamber and suggest that somehow the Greens should be seen as the Democrats were is absolutely and patently false because the Democrats never did a dirty deal with a government by signing up with them. They retained Don Chipp's motto—I know it is unparliamentary—which was 'Keep the bastards honest.' They would not side with either side but considered each issue on its merit—not so with the Australian Greens. They have signed up with the Australian Labor Party, and we have a Greens senator nodding in agreement. They have signed up.


What the Greens senators are now saying is, 'We want all the trappings and benefits of government and—whatever few there are—benefits of opposition as well.' This is, of course, typical of the Australian Greens. They love it both ways, don't they? Corporate donations are bad for political parties, unless it is a $1.6 million donation that the leader of the Greens himself negotiated. That is okay. If somebody happens to miss a division, that is bad. It shows a party in disarray—that is, of course, unless the leader of the Greens himself misses a division. That is different: it is all perfectly excusable, all perfectly understandable. 


So what we have yet again in this place today is the suggestion that the Greens should get all the benefits of government and whatever benefits there are of opposition. We as an opposition say that you have to be either fish or fowl in this game. You cannot try to be both. Of course, that is what the Australian Greens are seeking to do throughout. But we believe that, in fact, the Greens should not even have the Community Affairs References Committee chairmanship, because they are part and parcel of the government. To make sure this place operates, we as an opposition were willing to overlook that for the time being to allow the system to keep running as it was. However, now the Greens are moving the goalposts, as is always the case, seeking further and further benefits for themselves. We are going to take a stand on this. We are opposing it. 


It does not seem to be a coincidence that, of all the chairs that the Australian Greens could have chosen, the first one was the community affairs committee. I wonder why? Guess who the chairman of that committee was at the time? Senator Gary Humphries. We then say Senator Humphries is a very good man and should be chairing another Senate committee, and so he becomes the chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Com­mittee. Guess what? The Australian Greens say, 'Oh, we now want that committee as well.' Why are they in such hot pursuit of Senator Gary Humphries? It is because of his capacity to ensure that the Australian Greens do not win a Senate seat in the Australian Capital Territory, and so each and every time they seek to cut the ground from under Senator Gary Humphries. Can I say you will have to do better than that. You will have to have policies that actually resonate with the people of the Australian Capital Territory before you continue to pursue Senator Gary Humphries in this very ham-fisted way. 


But just to assist the Australian Greens and to keep faith with their electorate, we as an opposition are going to move that the words 'legal and constitutional' be deleted from the motion and replaced with the words 'environment and communications'. That will give the Australian Greens the opportunity to tell the Australian people whether the environment is actually their No. 1 issue or whether their social agenda is in fact their real motivation. Indeed, their vote on this amendment will be indicative of whether they are genuinely the watermelon party of the Australian political scene or simply using the green veneer, thin as it is, to cover up a big red centre of social engineering, which we have always said was the case. Today will be the test for the Australian Greens on whether their No. 1 item is the environment or whether it is social engineering and that is why they have been in such hot pursuit of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee chairmanship. 


The Australian Greens, who always want everything, who always move the goalposts, today will be given a free kick by the opposition in relation to the committee of their choice. We will, of course, oppose the Greens getting two committees. We believe they do not deserve one because they have signed up with the government and any committee chairmanships they want should be resolved in their Monday morning meetings between Senator Brown and Ms Gillard when they talk about all the affairs of the nation. I would have thought Senator Brown and Ms Gillard could have come to a solution in relation to this and determined which of the Labor chairs they would be taking. But here we have the Australian Greens wanting to take that which rightfully belongs to the opposition. We will give the Australian Greens the opportunity to vote whether or not they want an environment committee or the legal and constitutional committee. We will be opposing the suggestion that they should be entitled to these two committees. Senator Humphries—



Senator Carol Brown interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  It is a good interjection by Senator Carol Brown as to where Senator Humphries goes next, because one thing I do know is that Senator Humphries will continue to go up and up in the estimation of the people of the Australian Capital Territory and amongst his colleagues and in this place. That will continue to happen irrespective of the Labor Party and the Greens colluding to try to give the Greens a leg-up for another Senate seat in the Australian Capital Territory. To think that the Australian Greens have combined and colluded with the Australian Labor Party to form a government and now somehow claim that they are not part of the government and should get some of the spoils of opposition is indicative of the duplicitous and hypocritical stance they take.


We believe very strongly that this duplicity by the Australian Greens, which seems to know no end, needs to be explored and ventilated so the Australian people get to see what the Australian Greens actually stand for. Some of us get sick and tired from time to time of the puff pieces we see in the Australian media about the Australian Greens. I cannot help but remember the puff piece in the 'hate' media, the Weekend Australian, about Senator Brown and his nice house at Liffey. There were lovely pictures and panoramic views, but something caught my attention in the panoramic view. There was also a nice picture inside the house and something else caught my attention. I thought, 'How does this stand up against the Greens policy of not using wood waste for energy and biomass?' Do you know what was in that panoramic view? Smoke coming out of the chimney at Senator Bob Brown's house. Do you know what caught my eye in the view of his lounge room? The log fire—one of the most inefficient ways to heat a house. But, again, we should not be surprised. People should not be allowed to have wood fires! They should not be allowed to have biomass! Industry should not be allowed to! But, of course, Senator Bob Brown should because Senator Bob Brown is different. All those rules which he seeks to apply to everyone else should not apply to Senator Bob Brown because Senator Brown is the Leader of the Australian Greens. Senator Bob Brown is different and, therefore, the Australian Greens should be treated differently. Of course the list of hypocrisy and duplicity goes on and on.


That is why the Pecksniffian attitude of the Australian Greens needs to be exposed for all to see. The duplicity is there for all to see and today is another example of it. But what is most humiliating in all of this is that the Labor Party would stoop to do their dirty work, that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate would make this move in the Senate for and on behalf of the Australian Greens. There is no sense of shame and no sense of being independent from the Australian Greens. They are doing the dirty work for the Australian Greens, at a time when the Australian Greens are trying to say, 'We aren't really part of the govern­ment; we are really part of the opposition for this debate.' If that is the case, if they are not part of the government, why is it that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate is moving the motion? Why didn't the Australian Greens move it for and on behalf of themselves? Because the Australian Labor Party will do anything and say anything to placate the Australian Greens. And of course they will distort themselves to do it, as they have done in relation to the carbon tax—a tax which the Australian people do not want and that Ms Gillard is willing to implement just to keep the Australian Greens happy.


We were told by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that he would not seek to delay the Senate for long in relation to this issue. I know why—he had no feathers to fly with. There is no justification for the government to do this. There is no argument. So I suppose that is the easiest thing to do if you have no arguments at all. Even if the highly paid spin doctor that the Labor Party got from Tony Blair cannot spin you the lines to try to justify this one, the best thing to do I suppose is to sit down, shut up and hope that nobody notices. Bad luck, Senator Ludwig and bad luck to the Australian Labor Party. We have noticed. Even your highly paid spin doctor from the United Kingdom could not spin you out of this one. He could not give you a form of words to even fill in half of the time that was allocated to you to justify this unprincipled move in support of your Greens alliance partners.


For the Senate to work and for the Senate to work appropriately, you need give and take. You need to accept that there has to be cooperation. That is why, for example, tomorrow the coalition have very graciously given the government time—the private members' time usually allocated to us—for the purposes of the carbon tax debate. That is why, given that there was a heritage issue in relation to the community affairs committee, we were not willing to push the boundaries in relation to Senator Siewert's chairmanship and we were willing to allow that to go through to the keeper. Now, despite the cooperation that they get from the coalition day after day, hour by hour in this place, they are throwing all that cooperation into our face and saying: 'We don't care about all that cooperation. We won't agree with your support in making this chamber move as it should. We will throw all that into your face and take another chairmanship from the opposition for a government alliance partner senator.' If that is the way the Australian Labor Party want to play the game, so be it.


We will continue to be cooperative. We will continue to be a responsible opposition. But what we will do on a regular basis is highlight when the hapless Manager of Government Business in the Senate has to move motions for and on behalf of the Greens because the Greens are too embarrassed to do it for themselves. Why the Australian Labor Party would stoop to such a low level today and make this the No. 1 item for today just beggars belief? The Australian people listening to this broadcast, few though there may be, will know that the top order business for today for the Australian Labor Party government is to give the Greens another chairmanship. Why the Labor Party would stoop so low one does not know. Why don't we know? Because the minister himself was not willing to use the allocated time to try to justify why the Australian Labor Party was doing it.



Senator Ludwig interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  The minister just interjected and said, 'Because we should be talking about the clean energy package.' You know what? I absolutely agree. I am in heated agreement. So it begs the question: why the urgency to move this motion today during a period when we should be debating the clean energy package? Why couldn't you have deferred it until next year, after the clean energy package? Because you wanted to do another deal. It is another down payment on this dirty deal that the Australian Labor Party have done with the Australian Greens.


It is always the way, isn't it, with blackmailers? One demand will be made and as soon as you have succumbed to that the next demand is made and then the next. We know what the first demand in this blackmail was. What was it? It was the carbon tax. The second one was to ruin the Tasmanian forest industry and throw thousands of Tasmanians out of work. We know that that was another part of the blackmailing, and now we have the third example. The Greens are saying: 'We demand a new chairmanship. We want another chairmanship, but we will not be moving it. You, the Australian Labor Party, will move it for and on behalf of the Australian Greens.' The Labor Party will bear all the opprobrium so that when it is passed with a combined vote the Greens can say: 'We didn't really want it. It was the Labor Party that moved it and it was foisted upon us.'


The arrogance of the Australian Greens knows no bounds. We read about this move and that a particular senator would be given the chairmanship before the Senate had the motion before it, because the Greens were bragging about this new chairmanship in the media clips yesterday. They were already bragging about their achievement, pre-empting the vote of the Senate, which indicates they had done a deal with the Labor Party. They were pre-empting the vote of the Senate and they are now dealing with this place with the same sort of arrogance that the Australian Labor Party does. That is why it is quite appropriate that they sign this formal agreement, that is why they are an alliance and that is the reason they do not deserve a second chairmanship. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2011-11-02,"



Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:55):  One thing Senator Abetz can never be accused of is boxing above the belt. The amendment moved by Senator Abetz, which proposes that the Greens be given the chair of the environment and communications committee, says two things. Firstly, it says that Senator Abetz and the coalition agree that a second chair of a committee should be given to the Australian Greens. That is very clear. It is written in this amendment. It also says that the determination of the chair should be made by the opposition. That is nowhere in the history of the Senate. What is proposed here is a very reasonable move for the Greens, with nine members in the Senate, to chair two of the committees. That is exactly the arrangement that the Howard government, which included Senator Abetz, made with the Democrats. When there were nine Democrat senators they had two chairs. That is exactly the parity that the Greens are seeking and that the government has accommodated through this motion.


I propose to amend the amendment moved by Senator Abetz to replace the words 'removed and replaced' with the word 'augmented' and, in section (a), to insert the words 'legal and constitutional affairs and' before the word 'environment'. This would effectively use the talent bank in the Greens ranks. I want to compromise with Senator Abetz here. I come here in a spirit of give and take with Senator Abetz. He has put up a very fine idea. I think it is a very good idea from Senator Abetz. It recognises that there is a talent bank here in the which should be tapped. He is proposing that the chair of another committee as well be taken by the Greens. I will not get into discriminating among the people in my ranks, but I could name a number of them who could take up Senator Abetz's worthy option. I see some here that I would nominate to that position of chair. So, in a spirit of compromise with Senator Abetz, I propose that his option be taken up and that we also take another chair. I move:


That the words ""Legal and Constitutional Affairs"" be augmented with ""Environment and Communications"" so that paragraph (a) now reads:


(a)   that the chairs of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs and Environment and Communications References Committee shall be elected by that committee from members nominated by minor parties or independent senators; and


When it comes to the history of chairs in this place, you simply have to look at what happened between 2004 and 2007, when the Howard government, including Senator Abetz, got control of the Senate, to see what an extraordinary piece of hypocrisy this is from Senator Abetz. They then used their numbers to take over every committee in the place—the whole lot—leaving none to the opposition and the crossbench of the time. Senator Abetz now has the hide to come in here and say that this is in some way or another a travesty, that it is somehow out of keeping or out of whack with Senate form.



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator BOB BROWN:
  The poddy calves are braying in the National Party component of Senator Abetz's coalition now.



Senator Nash interjecting—




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Yes, I was. And so Senator Abetz—




Senator Nash:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I would ask that Senator Bob Brown withdraw the reference to me as a poddy calf.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  I do not think the reference was made directly to you, Senator Nash.




Senator Nash:
  It was.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  I do not think there is a point of order. Senator Brown, you have the call.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  If it helps the senator, I loved feeding poddy calves straight out of a bucket in other parts of my career.


It is the case that the opposition's record in this place when utilising the talent right around the Senate in the committee system, particularly for the chairs of committees, was usurped in a way that will go down in the blacker annals of abuse of parliament in those years where the Howard government, after getting control of both houses of parliament, appointed to itself the chair of every committee in the place. We are not proposing that, even though there would be the numbers in here to do that if the government and the crossbench so decided. But we are proposing that the talent of the crossbench be utilised in the chair. I propose that Senator Penny Wright would be an admirable chair of this committee.




Senator Abetz:
  We read about her in the paper yesterday.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  I am glad to know that Senator Abetz reads the Adelaide Advertiserand reads it carefully. Senator Wright's legal career has included work as a private solicitor, lecturer, mediator and tribunal member. In fact, she was on the Guardianship Board of South Australia from 1996 through to 2010, a mediator with Relationships Australia and a member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal—



Senator Abetz interjecting—




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Yes, a mediator, Senator Abetz. That means somebody who can take into account all sides and move towards resolution of problems. That makes her an admirable fit for a potential role as the chair of a committee.


Senator Nash has proposed that Senator Waters be taken up for the environment position. I do not know what reflection that may be on the current chair, but I would agree. Senator Waters would be an admirable chair of an environment committee. I see a little bit of recognition of the talent of Senator Waters from the good senator there. That suggestion from the National Party that Senator Waters take the environment chair will become available if the opposition supports the Greens amendment to the amendment. This process is a very reasonable one. It is based on precedent. It offers to take up the talent that is available and, of course, the Greens will be supporting it.

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:04):  Senator Brown's comments then would have been laughable if the issue were not so serious. This is just another demonstration of the Greens' insatiable desire and lust for power and control over the processes of this place. We have seen that demonstrated with their formal alliance with the government. We have seen it in relation to the successful and effective way in which they have set the national agenda. And we are seeing it yet again today in the way in which they want to control more of the Senate processes.


Senator Brown was lauding the talent of those in the Greens. I think that it is quite right to acknowledge the talent and experience of your own colleagues, but he is actually suggesting Senator Wright—a new senator to this place—stacks up against Senator Humphries, who has been, if nothing else, the Attorney-General of the ACT. Senator Wright, how does that make you more equipped than him to be the chair of this committee? What an absolute nonsense!


Let me go on. I gave Senator Humphries two seconds to write two lines—




Senator Bob Brown:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator should be addressing her remarks to the chair.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Senator Kroger, I just ask that you observe the usual courtesies.




Senator KROGER:
  I wish Senator Brown would observe the same procedures of the Senate that he is very quick to point out to all other members, including the dress code of this place and recognising the presiding officer.


Senator Humphries is a former Attorney-General of the ACT and Minister for Police and Emergency Services. Is this enough experience for you, Senator Brown?




Senator Fifield:
  Chief Minister.




Senator KROGER:
  He was the Chief Minister, but these are the things that have direct correlation to the experience he brings to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. He was shadow minister for legal and consumer affairs, Treasurer and the list goes on.


There was an interjection by the minister, Senator Ludwig, before he left the chamber before the conclusion of this debate to the effect that the committee could not sort this out. You may be surprised to know that the committee has never discussed dumping—and that is all that you can call it—Senator Humphries from the head of this committee and replacing him with Senator Wright. Not once has this come up in a committee meeting, and it begs the question: why not? I understand that the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee meets on a weekly basis. It does not take a rocket scientist to work out that this committee has met probably close to 30 times already this year, but not once have those on the crossbenches or in the government deemed the democratic Senate process or the committee system important enough to raise in a committee meeting that they were interested in taking the chair's position. That smacks of total hypocrisy. The Greens know they control the agenda of the government. They control what actually happens here and, as Senator Abetz pointed out, they are pursuing and enjoying the spoils of being in both government and opposition. What this all comes down to is: who is actually wagging the tail of the dog of the government? We know that it is the Greens.


The day the Greens signed their formal alliance with the government was a very dark, sad day for this nation. On that day a minor party which managed to garner only 11 per cent of the primary vote—it had an electoral mandate of only 11 per cent—began to dictate to this nation the agenda that we have seen being rolled out. We are seeing it again today. This is an absolute indictment of the Greens. Their thirst for further authority and power knows no bounds, and this motion is yet another demonstration of that. We do not support Senator Brown's amendment to Senator Abetz's amendment. We do not support it at all. We do not question the integrity and the ability of the Greens senators; we question the rationale that a further committee chairmanship should be taken from the opposition. The reason we question it is pretty straightforward. It only takes a fairly sane and rational person to look at the Notice Paper to determine that this position should be taken from the government. 


The opposition makes up about 44 per cent of the composition of the Senate; we are allocated about 43 per cent of committee positions. I am not going to quibble over one per cent. We consider that to be a fair and reasonable representation of our electoral mandate to this place. We know that the government and the Greens are in a formal alliance—others may call it a coalition. We on this side of the chamber, the Liberal and National parties, believe this is a coalition. They have a signed document, which they framed to forge their alliance—a formal alliance, to put it in the words of Senator Brown and the Prime Minister. Together they are seeking to increase their committee representation from over 52 per cent now to 62 per cent, so that three-fifths of the committee positions in this chamber will be allocated to the government and Greens alliance. No sane, rational person could suggest that that is a reasonable suggestion. There is no electoral mandate for this. The purpose of the Senate is that we represent our states, and this motion flies in the face of that.


I can never get past the photo opportunity, the press conference, after the Prime Minister negotiated with the Greens or, more to the point, effectively, the Greens negotiated with the government. I will never forget the day she did an interview after forming her minority government. If you had looked through a crystal ball you would have seen that that photo depicted what we could expect from this Labor-Greens government. In that photo were the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Greens, front and centre. Around them both were the Independents. The smile on the face of the Leader of the Greens was enough to light a light globe—probably all the light globes in this place. The expressions on the faces of those in the photo said it all. In that photo you could see the Prime Minister's realisation of just how far she had gone in selling your souls to the Greens so that you could form a minority government.




Senator Marshall:
  I don't have a soul!




Senator KROGER:
  Yes, Senator Marshall, we have seen that time and time again. I am so pleased that you have indicated you do not have a soul. We know that there are many on that side who do have or who claim to have a soul. This is an alliance that has caused more grief for your colleagues and yourself than for anyone else. This is an alliance whose consequences we will live with until we come to an election.


We do not support the amendment to Senator Abetz's amendment. We think that it is very hypocritical of the Greens to pitch themselves as the moral guardians, if you like, of the environment. They claim to hold that moral high ground, yet, when they sought to take a committee chair from the opposition, they chose not the environment committee, but the community affairs committee. In doing so, as we know, they took that chair from the very able Senator Humphries. Now they are seeking to encroach, to expand their territory, to take on another committee chair, and it is, once again, not the environment committee but the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. What is the hidden agenda here? Is it the social agenda that they are more concerned about than environmental pursuits? I go back to their primary vote at the last election. It is a sad day if a minority party can control the agenda of this country with a primary vote of only 11 per cent. 


In conclusion, Senator Abetz referred to the Adelaide Advertiser article, which I also read first thing yesterday morning before I even saw the red that was circulated in the chamber. It smacked once again, very typically, of the absolute contempt that the Leader of the Greens and his colleagues have for this Senate, contempt in that they would advertise, in advance, something that the Senate had not even voted on. That shows their absolute arrogance and the confidence that they have in their position with the government in their formal alliance. Nothing demonstrates their hubris more than the confidence they have that they will effectively ensure that they can chair another committee. 


As I said at the beginning, this would be laughable if it were not so tragic, to be honest. This is a total indictment of this place. I raised the hypocrisy of the senator in discussing standing orders of this place. What is good for him is not good for everybody else. The same principles apply here. We do not support this. We do not believe that it truly reflects our elected mandate to properly pursue the Senate processes of this place. We strongly reject the Greens' proposal to take the chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2011-11-02,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:17):  This is a very peculiar day, when we find that the Greens are apparently part of the opposition. I refer to page 373 of Odgers: 


Under standing order 25 the chairs of the legislative and general purpose standing committees must be chosen from the government party members, and the deputy chairs from the non-government members. For procedures for electing chairs and deputy chairs, see below … 


It further states that each legislation committee shall elect as its chair a member nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and, as the deputy chair, a member nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Each references committee shall elect as its chair a member nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate or a member of a minority group in the Senate and, as its deputy chair, a member nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The Leader of the Government in the Senate is now nominating someone from the Greens.


It is an interesting start for a person on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee when they do not even know their own Odgers. It is a very interesting position to kick off from, which goes to show, more than anything else, why they are not fit for the position. Let us go through and see how much role they have had with us. I have got a list of votes by the opposition—that is us; apparently it is you now as well, if we believe you—and the Greens. I can go to each one from 4 July. What we are looking for is when I say 'yes, yes' or 'no, no'. In seriatim, this is how we voted: no, yes; no, no. That is one, but the government did not support it either. Then yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; yes, no; no, yes; yes, no; no, yes; yes, no; no, yes; no, yes; yes, no; no, yes; yes, no; no, yes—I will not bore you, but you get the idea. We do not generally agree—in fact, never, except for one where the two genuine Independents had a different position. These are the people now coming in here, after reading what it says in Odgers, and saying they are part of our crew. I should have invited them to the Christmas party! I did not know they were part of the team. 


This is absolutely amazing. It shows how absolutely fraudulent the Greens have become, in everything they do. You watch, later on: they will support the guillotine. They are the party that now do not give leave. This is the worst part, and it will stick with you. They are the party that did not support an inquiry into the rape of Annette Harding. That is the one that really irks me. She is an Aboriginal girl and you decided that you were not going to support an inquiry into this. Why you did that, I do not know. It was that day, at that moment, that I just lost you. I just could not work out where you were going.




Senator Bob Brown:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Joyce should be addressing the chair. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Senator Joyce, I ask you to direct your comments through the chair. 




Senator JOYCE:
  That was the time where the last semblance of nobility for the independent position was lost. We had been seeking that inquiry in this place for so long, and so many people have been battling for so long to get that lady her day for some form of justice. When that was denied by the Greens we knew that the whole thing had really started to stink to high heaven in how this organisation is working. 


The Greens are a part of the key positions of the government—it is a Greens-Labor Party-Independent alliance. We all remember the vision of them all standing with their corsages in their lapels as they signed the registry to state that they would be supporting the government and that is how the government would form a government. Now they are completely corrupting the process of the Senate, the chamber that gave them succour and the capacity to have a voice in our nation. They are now completely corrupting that process. They are corrupting it as far as Odgers is concerned. They are corrupting it as far as their actions in what is delivered, the ventilation of a vibrant and analytical form of democracy, is concerned. They are corrupting it as far as their absolutely absurd lack of recognition of the facts as to how the actual votes went is concerned.


What have they sought an inquiry into? They are called the Australian Greens. In the deep recesses of my mind I have this association between the word 'green' and the environment. I thought that that would be the premier issue. When I think about the environment I think green. I think: 'Well, they're always frolicking around in the mushrooms in the forests with the frogs'—the party for frogs—but, no. It is legal and con. It is social engineering that they are really interested in. When you scratch the surface this is the party about social engineering. This is the party that always puts up the flag and collects people around with: 'I love my roses. You love your roses. If you love your garden you love the Greens,' and then we find that what they are really interested in is the social engineering exercise. In their form of Maslow hierarchy of needs, at the very top, before eating or sleeping or anything else that pertains to it, other more banal pursuits of the basic form of human instinct, their main issue is social engineering—to change the whole structure and to work their way into people's lives by the manipulative sense of making you feel good, of righteousness, of: 'We're saving the trees. We're saving the creeks. We are looking after the frogs. We're saving the fish.' But, when push comes to shove, when they have to nominate a committee, they nominate the committee to reorganise the social fabric. That is what they are truly interested in.


So where does this faux nobility go from here? Their eyes are focused. They draw an association between themselves and the Democrats. There are many people, I am certain, who voted for the Democrats who are wondering now where their vote has ended up. Think of people like former Senator Andrew Murray, a person respected on all sides of the chamber. He had his bleats, but the one thing he was not was anybody's patsy. He was his own person. Those people had a capacity to have genuine independence, to voice their views and to stand behind them. The Democrats were an independent party. The Greens are not an independent party. If you want a classic example of that, even within this chamber, I would have to say I have heard Dougie Cameron, as much as I disagree with him, at times say things—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Joyce, I ask you to refer to Senator Cameron correctly.




Senator JOYCE:
  I apologise to Senator Cameron with real deference. I have heard Senator Cameron at times say things that are different from the people in his own party. He has voiced them in the chamber and he has voiced them at the doors. He has not backed them up with a vote, but at least he has had the ticker to say them. So there is a sense within the Labor Party, and you can see it at times, that they will actually do what most rational human beings do: if they have a different point of view, they will actually say it. I have most certainly seen it on our own side. We treasure the liberty of the individual. We treasure the liberty of individual expression if it is required and—not often, but if it is really required—even in how you vote. It is part of why we sit on this side of the chamber. I would have to say that that is in the National Party probably more than anywhere else; it is just part of the culture of the show.


But I know one party here that does not. They always vote as a block. In the time I have been here, they have never split. We have never heard them say anything but the script. That is the Greens. They are a completely centralised, controlled unit. Maybe that is their cunning. Maybe that is how they got ahead. But it is not the expression of the liberty of the individual. I would ask all the people who get attracted to them in tertiary education: why? Why would you join a group which tells you how to think? Why would you join a group in which, manifestly, every word you utter has to go through a centrally controlled unit before you say it? If there is ever one party that should be a thousand miles away from the legal and cons committee it is the one with that attitude, that philosophy. That philosophy should be a thousand miles away. We believe in deference, in the removal and the separation of powers and in those who by their actions, displayed here and in other places, are truly independent.


I know somebody who is truly independent, who by their actions—and sometimes I have disagreed with him—has voted in accordance with his beliefs, and that is Senator Humphries. By his actions he is quite evidently a person who has the dignity of office to stand aside and say, 'I will be an independent arbiter in my deliberations as chair of this committee,' because that is who he is. He has displayed it; therefore, we can trust him with it. But the Greens have not shown anybody in their party who has had the capacity to do that. Therefore, one of the premier committees in this nation has now become a political football as part of this deal. It is quite evident, manifestly evident, in their actions that the Greens were most definitely not part of the opposition. You Greens might say you are not part of the government, but you are. But we can definitely prove by your actions—absolutely, categorically, without a shadow of a doubt—that 99.9 per cent of your votes are not with us, so you cannot possibly be part of the opposition. Therefore, if you follow Odgers, you cannot possibly have the chair, and if you understood Odgers or if you quoted it you would show some competency in it. But you do not even have it. You do not even know it. It has not got nothing to do with the process. This is a dirty little political deal that is completely removed from the reality.


Now Senator Brown is reading the paper. He is probably reading the form guide. What is the day that comes after the Melbourne Cup? It is the Oaks. He is probably looking up the Oaks. This is how bizarre it has become. We have the Leader of the Greens, who is now organising himself to take over the legal and cons committee, reclining in the chamber, ladies and gentlemen who are driving down the highways of Australia, reading the paper—made out of trees, I presume; but I do not know. I thought he would have an electronic form of it. But, no; he is going to read the stuff that they make out of trees—probably out of pulp and woodchips, to be honest. Where is the justification for this? You have not mounted an argument to show your independence. You have not mounted an argument that shows any understanding of Odgers and the position you are seeking. You have not been transparent in the deals that you have made with the Labor Party about why you should have this position. There has been no indication how the Greens candidate is comparable with or has more experience than the current chairman, who has served as Attorney-General and Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory and who by his own actions has shown that he has the courage and the conviction, though others might not agree with him, to cross the floor when he believes that is the right thing to do. You have displayed none of these things. You have taken the legal and constitutional committee and made it your pet project.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT
:  Senator Joyce, please address your remarks through the chair.




Senator JOYCE:
  I am sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is your pet project because the real motivation here is social re-engineering—and we are seeing more and more of it as you fall into this trap of hubris. You are in the spotlight because of the things you are doing to our country, whether it is introducing the carbon tax or closing down fishing, closing down mining or closing down the Murray-Darling Basin. If we pursue this nihilistic approach it will ultimately lead to the destruction of our nation. We will see destruction and bankruptcy and our nation in poverty if we pursue your course. 


The goal that sits behind this is social re-engineering—the destruction of the person; basically taking the person to where they are the equivalent of animals: there are horses and bunnies and frogs and people, and they are all the same. Ultimately a person's rights will be similar to vegetation rights—trees and bushes and people will all be the same. We can see this re-engineering in the carbon tax—we take $56.9 billion a year and send it overseas. We do not just re-engineer Australia; we try to re-engineer the world. Everything is part of this nihilistic approach that takes away from the dignity of the individual, takes away from what we are. This totally serves your purpose. 


This approach also indicates quite clearly that the term 'Greens' is a fraud. It inspires a faux nobility with an ulterior motive, which is the restructure of the social fabric of Australia, and other areas if possible, for your own purpose. It is social re-engineering with a suit and tie on—that is all it is. That is what the Greens do. It is done with totally selfish control and takes away any semblance of the right of the individual within the party structure. I cannot nominate one person in that party structure who I have ever heard make a statement on something that has not gone through their centrally controlled unit.




Senator Bernardi:
  Lee Rhiannon, on communism?




Senator JOYCE:
  That is ultimately where we are going. What is the agreement? Why on earth did we have the nomination for a position that is supposed to be made by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate? You can understand why this mistake could be made with any other committee, but this is the legal and cons committee; this is the one that is supposed to have an understanding of the Constitution. Maybe that is a bit old-fashioned—why would they worry about that? Can you explain to me your interpretation of that? Maybe you would like to get your new chair to stand and display to this chamber her competencies in understanding Odgers—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Joyce, I ask you to address your remarks through the chair.




Senator JOYCE:
  Chair, I would be very interested to see the new candidate stand before this chamber and, as her first act, show us her competency in understanding Odgers and how she believes the process followed thus far accords with the process defined by Odgers—which is the process we are supposed to be following here. If she could explain that to us that would be an interesting foray, an interesting opening, into her new role. But she will not be able to do that, because I have a funny feeling she has not got a clue. 




Senator Conroy:
  You're the bloke who was sacked as the shadow finance minister—sit down!




Senator JOYCE:
  Now they have sent in the 'minister for out there', Senator Conroy. This is all part of shutting down this place. In this new environment, let us see if the new chair of legal and cons supports the guillotine. Let us see how independent she is. Let us see how she allows ventilation of debate. Let us see what she does. It is going to be an interesting start.


This action is completely and utterly disgusting. It is not disgusting because we lose Senator Humphries—although he is an extremely competent chair and does not deserve to lose the position; it is disgusting because, right at the start, you have ignored the principle of how the Senate is supposed to work. The premier committee of this place is supposed to have oversight of the process. Either you are totally and utterly naive or you are pernicious, and I think it is the latter.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-11-02,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:36):  I support the motion and I support the amendment that recognises that the coalition thinks the Greens should have the chair of the Environment and Communications References Committee. If they want to add the environment committee to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Com­mittee—and indeed to the committee which Senator Siewert already so capably chairs, the Community Affairs References Com­mittee—then that would be perfectly fine. We recognise the obvious competence available to chair these committees. But what came to mind as I was listening to the last speaker, Senator Joyce, was the phrase that 'when ignorance is bliss it is folly to be wise', because what we heard in the Senate was an ignorant diatribe from Senator Joyce. What should be putting fear into the hearts of people following this debate this morning is that the person who engaged in that ignorant diatribe aspires to be the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. That is what is so appalling. That is terrifying, and I think people listening would be horrified by that. Yesterday, in the contribution that he made on the carbon price, he articulated that there is a god-given right to pollute, that the atmosphere is free to be polluted. He said that putting a price on carbon in trying to restrain pollution—the polluter pays—was somehow contrary to his god-given right to pollute. So I think people listening would recognise that what we have heard is frightening. It is frightening from this point of view, that this motion is about democratic representation. I recognise that the coalition do not like the fact that they are an opposition party and they do not like the fact that opposition parties should be represented on Senate committees on a pro rata basis. Senator Joyce referred to Odgers on several occasions, and people ought to be afraid when they recognise that he completely misrepresented Odgers. Odgers makes it very clear that crossbenchers have a say in terms of committee chairs and committee operations in this Senate. Odgers makes that very clear, which Senator Joyce did not do.


After the last election, the Greens increased our representation in the Senate to nine senators. There is a recognition, in terms of pro rata, that we have the capacity to chair at least two committees, and that is the basis on which we have argued for the chair of another committee, and the legal and constitutional committee is the case in point. Given the standing orders of the Senate, you do not expect to have the kind of reflection that Senator Joyce engaged in with relation to Senator Wright. I would remind the Senate of Senator Wright's career to date. She has not only acted as a solicitor, both in this country and overseas, but has lectured at Flinders University in public and environ­mental health. She has been a member of a residential tenancies tribunal. She has been a solicitor on the Legal Practitioners Conduct Board of South Australia. She has been on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. She has been a mediator at Relationships Australia and the Deputy President of the South Australian Guardianship Board. So, contrary to the assertions from Senator Joyce, Senator Wright is very able and well qualified and has life experience that will make her an excellent chair  of this committee. I look forward to that being reflected in the make-up of the Senate committee chairs.


I do remind the Senate that what is so extraordinarily hypocritical here is that it is the coalition who opposes at every turn the implementation of democratic principles in Australia. Only yesterday the first of the Greens bills that restore to the ACT and the Northern Territory their democratic rights passed both houses of parliament—and that was opposed by the coalition. They took away the rights of the Northern Territory and the ACT parliaments, they overrode the laws of those parliaments and they continued to do so right up until the last minute yesterday, and in the votes they opposed it. So there we have the coalition, who want to take away the democratic rights of the ACT and the Northern Territory, and here we have the Greens who have restored, with the government, those rights to the ACT and the Northern Territory which the coalition would have continued to see taken away. So, when we talk about where the commitment is to democratic representation, I note (a) there is a pro rata distribution in Senate chairs and (b) there is a commitment of the Greens to democratic representation, as is evidenced by the passage yesterday of that legislation restoring the rights to the ACT and the Northern Territory.


But my experience in the Senate goes back further than that. I was elected in 2004 and took my place in the Senate in 2005, when the coalition government had control of both houses. It was then that we saw their complete belief in a god-given right to rule at any cost while ruling out any democratic representation. The coalition abolished the Senate committee system as it stood prior to that election. Not only did it do that but it took all 10 chairs for itself. There are other people sitting in here today who came into the Senate at that time who will recall that. Senator Polley, my colleague from Tasmania and a Labor senator, came into the Senate at the same time and Senator Polley will recall that is precisely the case—that the coalition abolished the tradition of the Senate committees, abolished the right of the opposition parties to have any chairs in the Senate committees.



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Order, senators! Senator Milne has the right to be heard in silence.




Senator MILNE:
  So this is the hypocrisy of some of the people who have spoken today: they were sitting there and grinning from ear to ear as they took away the democratic representation of any opposition member to chair any committee at that time. Senator Macdonald was sitting there then and was very happy to take away such representation from everybody else. What is more, when the opposition members of the Senate, from the crossbenches or the Labor opposition at the time, put forward proposals for Senate inquiries into a range of very significant matters, they were voted down as a matter of course. Only those inquiries which the coalition were prepared to have were actually allowed to be even investigated at that particular time. One of the great strengths of the committee system in having opposition members and crossbench members chairing Senate committees is that, in a balance-of-power parliament when no-one has all the power, you get investigations into things which the government of the day does not necessarily want to have inquiries into. Not only do you get inquiries into things the government of the day may not want investigated but on the inquiries of the references committees the government does not have the numbers to dominate the outcomes. As a result, you get very significant Senate inquiry outcomes that are taken seriously by the community. During the years when the Howard government had control of both houses, the Senate committee reports were regarded as having very little significance because they were seen as a rubber stamp of the Howard government and the chairs made sure in those reports that they were government reports and that was all there was to them. Here we have people like Senator Joyce standing up and talking about democratic representation while refusing to acknowledge that when the Howard government had power it used that power ruthlessly to destroy democratic representation in the Senate.


This motion is saying that we recognise, as Odgers points out, the right of reasonable pro rata representation across the parliament for Senate committees. The committee system was changed when Labor got back into government so that we had opposition representation, but we have had abuse of that from the coalition. There was an agreement that there would only ever be three select committees at any one time and that they would be for specific periods, yet having agreed to that the coalition abused it. That is just part of what the community must now be worried about. The community should be worried about what would happen if the coalition ever got control of both houses again, because their track record to date is that they want to control everything. What is more, they have no respect for science, no respect for economists, no respect for international lawyers and no respect for anyone who does not agree with them, as we have heard from the leader of the coalition.


The leader of the coalition has cast absolute contempt. He has treated the scientific, economic and legal communities in Australia with contempt. To be truthful, we are now hearing drivel from people who are refusing to acknowledge that the born-to-rule mentality of the coalition showed itself during the Howard government years with the abuse of the Senate. What is even more interesting is that one of the major reasons the Howard government lost government in 2007 was the community's unhappiness with the Howard government having destroyed the democratic representation in the Senate in the manner to which it had usually been given expression. The community wanted to make sure that there were checks and balances and that the Senate was restored as the balance to a majority in the House of Representatives. That balance of democratic representation, with the ability of the government to chair legislative committees and the opposition and the crossbenchers to chair the references committees, means that you get a balance of interest. Because we have a balance-of-power parliament repre­sented here in the Senate, we get the issues that are on the minds of Australians up for investigation by Senate committees. Those Senate committees are taken seriously when they represent a fair cross-section of the Australian community. That is the basis of this motion.


What we are hearing from the coalition is their view that they have a right to all of the chairs and that they should not be shared according to a pro rata distribution or to democratic representation. The coalition simply thinks it should keep all of those chairs. It is anti-democratic. It is anti the rules of the Senate. It is anti the commitment to the Australian people of fair repre­sentation in the Senate and it is restoring what the Howard government tried to take away and did take away for a considerable period. Over those years, I moved several times for inquiries into various aspects of the impacts of climate change on agriculture and other aspects in the Australian community and the upshot of it all—




Senator Nash:
  Why don't you want the environment committee?




Senator MILNE:
  I hear Senator Nash saying that she would support us having the chair of the environment committee as well, so I hope that she will support that amendment when it comes forward.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! On my left. Senator Nash, is there a point of order?




Senator Nash:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, there is a point of order. I think the senator should withdraw that. I did not say the environment committee as well; I said the environment committee instead of the legal and constitutional committee.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator MILNE:
  Thank you for the clarification, because it is now clear that Senator Nash does support the Greens having the chair of two committees. I thank her for that acknowledgement because clearly that is part of the debate here this morning. I look forward to seeing—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Joyce:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, a point of order: I think that is a complete misrepresentation of a statement that was made and a deliberate misrepresentation of another senator. The Greens have just stated that we believe they should have two committees—that has never been stated. They are definitely misleading the chamber if that is what they continue to say.




Senator Bob Brown:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: the Greens have heard the opposition speakers in silence—




Senator Bernardi:
  We didn't tell lies, though. That's what you're doing.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi!




Senator Bob Brown:
  But, as we are hearing now from Senator Bernardi, they are breaching the standing orders, as were Senator Nash and Senator Joyce, by interjecting. They are now trying to defend those interjections. They have no point. The interjections themselves were unruly, and if they had not broken the rules there would be nothing for Senator Milne to be cogently commenting on.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  On Senator Joyce's point of order, Senator Nash has not actually had the call from the chair during this debate. I have no way of knowing what she said. I call Senator Milne.




Senator MILNE:
  As I was indicating, the Greens do want to pursue our responsibilities here in the Senate very vigorously and we are already doing that. Senator Siewert has been and continues to be an exemplary Chair of the Senate Com­munity Affairs References Committee. When I speak to people around the country, of all political persuasions, they say to me that they regard Senator Siewert extremely highly as being a very professional chair. I have absolutely no doubt that Senator Wright, if it is the will of the Senate, will be an equally good, professional chair in that role with the experience she brings to the Senate.


It is time for people to reflect on how we want our democracy to operate in Australia—whether we want it to give effect to the will of the people as shown at elections. The will of the people at an election returned nine Greens senators to the Senate. That means that on a pro rata basis the Greens should have the chair of two committees. We are now moving to ensure that that actually becomes part of the Senate process in spite of the fact that if the coalition had their way they would once again abolish the Senate committee system, once again take away chairs from any opposition party. Make no mistake about it, Mr Acting Deputy President, the contributions we have heard today have just reinforced the extent to which they would ruthlessly destroy a democratic tradition of the Senate since its inception—that is, until the Howard government destroyed it during that particular period.


As I pointed out earlier, Senator Joyce misrepresented Odgers, as Odgers specifically talks about the role of the crossbench in relation to Senate committees. One of the things that seems to confuse and distract Senator Joyce and some of his colleagues, as was evidenced by his speech, is a view—and it must come from his experience in the coalition—that people can only have a similar view about things if they are dragooned into it by the leader's office. I can see that that was a tradition with the Howard government and I can see it is a tradition with the current leader of the coalition. What this points out is something that the Greens alone have in the political process in Australia, which is a consistent philosophical view. It is a consistent philosophical view that is based on the global Greens charter.


One of our great strengths in the 21st century is that, unlike other political parties in parliaments around the world, including here in Australia where they base their views on their opinion polling, on what their focus groups have to say, on what newspapers such as the Murdoch press have to say and so on, the Greens have a philosophical view based on the four pillars of ecological integrity, participatory democracy—and participatory democracy is what we are pursuing here in this parliament—social justice, and peace and nonviolence. Those four very strong philosophical views underpin the Greens, and we bring that perspective to every issue that comes before us. That is why when a matter comes before the parliament you know, as Senator Faulkner and others have said about us in the past, that the Greens have a consistent philosophical view that it is based on a set of principles—unlike the other parties, who actually do not have a philosophical view anymore, which is why they are all over the place on a variety of issues. That is why we are strongly in favour of participatory democracy and the pro rata expression of what came from the 2010 election. I look forward to the Greens taking the second share in the Senate committee process.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (10:57):  At a personal level I am philosophical about—




Senator Conroy:
   Declare your interest.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  My interest has been pretty well declared for me in this debate, thank you, Senator Conroy; more than amply declared for me. I am philosophical about having to give up the chairmanship of this committee. The Greens' intention to take this chairmanship has been evident for quite some time, has been signalled for some time, so I am not surprised that I am in the position today of being deprived of that chairmanship.


But there are two reasons that I feel this is a very sad day for the Australian Senate. One is that this represents a very significant shift in the way in which the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs does things. It is a very well respected committee, one that has had an air of being able to produce reports that are a step or two away, on many occasions at least, from the political dimension of debates on the floor of the Senate. It has been able to produce reports that have garnered respect in the broader community because they have been seen as dispassionate and independent assessments of the evidence before the committee. I have to ask myself whether that kind of reputation can be preserved in a situation where effectively the government and its close ally the Greens control both the references and legislation perspectives of that committee. For those listening to this debate who might be unaware of what the chairmanship of a committee indicates, that committee will have only those two perspectives. Not only does a party get to provide the chair of the committee but, effectively, it gets control of the committee. If two parties, such as the Greens and the Labor Party, work together on the committee then the chairmanship of that committee delivers control of the committee's deliberations—the majority reports of the committee—to the party or parties with that majority control. So, both the references version and the legislation version of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee will now effectively be controlled by the Labor-Greens axis in this place. The party that represents the largest grouping in this Senate—the coalition, the parties that represent half of all the votes cast by Australians at the last federal election on a two-party-preferred basis—will be unable to put a perspective in the majority reports of either of those two committees.


It is important and significant to note that this committee and the Community Affairs Committee of the Senate constitute the committees with the strongest purview over social policy in this country. They represent the vantage point from which the Senate views a whole range of critically important legal and social issues and are a very important part of the work of the Senate overall. Consider some of the issues the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee has considered in the last few years. It has had a strong overview of issues of national security and intelligence through supervising issues like the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and the intelligence services in Australia. It has looked at issues like child support. It has looked at the Commonwealth Commissioner for Children and Young People Bill. It has looked at migration matters, most recently examining the government's deal with Malaysia for the swapping of asylum seekers between those two countries.


So the committee has looked at critically important issues from a whole range of perspectives. But those issues will now be considered by a committee with two manifestations, both dominated by this Labor-Greens axis. I use the phrase 'Labor-Greens axis' because it is very clearly the case in this Senate that those two parties work so closely together that they cannot be described as anything other than a coalition or an alliance. In the course of this year there has been only one occasion among the hundreds of divisions that have been held on the floor of this Senate when the Labor Party and the Australian Greens did not vote together—just one. If they are not a coalition, not an alliance, not the same party effectively operating as two different factions, then why are they cleaving so closely together on so many votes over so many issues? In fact, Labor and the Greens have always had very close cooperation, generally supporting each other to the tune of more than 95 per cent of all votes conducted on the floor of this chamber. So the suggestion that the Greens are a separate party with a separate perspective that is going to be quite separate from the government is completely untrue.


A vote today that the chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee should be a member of the Australian Greens will deliver to that side of the chamber all the work of this important committee. The voice of the other significant part of the Australian community that does not take that perspective will be lost except in dissenting or minority reports of the committee, which do not carry anything like the same weight as the majority reports of the committee. That would be most unfortunate, and I think it would be a sad degrading of the integrity and capacity of a very important Senate committee.


The other reason I am opposed to this motion is that pretty dirty tactics have been used to get to this point. A little while ago, the minister rose and announced that he had to move this motion on the floor of the Senate today because the committee had been unable to reach agreement on this subject. I am certain that the Labor members of the committee did not tell the minister that. They know that there has been no discussion at all on the floor of this chamber about the chairmanship of the references committee—not one word of discussion about it. It has never been raised.


Coalition members obviously did not make that bizarre representation. I can only assume that the Australian Greens have told the minister that they have sought valiantly to get the chairmanship of this committee on the floor of the chamber and that they have been rebuffed. Where else would that bizarre claim have come from? Was it Senator Bob Brown who told the minister that? Was it Senator Wright? Who told the minister that this was the case? It is not true, is it?


That is just one of the indications of the dirty tactics the Australian Greens have used in respect of this matter. We see these dirty tactics all the time. We have seen them in the application of the Greens policies during election campaigns. We saw them with the passage of the legislation for disallowance of the territory legislation through this place just the other day and through the House of Representatives yesterday. The man who moved legislation in the parliament to overturn Northern Territory legislation because he did not agree with it has now triumphantly declared that he got legislation through the parliament to give the territories more rights—rights that he was happy to take away a couple of years ago. This is the party that has a policy of removing funding from non-government schools in Australia but whose leader was happy, during the last federal election campaign—when he came to campaign in the Australian Capital Territory, where we have the highest level of take-up of non-government education anywhere in the country—to say: 'Oh, no; that policy won't be applied. We're actually not going to do that anymore. We've decided to put that policy to one side.' When asked by a journalist in the National Press Club debate a couple of days later, 'Why have the Greens decided to abandon this policy?' he said: 'We haven't done that. Our policy on this subject still stands. We're not backing away from that policy.'




Senator Conroy:
  What has this got to do with the topic?




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  It is to do with hypocrisy, Minister.



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  We were not in bed with the Australian Democrats. We did not sign a deal with the Australian Democrats. The Democrats voted against us more often than they voted for us in this parliament. So, rewarding those sorts of dirty tactics is just unconscionable and I do not believe the Senate should do it.


Imagine if we came back in the next parliament—were we fortunate enough to be on the other side of the chamber—and we said, 'Well, the National Party is a separate party and they are entitled to their own allocation of chairmanships, quite separate from the government's.' What would you people say about that? You would be up in arms. You would be out of your trees with rage. But that is exactly what you are doing here today, and you know it. You know that this is a very bad precedent to be setting. This is not a good way for the Senate to proceed. It degrades the value of a very important process in this Senate. I think the chairmanship of the two manifestations of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee should reflect the voting intention of Australians at the last election and the composition of this Senate. With this motion being passed it will not do either of those things.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (11:08):  I will not keep the Senate for very long. I want to indicate why I am totally opposed to the Greens chairing yet another committee. My colleagues on this side have pointed out the unfairness and the breach of agreement. I just want to point out that the Greens political party is a party with hypocritical approaches to everything.


We cannot have as chairs of our committees members of a party of such hypocrisy. I do not make this accusation personally to the Greens nominee. She has only very recently come into the Senate. I have little knowledge of her and have had little to do with her. By contrast I know Senator Humphries is a very distinguished and qualified person—someone who has been an Attorney-General and a Chief Minister of a territory—whose chairmanship of this committee in the recent past has demonstrated why he should retain the chairmanship of this committee.


The Greens political party are a party of hypocrisy. You will remember how their leader, Senator Bob Brown, used to rail against the big parties taking donations from big business. Then we learn that Senator Brown personally received a $1.6 million donation for his campaigning funds, which I am told is the biggest single donation ever in the Australian political scene. After all of the Greens', and particularly Senator Brown's, pious speeches against accepting donations from business, here we have Senator Brown accepting $1.6 million, the largest ever individual donation, for a group that we read in the papers has a particular interest in some of the decisions made in Tasmania in relation to environmental and forestry areas.


Then, we have a party that has railed against the monarchy and privilege. Let me tell you a little experience I had when Her Majesty was in the parliament the other day. I could not get to the front row because there were people there who were particularly keen to touch or see the Queen. I just went along to see the gracious lady, so I stood in the background. Then I looked over into the corner and I saw Senator Brown and all his cohorts over there. I thought they would not be interested in getting near the Queen so I would be able to slip in front of them and get a better view. Could I! I could not get anywhere near them. I got there and Senator Brown and all his team were there pushing their way through to the centre. I then worked out why they were sitting there. It was because the Indigenous singer was right in front of them. So, as the attention turned from the Queen to the Indigenous singer—and what a great performance that was—Senator Brown happened to be right in front of them and, would you believe, in a line between the Queen and the television cameras. I then tried to move there but, no, Senator Brown had been tipped off that the Queen was going to walk through this way. Could you get anywhere near there? No, there was a little cordon of staffers around Senator Brown, so that when the Queen came over Senator Brown could say, as he did, 'Hello Your Majesty. Yes Your Majesty. Bow Your Majesty. Welcome from Tasmania Your Majesty.' I am pleased that Senator Brown is showing respect and courtesy to our head of state. I do not criticise him for that. What I criticise him for is the abject hypocrisy of this party.


We hear Senator Brown railing against those multinational mining companies: they are ripping the guts out of Australia and taking all the profits overseas. Yet we had a flood tax you might recall that was imposed on individuals. It was not imposed on these big multinational companies but on individuals. I said to Senator Brown time and time again, 'Why are you passing this tax on individuals and letting go free those horrid multinational mining companies that you are always railing about.' But it did not matter to Senator Brown. He is so hypocritical in his views of legislation. If the Labor Party say they want it, the deal says they get it. And here today we have the pay-off to the Greens. I am still waiting for Senator Brown to explain to me, with these multinational mining companies that are ripping the guts out of Australia and taking all the profits overseas, why did he vote to exclude these multinational mining companies from paying the flood levy, the same as we all paid?


I highlight that Coles and Woolworths, which again Senator Brown is always railing against, got away scot-free. They did not pay a cent towards the flood tax, but the local butcher and the local baker who compete with Coles and Woolworths in every community around Australia had to pay the flood tax. That is what Senator Brown voted for. What a hypocritical approach.


They rail against the use of VIP aircraft, but who is No. 1 on the manifest list when something happens? Senator Brown and his colleagues. Again, I do not blame them for that. I rarely use them but I understand that some people cannot get to and from. That is fine, and a lot of people do use the VIP aircraft. But the hypocrisy of criticising everybody else, leaking to the media how the Labor Party and some Liberals have used these aircraft—yet there we are, when it suits them, away they go. I am glad they use it. If it is convenient to them to get to and from parliament, that is fine, but do not be so hypocritical about it.


This is why I distrust any member of the Greens political party chairing a particular group. I do not want to take much more of the Senate's time. I think it might be worth while, though, if the nominee of the Greens, who is in line for a fairly hefty pay increase, after having been here only a couple of months, with the chairmanship of this committee were to indicate some of her credentials. I know my colleagues have a lot they want to say on this so I am not going to take much more of the Senate's time. I simply emphasise the reason that I will not be supporting the Greens for any other chairmanship is that they are a party that has demonstrated that they cannot be trusted with the conduct of part of this chamber.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2011-11-02,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (11:17):  Senator Macdonald might have noticed that he just beat me to the call when I wanted to speak earlier, so it is not so much at his invitation that I am standing to speak but that I think it is important that I put my credentials and views on the record, given that people have been quite free in talking about me.


First of all, I would like to say that it would indeed be a great privilege if the Senate were to see fit to support my nomination to chair this important committee—one of the most busy committees of the Senate, I understand—the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which looks into a broad range of significant legal issues affecting Australians.


I would like to acknowledge that I have been on the committee for some four months, since I was first sworn into the Senate. I have had the opportunity to observe Senator Humphries's chairing of the committee and I would certainly acknowledge that he has been a fair and diligent chair, and I have been impressed with his chairmanship. Of course we understand that this is not personal at all. I would also like to indicate that I would intend to continue in that vein, and I might come to that later.


I did find it a bit disappointing that Senator Humphries chose to, perhaps, move away from that stance when he was suggesting that, by virtue of my being a member of the Greens, I would somehow, therefore, not be able to chair the committee in a non-partisan and open-minded way. In fact I think that observation belies the experience and track record of my colleague Senator Siewert's chairing of the Community Affairs References Committee. There have certainly been majority reports of that committee by the opposition and the Greens and not always majority reports involving the government, so I think the evidence speaks for itself, but I will come back to that.


As I said, this is not personal. It seems to me that in a sense this is a principle. If you look at the statistics and at the idea of representation of the Australian vote in the Senate, it is an appropriate situation to come to that there are two committees being chaired by the Greens in this parliament. Of the 16 paired legislation and references committees we know that eight are chaired by the government, seven by the coalition and, up to now, one by the Greens. We have 76 senators in the chamber and, as of 1 July, we have nine Greens, which is 12 per cent of the make-up of the chamber. It is fair that committees be chaired in the same proportions, which do reflect the true representation and make-up of the Senate. For those who have not had their calculators out, 12 per cent of 16 is indeed two. As we know, there is also a precedent for this situation. When there were nine Australian Democrats senators they also held two chairs; presumably that was because at that time it was also considered fair and appropriate that the chairing of the committees represent the proportion of the Australian public's vote for senators.


Senate committees are a great aspect of the Senate's work. I have been in the Senate only four months but I have had an opportunity to observe the work that the Senate does, and I think that the work of the committees is often undervalued and not fully acknowledged by the Australian public. I have been very impressed by the degree of goodwill, collegiality and collaboration that occurs on Senate committees and the depth to which important issues affecting Australians are considered and dealt with on the committees, with a good attitude by all participants. I think the committees are a great opportunity to inquire into a range of important issues affecting Australians and, because of that, I think it is appropriate that there be a democratic representation on those committees in respect of the chairs.


I want to come to my qualifications. I think it is important and I think I do need to be accountable in terms of putting those on the record. I believe I am well suited to this role. I was admitted as a legal practitioner in 1984 and, over the 26 years since then, I have carried out a very broad range of roles. In two states of Australia and also in the UK I have worked as a solicitor and legal practitioner. As well as that, my work has spanned private practice, community work, legal decision making, mediation and teaching. As a result of this broad spectrum of legal work, I believe I have a uniquely broad understanding and insight into the various components which contribute to our strong legal culture in Australia and our adherence to the important and crucial concept of the rule of law. I worked in the civil litigation system as a private practitioner, when I worked in the country. So I also have the experience of being a generalist working with country people in Ballarat. At that time I worked in family law, and I did minor criminal work, but I particularly worked with workers' compensation and personal injury litigation—so I got an interesting and quite deep insight into the difficulties and challenges of civil litigation.


I then went to work in a community legal centre with the Tenants Union legal service. Through that role I gained an understanding of the importance of community legal centres and that movement, and the way they offer an opportunity of access to justice for many Australians, including those who are disadvantaged and would not have any ability to prosecute their legal rights in the absence of those important centres and that sector.


I then went to work in London, in the Borough of Hackney, where I worked with the trauma of child welfare law for a London council department. I experienced there the challenges of a London council with very high needs but few resources.


I have worked in the role of an investigating and conciliation solicitor with the Legal Practitioners Conduct Board in South Australia, and that gave me an insight into the regulation of the legal profession, the handling of concerns about misconduct on the part of legal practitioners and dealing with complaints from the public.


Finally, I think it is important to note that I have been a legal decision maker on three different tribunals, including 10 years on the Residential Tenancy Tribunal and 13 years as a Deputy President of the Guardianship Board in South Australia, which gave me an opportunity to conduct hearings of an extremely sensitive and difficult nature involving people with mental illnesses and disabilities and form views about the appropriateness of appointing decision makers for people who are no longer able to make their own decisions by virtue of mental incapacity. It was important work; it involved considering people's legal rights in a range of ways, and it involved hearing evidence from people who were vulnerable and often had difficulty communicating. Through my work on tribunals I developed skills in conducting hearings, listening carefully to witnesses and weighing up evidence in order to make considered decisions that were then subject to appeal and had to be justified.


Obviously, these are all matters which go to the effectiveness of chairing a Senate committee. As I said, for the last four months I have had the opportunity of observing the Senate committee system, and I have been very impressed with the goodwill and collaboration that I have seen. Committees are one of the most valuable and constructive aspects of the Senate's work and I am committed to participating and playing my part in that. If I am elected to the Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee I would look forward to working with senators across the political spectrum. I have a commitment to dealing with matters openly, fairly and on their merits. I believe that my experience and track record stands me in good stead with this, and I look forward to investigating the important legal issues and helping the chamber fulfil our worthy role as a house of review.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (11:26):  The Senate has very important constitutional responsibilities. The Senate has a very important job to do as part of the checks and balances on government power. The Senate has a job to do to scrutinise the activities and the performance of government, to hold the government to account—that is what the Australian people expect us to do. Naturally, opposition senators are more enthusiastic about ensuring that the activities of government are properly scrutinised than government senators are. And that is of course the way the system has been designed; that is how it is meant to operate.


Senate references committees are a key tool for the Senate in its pursuit of its responsibilities of scrutinising the activities and performance of government. So when we as a Senate make a decision about who should chair a Senate references committee, it is not just about a job for an individual senator; it is about the chair of that committee helping the Senate fulfil its core constitutional responsibilities in scrutinising the activities of government and holding the government to account.


The Greens are a party of government. The Greens have lost all their enthusiasm for scrutinising the activities of government, for holding the government to account, for ensuring that we have open and transparent government. The Greens used to be enthusiastic about scrutinising the activities of government, about holding the government to account. The Greens used to be an enthusiastic opposition party in the Senate. Between 1996 and 2007 the Greens were very enthusiastic about scrutinising the activities of government and holding the government to account. Even between 2007 and 2010 the Greens were still somewhat committed to scrutinising the activities of government. But ever since they signed that little piece of paper, ever since Prime Minister Gillard and Senator Bob Brown met in front of that little table, signed that little piece of paper, signed the alliance agreement—since they joined together to form the government of Australia—they have lost all enthusiasm for holding the government to account.


Look no further than the Greens' conduct in this chamber. There used to be a day when the Greens were completely opposed to the use of the gag. There used to be a time when the Greens thought it was evil to guillotine debate—it was anti-democratic. Now, whenever the Greens are unhappy about where a particular debate is going, whenever the Greens are unhappy that the government is too much on the back foot, is under too much pressure because the Senate is scrutinising the activities and performance of government, because the Senate is holding the government to account, the Greens are at the front of the queue when it comes to gagging debate, when it comes to guillotining debate, when it comes to preventing the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities of holding the government to account. The Greens used to be in favour of openness and transparency in government. In fact, we were led to believe that the inclusion of the Greens as part of this Labor-Green government—with its Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Conroy, who is here in the chamber—was going to be a new era of openness and transparency. What a disappointment that has been. The Greens are now working very hard to help with the cover-up. There has been cover-up after cover-up by a secretive government.


If the Greens were truly committed to openness and transparency in government, why didn't they join the coalition in forcing the government to release all of the information about the mining tax revenue estimates? Why didn't the Greens join the coalition in forcing the government to release all of the information about their carbon tax modelling? Why do the Greens vote again and again with the Labor Party in preventing the Senate getting information out of the government about the activities of government? It is because the Greens political party are an integral part of this government. They have lost all enthusiasm for the job of holding the government to account. Yes, the Greens were successful at the last election. Their representation in this chamber increased and there is a case for the Greens getting additional chairs, but they should not be chairs of the references committees. These committees are part of the Senate activities in holding the government to account; they are there to be filled by enthusiastic opposition senators focused on scrutinising the activities of government. The Greens should get the government chairs on those committees.


People across the community need to understand that there are effectively two committees for each area of policy responsibility. There are legislation committees, chaired by government senators, and there are references committees, chaired by opposition senators. The Greens are a party of government and the increased representation of the Greens in this chamber should be reflected by an increase in their representation in government chairs of legislation committees. But this is not what the Greens are all about. 


Senator Ludlam, who has just been relieved as Acting Deputy President by Senator Cameron, has talked in the past about his commitment to increased openness and transparency from government. That was before the 2010 election. Since the 2010 election Senator Ludlam, along with every single one of the other Greens senators, has been part of the cover-up. He has been part of this constant push by the Labor Party to keep information away from the public. References committees are a very important tool for the Senate to pursue the government and get access to information the government is not readily prepared to release or put in the public domain. Remember, this is part of the deal that the Labor Party signed with the Greens to form a government. There was a clause in there: we were going to have an Information Commissioner. Do you remember that? The Information Commissioner was going to settle disputes between the Senate and the executive government about the release of information when the government refused to put particular information into the public domain. The Greens said there was going to be huge achievement, huge progress and a huge increase in openness and transparency, because the Greens had convinced the Labor Party that the Information Commissioner was going to settle disputes between executive government and the Senate about the release of information that the executive government wanted to keep secret. What has happened to that? We are now 15 months down the track—about halfway through this term of government—and the Information Commissioner is still not in a position where he can fulfil that role. They are just empty words in that particular agreement. It is another example demonstrating the Greens' total lack of enthusiasm for scrutinising the activities of government.


The Labor Party clearly likes the fact that the Greens would take away a chair position from the opposition. It is very convenient for a government that is secretive and non-transparent, that is a bad government that has a lot to cover-up and does not want the pesky scrutiny of an effective references committee with an effective opposition chair who is enthusiastic and committed to scrutinising the activities of a bad government. They would much rather have one of their buddies chair a references committee. If one of their buddies from the Greens chairs a references committee it is going to be much easier to deal with; it is going to be a lot less hard work. They are going to be much less on the backfoot having to provide information that they would rather not have out in the public domain. There are all these stuff-ups out there by the government; there is a lot of information the government wants to keep secret. If you look at the performance of the Greens over the last 15 months, my suspicion is that the Greens will continue to be complicit in helping the Labor Party cover up whatever they can get away with. That is not in the Senate's best interests and not in our national interest.


The Constitution has designed the checks and balances in our system, the checks and balances on government power. The way the Senate is supposed to operate with government parties and opposition parties is clearly for opposition parties to do the best they can holding government to account and scrutinising their performance, and for the government to govern. The Greens are trying to have it both ways. They are trying to be the government and they are trying, badly, to be the opposition as well. And they cannot. That is a schizophrenic approach to the operation of this chamber that is not going to work.


The Labor Party is so keen to have a Green senator chair an opposition committee that the government is moving the appoint­ment. Why are the Greens not putting this proposition to the Senate? That particular question is a very good question that was raised by an earlier speaker. Why is it that a Labor minister—the Manager of Govern­ment Business in the Senate, no less—is moving this appointment of a government senator representing the Greens to be the chair of what is supposed to be an opposition dominated committee. Why is that? No doubt it is because, in this area, the govern­ment is very, very keen to have less scrutiny, to have less pesky questions asked and to have a less enthusiastic pursuer of bad government policy. They want somebody who is going to be part of the government team to take some of the heat off the government, and that is not in our public interest.


The question has been asked: if the Greens want another committee chair, why aren't they focusing on their core business? They want to make people believe that their core business is about caring for the environment. But we all know that is a ruse, we all know that is to make themselves respectable with the mainstream across the Australian community. And it probably has worked to a degree, sadly. People have not really seen the true face of the Greens. But this move today actually shows what really makes the Greens tick. It is not the environment, it is not doing the right thing on so-called green issues, what makes the Greens tick is a social agenda that does not have mainstream support across the Australian community. Therefore they are forever looking for opportunities to weasel their way in, to sneak their way in. In fact, I would be very interested to know what their intended agenda is going to be once they control the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. I just wonder what Senator Ursula Stephens thinks about a Greens senator driving and controlling the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee agenda. Where are the good people in the Labor Party who I know are privately concerned, the same as coalition senators are, about many of the loopy ideas that the Greens want to pursue? Where were they when the Labor Party made the decision to give them this key strategic role where they are going to be able to bring one loopy idea after another before this chamber? Where are they? Silent.


I have to say that people across Australia are increasingly concerned about who is driving this agenda. They know that this is a government with the green tail wagging the red dog. They know that the Greens are running the show and they are concerned about it. None of the issues that we are debating at the moment are issues initiated by the government, whether it is the carbon tax, whether it is gay marriage, whatever it is. It is either the Greens or some Independent that is forcing the government's hand. This Labor dog is just doing as they are told by their Greens and Independent tail. I can tell you that people across Australia are increasingly concerned about it. This move today is just another move that will reduce the level of scrutiny, the level of pressure on executive government that would come from this chamber, which will lead to inferior public policy outcomes. That is not in the national interest.


Like others, I do not really know Senator Wright all that well. I have had a look at her biography on the parliamentary website and I have listened carefully to what she has had to say this morning and she clearly has extensive legal experience. However, she does not have much experience in this chamber. In fact, she does not have much experience as a member of parliament more generally. She has been here for four months and I am sure that throughout her career she will make a fine contribution for her party. Like all of us, it takes a while to get into the job and to learn all the ropes and to learn how to properly perform these sorts of leadership responsibilities as part of the Senate. But what I do know is that Senator Gary Humphries has been a senator for nine years, has been a member of the ACT Legislative Assembly for 14 years, has been a Chief Minister and has been the Attorney-General of the ACT for six years. He is a distinguished parliamentarian and of course, above everything, he is part of the opposition and he is an enthusiastic opposition senator who is enthusiastic about scrutinising the activities of government, which is the job of the chair of the committee. This is not about a job for Senator Humphries. Senator Humphries has clearly got the credentials, the track record and the experience to be a very effective chair of the legal and constitutional committee, as he has been in recent times. But more important than anything is that, given the responsibilities of the Senate, given the responsibilities of Senate references committees as part of our overall role to hold the government to account and scrutinise the activities of government, he will be more motivated to do a good job.


This is not a reflection on Senator Wright as an individual senator, this is a reflection on the position she holds as part of the government. Senator Wright will clearly be less enthusiastic about probing and actively pursuing the activities of this government. I see Senator Wright shaking her head and I admire her idealism. But the truth of the matter is that she will find out very quickly that she will not be in charge of her own destiny in relation to this. She is part of a Labor-Green alliance in government. Senator Bob Brown and Senator Christine Milne will tell her very quickly if she gets out of line. If she is seen to be giving the government too much grief, you watch how quickly Senator Brown and Senator Milne on behalf of Prime Minister Gillard are going to come down on her like a tonne of bricks. There is absolutely no way that a Greens senator who is part of this government is going to be as enthusiastic in scrutinising the activities and performance of this bad government as a senator representing the coalition in this place. And for the coalition there clearly is no senator better equipped to lead the work of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee than Senator Humphries.


That is why the coalition strongly opposes the motion that was moved on behalf of the Labor-Green government by the manager of the Labor-Green government's business in the Senate, Senator Ludwig. That is why, even though we do not agree with giving the Greens, who are part of the government, an opposition position, which will lessen the level of scrutiny of the government, in a spirit of generosity and cooperation we have suggested an amendment which would see the Greens be able to take responsibility for their core area of interest, which we are led to believe is to focus on environmental issues around Australia. Clearly they could not care less about the environment. Not only did they first demand the position of Chair of the Community Affairs References Committee, which has responsibility for a wide range of social policy issues, unrelated to the environment; their second priority is the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which has got nothing to do with the environment whatsoever. This is showing their true colours. As Senator Joyce said earlier, their true priority is to focus, through this particular mechanism, on social engineering and social agendas that are widely opposed across the Australian community. 


This is a dark day when it comes to the Senate's role in scrutinising the activities of government. This is a day when the Senate's capacity to hold a bad government to account will be lessened if this motion gets up. (Time expired)

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2011-11-02,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (11:46):  Colleagues, for the last little while I have been coming into this place day after day and thinking that it cannot really get any more pear shaped under the Labor-Greens-Independents government. But today we have it. It has got even more pear shaped. You are quite right, I say to Senator Cormann, to call it a dark day. Here we have another one. 


When I came into this place one of the things that struck me was the sense of process. One of the very daunting things when you first come into this place is understanding the processes of the Senate, because so many of them are by convention: you cannot read them in the standing orders; you cannot read them in Odgers. It takes some time to understand the process. While you get an understanding of the process, you also gain a real respect for the process. I think that is one of the most important things about the Senate. Not having spent time in the other place, I cannot really comment on whether they have that same respect for the process. Perhaps those colleagues who have been there, such as Senator Ronaldson, might be able to comment on that at some stage. I very much feel the weight of the respect for the chamber. 


So when we have a situation today, with the nomination for the chair of a committee coming through the government of the day in the Senate chamber rather than through the normal processes, where the committees themselves determine their chairs—as should be the case—it is really quite extraordinary. The respect that should be held for the Senate and the entire processes around that have simply disappeared. To go back to what our leader, Senator Abetz, said earlier—he was very eloquent indeed in his remarks—the role of the committee chairs is, in many respects, to hold the government to account. 


The very simple fact that we have here today is that this is about numbers. The Greens are saying that they are entitled to an extra chair of a committee because their numbers have increased in this chamber. That would be fine and that would be worthy and that would be appropriate if they were not part of the Labor government. This is the problem with the whole premise of what they are putting forward, because the Greens are no longer independent of the Labor Party. Therefore, they are not at liberty to count their numbers separately from the Labor Party. That is precisely why they are not entitled to a second chair. 


Having spent some time as whip and having worked very closely with the then Liberal whip—an excellent Liberal whip, Senator Parry, who has now moved on to Deputy President, having been replaced by the equally able Senator Kroger—I know that so much of the chamber is run on numbers. Because we are in this place and we are respectful of this place, we do the numbers properly in terms of entitlement: what we are entitled to cross-party, what we are entitled to in opposition and what we are entitled to in government. There is a respect for that process and there is an understanding that, even if sometimes we do not like it, what the numbers say leads to the true entitlement. That is why it is so appalling today to see the Greens try to commandeer another chair, because they are simply not entitled to it. The numbers do not stack up that way, because they have given the Australian people a Labor government. 


If the Greens had not agreed to be part of the Labor-Greens-Independent government after the last election, we would not have a Labor minority government now. So, colleagues, by the very simple fact that the Greens agreed to be part of that government—that incredibly bad Labor-Greens-Independent government—they have forgone their right to use their numbers to try and commandeer another chair. That is not hysterical. That is not coming from this side of the chamber railing against the fact that the Greens should not have that position. It is a logical, numerical deduction. Those on the crossbenches cannot, on the one hand, choose to say that they are part of the minority government, and then, on the other hand, choose to say, for the purposes of gaining another chair, 'We, for this particular moment, choose to sit outside of the government arrangement that we have entered into.' It simply does not make sense. The Greens are doing this only because they can and because the government is letting them. As my very good colleague Senator Cormann and other colleagues have asked before me, why is it that the government has moved for the Chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References to go to a Greens senator? Why didn't the Greens come and do it? Why didn't the Greens themselves walk into this chamber and put what they believe, through their somewhat erroneous counting of the numbers and putting their numbers the way that they have, to the chamber? Why didn't the Greens come into this chamber and say, 'We believe we are entitled to an extra chairmanship'? Why didn't the Greens do it? Why did the Greens have to hide behind the Labor government and let the Labor government move it? 


It is incongruous. It does not make sense. If the Greens are arguing that their numbers, separate from the Labor Party, entitle them to another chair's position, that means it is an issue entirely separate from the Labor government. So why on earth would the Labor government be moving it on their behalf? I cannot even imagine why they would do that, except for the fact that they are in cohort, working together, which again negates the claim for the extra chairmanship.


Colleagues, as the Greens had increased their numbers by a few in the Senate—a sad day for Australia that was, but we'll get to that at another election—wouldn't you have thought that they would have come in and said, 'We think on our numbers we should have another chair,' put it to the chamber and expected the Labor government to then agree with them? That seems to me to be what the normal process should have been. That seems the proper process to follow. But no. We have the Labor government moving the nomination on behalf of the Greens for something that should have been a decision of the committee. It is quite extraordinary. As I said at the outset, it is yet another pear shaped day in the Senate chamber. 


You only have to look at this situation to see that the Greens are trying to have it both ways. On the one hand they want to say they are part of the government. They want to say they are doing all these things and having all these outcomes by being part of the government. Yet on the other hand they want to say: 'Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no—we're independent of the Labor Party. We're not with them. We are our own Greens party.' It is absolute rubbish and it really does show what we have known all along and what is only just starting to come out now that there is starting to be some scrutiny of the Greens now we have this Labor-Greens-Indepen­dents alliance: there is one rule for the Greens and another rule for anybody else. One thing is okay for them, but there is a different expectation for anybody else. As one of my colleagues said earlier, if we on this side miss a division it is the end of the world and the Greens rail on and on about how terrible it is, but if Senator Brown misses a division that is perfectly okay; there is a perfectly sensible reason for that. That is only one example. 


Thank goodness there is finally starting to be some scrutiny of what the Australian Greens actually do and what they actually say, because they have gotten away for far too long with not having any scrutiny of their activities, of their policy and of what they are doing here in the Senate chamber. Isn't it extraordinary? We have seen the Greens in the past railing against the proper processes of the Senate not happening, but what did we see just a couple of weeks ago, when the carbon tax bills were first brought to the Senate? We saw the government guillotine the debate. Debate ensued, as the phrase has it, on all sides, all around the chamber, and then we had Senator Siewert stand up and give us a dissertation on how dreadful it was that the coalition had in the past guillotined debate in this chamber, how awful it was. Then she supported the guillotine. The entire Greens party supported the guillotine. Why was that, I wonder, given that obviously they have the deeply held belief that the guillotine should never be used? We have heard them speak about it in the chamber before. I know: it was because the Greens are part of the Labor government. Isn't that funny? So Senator Siewert stood there railing about the guillotine and how terrible it was that we were using it and then she voted against the government. To me it would make perfect common sense for the Greens to then vote against the Labor government. But, oh, no—they could not do that, because they are in government. They are in government with the Labor Party.


That is precisely why they are not entitled to this chairmanship position. They are simply not entitled to it, because they are part of the government. You have to count numbers on the other side of the chamber together because they are the government. We do it on this side of the chamber. We are two separate parties in coalition, and our numbers are counted collectively. That makes perfect sense. Within the coalition the Nats have a certain number of senators. We deal with that as the numbers of the whole Senate on this Nationals and coalition side, and we are entitled to certain positions. Exactly the same thing should happen on the government side of the chamber because the Greens and the Labor Party are in government. They are the government numbers. They are total numbers. They are not separate from the Labor Party. There are 39 of them on that side of the chamber. There are nine Greens and 30 Labor. They should be counted together—they are government—and then the chairs should be divvied up. The Greens cannot be treated as separate.


If, as we expect, we are going to be in the position where the Greens are granted a second chair of committee—and for those of you listening out there who are thinking: 'What's all this hoopla about committees?' it is really important that this process is followed properly because those committees do an enormous amount of work and it has to be balanced—if we accept that the government is going to put this through, the real question for the people out there is: why is it that the Greens have chosen legal and constitutional affairs? I note that Senator Collins over there is in fierce defence of the Greens.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Why did you knock them off? This is such hypocrisy.




Senator NASH:
  I will take the interjection because it shows it even more, colleagues. When we have Labor ministers on the other side of the chamber in defence of the Greens, doesn't it carry more weight to the argument that they are in partnership, that they are in coalition? That is precisely why this extra chairmanship should not be granted.


That being the case, let us just have a look at what the Greens have chosen for their second committee: the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Com­mittee. Maybe I am missing something here, but when I think of the Greens I think about them talking about the environment. Colleagues, maybe you might think something different, but when I look at the Greens I think 'the environment'. It sort of goes, like 'horse' goes with 'saddle'. But they want the legal and constitutional affairs committee. Why would the party who call themselves the Australian Greens, who spend their time talking about the environment, not want the environment committee, particularly when the environ­ment committee also covers communica­tions—and I know that Senator Ludlam has a very keen and genuine interest in communications? Why would they not want the chair of the environment and communications committee? That simply does not make sense, and that says to the Australian people that the Greens are duplicitous, because if they truly were the party of the environment they would want to chair the environment committee. I do not think you have to be a rocket scientist to figure that out.


I think there would be a number of people who are listening at the moment, thinking: 'Why on earth don't the Greens want the environment committee? Why do they want the legal and constitutional affairs com­mittee?' This is a question to be asked of the Australian Greens. This is really serious. If the Greens' core business is the environment, why do they not want the environment committee? That, colleagues, is the question for the Australian Greens. You can only surmise, you can only deduce, that the reason they want the legal and constitutional affairs committee is for the purposes of their social agenda. We can only deduce from that that the Greens' social agenda takes priority over the environment.


I would say that there are a lot of people who have supported the Greens over past years—not that there are that many of them when you look at the whole perspective of Australia—who would think, rightly or wrongly, that they are the party of the environment, not that they are the party of the social agenda that they want to prosecute. And yet here today we have the Greens wanting the legal and constitutional affairs committee chairmanship, not the environ­ment committee chairmanship. Colleagues, I cannot for the life of me work that out. I tell you: I am starting to miss the Democrats, because at least they had the courage of their convictions. At least they were prepared to stand up for what they believed in, and at least they made a contribution to this chamber that was not part of a Labor-Greens-Independent government.


What an extraordinary day we have today, when the Leader of the Australian Greens—trying, of course, to upset the Nationals, as he likes to try to do—refers to a National as a 'poddy calf'. If that is the best that Senator Brown can do, I think he is going to have to come up with something a little better. I am a little more thick-skinned than that. I tend not to think of myself as a poddy calf. I thought Senator Brown might have been able to do a little better. What sort of pear shaped day is this? It is extraordinary that we see this situation.


The Greens also like to rail on about transparency and about the processes of the chamber, and yet, today, what do we see? We see that very process being undermined, that very process being manipulated to give an outcome to the government side of the chamber that should not be delivered. It simply should not be.


They know this on the other side of the chamber. They know the numbers do not stack up. They know that they are the government. They know the Greens are part of the coalition. They know. But this will show the Australian people the true face of the Greens. We are seeing today the real Greens. They are, as John Anderson, ex-Deputy Prime Minister, so eloquently put it many years ago, the watermelons: green on the outside and pink in the middle. When you chop a watermelon in half, Senator Ronaldson, you know as well as I do that there is a lot more red than there is green. And that is what has become so clear today, because the Greens have placed their social agenda as more important than their environmental concerns.


My colleagues and I on this side of the chamber have always suspected it. We have suspected that for a long time. But today it has been proven. Today we have the proof that the Greens' social agenda is more important than their environmental agenda. The reason I say that, and the reason that that cannot be argued against, is that they have chosen to take the chairmanship of the legal and constitutional affairs committee and not the chairmanship of the environment com­mittee. This might seem a small issue, but this is a huge, watershed day. This is the day that the Greens showed that they are not an environmental party. This is about their social agenda. This is about social engineering. This is about their social agenda, and we have seen the true Greens today.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (12:07):  I want to reflect on what I thought was a quite undignified spectacle today, about which I hope, on reflection, there will be some regret. I will preface my comments by saying this. Senator Wright and I go back, in the loosest sense, to her days in Ballarat and we do share that aspect. But it was an undignified spectacle today when a new member of this place had to stand up and justify their appointment. What we saw today was one candidate being forced by her leadership to justify her appointment, when the person who should be in the role and who was then sitting behind me, Senator Humphries, had no such requirement to justify his record and his role because his record stood for itself. I hope that Senator Bob Brown reflects on this undignified spectacle today. I hope Senator Brown reflects on what he has forced one of his own to do—to stand up in this chamber and read out her CV to justify this very grubby deal. Senator Brown—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—if that is the way you are going to conduct yourself in this chamber and if that is the pressure that you are going to put your own members under, then I think you need to very much reflect on what has occurred today.


There have been a number of discussions, quite rightly, about the utter hypocrisy of the Australian Greens, but I do not want to repeat those comments. What I do want to talk about today is not those who sit at the other end of the chamber but those who sit opposite us. I say to the Australian Labor Party: are you aware of the extraordinary damage that you are doing to yourselves with this unholy alliance? I know a number of people on the other side of the chamber—not down the other end but on the other side of the chamber—who do not support the Greens' four pillars and do not support the Greens' desire for death duties, and we can run through all their loopy economic policies.




Senator Brandis:
  Compulsory vegetarianism!




Senator RONALDSON:
  Yes, we can run through all of them, and I know there are many on the other side who do not share those ideas. We have got an unholy alliance that will end up eating the party that drove its implementation. The Australian Labor Party will be eaten by this group of nine here and one in the other place. The Australian Labor Party will be eaten by this alliance. It is absolutely fascinating to reflect on the signing ceremony—




Senator Brandis:
  For civil unions.




Senator RONALDSON:
  Yes. If this signing ceremony had been done after the decision by the Independents as to who would form the government then you might say this was a marriage of convenience, but indeed it was not. This signing ceremony was done before the decision of the Independents was known, so this is no false marriage; this is no accident. This was a deliberate decision by the Australian Labor Party to hop into bed with the Australian Greens. There is a very old saying, as you would be acutely aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, that if you sleep with dogs you wake up with fleas. The fleas on the body of the Australian Labor Party will not be small ones; they will be very substantial lumps. We are already seeing the impact of the fleas on the body of what was a great political party, not one that I agree with philosophically but one that has served a very useful purpose in the political process and one that took some decisions, particularly in the early nineties under Hawke and Keating, which I actually thought were good for this country—and I will give credit where credit is due—to open up this economy. So I have given them their due, but the once great Australian Labor Party with this unholy alliance finds itself with a primary vote of 29 per cent. If there is not one senator opposite—not down the back but opposite—who does not think for one minute that part of that is due to this unholy alliance then they are utterly delusional.


We know what the other part is. The other part is the great lie in Australian politics: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. That is part of the 29 per cent, but the other part of the 29 per cent is the Australian Labor Party ceding political ground to the Australian Greens for utter convenience in a desperate attempt to maintain government. We have seen, in a desperate attempt to show that the decision to change from one Prime Minister to another was appropriate, the Prime Minister of this country leave your political party, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, hanging out to dry, not for the short term and not for the medium term but for the long term. It is absolutely decision time now for the Australian Labor Party as to how you are going to conduct yourselves in relation to this relationship. We should not see another example like today's of an unseemly sight when a new senator is required to read their CV into Hansard to justify their position. That is unseemly and that is an exercise in complete and utter futility. As I said earlier, I hope that today's spectacle is not repeated in this place.


I will finish on this note, as I know my colleague Senator Brandis wants to speak as well. If this is not reflected upon today by those of you opposite, if you are not prepared to accept that this relationship and this unholy alliance have the ability to destroy the Australian Labor Party and if you are not prepared to stand up and say, 'We are not prepared to tolerate that,' then you will die by your own swords.




Senator Brandis:
  You will die the death of a thousand cuts.




Senator RONALDSON:
  Yes, the death of a thousand cuts. Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, I know that you are probably philosophically more aligned with the Greens. I also know that the majority of your colleagues in the right of the Australian Labor Party are not aligned with the Greens. The spectacle of the right wing of the Australian Labor Party rolling over to the Australian Greens, knowing what they stand for and knowing what the right of your political party stands for, was undignified for a party that had its roots not far away from where I live. Part of it was where I live. The Australian union movement and Creswick go back a long way, as the Acting Deputy President will know.


This is now a challenge for this political party. Is it going to let itself be destroyed by this alliance or is someone going to wake up at some stage and say, 'We are no longer prepared to see our great party destroyed by this unholy alliance—by this marriage.' This marriage is not driven by convenience; it is, regrettably for the Australian Labor Party, now driven by philosophical alignment. The challenge is there. I hope, for political process and for good government in this country, that the Australian Labor Party realises the damage it has done itself. I hope the Australian Labor Party does not let us have a repeat of what has occurred today.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:16):  I rise to close the debate on behalf of the opposition. I know that these decisions about committee allocations do not necessarily or even largely depend upon the merits of individual senators. I mean no disrespect to Senator Wright in what I am about to say, but if one considers the outcome of what is proposed to displace Senator Gary Humphries as the chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee with Senator Penny Wright, it is a travesty. It is preposterous. I have nothing against Senator Wright—I do not particularly know Senator Wright—but she has been a member of the Senate for four months. She has no experience as a senator to speak of in any respect. The fact that she was reduced to reading her CV onto the record earlier on was a humiliation for her.


I mean no personal disrespect to Senator Wright, but we are being asked to elect her as the chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, one of the most prestigious committees in this chamber, at the expense of Senator Gary Humphries, the only person in this Senate who has been a head of government in this country. He is a former Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory. He is the only person in this chamber who has ever been an attorney-general; Senator Humphries was for several years the Attorney-General of the Australian Capital Territory. With all due respect to Senator Wright—and this is not meant as a personal slight—to suggest that she is a more appropriate person to chair the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee with no experience as a senator and no experience in government, than former attorney-general and former chief minister Senator Gary Humphries, whose discharge of that role has commanded respect on both sides of this chamber, is ludicrous. There are very few people in this Senate, on either side or on the crossbench, who enjoy the respect that Senator Gary Humphries enjoys.


As I said at the start, these decisions do not turn largely upon the identities of individual senators. We need to see this for what it is: an attempt by the Greens, supported by a slavish government, to take over the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. It is nothing short of a naked power play, and Senator Wright is being used as a pawn in that naked power play.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Brandis, I am reluctant to interject here, but I think you are getting close to breaching standing order 193(3). You are reflecting continually on a senator in a manner that is not proper, and I ask you to bear that in mind.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I bear in mind your guidance, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am sure Senator Wright is a decent person, and I cannot fail to imagine that privately she would feel quite uncomfortable with the position in which she has been placed. This is a power play. Let nobody have any illusions about that. I follow on from some remarks that my friend Senator Michael Ronaldson made about what has driven this power play—that is, not merely the rise of the Greens but the invasion of the Australian government by the Greens.


In this peculiar time in Australian history we have an Australian Labor Party government whose agenda is dictated by the Greens. One of the many reasons we in the opposition regard this as an outrageous misuse of power is the Greens are not a crossbench party in any real sense of the word. They are to all intents and purposes an element, an essential ingredient, of this government, so much so that the government is in power today because of a written agreement executed by the Prime Minister and Senator Brown. No crossbench party has had more power over a government in our history than the Australian Greens have over this Labor government today. That is why we in the opposition say that committee chairmanships reserved for the crossbench parties ought not to be given to the Greens, because the Greens are not, except in a purely theoretical sense, a crossbench party; they are an integral part of the Gillard government.


I am, as some senators may be aware, something of a student of Australian political history and I have had many, many long and enjoyable discussions with my friend Senator John Faulkner about the history of the Australian Labor Party. I acknowledge that although the Australian Labor Party are my party's principal political antagonists the Australian Labor Party nevertheless—as Australia's oldest political party, having been formed during the shearers strike in Queensland in 1891, famously under the Tree of Knowledge in Barcaldine—have a long and honourable place in Australian political history. There are many of the great events of Australian history for which the Australian Labor Party was responsible. In particular, no-one will forget that it was a government of the Australian Labor Party, led by John Curtin, that took Australia through the most critical stages of the Pacific war.


Throughout the decades, we in the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have had bitter disputes on a range of different issues which have decided the course of the history of our nation. Most of the time, I say, the Liberal Party has been right, but some of the time I concede, because I am a generous person, the Labor Party has been right. But in the course of all of those decades the shape and course of Australian history have been charted by the debate between the coalition parties and the Australian Labor Party. Together, through the dialectical process of parliamentary debate and political argument, we have shaped the direction of this country, so that where Australia is today is in some sense the product of both our political traditions: the Liberal tradition and the Labor tradition.


The Australian Greens share no part of that tradition. There is no element of Australia today, the most successful and prosperous nation in the world, that is thanks to anything the Australian Greens have done—nothing—and yet at this particular strange, peculiar point in our nation's story all of a sudden the Greens, opportunistically seizing the circumstance of a hung parliament, have seized control of a Labor government and seized control of its agenda.


Let me give you two examples: the carbon tax and asylum seeker policy. Last year, of the 150 members elected to the House of Representatives at the 2010 election, 148 were elected on a promise not to introduce a carbon tax. Every member of the coalition, every member of the Australian Labor Party and most of the Independents were elected on an undertaking not to introduce a carbon tax. Yet today we are on the threshold of passing legislation in this chamber to introduce a carbon tax, because of the Greens and because of the undue influence the Greens have, the capacity of the Greens to exercise political duress over the Australian Labor Party.


The other great issue of the day is asylum seeker policy. At the 2010 election both the coalition and the Australian Labor Party went to the people promising to build their asylum seeker policy around the policy of offshore processing. Today we do not have offshore processing, once again because of the Greens. The two great issues of the day—a carbon tax and asylum seeker policy—have produced outcomes at variance from that which both sides of politics promised the Australian people only last year, because of the political duress that the Greens have been able to exercise over this government.


I join with my friend Senator Ronaldson in saying to you, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron—and you and I are quite friendly, we chide each other in the corridors; I can't help liking you, I am embarrassed to admit, though I might be one of the few—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I am at a great disadvantage here. You know it.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I do not say this in a chiding way; I say quite seriously to you, as someone who has given your life to the Australian Labor Party: be careful what you wish for, because these allies of yours at whose behest you formed government are your most lethal political enemies. They are more lethal political enemies for the Australian Labor Party than the coalition are, because we may be the alternative government but the Greens are the alternative party of the Left and they will eat you up, and I know that many, many of your colleagues are deeply concerned about it. Why do you think it is that today, among voters for the left, more than a third would prefer to vote for the Australian Greens than for the Australian Labor Party? That is what the latest opinion polls show: a Labor Party primary vote of 29 per cent and a Greens primary vote of 15 per cent. They have lost a third of their electoral base to these people—a third. If those figures are disaggregated by generation, a voter of left-wing sympathies who is under the age of 30 is just as likely to vote for the Greens as for the Australian Labor Party. And a voter under the age of 25 whose sympathies are with the left is actually more likely to vote for the Greens than to vote for the Australian Labor Party.


I know that the smart people in the Australian Labor Party are deeply, deeply worried about this trend—and so they should be. The Greens are not like the One Nation party in the 1990s, which was a fly-by-night phenomenon—largely a personality cult, driven by the circumstances of the time. The Greens are here to stay. With each passing year, like a flyblown sheep, the Labor Party will be hollowed out by the rise of the Greens. And they brought this upon themselves by being prepared to pay the 30 pieces of silver to Senator Bob Brown in order to get in to government after the 2010 election. The Australian Labor Party should be particularly ashamed and afraid of the new authoritarian tone that the Greens have brought to Australian politics, which Labor has embraced as the price of government.


Patrick Moore, one of the founders of Greenpeace, a few years ago was asked, 'What went wrong with the environmental movement?' He said:


… following the falling of the Berlin wall, and the end of the peace movement, and the end of radical socialist politics in the labor and women's movement, an awful lot of those people drifted into environmentalism. It's been highjacked by political and social activists who are using environmental rhetoric to cloak agendas that have more to do with anti-corporate and class warfare than they do with ecology or saving the environment.


That is the Greens. The mask of environ­mental concern has been stripped away. Nothing could demonstrate that more clearly, in a symbolic fashion, than this motion we are debating today to install a Greens senator with no credentials as the chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee of this Senate in place of a senator of experience who is respected by both sides.


The Greens will use that bully pulpit to prosecute a radical agenda, inconsistent with the values of not only the coalition side of the chamber but of most on the Labor side as well. The Australian Labor Party, for its many faults, has always been a party committed to democratic values. But the Greens are not committed to democratic values. They are a party of zealots. They are a party of cold-eyed fanatics. They are a party that embodies the authoritarian cast of mind. Nowhere can that be seen more clearly than in the fact that, with insouciance and glee, they are prepared to foist on the Australian people a vast new tax that both sides of politics promised at the election last year that they would not introduce.


The Australian Labor Party has embraced its most lethal political enemy. It has disregarded the advice that an appeaser is a person who keeps feeding the crocodile in the hope that he will be the last to be eaten. As I said before, by appeasing the Greens—by embracing them, by allowing the govern­ment's agenda to be dictated by the first truly authoritarian party we have seen represented in the Australian parliament—the Australian Labor Party have signed their own death warrant. They have ceded the ground of the so-called progressive left to their most lethal enemy, who are determined to displace them. Every time the Australian Labor Party goes along with a power play like this and rolls over for the Greens—meekly, timidly, reluctantly but inevitably—they execute, once again, that political death warrant.


So I will close the debate for the opposition by saying that the Senate is being presumed upon this afternoon by a travesty of a resolution, in furtherance of a power play of which, superficially, Senator Gary Humphries is the victim and the proper process of the Senate is the victim. But the true victim of the Greens is the Australian Labor Party and the political tradition it represents. In years to come, when historians write the history of these times and chart the decline of the Australian Labor Party—as, in decades to come, they will—they will locate this parliament and, in particular, the Labor-Greens alliance as the point at which that remorseless decline began.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:57):  In Australia we say we are from the lucky country, and in most instances this rings true. However, it is important that we remember that there are many people in Australia who are far less fortunate and who are struggling to cope with a range of pressures. It is often our young people who struggle the most, particularly those who have been caught up in the criminal justice system. The reality is that, if we do not coordinate effective early therapeutic interventions to support young people to develop the skills to successfully navigate through life, their offending behaviour will become worse and they will not be able to achieve their full potential and participate fully in the community.


Recently I had the opportunity to visit some services and initiatives in my home state of Tasmania that have been set up to assist young people at risk and support those who were already caught up in the criminal justice system. Today I want to discuss those various initiatives and acknowledge and support those who work to inspire and build better futures for these young people. To put this discussion in context, it is also important to give you a snapshot of the demographics in Tasmania. In my home state we have a particularly low rate of participation and retention in post year 10 education and training. Many young people disengage from education or training in the early years of high school, and we have high rates of teenage pregnancies and juvenile offending.


During 2008-09 approximately two-thirds of Tasmanian offenders were less than 30 years of age and one-third were aged between 10 and 19 years. The data from that same period shows that Tasmania has the second-highest youth offender rate in Australia, behind the Northern Territory. The figures show that 1,255 young people were known to youth justice services in 2009-10, and of these 146 were remanded in custody and/or sentenced to detention. The data also reveal that 63 per cent of young people known to youth justice on 30 September 2009 had been previously notified to child protection. In addition, a high proportion of young offenders have psychiatric difficulties and problems associated with drug and alcohol abuse. Some of these young people have been victims of crime themselves and for many of them family and community ties have been fractured. Thankfully, in Tasmania and other jurisdictions we are moving towards a youth justice system that promotes early intervention and therapeutic interventions. The Tasmanian state govern­ment has just concluded an overview of the Youth Justice Act 1997. As a result of extensive consultation, feedback and input from lawyers, police, young people themselves and the broader community, the new Youth Justice Bill 2011 is expected to be debated in the state parliament next year.


There is growing recognition and acceptance that the legal system can have a therapeutic effect on an offender without compromising the core system and rule of law. The review of the Youth Justice Act has helped build a body of evidence in support of therapeutic approaches and the holistic approach to dealing with offenders. We owe it to our young people to do what we can to ensure that detention is a last resort and to address complex underlying problems to their offending behaviour as early as possible. Developing a more appropriate legislative framework will ensure that the justice system is the point of convergence for engaging service providers to address the variety of problems that a young person can have. The collaborative court framework will embed a comprehensive problem-solving approach in the courts and will also assist in a more comprehensive assessment of risk and treatment needs. Tasmania's agenda for children and young people will also help embed the collaborative framework and foster a multi-agency and multidepartmental approach in dealing with young people.


As well as focusing on reforms to the youth justice system, it is critical that we continue to support and acknowledge the work done by organisations and individuals in the community. Recently, the Minister for Justice and Minister for Home Affairs, Brendan O'Connor, and I visited the Whitelion service in Hobart. Minister O'Connor and I were fortunate enough to spend some time with the young people at Whitelion, who cooked morning tea. As the minister and I learnt how to improve our pancake-making skills, I was inspired by Whitelion volunteers and the young people who we met that morning.


Whitelion is a not-for-profit organisation which operates in Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia that aims to reconnect disadvantaged young people with the community so they are living positive and meaningful lives. Whitelion's core agenda is to give young people 'the courage to grow', and began working with young people in Tasmania in 2002. Since 2002, the organisa­tion has worked with young people across Tasmania, providing specialist youth services to give young people the opportunity to build positive lives for themselves through role modelling, mentoring and employment. Whitelion focuses on supporting young people as they transition back into the community from out-of-home care and the youth justice system. The programs and services offered help young people develop positive and beneficial relationships with role models and their peers. The organisation also provides opportunities to gain social skills, empowering young people and supporting them to set and pursue a positive pathway. 


In Tasmania, Whitelion has partnered with a number of community and corporate groups and is sponsored in part by Southern Cross Media. The organisation has also secured the support and time of local politicians and community leaders, with Premier Lara Giddings launching the organisation's 50 Jobs in 50 Days campaign. Last week, Whitelion Tasmania organised for well-known footy legend Dermott Brereton from Hawthorn—of course, the best club in the AFL—to spend some time with the young people inside Tasmania's Ashley Youth Detention Centre. Whilst he spent quite a lot of time kicking the football around, Brereton's aim was to help these young people realise the key to overcoming adversity and the challenges ahead was to not give up on themselves. 


It is through positive mentoring and activities aimed at building skills and confidence that these organisations are able to empower our young people to re-engage. As an example, I want to take a moment to share a story with you about John and Bobby who were linked up through a mentoring program coordinated by Whitelion. John, a semi-retired businessman, felt that he had more to contribute to his local community when he signed up with Whitelion's mentoring program. He was matched with a 14-year-old boy, Bobby, in August 2010. Bobby and John catch up on a fortnightly basis, but at times they would be in touch more frequently. Their mentoring activities include fishing, bike riding, visiting tip shops, tinkering on second-hand motors and generally just having fun. 


Bobby is under the care of the state. He has been diagnosed with ADHD and he has disengaged at school. Bobby started offending before he participated with the Whitelion mentoring program. Bobby's grandmother who is also Bobby's guardian says that Bobby has difficulty trusting others, but she could not speak more highly of John and the influence that he has had with Bobby. After spending time together, John says that he has noticed a significant change. John now describes Bobby as a thoughtful, polite and appreciative young man with a great sense of humour. John feels Bobby is proud of their mentoring relationship and that Bobby tries his best to be cooperative.


When you ask Bobby what he thinks about the mentoring program he tells you that it has been helpful. He says: 'John is very supportive in my various projects. He is a very encouraging person and I enjoy having him around when I am working on my projects.' When asked what he thinks about the program, John says that he feels lucky that his and Bobby's personalities click. He says that there have been great rewards for both parties in the mentoring relationship and that he also feels good after seeing Bobby. John, who is very humble about his achievements, feels that one can still have selfish pursuits—making money, running races—and still find time to volunteer with groups such as Whitelion. John's wife is proud of his involvement with Whitelion, and she does not mind him not being around her as long as she knows where he is. Since commencing the mentoring program with Whitelion, Bobby has re-engaged with school and has not reoffended. That small snapshot helps to illustrate both the difference the program makes to young people, but also those individuals who give up their time to volunteer. 


In addition to Whitelion there are a myriad of other great programs operating to make a real and enduring difference in the lives of young people. To provide you with a further example, last week the Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness, Senator Mark Arbib, and I participated in a street soccer match in Moonah in Hobart.




Senator Mason:
  How did you go?




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  I unfortunately let a lot of goals in. The Big Issue community street soccer program is a national initiative that coordinates weekly football training for homeless, marginalised and disadvantaged people across Australia. The program, supported by corporate partners and the federal government, has provided $4.4 million in funding for the initiative since 2007. Street soccer aims to use the power of sport to promote social inclusion and personal change for homeless, marginalised and disadvantaged people. Ultimately, the program works to create healthier and more engaged communities. The weekly soccer sessions are an opportunity for the participants to get fit, make new friends and seek support and advice in a non-threatening and informal environment. The program is structured so that dedicated support staff work closely with players, linking them to services that address homelessness, substance abuse, family breakdown, grief and loss and mental illness.


In Hobart, street soccer has been operating since February 2010 and the initiative continues to grow. Every Tuesday from 1.30 to 3.30 pm players come together for training and a match either at the Eady Street rugby oval or inside at the Moonah Sports Centre. The minister and I were fortunate enough to spend some time with the players both on and off the field and it was great to take the opportunity to introduce Cindy Chatters to Minister Arbib. Cindy Chatters joined the Hobart street soccer program a few months after it began in 2010. Her street soccer journey began after acquaintances asked her for directions to the program's training ground in Hobart. After showing them where the session was, she reluctantly joined in and has never looked back. In fact, Cindy Chatters was the only woman and only Tasmanian selected to represent Australia in the Homeless World Cup held in Paris in August this year. Cindy really is a remarkable and resilient woman who has certainly endured her share of challenges. Through the street soccer program, however, it has been fantastic to watch her confidence grow and to see her move from strength to strength on and off the field. Cindy is a passionate advocate of the program and is working hard in the local community and beyond to encourage others, particularly women, to get involved in the program. 


It was great to visit the street soccer training and forge new relationships with the members of the team, and I look forward to returning for another training session and perhaps, Senator Mason, even improving my goalkeeping skills. The street soccer program offers far more than a two-hour training match. It is an opportunity for males and females over the age of 16 from all backgrounds to come together and focus solely on something other than their own personal circumstances. Some of the players who attended the session were on sport and recreation release from Risdon Prison, some were recently arrived refugees, others were homeless or at risk of homelessness and a few just needed somewhere to belong. It is wonderful to watch people from all different backgrounds come together in the name of sport and to have fun. The street soccer program really is making a difference in my community and in 25 communities across Australia. The dedication of the coaches and of The Big Issue in pulling the program together is truly admirable and I want to acknowledge and thank them for their contributions and ongoing efforts.


I genuinely look forward to continuing to work with groups like Whitelion and with programs like street soccer to build more inclusive and resilient communities. Whilst there are a number of groups and initiatives operating around Australia to support disengaged youth, it is important that we continue to support these organisations and programs to ensure that every young person is given the greatest possible opportunity to succeed in life.

 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (15:04):  I seek leave to have incorporated into Hansard additional information in answer to a question asked of me yesterday by Senator Di Natale.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—



AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE INVOLVEMENT WITH INDONESIA NATIONAL POLICE


1. Australia and Indonesia have had a Memorandum of Understanding regarding transnational crime in place since June 2002 and, as a result of the first Bali bombings, signed a joint investigations agreement in relation to that case on 18 October 2002. The AFP provides capacity building assistance in support of the Indonesian National Police (INP), including Detachment 88. The capacity building initiatives delivered by the AFP in Indonesia include the provision of training to both INP and Detachment 88 officers, provided through the joint Australian-Indonesian, Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation (JCLEC). The involvement of the AFP in training programs at JCLEC allows the AFP to impress on regional counterparts some of the AFP values such as human rights and ethics in policing. Importantly the principles of human rights are embedded into all JCLEC programs.


 The APP is aware of allegations of human rights abuses by Detachment 88. The AFP engagement with Detachment 88 is through the INP Executive in Jakarta.


2. The AFP is aware of media reporting in The Age on 1 November 2011; however the AFP has no mandate to investigate the conduct of foreign police within another country. Any investigation into the conduct of INP officers and their intervention in the Freeport Mine industrial action is a matter for the Indonesian authorities.


The AFP will continue to provide capacity building assistance to the INP and Detachment 88 in support of mutual law enforcement and security objectives.

Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to a question without notice asked by Senator Boswell today relating to a proposed carbon tax.


The thing that really concerns me about this carbon tax more than anything else is its effect on industry, employment and our international competitiveness. These are major issues that need to be aired in the Senate. In its submission on the clean energy future legislation the Minerals Council of Australia noted that the jobs and competitiveness program in this piece of legislation is vastly inferior to competitiveness safeguards contained in other schemes, specifically the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. That is a matter of real concern. The Minerals Council went on to say that even the well-known and flawed Treasury modelling concedes that real wages and productivity in Australia will grow much more slowly with the level of carbon pricing proposed under this legislation. Treasury modelling also reveals that Australia's economy will be $1 trillion—that is, one thousand billion dollars—smaller than it might otherwise have been by 2050 as a result of this carbon pricing legislation. And we have to ask ourselves: if we are going to inflict such pain and injury on our economy, how effective will the carbon pricing be in reducing world carbon levels? Because part of the rationale for this legislation seems to be that we are on a crusade, with our 1.4 per cent of carbon emissions, to save the world from the horrors of an increased carbon level. The Gillard government claims the carbon pricing scheme will save 160 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2020. In 2020, on Treasury's baseline estimates, China alone will be producing 49 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent every day. In other words, in 2021 China will replace Australia's projected emission reductions—that is, 57 million tonnes of carbon dioxide—in just over one day! So in one day, Chinese emissions will replace the whole year's savings in Australia, and Australia's projected emissions savings, including purchases of international permits, in less than four days. I think that set of figures, more than anything else, just shows what a pointless exercise this carbon tax is in terms of the higher ideal which the legislation is supposed to be addressing—that is, our role in reducing world carbon. It is not going to make any difference whatsoever.


It is very interesting also that, in terms of employment, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry have given a pointed assessment of the proposed carbon tax. The CCIWA had a checklist on the carbon tax, of I think 11 points, and it notes that the carbon tax failed to meet the core principles on more than half of those objectives. So, again, the carbon tax is proving to be an illusion in terms of the objectives it is supposed to meet. It is really, as I said yesterday, a fraudulent tax—and so it is proving to be.


The Australian Trade and Industry Alliance claimed manufacturers would be worse off than their European counterparts under the proposed emissions trading scheme—and, in fact, they had research commissioned which shows that the carbon tax will cost 950,000 jobs in Australian companies under this regime. We can hardly be proud of the effects and impacts of this program on the Australian economy. As we have said during the week, this tax is a fraud. This Senate should not be proceeding with it; it should not go ahead. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:10):  We on this side of the parliament, we in the Labor government, believe that climate change is real. We believe it is caused by carbon pollution and it is harmful to our environment and the economy. That is why we are taking action on climate change. We are committed to taking action on climate change, which is in stark contrast, as we heard just a moment ago, to the position taken by those opposite. Those opposite, or some of them, used to believe in climate change; they used to have a policy that supported putting a price on carbon through an emissions trading scheme. But that position was thrown out when Mr Abbott took over as Leader of the Opposition, as Leader of the Liberal Party. Mr Abbott becoming the elected leader of the Liberal Party signalled that the sceptics had taken over. In taking over, the climate sceptics led by Mr Abbott dumped their support for action on climate change through the government's proposed emissions trading scheme. And whilst the Liberal Party were backing away from action on climate change, nothing could be further from the position taken on this side of the chamber by the Labor government, because we have remained steadfast in our commitment in taking action on climate change.


The time for inaction has passed. The time for delay is over. The time to take action is now. And that is what the Gillard Labor government is doing. We have a plan to tackle climate change by placing a price on carbon. It is imperative for the future of our economy and of our environment that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions and begin to transition our economy to a clean energy future. We know that greenhouse gas emissions are causing the world's climate to change. Climate scientists have been telling us this for years. They have been telling us that we need to change our behaviour to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.


We know that the rest of the world is acting, and to claim otherwise is just disingenuous. Australia generates more carbon pollution per capita than any other developed country, including the United States. We also produce significantly more pollution per person than India and China. Our level of carbon pollution is increasing at a rapid rate. Without taking action it is expected that our carbon pollution will grow by almost two per cent to 2020. We cannot afford to delay action on climate change any longer. We must take action to cut our greenhouse gas emissions, and that is exactly what the Gillard Labor government is doing.


The price on carbon means that Australia's 500-biggest polluting companies will be charged for the pollution they produce. In turn, this will help drive investment in clean energy technologies. The carbon price is not a tax on ordinary Australians, unlike of course the policy of those opposite. It is not a tax on ordinary Australians, as those opposite would have you believe; it is a tax paid by Australia's biggest polluters. All the money raised from the carbon price will be used to support households, jobs and to invest in clean energy and in climate change programs. To assist households with price impacts the government is introducing a comprehensive assistance package, and this will comprise two rounds of increases in pensions, allowances and benefits. There will also be tax cuts, and they will be targeted at those who most need them. This means Labor will ensure pensioners, low- and middle-income earners and families are assisted. Under our assistance package, nine out of ten households will receive assistance through a combination of tax cuts and increased payments. Almost six million Australian households will receive tax cuts for increases in payments that fully cover the average price impacts of the carbon price. We also know that petrol forms a big part of the household budget, so we have ensured that there will be no carbon price on any fuels, including petrol, diesel and LPG for passenger motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles. Whilst we are providing household assistance to families through our carbon price plan, families will be worse off under Mr Abbott's plan of direct action. (Time expired)

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:15):  I also rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Wong in question time. I concur with Senator Carol Brown that climate change is indeed real. We can all go along with that. The question that we raise and continue to have unanswered—in fact, Senator Wong is like the Artful Dodger when it comes to answering this question—is whether the Gillard Labor government will release the modelling for the carbon tax. The answer is, 'We have released an unprecedented amount of information to do with it.' It is not a big ask. It is only, as outlined by the Labor Party, the single biggest tax reform that this country has ever undertaken, and we are not getting any scrutiny of it at all. There are independent people out there in the Australian business society who would like to have it scrutinised. 


In Senate estimates we heard questions asked about when the model is going to be released. Again, the answer came back, 'When we think it might be fit to be released.' Is this another, 'Well, we will get to it soon'? Is it going to come before the next election? I do not know. All we hear from Senator Wong is, 'There is an enormous amount of information out there in the public domain.' What we do not need is another talkfest with voluminous amounts of information that do not accurately represent the financial modelling on which this government has based, punted and bet the economic future of this country's prosperity. The Productivity Commission has the model, but it is not in the Australian public domain. We want some transparency from the government on this one. We would like the people from Bloomberg to have it. They have got a couple of hundred of economists over there who might want to have a look at it and make some public comments. Why won't we give it to them? Instead, we are faced with a model that, on the government's own admission, has a decline in GDP in real terms from 2020 to 2050. What it is, I predict, is churn. It is just another bureaucracy churning it out, taking money from those who have it and generate it, putting it through a mill and distributing it as they see fit. 


Senator Wong continues to avoid the question about whether she will give the opposition the opportunity to rightly scrutinise it under that good and solid Westminster system of government that keeps everyone accountable. 




Senator Boswell:
  What have they got to hide?




Senator EDWARDS:
  Senator Boswell asked, 'What have they got to hide?' I do not know. I suspect it is because, since 2007, electricity prices across Australia have increased by an average of 51 per cent; gas prices have increased by an average of 30 per cent; water and sewerage rates have increased by an average of 46 per cent; health costs, hospital costs, dental costs and pharmaceutical costs have increased by an average of 20 per cent; education costs—school fees—have increased by an average of 24 per cent; and rent has increased by 20 per cent. The cost of living is just going up and up and up—and you want to impose from 1 July next year another impost on business which they cannot pass on. It will erode the profitability of businesses through increased electricity prices, and all that lays before them is fewer job opportunities for people in manufacturing. 


Just out today, we have got the Australian Food and Grocery Council saying that, amid the range of ominous trends and forecasts, the industry is at a crossroads. Its publication shows that the industry is facing a perfect storm of costs and regulatory pressures. How much more of a burden are you going to put on business when the carbon tax comes out? There will be more forms to fill in. In its Industry at a crossroads publication it is saying there could be a loss of up to 130,000 jobs in manufacturing and a further 6,000 jobs in associated sectors like agriculture by 2020. There could also be a slump in operating profits of 4.4 per cent and 11.6 per cent, purely because of the introduction of the government's economic— (Time expired)

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:20):  As I move around doing my duties as a senator throughout South Australia, going to various country regional centres and attending street corner meetings, we always encourage the voter—or the attendees at those meetings—to engage in the carbon tax debate. We need to raise it in certain areas. Far from being an issue at the forefront of a lot of voters' minds, they are not frightened and they are not buying the scare campaign of the opposition. There is a growing body of people who want to leave a better Australia for their children and grandchildren. They understand that coal fired electricity power stations are not the cleanest way into our future. In my own state of South Australia, we are leading the way in clean energy options. There is, as I say, a continual fear campaign. Mr Abbott says no to everything. He fails to engage in any legitimate debate on clean energy options and simply tries to scare the electorate through a well-coordinated, well-repeated, incessant fear campaign about destroying jobs. The Treasury modelling shows that the economy will still grow and that average incomes will continue to grow and that carbon pollution will fall, which I suppose is the achievable outcome we are seeking for our Australian environment. We will see investment of about $100 billion in renewable energy and hopefully South Australia will continue to lead the way in that renewable energy. Under former Premier Mike Rann's leadership we have led the way. We have certainly led the way in renewable energy with wind farms, geothermal and the like. These things have really been at the heart of our leadership in South Australia, where we produce something like 50 per cent of the renewable energy of our great nation.


Senator Boswell is looking for a model in which he can put his economic data, a tame economic professional to put his details in and produce some trillions of dollars worth of results. These things are simply not going to happen. We are going to rely on the Treasury modelling. They proved through the GST that they could do it and they have proved that they will continue to do it.




Senator Boyce:
  The modelling is a secret.




Senator GALLACHER:
  The modelling is not a secret. We are simply going to rely on the proven experts in Treasury who did the modelling for the GST and who will do the modelling for the carbon tax. The modelling shows that the economy will continue to grow strongly. It shows that average incomes will continue to grow strongly. It shows that jobs will continue to grow strongly; in fact 1.6 million additional jobs by 2020. And it certainly shows that the carbon pollution will fall, and all Australians will ultimately reward the party that delivers this. It is in the interests of our children and our children's children that we take this action. If you are looking for support in the community about climate change, look at the solar schemes that are oversubscribed. Look at the people who have gone out and put their hard-earned cash into those solar panels to produce their own renewable energy source. Australians do believe in this. They put their own hard-earned cash on the table. They have gone out, paid up to $10,000 and whacked panels on their roof. They are producing green, renewable energy and they are very proud of that. Most of the schemes have been oversubscribed. Yet the other mob tell us that people do not want a bar of renewable energy, they do not want to make the environment cleaner and greener, they want to continue down an old-fashioned path. Well, time is up. We have really got to look to the future for our children and our grandchildren. The community is onside, despite the scaremongering of the opposition. Quite frankly, the opposition used to be onside under their former leadership. So it is without any shadow of doubt that we can continue on this historic path. (Time expired)

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (15:25):  I have to congratulate Senator Boswell on the question that he put today, which is the topic of this debate. His question goes right to the heart of trust in this government. He asked why, given that the Productivity Commission can release all modelling related to COAG reform, the government cannot release all the modelling related to their clean energy legislation. If it were not so frightening, it would be funny that part of Senator Wong's answer was, 'I am unclear how that is relevant.' She is very unclear about how it is relevant that one part of government can clearly and transparently release the economic modelling they use but this government cannot release all of the economic modelling on the most important piece of legislation that they have put before this house. The Prime Minister is quite right to call it historic. It is historic but it is a very sad day in Australia's history.


The Prime Minister promised us there would not be a carbon tax under a government she leads. We now have modelling where it is okay if they give us the bits and pieces that they feel like giving us but do not give out the full modelling so that it can be tested by the economic sector of Australia. How typical of this government. Of course, people do not believe that the government has given us the bits of the modelling data relevant to the new legislation; they believe, because of the government's history, that the parts of the modelling that are being given out are the bits that are convenient for this government. They do not trust them. Senator Boswell brought that point out very well and Senator Wong's response was disappointing but typical of the dishonest way that this government behaves.


I was somewhat amused by Senator Gallacher's comments regarding solar energy. Yes, Australians have put in large amounts of solar panels and solar hot water and solar heating devices. But he seems to have not noticed that in a number of instances those people have been defrauded by systems that were accredited by this Labor government. Why would we be surprised that there had been a failure in implementation of an energy-saving system by this government? He appears also not to be aware that in fact throughout Australia and most of the world the electricity grids are not capable of taking as much solar power as people generate. In most cases, and I am referring particularly now to South-East Queensland, the grids can only cope with 30 per cent of the grid power being energy that is put back into the system from solar energy. This means that, if you live in a street with no solar power, you are fine: your power can go back into the grid and you can get paid the feed-in tariff for doing that. If, however, you go ahead and put in solar power in a street where 30 per cent of the houses already have solar power, you will not be able to feed your solar power into the grid; you will not get the feed-in tariff. 


Right now in South-East Queensland, it is taking up to 16 weeks for people to be connected up, from the time that their solar power systems go in until the time that they actually get paid for feeding the power into the grid. Part of the reason this is happening is that the South-East Queensland electrical authorities are desperately trying to pedal backwards so that they do not have to make the point that the Queensland Labor government, along with many other state governments and many other governments internationally, have neglected to point out to people who bought solar power units that there was a chance that they would not be able to get the feed-in tariff. It is another part of the nontransparency of this government. (Time expired)

As if that were not enough, what the Senate is debating in this matter of public importance debate today is the greatest policy failure facing the Labor government and that is the policy failure in relation to border protection. Who can forget the words of the now Prime Minister of Australia, on execution day in 2009, when they politically executed the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd. This was the reason that was given by the now Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, for Mr Rudd's execution:


I accept that the government has lost track. We will get back on track. I have taken control for precisely that purpose.


Not only that, but a few days later the now Prime Minister asked the Australian people not to judge her on how she became Prime Minister. She said:


The only thing I could say to Australians is to judge me on how I do the job.


Well, when Ms Gillard uttered those words she clearly was not referring to the job that the Labor government has done in relation to protecting Australia's borders. Far from breaking the people smugglers' model, which is the rhetoric of the Labor Party, the policies the Labor government have in place are seeing the people-smuggling business absolutely booming. We only have to go back to yesterday. What did we have? The arrival of yet another boat under this Labor government's watch. Ninety-four people were found and have been taken to Christmas Island.


In relation to the arrival of yet another boat the question the Australian people have to ask themselves is this: how much is the government's failure in relation to protecting Australia's borders going to cost us as taxpayers? After all, it may surprise the current government to know that it is the Australian taxpayer who ultimately pays the greatest price in relation to their failed border protection policies. The bad news for the mums and dads of Australia is that it is potentially going to cost them billions of dollars, and it is billions of dollars that have not been accounted for in the 2011-12 budget.


It is bad enough that the failure of the Labor Party in this important policy area has cost the Australian taxpayer in excess of $3 billion to date. Those costs will keep on rising. The current 2011-12 budget has a figure of around $1.3 billion to be spent in this important portfolio area. The only problem with that is this: the figure was based on just 750 boat arrivals. How the Labor Party ever got to that figure is beyond me, because, since 2008, when the Labor Party rolled back the Howard government's strong border protection policies, just under 13,000 people have reached our shores. So how they ever thought they were going to get that down to 750 in one year is beyond the comprehension of most people. But did we ever believe it? The answer is, no, we did not, and we have already been proved right. We are only into the fourth month of this financial year and already the budget in relation to this particular portfolio area has quite literally been blown out of the water.


Why do I say that? Well, if you budget for 750 arrivals and as at 2 November over 1,340 have arrived, and we still have three-quarters of this financial year to get through, there is clearly a cost implication. That cost implication does not worry the Labor Party because they think Australian taxpayers money is like Monopoly money. It is going to cost the mums and dads of Australia, who are already struggling under the rising cost of living pressure, who are going to struggle to pay their electricity bills once the carbon tax goes through and who are going to struggle to pay their gas bills once the carbon tax goes through. And as for discretionary income, there will not be any once the carbon tax goes through. In addition to that they are the ones who will ultimately pay for the absolute abject failure in this important policy area.


One thing the government has not done to date, and it is one thing the government should do, is come clean with the Australian people. The government should bring down a mini budget in relation to this portfolio area. Come clean with the Australian people. Be up front with them and let them know just how much more of their money is going to be spent on cleaning up Labor's border protection mess.


What is so unfortunate about the debate we are having today is that it is a debate that did not have to happen. We all know the reason for that. When the Labor Party assumed office in 2007 they inherited a solution. They inherited the Howard government's policies, which had reduced the boats coming to Australia to zero. But was that good enough for the Australian Labor Party? Good God no! How much lower can we get than zero? They do not know, but they rolled back those policies and what did we see the minute they rolled them back? The people smugglers knew that under the Australian Labor Party they were back in business. Under the former Howard govern­ment we sent a strong consistent message to people smugglers: Australia is closed for business. As at August 2008 that message went out the door and the doors to Australia were opened. Less than $100 million a year was spent by the Howard government in this important portfolio area. Under the current government the Australian taxpayers, the mums and dads who work hard, are paying in excess of $1 billion a year. The crime is that it never needed to happen.


What is the Labor Party's solution? Is it to adopt the Howard government's proven policies? No, they could not do that because they could not swallow their pride and do it, even though they know it will work. What did they put up? The Malaysia solution, or the now failed Malaysia solution, which we still know is the preferred option of Minister Bowen. But this is the bad news for Minister Bowen: even if the parliament were to pass the Malaysia solution, the deal is over before it has started. The deal was only good for the first 800 boat arrivals. How many have arrived since the signing of the Malaysian deal? We have had 1,070 people and the deal was only good for 800 people. So, even if the parliament decided tomorrow to pass the Malaysian solution, the deal is over before it has even commenced, and the ALP, the government, are actually stuck with 270 people who are going to be processed onshore in any event. That is a catastrophic policy failure if I have ever seen one. Apart from the fact that in relation to the Malaysian solution—this is how good the Australian government are at negotiating deals—they  negotiated into the deal clause 16, which stated 'this agreement is merely a statement of the political intentions of the parties'. And then they went a little bit further. They felt, 'Well, that's not a good enough negotiation; let's negotiate Malaysia out of this deal even further', so they negotiated into the agreement the following words: 'This agreement is not legally binding on the parties.' That is the solution that the Labor Party held up to the Australian people.


If the Labor Party truly want offshore processing, as they continue to tell us they do—Minister Bowen was on television only this morning, yet again committing the Labor Party to offshore processing—they could actually have it tomorrow. They could have it tomorrow if they only agreed to one amendment—and that amendment is actually the policy that the Labor Party took to the previous election: that a country has to be a signatory to the UNHCR treaty. That is the promise that the Gillard government made prior to the election. Our small amendment will actually help the Labor Party keep their promise to the Australian people. But in this area this government's policy is a catastrophic failure. They should swallow their pride and adopt the former Howard government policy— (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (16:38):  Well, that really was a most remarkable contribution by Senator Cash. I will summarise very briefly her contribution. She referred to the 'greatest policy failure of the current government', 'another boat arrived yesterday' and 'what will be the cost to taxpayers?' She referred to budget measures, a blow-out of portfolio costs to the tune of $1 billion and referred to it as 'Monopoly money' et cetera. Not once did she choose to address the motion before the chair—that is, 'The failure of the current government to maintain effective and humane border protection policies in order to deny people smugglers the product that they sell.' Let us  think about that motion, because I do want to address it.


We currently face a terrible set of events. One really should start at the outset by indicating sympathy for those people who drowned yesterday to their parents and to their loved ones. It was a terrible set of events that we faced yesterday morning. It was terrible on two levels. Firstly, there were the deaths of the six young people in Indonesian waters—and I am advised there are another 20 people still missing. But, perhaps more terrible, when we pass the instant events of yesterday, is the continuing set of events year in, year out, which inevitably, as sure as God made little apples, will lead to further death and harm in this debate. For almost 10 years, without interruption, people have been drowning at sea as they seek entry into Australia. So one may squarely ask the question: why has that continued for up to 10 years? Surely it is not beyond the wit of human kind that after one, two or three years one could devise a solution that is acceptable and put it into practice.


We know in this country that we have had longstanding bipartisan immigration policy relating to entry into this country since the immediate post-war years—arguably the best in the world: low-cost, flexible, variable, changing according to the needs of those who want to come into this country and those who seek additional labour. So, family reunion might change to a higher concentration, for example, on skilled migration or labour market demands in Queensland and Western Australia. But every three, four or five years, in between governments and through governments, immigration policy in this area changes according to the needs of people and markets. So, we have had for many years an orderly, effective and lawful immigration policy.


In that context, why do people choose to put themselves at risk? As we saw from the events of yesterday and last Christmas, many people drown at sea. The answer, I suggest, is simple, plain and clear. On this issue, advice to government from those who have authority and experience over many, many years in this discussion and this debate, is very direct. That advice to government is: 'We need a genuinely effective deterrent to prevent asylum seekers taking the dangerous boat journey to Australia.' There are three key words in that phrase: 'genuine', 'effective' and 'deterrent'. 'Genuine' means controlled, managed and lawful; 'effective' means a policy that works and that is understood in this country and the wider region; and 'deterrent' means preventing people taking the risk of drowning. That is what we have needed for 10 years, that is what we needed yesterday and that is what we need now. But we do not have such a policy, so people jump on boats, like last Christmas, at the peak of the season, and they jumped on boats yesterday, as the season is about to peak this year, and the boat overturned. Twenty are missing and six are dead—one a child—yet we do not have a policy after 10 years.


This government has tried for the last three years to get a policy. Why don't we have one? Because the opposition, those people over there in this place, refuse to respect the will of the elected government and let the government of the day, whoever the government of the day is, give authority to executive decisions of that government. They work to prevent the government of the day, the executive of the day, giving effect to its lawful policy, to implement its policy, through the House of Representatives. They refuse to allow the government to implement the Malaysian transfer system.


Now, why do they choose to do that? Why do they say, 'It's better that boats fall apart at sea; that 20 people are missing; that six people drown; that one child will never see adulthood'? Why is that a better position that the mob over there choose to adopt and implement? The reasons are base political reasons. For reasons best known to themselves, they combined with the Greens down there and the net result is what? The net result is this: people die, because people are seeking entry into this country so they can have a better life. So this opposition flouts long-standing convention in a very difficult and very delicate area of public policy for its own base purpose. The results of that continuing practice in the house are twofold: the convention is flouted for political gain and people—children, women—die unnecessarily.


This could be fixed tomorrow. It requires a degree of humility, it requires a degree of modesty, it requires a degree of common sense and it requires the same application to bipartisan policy on entry into Australia that both political parties have applied for many years since the post-war years. The answer is this: that the government of the day, through the executive of the day, is permitted in the House of Representatives to get its will carried out through necessary amendments to legislation. What happens there? It requires a simple decision—as has been outlined repeatedly—to be made by the Leader of the Opposition to have a private discussion with the Prime Minister and say: 'The opposition may not agree with your approach. It may do different things should it come to government sometime in the future. It thinks the approach is incorrect and it might not work. But you are the government and we will consent to you governing. We will support your amendments in the House, as have successive leaders of the Labor Party for many, many years in opposition.' 


When the coalition government of the day sought to amend acts of parliament to give effect to policy change in the area of lawful immigration, asylum seekers or illegal immigration, the then Leader of the Opposition—whether it was Mr Beazley, Mr Crean or whoever—gave the support of his party in those delicate negotiations. The current Leader of the Opposition, instead of making ongoing, cheap points in the other place, must show maturity when he approaches the government and let it make decisions. If Mr Abbott does not like it, he has the right to put in a caveat that if he should come to power and have the necessary support of the House of Representatives then he would seek, through customary mechanisms, to change the position and implement the policy or the laws that he as leader of the government thinks is appropriate at that time. I am sure I can say without fear of contradiction that if we were in opposition we would so indicate support for such a decision by them. But that is not the case.


So let us address the final point that Senator Cash raised about Nauru. She said that notwithstanding the issues about budgets, blowouts and costs, we should go back to the solution of the Howard government, eat a bit of humble pie and implement what worked then, some four, five or six years ago. That is okay, but you really do have to come into the real world—2011—and face the current set of facts that apply about Nauru. Nauru does not break the people-smuggling trade, as Senator Cash and the opposition well know. It does not provide the disincentive to stop people taking that dangerous boat journey down to Australia. Go back to the advice that the government had—that it needed to have a genuine, effective and humane policy. It needed one policy that acted as a deterrent, and we know for a fact— (Time expired)

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2011-11-02,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (16:48):  I rise today to add my contribution to this discussion. I do so reluctantly because this is a debate that has become embarrassing. This is a debate that has become unsightly, low and shameful, degrading our reputation and our Australian spirit of compassion and the values of a fair go. Instead of beating up on some of the world's most vulnerable people and appealing to the lowest of the lows, we should be appealing to our better angels. Once upon a time we did do this in this place. Once upon a time we had political leadership in this country that showed that compassion was a strength, that showed that offering people a helping hand was not just the right thing to do but was something to be proud of. There was support from all sides of the chamber to do this. Appealing to our better angels is something that all political leaders and participants in this place should be considering.


I will put some facts on the table. Since the end of World War II Australia has resettled almost 700,000 refugees. They have made an amazing, wonderful and important contribution to our country. Currently in Australia, asylum seekers make up only two per cent of Australia's entire annual migration intake. Last year, the 8,250 people who claimed asylum in Australia only amounted to 1.04 per cent of the global population of asylum seekers. Most asylum seekers who arrive in Australia arrive by plane, yet the majority of them are not found to be in genuine need of protection. Those who arrive by boat do not even make up a quarter of those who arrive by plane. Yet we have this toxic, debilitating, nasty, shameful debate about individuals who are so desperate for safety, protection and freedom for their families that they board a leaky boat. Those who lost their lives on the high seas in the last day or two did not take the decision to board that boat lightly. Asylum seekers who are coming to Australia asking for help are fleeing from countries of war. They are coming from places where they have been persecuted and tortured, and they are desperate for protection. And on that journey for safety coming through countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, countries that are not signatories to the refugee convention, that will not afford them genuine protection on their journey, they are faced with very little choice but to engage the operations of people smugglers.


There is much to do in the space of dealing with refugees and asylum seekers in this country. We need a response that Australia can be proud of, that upholds Australia's international obligations, that is underpinned by our values of a fair go and our Australian spirit of compassion. It means allowing people to resettle in this country with pride, not demonising those who are so desperate the only choice they have is to board a boat, working with our regional neighbours to avoid that perilous journey, offering safe pathways for people and resettling more people directly from the source countries that people are fleeing in the first place. And we have done that before. Under the Fraser government, under the guidance of immigration minister Macphee, we actually went to countries and took people because we wanted to offer them safety. It has been done before. The only difference is that there was political leadership at that time. There was an underpinning of what was right and an absolute strength and core belief not to go into what was wrong just because it perhaps seemed to be politically easy. It is about appealing to our better angels, not allowing ourselves to sink so low that we capitalise on the death of vulnerable people who die at sea.


It is about resettling more people directly, offering safer pathways, ensuring that we work with our regional neighbours, working with the NGOs and the UNHCR so they can assess more people's claims quicker and upholding commitments to resettle people from places like Malaysia and Indonesia. If we were to take 4,000 people from Malaysia per year who had already been assessed, that would make a significant contribution to helping resettle those who are most desperate, those who are not safe while they are in Malaysia. We should be working with Malaysia and Indonesia to encourage them to offer basic protections for these people so that while they are waiting for resettlement they are not continuing to be in fear of their life. We should be arguing that the best way for a regional protection framework to work is for Australia to show leadership and to set the standard. Why would countries in our region agree to treat people any differently than they do when they see Australia wanting to wash our hands of our responsibilities, when they see Australian politicians bickering like naughty schoolchildren in the schoolyard because the canteen has been closed? The behaviour in this place and the other place, the language that is used, the lack of information, the skewed facts, the rewriting of history do not just embarrass us as a parliament, they trash Australia's very proud history of standing up for very vulnerable people, doing what we can to offer a helping hand, ensuring that our spirit of compassion is something that we should be proud of. Why would you expect any other country in the region to act any differently when the leadership shown in this place is dismal?


It is time to put the bickering aside, stop blaming each other, stop trying to prove who can be the toughest and the nastiest. We are actually talking about individuals, people, children, men and women, who are so desperate that they take a journey that they know is risky. But it is because for them that is the only option available for their safety. If we want to avoid people taking this journey we need to set an example, help resettle more people, stop people from boarding boats in the first place and afford proper compassion, leadership and humanity for those who do arrive. Let us go to Afghanistan and find people that actually need to be resettled. Don't wait for them to have to engage a people smuggler. That is what our government has done in the past. It worked then and it could work now.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  You are blinded by the toxic, dirty, grubby, cheap politics of the day. Until you get past that, until both sides of this chamber accept that we need a bit more moral leadership and try to find their moral compass, it will be very difficult to lay down that route and bring people here safely. Bickering in this chamber over who is the toughest and nastiest does not save lives, does not warrant the values of leadership and does nothing to put Australia on a good footing in our region.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:58):  Senator Hanson-Young started her contribution to this debate by saying how embarrassing it was. I have to say, quite frankly, that I find it very embarrassing to listen to those pious words which I know are driven more by politics than actual conviction. I have observed firsthand some of the misleading statements, the grandstanding, the self-promotion that not only Senator Hanson-Young but in fact the entire Greens party have undertaken with respect to this debate. It is alarming that they are so naive or are deliberately misleading the Australian people under this notion of fairness. That is why the Australian people so easily dismiss this pious rhetoric from the Greens. It is an extraordinary claim we have heard here today that the Greens party, via Senator Hanson-Young, is now encouraging the Australian government to go over and identify refugees and bring them back over here. This contribution is somehow suggesting that the Australian government should now get into the people-smuggling racket. It is just a joke. It is beyond belief that this is meant to be a sensible debate, a compassionate debate, a debate about protecting Australia's borders, when we have politicians who are openly advocating going out and grabbing people from other countries and bringing them in here of our own volition. 


We do have a humanitarian refugee policy. It works through the United Nations HCR and it has worked effectively, but it only works effectively when it is combined with a strong border protection policy. We have seen a strong border protection policy before, under the Howard government, in which the boats effectively stopped. The people smugglers were put out of business. Unlike the Greens party, I still want to put the people smugglers out of business. The Greens want to put everyone else except the people smugglers out of business. They want to keep them in business. This is outrageous. 


We also know that the government is sharply divided on this issue. We know that courtesy of some leaks from cabinet, in which some members of the cabinet were allegedly saying, 'We should be embracing the Nauru solution again.' Indeed they should. We have said that repeatedly. Now there are some with common sense in the Labor Party who know their border protection policies are not working and they are trying to embrace ours. I support them for it and I commend them for it. But of course I also condemn the people who leak from cabinet, because one of the privileges of being in cabinet is that you retain cabinet confidence. I notice that, rather cruelly, people are sheeting home the blame for these leaks to a particular minister in this chamber. In his steadfast support of Ms Gillard, he is trying to prop up her poor leadership at the moment whilst the forces are assembling to re-install Mr Kevin Rudd. Earlier we heard from one of the numbers people for Mr Rudd, Senator Bishop, who has been busy undermining his own Prime Minister and trying to drum up support for Mr Rudd. 


The simple fact is that this Labor government has been absolutely bereft in maintaining a strong border protection policy. I know it has no intention of causing death and distress. It would be reprehensible to suggest that. But the reality is that, with this weak border protection policy, we now have people smugglers that are selling tall tales and fanciful tales based on the government's policy to entice people to get on their boats and spend their hard-earned money to come out here. The proof is there, because over 10,000 of these people have paid to take this trip, and they do it because they know that when they get here this government will support them and endorse their decision to try and usurp the system and bypass the traditional points. 


We can very clearly trace this back to when the Labor Party changed the policy. I will stand corrected if I am wrong, but I believe that the current policy was written by Ms Gillard herself; she endorsed it. But Ms Gillard's reputation for telling the truth is somewhat tarnished, not least of all in this area. In 2002 she made a statement that she would turn the boats back. In 2008 she said that it is fanciful, that no-one can do that. Then of course, not that long ago, she maintained that there was a virtual way of turning the boats back. We know the result of this government's border protection policies. It is that people are paying people smugglers to come out here. There are many non-bona-fide refugees amongst them. There are many people in detention centres. We have seen a blow-out in the budget costs of the administration of these detention centres, from $100 million only three or four years ago to over a billion dollars per year now. This is an outrageous indictment. I have been to some of these detention centres. I have seen that people are there for a long period of time because the government does not know what to do with them. They cannot be released into the Australian community and they cannot be sent home. This is a failure of monumental proportions and it is a failure that is playing havoc with people's lives. 


The answer to this is very simple. It is for those smart people, if there are any in the Labor cabinet, to re-embrace the Nauru solution, which is ready and which can be run under Australian guidelines and Australian strategies. Nauru is a signatory to the human rights convention. It could be run at a very effective cost and it has been proven to stop the boats when it is combined with temporary protection visas and an ability to turn the boats around where it is safe and prudent to do so. These are common-sense measures. 


What has happened in the Labor Party? Where has the common sense gone? It has vacated the premises, like Elvis. Elvis has left the building; well, so has common sense when it comes to this government, because it cannot get this right. Senator Bishop said they had had a myriad of solutions and they had been working on this for three years. You had a decent solution, Senator Bishop, which was ready-made and embraced, and it was part of a successful government. And then you changed it. You changed it, just like you changed from Mr Rudd to Ms Gillard. Now you are going to change back. I know you regret that, Senator Bishop, because you are doing the numbers for him. But you have got a bit of an effort to convince some others in your party. Anyway, Mr Rudd will be coming back because he knows that this government is on track for a disaster because of the disaster they have given to the Australian people not just in terms of the budget but in terms of the moral guidance and the substance—the fact that they are not prepared to take a tough stand against people smugglers. They will talk the good talk, they will deliver the rhetoric, they will blame the opposition—they will do a whole range of different things—but their solutions have been failures. 


I suspect that the next speaker will get up and say that we should have supported the Malaysian solution. Frankly, we should not have supported the Malaysian solution, because the Malaysian solution was not a solution; it was a temporary, stopgap measure that would have already failed at every level, because more than 800 people have already arrived. It would have been an abject failure. The point that I really think is important is that if this government were serious, if this government really genuinely wanted to stop this repulsive trade in people smugglers, they would ditch the Greens, they would ditch the Greens' extremist policies and they would re-embrace the solution that the majority of Australians know works. It has been demonstrated to work and it will continue to work if it is done. I say this to Senator Farrell and the Prime Minister and anyone in the Labor Party: if you embrace the Nauruan solution again and reintroduce temporary protection visas and turn the boats around when it is safe and prudent to do so, I will not make any political mileage out of it. I will go out and celebrate the fact that you have got some common sense back in your party policy.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2011-11-02,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (17:06):  Senator Bernardi, I do not need your help or advice in terms of what policy this government should be adopting on border protection. You referred to former Prime Minister Howard and his policies. His policies were not about border protection, Senator Bernardi. His policies were about getting himself re-elected in the 2001 election.




Senator Bernardi:
  It worked.




Senator FARRELL:
  It did work, and that is the tragedy.




Senator Bernardi:
  It also stopped the boats.




Senator FARRELL:
  It did not stop the boats, because we are still getting these boats now. This problem did not go away with what John Howard did. He sought to use the tragic circumstances of the 438 Afghan asylum seekers on the Tampa for his own political purposes. It was not about border protection; it was about getting him re-elected in that 2001 election.


What is tragic, quite frankly, is the fact that the opposition would use today of all days to raise this issue in the parliament. Overnight, we have read about the very tragic circumstances off the Javanese coast in which a number of apparent asylum seekers seeking to come to Australia lost their lives. It is a tragedy that the opposition, just as they did under John Howard at the time of the Tampa, are seeking to use this issue to score what are nothing other than cheap political points. It is distressing to the people of Australia and to this parliament that instead of focusing on policies that might solve the present difficulties off the coast of the Indonesia they have decided to use this opportunity to score these cheap political points. And we have seen that time and time again.


The reality is that the opposition has no effective policy on border protection and so they seek to criticise our policy, a policy that will clearly act as a deterrent, that will be effective and that will solve the problem that we find ourselves facing. It would seem that the only time that the opposition supports offshore processing is when it is done their way, the Nauru solution.



Senator Bushby interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  What do we know, Senator Bushby, about the Nauru solution? What are the experts telling us about the Nauru solution?



Senator Bushby interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  You will have your opportunity, Senator Bushby, to speak on this subject in due course, if you are on the list. What we are being told about the Nauru solution is that it is both costly and ineffective. We want effective border protection solutions. What we know about the Nauru solution is that it is costly and ineffective. To resurrect that Nauru solution would not be cheap. We are looking at over $1 billion in operational costs alone. And that does not include all of the inevitable spending on infrastructure that would be required to resurrect the Nauru solution. The opposition have been told about the Nauru solution. They have been told in very clear terms that Nauru is not a silver bullet solution. More importantly, it will not break the model of the people smugglers and their dreadful trade. Just as we know it will not work, the opposition knows that it will not work and will be expensive. The government has the solution, the Malaysia solution. The Nauru solution is the wrong one. We are talking about it costing more than $1 billion to resurrect the Nauru solution.




Senator Humphries:
  Can you get those figures?




Senator FARRELL:
  I do not have them immediately to hand, Senator Humphries, but I will make some inquiries and see what I can find out for you in that regard. We know from all of the expert advice that we have received that the Nauru solution is expensive. More importantly, it will not work. Whatever the cost might be—put the cost factor aside for a moment; put that $1 billion aside, Senator Humphries—we know that it will not work. It will no longer act as a deterrent because what the people smugglers know is that if they can get to Nauru it is just a stopping off point on the way to Australia. It is a bit like the Qantas dispute on the weekend: if you want to come from Adelaide to Canberra, you might have to go via Melbourne but you will get to your destination. That is how the people smugglers think of the Nauru solution.


This government has a solution, and one that provides a great deal of compassion. Part of that proposal is to bring 4,000 genuine refugees—




Senator Bushby:
  Genuine refugees.




Senator FARRELL:
  Yes, genuine refugees—from Malaysia. My understanding is that the vast bulk of these people are from the country of Burma, that prison state. Those people currently in Malaysia are genuinely in the queue and have been waiting for long periods of time to be resettled to Australia. They will get the benefit of our solution, which they would not get under any opposition proposal.


Going back and looking at the Nauru proposal, what else do we know about it? The government released the Solicitor-General's legal advice and provided special briefings to the Leader of the Opposition. But he continues to ignore the facts explained in that legal advice.




Senator Polley:
  He ignores every expert.




Senator FARRELL:
  He does. I will take that intervention from Senator Polley. That is one of the problems of the current Leader of the Opposition. He gets advice but he refuses to follow it. He gets the advice from the Solicitor-General that there are significant legal doubts as a result of the High Court decision in respect of Nauru but he refuses to accept that advice. Of course, we have seen what he says about the advice of climate scientists about what is happening in terms of global warming. He rejects that. He just has one mantra, and the mantra is: stop the boats. A simple solution: stop the boats.


The Nauru solution will not stop the boats. The boats will still keep coming unless we get the opposition to see sense here, unless they start taking advice, both the legal advice that we now have from the Solicitor-General—which has been provided to you; you wanted some information from us, Senator Humphries; we have provided you the legal advice—




Senator Humphries:
  I didn't ask you that.




Senator FARRELL:
  Perhaps not you personally.




Senator Humphries:
  I want the costings—the billion-dollar costings.




Senator FARRELL:
  I have undertaken to follow that one up, Senator Humphries. But of course that advice, as the Leader of the Opposition and other members in the opposition have been told, does not support the position of the opposition.


We have also heard about one of Mr Abbott's solutions to the people-smuggling trade—that is, to tow the boats back. Mr Abbott was asked about this last month.



Senator Back interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  Mr Abbott was asked about this, Senator Back.




Senator Back:
  Didn't Mr Rudd have that idea also, Senator Farrell?




Senator FARRELL:
  We are talking about Mr Abbott here.



Senator Back interjecting—




Senator FARRELL:
  Senator Back, you can talk in your speech. This is my opportunity to say a few words, Senator Back, and I want to talk about what Mr Abbott said. When he was asked the question, he said:


Well, that’s the kind of operational question that would have to be worked out by the commander on the spot … I’m not going to set myself up as an expert, but what’s been done in the past can under the right conditions be done again in the future.


That is his policy.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:17):  I thank Senator Farrell for setting the scene in this debate of yet another failed Labor policy. As I move around the country—as I do and as I have done recently throughout Western Australia, including the goldfields areas and the wheat belt areas—there are just so many people shaking their heads and saying to me, 'How many more policy areas can this Labor government fail in before it falls over?' This, of course, is yet another.


The worst of it is twofold. First, there are the devastating consequences. Senator Farrell is right: an absolute tragedy seems to be unfolding in Java, and we just do not know how many other instances of this there are likely to be as we move into the monsoon season. As we move through November to December and January it is very, very unsafe. It is unsafe to go to sea in boats of that type anyhow, but, whilst the people smugglers are being encouraged to the degree that they are being encouraged, we are inevitably going to see this happen.


The second unfortunate sequel of all of this is that, if only this Prime Minister swallowed her pride and accepted the offer by the coalition, this problem would be solved by the end of this electoral week. That solution, naturally enough, is to accept the offer by the coalition to expand the current proposal of the government to the 148 countries that are signatories to the UNHCR convention, including, of course, Papua New Guinea, and including, but not exclusively, Nauru—as Senator Farrell seemed to concentrate on.


I can make the point strongly to you, Madam Deputy President, having worked in Malaysia in much of the last decade, having had an office there and having been there when then President Mahathir Mohamad actually put the cane to illegal immigrants and literally drove them out of Malaysia in a very public way. I can only support the words that have been said in this place in recent times about the capacity of the Malaysians. There is no way in the world that the Malaysians are likely to be a valid recipient. I simply invite the Prime Minister to ask the Prime Minister of Malaysia why they do not sign up to the UNHCR convention.


We already know the Malaysia solution is not going to work. How do we know? Because the original Malaysia solution, when announced with fanfare, was for 800 people in exchange for 4,000. I for one have no difficulty with 4,000 genuine refugees coming into the country. That is not the part that is at fault. Why is it a failure and why was it always going to be a failure? Because, of the 800, since it was announced, 1,270—yes, another 50 per cent—have already arrived. So, even if the Malaysia solution were put forward and passed, we know that it already would have failed. The people smugglers laughed at it.


Let me give you a little bit of history. It was the then Fraser Liberal led coalition government in the 1970s, under the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Michael MacKellar, who announced this country's first refugee policy, to be based on four principles: the first recognising Australia's humanitarian commitment; the second, the fact that all decisions to accept refugees must be and remain with the Australian government; the third, that special assistance would be required for the movement of refugees; and the fourth—most interestingly—the fact that most refugees do not want to settle in this country but their interests lie better in their remaining close to their own country of origin—to which subject I wish to return.


We know, of course, that Australia is a very generous country when it comes to accepting refugees. I think on a per capita basis we are second only to Canada. In the year 2009-10, 13,750 were accepted under the Australian Humanitarian Program, of whom 6,000 were refugees and the balance under the special program. As we know, as these asylum seekers—people who are not yet accepted as refugees—get positions, they take away from others who are already on the list, in the queue, and those who might be accepted on the basis of family association et cetera. They are the ones who are disadvantaged. I want to briefly comment on the activities going on, as have been reported to me, in some of the refugee camps in Thailand, Africa and other places. It is a shocking thing but with the corruption that occurs with those who are managing these refugee camps we are finding many who are there for years simply because people with funds jump the queue. Take one instance that was put to me recently. When a family complained to the management of the refugee camp they were simply told, 'Oh no, you actually left the camp two years ago.' They had not left the camp two years ago. Their identities were assumed, having been paid for, and they were left there to rot. 


There is, however, some good news for this Labor government. I go back to the Howard government and the then minister for immigration, Mr Philip Ruddock, and a speech he gave in the other place on 3 December 2002. He reflected on these facts in the speech entitled 'Managing Migration'. He said that from 1999 to the end of 2002 3,830 people had attempted to come to this country and, of them, 910 had been recognised through the UNHCR process and 400 had been resettled from Indonesia, with, interestingly, 89.4 per cent having been repatriated to countries other than Australia. But this is the interesting point, and it is so poignant for today. How prophetic it was. I quote from his December 2002 speech:


By any measure, this comprehensive strategy—


that the government had put into place—


has been successful.


He said:


There are many countries around the world that would like to be in the position we are in, having achieved that outcome. However—and in my view, most importantly—it has stopped people risking their lives in dangerous journeys organised by people smugglers. I lament very much that many people have lost their lives tragically, putting themselves—


in positions of danger. If time permitted, we could go on to the question of unaccom­panied minors and how that will only spread under this government's policy. There is only one action for the Prime Minister to take: pick up the phone to the Leader of the Opposition and accept our recommendations. (Time expired)

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (17:24):  This matter of public importance is terribly sad. It has been perversely amusing watching those opposite try and justify their perverse and somewhat illogical arguments associated with justifying this ridiculous matter of public importance discussion before the Senate this afternoon. It is terribly sad because it claims that the government does not have a humane border protection policy and is promoting people smuggling. That could not be further from the actual case. In fact, the government's amendments to the Migration Act that we sought to move through the parliament were particularly aimed at the issues: a more humane approach by prioritising those who are refugees waiting in UNHCR camps throughout the world, increasing the number of humane refugees that we take through our annual intake and providing an effective deterrent to the insidious trade of people smuggling.


The other perverse issue associated with this matter proposed by the opposition this afternoon is that in effect they are saying, through their actions in opposing the changes to the Migration Act, that they are opposing the principle of re-establishing offshore processing as an option for governments in Australia, be that in Nauru or Malaysia. So they are opposing the principle that we seek to re-establish in the Migration Act. This is a very emotive and very difficult issue of public policy and it is an issue that requires leadership. With the recent amendments to the Migration Act sought by the government, there was an opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite to show some leadership on this very important issue. What did they do? They did what they have done in every other public policy area that has affected this country: they just said no. It was a chance to show the type of leadership that was shown by the then Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, in 2001 when he did support sensible amendments to the Migration Act to ensure that there was an effective deterrent to people smuggling to this country. But, no, we do not get that sort of leadership from those opposite. We just simply get 'No, no, no'.


In the wake of the High Court decision, the government took the advice of experts and sought to re-establish the principle of offshore processing as an effective deterrent to people smuggling and we did not specify a location for offshore processing in the amendments. The principle would have been re-established that the executive government of this country has the right to determine its migration policies and its border protection policies. We sought to ensure that offshore processing became legal again, so we sought to re-establish that principle. We did not specify Malaysia or Nauru or anything like that; we simply sought to re-establish that principle, the principle which could have been used by future governments, if they were to so choose—despite the fact that they have been previously advised that Nauru will not work—to establish that they could use Nauru as an option in the future. Yet the opposition opposed it. They voted against their rhetoric and their public comments about Nauru as a viable option. They voted against that principle, simply because they say no to everything and they are only out to try to attempt to damage the government.


The government took the approach that it did, in recommending those changes to the Migration Act, because we sought the advice of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Andrew Metcalfe, the head of the department, gave evidence in estimates hearings that Malaysia was the most appropriate plan to deal with this issue. And, of course, we saw the evidence of Chief of Navy, who said that Nauru and other issues might not be an effective deterrent. We did this because we know that we need to stop people getting on boats and we need to stop it being possible for people who have the money to pay for that unsafe journey. We wanted to maximise our humanitarian intake from those people that have been waiting in UNHCR camps for many years. We believe that the Malaysia agreement was a way to achieve that, and we still believe that that is the most appropriate way to do this. We believe that Nauru will not work, because the advice of the experts says that Nauru will not work. It is too costly, it is not an effective deterrent, there is no infrastructure on the island to deal with it and the overwhelming majority of genuine refugees end up in Australia— (Time expired)

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (17:34):  It seems quite a long time since the moving of the adjournment last night. I had expected to be completing this speech on these so-called clean energy bills somewhat earlier today, but there we are. When the adjournment was moved last night one of the issues I was discussing in relation to these bills and my shadow responsibilities was the impact on housing in Australia that will occur after the implementation of this legislation. I was speaking last night about the increases that will result, particularly in rents, as investors in new houses are forced to pass on the costs of servicing those larger mortgages to their tenants.


When you increase the cost of building new homes you inevitably also slow the growth in new housing stock and push up the price of existing homes. We already have a shortage of rental properties, so an increasing shortage of rental properties will only see more low-income earners and more welfare recipients pushed into what is often known as marginal housing. A number of senators in the chamber are familiar with the issues around homelessness. I am not sure that I understand a policy that is ultimately going to exacerbate social problems such as this. It seems to me to be ill conceived. Equally perversely, the additional costs of new housing construction are going to punish those who want to build a house, as modern, newly constructed houses have the highest levels of energy efficiency and therefore the lowest contributions to carbon emissions of Australia's housing stock. It will deter the construction of new, more energy efficient housing, and this is at a time when Australia already has a chronic national housing shortage, which stands at 202,400 as of June 2010 and is expected to exceed 300,000 by 2014. I would really like to have more current, more up-to-date, figures but for reasons known only to members of the government the National Housing Supply Council was not reappointed for an extended period after the last election. In fact, it was in limbo for months and months, notwithstanding the fact that the relevant aspects of the red book for that portfolio indicated that it was a priority action. So we are awaiting a State of supply report which will show Australians and, more particularly, investors what the state of shortage is. In ignoring the important issue of the national housing shortage—and it is extremely frustrating in the estimates process to seek answers as to when we will see a new State of supply report—the government also ignores the fact that the implementation of the carbon tax as it is constructed under this legislation will only exacerbate the problem, and that is a matter of great concern to members of the coalition.


We think, as members of the Liberal and National parties, that there is another way to go about this, and numbers of my colleagues have spoken about that previously. Overwhelmingly, Australians want to see something done about climate change and want to see Australia doing its part. Rather than using the blunt object of carbon pricing, the coalition's plan is to address climate change and to reach its five per cent emissions reduction target by 2020 by positive, direct action.




Senator Chris Evans:
  Oh, come on. Put your heart into it.




Senator PAYNE:
  Well, Senator Evans, I can certainly assist with that. I could in fact bring some light-heartedness to the chamber if this were not so serious. What we see, particularly in New South Wales—and I do not know if other senators are experiencing it as well—is what could only be described as hysterical misinformation spread by members of the government about the coalition's position on these issues.


It is the stuff of politics that ministers visit electorates and shadow ministers visit electorates—it is the toing and froing of the political process; we are all used to it—and a couple of months ago I was very pleased to welcome the shadow minister for health and ageing, the Hon. Peter Dutton, from the other place, to the federal electorate of Lindsay in Western Sydney to meet with senior staff and officials from Nepean Hospital. Nepean Hospital is a very important tertiary hospital in Western Sydney. It serves, as I am sure you would be aware, Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, a very important part of the Western Sydney community, not just around Penrith but also in the lower mountains and further afield.


Mr Dutton's visit to Nepean Hospital had us contemplating the impact of a carbon tax on a hospital like that, and the end result of that contemplation and our discussions on that day indicated that they would be facing an increased electricity cost of approximately $300,000 a year with no compensation, as the Energy Users Association assessments indicate. Not unreasonably, Mr Dutton and I raised this issue in the local community. We raised it through the local media and asked the local member, Mr Bradbury, what he thought about this potentially increased cost of $300,000 and how a hospital like Nepean Hospital, already stretched to the limit but doing an exceptional job at all levels of its operations, was going to deal with an extra $300,000 in electricity costs. I thought it was probably quite a reasonable question. It is his local hospital, they were keen to know how we thought they should deal with it and I was keen to know how he, as a member of the government, thought it should be dealt with.


As I indicated in my previous remarks, there is absolutely no contention on the part of the coalition that nothing should be done in relation to climate change. That is a fallacy. It is an untruth and it is something that we will contest when that point is raised at every opportunity because we have a policy in relation to direct action. So when I asked the local member in Lindsay what his response was to this potentially increased cost for Nepean Hospital it seemed strange to me that he chose not to answer that question but rather to issue a press statement which said that failing to act on climate change will come at a great cost to the health system over time. No-one is arguing that we should fail to act—nobody at all in this particular discussion—but he went on to say:


Without taking action, Australia is expected to experience higher rates of infectious and vector-borne diseases as well as food and waterborne diseases.


If that is not hysterical scaremongering, it is hard to imagine what might fall into the category of hysterical scaremongering. One expects that the vector-borne, and certainly the waterborne, diseases are going to head down the Nepean River to the weir in Penrith and infect the local community if we are not addressing climate change.


I reiterate the point that nobody is suggesting that climate change should not be addressed, but the contention of the opposition is that this is not the way to do it, that this would be a cost on all Australians—a cost on business, on families and on individuals, and one which they should not be expected to meet by a government that did not tell them the truth before the last federal election. The price of addressing climate change should not be lower standards of living and it should not be the exporting of the problem, along with Australian jobs, as I indicated yesterday.


In relation to what the impact will be on housing, in particular, I have indicated that the Housing Industry Association, for example, estimates an increased cost of $5,000 for the construction of a house. Any realistic person in this place, in this chamber or the other one, will know that in the community $5,000 extra is a deal breaker. Five thousand dollars extra on your budget when you are counting every single cent to build your new home is literally a deal breaker. Why should Australian families who want to look after their children and support themselves by building their own home—realising what is often cliched but is in fact very important: the great Australian dream of owning their own home—be faced with that impost because this government refuses to consider other options? We say that it is an unreasonable approach, that it is not an approach we will support and that in fact it is legislation we will oppose and repeal if we are elected to government at the next election.

Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:43):  I rise to acknowledge what a sad week this is for democracy and for those who have elected us to represent them as we debate the introduction of the clean energy package of bills, which we know is a fancy name for a carbon tax. It is a debate that the Prime Minister pledged to the people of Australia before the last election that we were not going to have, a carbon tax that we were not going to have. We all remember her solemn pledge only six days before the last election that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. Because she broke that pledge, today we are debating just that: a carbon tax that every Labor senator on the other side of this chamber should be ashamed of. To those on the other side I say: where is your integrity? Stand up for your principles, honour your word to your constituents and listen to what Australians are telling you—not the small minority represented by the Greens, with whom you are in formal alliance, but the majority of everyday Australians, hardworking families, individuals and businesses across the country who do not want a carbon tax.


Whilst I am on the subject of those on the other side of this chamber, I find it passing curious that senators from Queensland, Western Australia and my home state of Victoria have been missing in action this week during this debate. Where are they? What is their position? And why are they not standing up for the workers and families in each of their states? We have not heard from Victorian senators arguing for this toxic carbon tax. And why is that? It is a really good question. It is because they know that this tax is going to kill the manufacturing industry in Victoria. It is going to plunder it in a state where 50,000 jobs are in the manufacturing industry. It is an absolute disgrace.


Prime Minister Gillard made a solemn pledge on behalf of her government to the people of Australia. We now know that her vow—her commitment—was nothing more than empty words and at best an immoral pledge to the nation. We now know that the words of the Prime Minister are meaningless. Australians question everything she says today. If there are any senators opposite who have any real integrity, they will honour that pledge and cross the floor to vote with us on this side. They will choose to honour their government's pre-election pledge and maintain their faith with their electorates. They will support minimising the cost-of-living pressure and will secure and support a manufacturing industry in challenging times rather than threatening jobs.


I received a letter on 17 October—very recently—from the Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group, Ms Heather Ridout. This letter urged me to amend the carbon tax as it was 'a flawed approach to cutting greenhouse gas emissions'. If Ms Ridout wants this Labor legislation to be amended, then we know it surely must not be good for this country. In fact, we know this tax will be lethal to the manufacturing industry in Victoria. I say to Ms Ridout today that the coalition hears you. The coalition will do more than amend the carbon tax; we will repeal the carbon tax. Unlike those opposite, we will not break this promise. This is our covenant with the people of Australia, and we will stand by that covenant.


The government's abject failure, incompetence and dysfunction since the last election has been incomprehensible. The next election will not only be a referendum on the Labor government's policies; it will also be a referendum on this carbon tax. The fact that this government thinks it can effectively implement this vast structural economy-wide tax in Australia beggars belief. Why do I say that? You only have to look back over the last few months and the litany of disasters we have seen this government preside over.


Only this week we saw the government's tardy and incompetent response to the Qantas crisis. To those who are listening to this broadcast today, I remind you of the extraordinary cost blow-outs of the NBN, the $50 billion plus program that commenced without a business plan. I remind you of the BER, with billions spent on school halls without any consideration being given to seeking value for money. And kids are still waiting for their own personal computer through the computers in schools program. And let us not forget GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch and cash for clunkers. The list goes on and on. They are all government policies that have been poorly conceived and that in some cases have been knee-jerk reactions, such as the live cattle export debacle that cost businesses and Australia millions of dollars in lost contracts. And let us not forget the $900 stimulus package cheques under former Prime Minister Rudd—not so long ago—which supposedly saved us from the GFC.


How, then, can the people of Australia trust this government, who now supposedly want to save the planet, to be fiscally responsible with a new tax? How can we trust them with the biggest structural change, the biggest tax, we have seen when they cannot even manage the installation of pink batts in roofs? This government—with its political partner, the Greens—arrogantly claims that it can and will save the planet. What hubris and hypocrisy. If the government is so keen to cut emissions and save the planet, it should start by curbing Mr Rudd's travel and consequent carbon emissions. Maybe they could even use a commercial airline instead of chartering a 737 for one person.


The litany of failure continues with the GP superclinics promised across the nation, which are yet to be delivered. And we have witnessed a rolling immigration crisis that continues today. These are all disasters of the government's own making. We know the Prime Minister has lost control of our borders. She has certainly lost control of the national agenda, because the Greens are actually running that agenda. More importantly for her, she has to spend a lot of time checking behind her back due to the internal division that is racking the Labor Party, the caucus and even her own cabinet, if the reports we have heard of recent cabinet leaks are true. In this climate of absolute mayhem, the government is hell-bent on ensuring that Australia is the first and only nation that will have introduced a carbon tax by the time she and her deputy, the Leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown, pack their bags for the climate change conference in Durban. Not one of the world's developed economies has implemented a carbon tax—not Canada, which voted against it; not New Zealand, which axed the tax; and not the US, which has completely removed it from its policy agenda. And those on the other side of the chamber accuse us of being oppositional in defending the livelihoods and wellbeing of businesses and families. There is one thing that is certain about this sad state of affairs and that is that an Abbott government will repeal this carbon tax.


In my patron seats in Victoria, every day I hear firsthand accounts of the devastating impact that a carbon tax will have on them. Only in August this year I hosted the shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, in the electorates of Deakin and Chisholm, two of my patron seats in Victoria. I went, where the member for Deakin, Mike Symon, and the member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, dare not go—that is, to visit small businesses. As is the case with most SMEs in these electorates, the small businesses that we visited will be negatively affected by the Gillard government's toxic carbon tax.


We visited Daisy Garden Supplies in Ringwood East and Electric Cable Duct Systems in Box Hill South. I asked them: what would the imposition of a carbon tax mean for a small family business like yours? I stress: these people have mortgaged their homes to establish small businesses and have built them up over a long period in the hope that their families will take over when the fathers, uncles or brothers actually retire. Neil Mulcahy is the owner-operator of Daisy Garden Supplies. He has done an amazing job of building up this small business. He now employs no fewer than 60 people. That is not just 60 individuals; that is 60 families who benefit from the employment provided by Mr Mulcahy and his successful local business. It has taken Mr Mulcahy 31 years to build and develop his business. He is clearly a significant contributor in that area and to the community.


During our visit, Mr Mulcahy and his wife told me that his current monthly fuel bill was a staggering $100,000. Daisy Garden Supplies has about 60 trucks on the road, which deliver across the length and breadth of Victoria and beyond. Mr Mulcahy believes that the imposition of this government's toxic carbon tax will impact on his business dramatically. Whilst I was there with the shadow Treasurer, we also talked about the Australian Trucking Association's estimates, which he supports, because he has a number of his own trucks and is a big user of the industry. The Australian Trucking Association estimates that a carbon tax on them will cost their industry and their customers $510 million in 2014-15 alone. That is half a billion dollars in one financial year.


Mr Mulcahy's electricity bills and machinery bills will go up and the member for Deakin, Mike Symon, says that this is okay. Mr Symon, by his inaction on advocating for local small business, such as Daisy Garden Supplies, is essentially saying that he does not care about the effect of this toxic carbon tax on small business. He has been missing in action in Deakin. I have not seen him holding carbon tax forums across his electorate. The people of Deakin have not heard from him on this matter. I would go as far as to say that, by virtue of the absence of him saying anything on this issue, he has to be a strong and devout supporter of this toxic carbon tax.


But, above all, what his inaction demon­strates, which is even more compelling, is that he does not understand small business and how it operates. I guess we should not be surprised, given that he is yet another member with a union movement back­ground. But it is very tragic for the people of Deakin that he has not been able to learn on the job and understand how these businesses operate since becoming the member for Deakin. One can only describe the Mike Symons of this world as gutless in their position on this matter. Before the last election he was a sitting member of the government, the same government that pledged that there would be no carbon tax. Now he stands by Prime Minister Gillard when she visits the electorate of Deakin, advocating and prosecuting the case for why a carbon tax should be introduced. For people like Mr Mulcahy at Daisy Garden Supplies there is not a dollar of compensation. There is no assistance, there is nothing—zip.


Daisy Garden Supplies is a classic small to medium sized family business and Mr Mulcahy will have to wear the cost or pass it on to his customers. It is abundantly clear that, for many of these businesses, passing the cost on to the customers is not an option because their profit margin is so slim. This will have huge ramifications on his capacity to employ 60 individuals and it may well have huge ramifications on the families of those 60 people.


In the electorate of Chisholm we met the owners of Electric Cable Ducting Systems. The member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, has some serious questions to answer—as does Mike Symon, the member for Deakin— which, I think, demand some urgent answers. Whilst the member for Chisholm has recently been very outspoken on the Prime Minister's Malaysia solution and has been very strident in her opposition to offshore processing, in particular to the Malaysia solution, she has been absolutely mute on the issue of a carbon tax and she has been mute in defending the interests of those in her electorate. Electric Cable Duct Systems, ECD, began as a small family business operating out of a shopfront, with a workshop at the back, in 1979. ECD is now an Australia-wide leader in electrical cable management. Thirty-two years on this family company, ECD, have outlets in New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland, the Northern Territory, the ACT and New Zealand. Under a carbon tax the cost of aluminium, which is the main material that ECD uses to assemble their products, will significantly rise.


The world's largest aluminium company, RUSAL, recently launched a scathing attack on the Gillard government's carbon tax. It was reported online at news.com that in a submission to the federal government RUSAL said the clean energy legislative package, the carbon tax and emissions trading scheme, was a threat 'to the viability of the Russian group's major investment in Australia.' RUSAL owns 20 per cent of the giant Queensland Alumina refinery at Gladstone, the second largest alumina refinery in the world, which employs 1,800 people. The estimated cost of a carbon tax to this industry was in the order of $30 million to $40 million in the first year of the tax, and nearly $400 million over the next 10 years.


There is a very consistent theme if you go out there and talk to businesses, people who are actually creating jobs and wealth, which is that this toxic carbon tax is going to kill their businesses. My office was recently in contact with three families in Victoria who, on the government's own figures, will be worse off under the carbon tax. Each of these families entered their details into the household assistance estimator on the government's clean energy future website. I must point out that these families are operating on the assumption that the estimator is accurate. With good reason, the families who have contacted my office doubt the accuracy of the calculations and believe that they will in fact be worse off than what is estimated on this website.


Kathleen and Chris were one of those couples. They are young, married and have two kids. Kathleen worked for the first 12 months of their marriage before becoming pregnant and giving birth to their first son. Chris works in the finance industry and has received promotions in the time that Kathleen has remained at home, although he is the sole income earner. According to the government's own estimator, under the carbon tax they will be worse off. I have pages of examples of people who have contacted my office in the electorate of Deakin who have all expressed their concerns about that website. It confirms to them that they are going to be much worse off under this carbon tax.


In essence, what does it mean for these families? It means an additional financial burden and it means that businesses will be challenged in continuing to provide the employment levels they currently do. But what for? Why are we dealing with this now? Why is it so incredibly necessary for Australia to be the only nation to introduce an economy-wide carbon tax when all other countries have turned their back on it. As we know, and we have heard it this morning, it is because Bob Brown, the Leader of the Greens, who sits over there on the government side, wants to go to Durban with a carbon tax under his arm.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (18:03):  As I stand here in the chamber tonight and look down at the list of bills being considered together, there is a temptation to go through each of the bills, to talk about each of the schedules, to examine the purpose of the carbon tax, to look at the efficacy of the mechanism, to look at the compensation arrangements and to look at all of the consequential provisions of other pieces of legislation. That is a temptation, but I think to do so would be a mistake because the real significance of the debate we are having here today is not actually the provisions contained in the bills. The real subject matter of the debate is that of deceit. It is that of a government that went to the last election with the solemn pledge that it would not introduce a carbon tax. The exact phraseology used by the Prime Minister was:


There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.


She was echoed in that sentiment by the Treasurer, who referred to the hysteria that people who believed that a Labor govern­ment could possibly introduce a carbon tax were expressing. Anyone who had the temerity to doubt the statement of the Prime Minister that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led was basically branded an hysterical. The Australian people took the word of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in good faith. They cast their ballots, whether it was for the government or the coalition parties or for another party, in the sure and certain knowledge that if Labor re-formed government they would not introduce a carbon tax. We know all too well and all too clearly that what the Prime Minister said before the last election represents perhaps the most blatant, clear and unequivocal lie in recent Australian political history. That is why I say that it would be a mistake in this debate to focus on the provisions of the bills. That is what the government would like us to do, and indeed that is what many government senators are doing: looking at the actual provisions of the bills. But to do so obscures the very reason that we are here in the first place: because those opposite are seeking to give effect to a fundamental breach of promise.


I do, however, at the outset, want to focus a little bit on my home state of Victoria. My state of Victoria will be hit first and it will be hit hardest by the carbon tax. The reason for that is Victoria has a great comparative advantage: it has access to a cheap energy supply; it has access to cheap brown coal. It has been the underpinning of Victorian industry. It has been the underpinning of the success of many Victorian businesses that they can access such a cheap and constant power supply.


Another reason I contend that Victoria will be hit first and hardest by a carbon tax is the importance of manufacturing to the Victorian economy. A few kilometres from my electorate office in Mentone is the centre of Dandenong. Dandenong is at the heart of the manufacturing precinct of Victoria. Something in the order of 44 per cent of Victoria's manufacturing output comes from the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, particularly based around Dandenong and Dandenong South. I have visited many manufacturers over the last several months. I have visited quite a few of them with Ms Mirabella, from the other place, the shadow minister for industry. I visited many of them with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott. And the story at each and every manufacturer is the same: the carbon tax will be bad for business.


I had the great pleasure a couple of months back of going to the annual general meeting of the South East Melbourne Manufacturers Association in Dandenong. There would have been 300 manufacturers there. The reasons I went along were twofold. Firstly, I like spending time with manufacturers, I like hearing about their business success stories and I like hearing about the people they employ. But the other reason I went along to the annual general meeting of the South East Melbourne Manufacturers Association was the guest speaker at that meeting, who was Mr Mark Dreyfus QC, the member for Isaacs and the parliamentary secretary for the carbon tax. I have to hand it to Mr Dreyfus. He did have a fair bit of front. He addressed these 300 manufacturers on the topic of the carbon tax and 'why it is good for your business'. That was an audacious thing to do, but clearly he has the strength of his convictions. So Mr Dreyfus was standing there, addressing 300 manufacturers on the subject of the carbon tax and 'why it is good for your business'. When it came time for questions, one manufacturer stood up and said, 'Mr Dreyfus: the electricity bill for our business is $120,000 a year and it is going to go up by 10 per cent.' Mr Dreyfus listened to that. Another manufacturer stood up and said, 'Mr Dreyfus, I can top that: our power bill is going to increase under a carbon tax by $130,000 a year'—an electricity bill increase of $130,000 a year! Mr Dreyfus's response to that was words to the effect of, 'Well, I think that just goes to prove my point that the effect of a carbon tax will be modest.' Another manufacturer got to his feet and said, 'Mr Dreyfus, we're in the medical devices business. One of our leading products costs $1,500 a year to produce. We have a margin on that product of $5, and the carbon tax is going to wipe that margin off.' The response of Mr Dreyfus to that manufacturer was, 'Well, I think what that tells us is that your business has other problems, doesn't it?' The arrogance, the condescension, the lack of understanding of what it actually takes to build a business, to invest your capital, to take a risk, to employ people—no understanding at all. The best that I can say of Mr Dreyfus in that circumstance was that at least he had the guts to front up, but I have to say he was on a hiding to nothing—and quite rightly so.


I have been spending a fair bit of time in my part of Melbourne. On Saturday mornings I like to get out, visit a shopping centre, set up a card table, put up a few banners—the wording on them, you may be interested, Madam Acting Deputy President, says, 'Say no: stop Labor's carbon tax', in lovely bright yellow letters on a crisp black background. I am usually flanked by two of those. And with some friends I collect petitions against the carbon tax. I have to say that I have been bowled over by the rush of people saying, 'Where do I sign? Where's a pen? Let me put my name down. How do I get rid of this government? Come on you guys, what are you doing? Can't you get rid of this government? How do we stop this carbon tax?' It has happened time and again. I set up my card table with my friends in the shopping centre of Berwick, in the seat of Ms Laura Smyth, the member for La Trobe. I have to say I was bowled over with people saying, 'Where do I sign? How do I stop this tax? How do we get rid of this government?' On another Saturday morning I set up my card table in Mordialloc, in front of the Safeways, in the electorate of Mr Mark Dreyfus QC, the local member for the seat of Isaacs. And again the same thing: bowled over by people saying, 'Where can I sign? How do we stop this government? How do we get rid of this carbon tax?'


On another Saturday morning I set up my card table at Dingley Village shops in the electorate of Mr Simon Crean, the electorate of Hotham. The same thing happened there with people saying: 'Give me a pen. Where do I sign? How do we get rid of this government? How do we stop this tax?' On another Saturday morning at the Cranbourne shops I set up my card table in the electorate of Mr Anthony Byrne, the member for Holt. The same thing happened again with people saying: 'Where do I sign? How do we stop this government? How do we stop this tax?' It was the same thing over and over again.


The reason there was that passion and the reason we obtained literally thousands of signatures from people was that these people felt like they had been gypped, if I can use that technical term. They know they were lied to. They know they were fibbed to. They know they were sold a bill of goods. They know they were told, 'There will not be a carbon tax.' They feel ripped off. They are not happy about it and they should not be happy about it because there should be a fundamental bond of trust between the electors and the elected. This government has broken that fundamental bond of trust and the Australian people are not happy about it.


Madam Acting Deputy President, I know you are interested in what I do with my Saturday mornings and you are probably also interested in what I do with my Friday nights. On the night that Her Majesty had a reception here in the Great Hall, I could not attend. I conveyed my apologies because I had a prior engagement. That prior engagement was in a hall in the suburb of Cheltenham in the south-east suburbs of Melbourne. Coincidentally, it happens to be in the electorate of Mr Mark Dreyfus QC, member for Isaacs and parliamentary secretary for the carbon tax. The occasion was a rally against the carbon tax and we had 90 or 100 people there. I do want to tell you in my own words what occurred there but I can do better than that—I can quote the words of Mr Dreyfus who obviously felt very strongly about the event because he wrote an opinion piece for Fairfax. I will just share a little bit of it with you. It is headed 'Baillieu government joining Abbott's circus.' It starts:


The Tony Abbott circus of lies and misinformation about climate change and the carbon price came to my electorate, Isaacs in Melbourne, last week. And this time the state Baillieu government joined the show, with no less than six state MPs lining up to deceive and alarm the residents and business people of southern suburban Cheltenham.


Quite frankly, I think it is good to see state MPs working on a Friday night. It continues:


On stage before a not-so-large crowd of about 90—


Not-so-large crowd of about 90! I think 90 people on a Friday night about a public policy issue is not bad. You have got to be pretty arrogant as a local member to discourage 90 of your constituents who are gathering on a Friday night. Anyway, Mr Dreyfus says:


On stage before a not-so-large crowd of about 90 were Liberal federal frontbenchers Andrew Robb and Senator Mathias Cormann (who came all the way from WA to recite his slogans), state Energy Minister Michael O'Brien, and ringmaster Senator Mitch Fifield. In the audience were state Liberal MPs Inga Peulich, Murray Thompson, Lorraine Wreford, Donna Bauer and Elisabeth Miller. That's nine Liberal MPs in attendance at the circus!


I actually think it is a good thing that you have got nine members of parliament out there meeting their constituents, talking to them and listening to them. That is not something to be disparaged. It is a good thing to have members of parliament out and about and to have their constituents there engaging with them. That is a good thing. Mr Dreyfus continues:


The performers – Robb, Cormann, O'Brien and Fifield spouted the usual Liberal false claims.


I have got a little bit of advice for Mr Dreyfus: if one of your political opponents has got under your skin do not let them know, do not write an opinion piece for the paper and just pretend it is water off a duck's back. Anyway, I am grateful to him for putting pen to paper. It has given a lot of encouragement to many to continue the fight.


My point is that Labor are out of touch. They still do not understand that you cannot fib and you cannot lie to the Australian people and expect them to say: 'That is okay. No worries. Think nothing of it.' That fundamental bond of trust, which I spoke of before, between the electors and the elected has been broken. It is bad enough that that has been broken. It is bad enough that this government did not do the decent thing and take the carbon tax to the last election. But we do not expect much better from the Australian Labor Party. It is bad enough that they did that. I am tempted to say almost worse but it cannot be worse than that, because nothing can be worse than lying to the Australian people. You would have thought, having lied to the Australian people, that to try and reclaim a bit of dignity and to try and reclaim a bit of decency you would ensure that there was a decent parliamentary process—that there was proper scrutiny in this place.


We know the analogy that many on this side have cited before of the goods and services tax and the new tax system. There were five months of parliamentary inquiry and countless Senate committees meeting concurrently to examine that important legislation. This package of legislation, which is before us here, will have a much greater effect, and not for the good of the Australian people. It would be an understatement to say it was disappointing that only two weeks were provided for the Australian Senate to look at this legislation: this week, which is apparently meant to be for all the second reading speeches, and next week for the committee stage. It is bad enough that a motion was put through this place to bring a guillotine into effect to terminate the second reading stage at 3.45 pm on Thursday of next week. It is bad enough that the guillotine was to be put into effect to terminate all stages of the bill, regardless of where we are at, and bring the matter to a conclusion at the end of Thursday next week. That was bad enough, but we have the incredible situation today where that is going to change. Tomorrow the government, with the connivance of the Greens, is going to seek to bring this package of bills to a conclusion by 11 o'clock next Tuesday. This is in stark contrast to the words of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, who said in his press release of 21 September that the Senate would have more than two full weeks to debate the clean energy package of bills. That is not true; that is a fib. The Senate will not have two full weeks; the Senate will not even have a week and a half. The guillotine is being brought forward. What we are talking about here is a gag on a gag. This is shameless, having a gag on a gag. We were promised that there would be two full weeks of debate. We do not think that is enough. Personally, I think there should have been about five months of appropriate examination.


But the ultimate deceit was Senator Evans's press release today, which is about putting a gag on a gag, headed 'Extended sitting hours for Senate to pass clean energy package'. Talk about doublethink—extended sitting hours. No, the government are not extending sitting hours, they are putting a gag on a gag. They are bringing a guillotine forward from a Thursday to a Tuesday. That is not extending hours, that is truncating hours, that is curtailing debate. It is an outrage. Compounding the fact that this government lied to the electorate at the last election, compounding the fact that they have not provided proper parliamentary scrutiny, what they are now doing is truncating the limited parliamentary scrutiny that is available. This is appalling. This bill should be opposed. This legislation should be opposed.

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator ADAMS
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:24):  I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related bills. To continue in Senator Fifield's vein, I too was very surprised when I sat down at my desk and found 'Labor and Greens shut down carbon tax debate'. Once again we are really being truncated, I guess you could say, and it looks as though 12 of our coalition senators who are very keen to participate in this debate will miss out. Where is this government going? The government refused to give the community a say on the carbon tax at the last election by promising not to introduce it. Once more the government is shutting down the debate. The government is desperate to ram through this legislation because it knows that it is electorally unpopular, as Senator Fifield just explained. I can certainly give many examples in Western Australia at the local shows where we had exactly the same reaction. I have never before had a petition that I have not had to ask people to sign, but they have come and asked me whether they can sign it, where do they sign it, what do they do and how do they go about it.


We have not even debated these hours but obviously it is a fait accompli. They want to limit the debate because the more the carbon tax is debated and more people understand how it will impact on their lives, the more they want to get rid of it. Instead of ramming the carbon tax through the Senate, the Prime Minister should take the bills to an election as a matter of urgency and decency. The coalition will make the next election a referendum on the carbon tax. If elected, the coalition will introduce legislation to repeal the tax as the first order of business. I am sure all those listening are fully aware of what the coalition government intends to do if they are successful in being elected at the next election. We will have a contract with the community to honour the mandate to scrap the tax as a priority, and we expect Labor to respect the mandate.


The tax is first and foremost an electricity tax, which is why it will not work. After $105 billion of taxes Australian firms, and through them the consumer, will still have to buy almost 100 million tonnes of foreign carbon credits at a cost of $3.5 billion a year by 2020. This is absolutely ridiculous and we are determined to ease the cost-of-living pressures on Australians and ensure that they will be better off under a coalition government rather than under Labor's carbon tax that will not even reduce Australia's emissions.


I will go back to my description of how all of this came about. If the Gillard government had been honest with the Australian people before the last election, we would not be here today debating these bills in their present form. The government was elected on a mandate of no carbon tax, and six days after the newly constituted Gillard-Brown government the carbon tax, funnily enough, reappeared. As the Australian people had not been consulted regarding the carbon tax, it was proposed to hold a community forum with 150 appointed delegates. These delegates were supposedly to advise the government on how to deal with the carbon tax. Of course, the forum did not eventuate and instead the government formed a new committee and held an inquiry into Australia's clean energy future. This inquiry had no terms of reference, which meant that all submissions were relevant to the inquiry. Of the 4,500 submissions that were received, it was interesting to note that only 70, two per cent, were published on the website and protected by parliamentary privilege. This means that the Gillard-Brown government listened to two per cent of Australians who had put forward submissions but the other 98 per cent have not been heard or were completely denied a voice. Is this representative of a democratic country? I think not. 


This inquiry has been a farce and without the Gillard-Brown government releasing its modelling it means little to the Australian people. Without seeking the permission of the Australian community at either an election or a referendum, the government is taking billions of dollars out of our economy and giving it to foreign interests. At the same time it has ignored landowners' rights and has turned a blind eye while some of our best agricultural land is turned into a worthless landscape. It seems the Australian people have lost their basic right to democracy through this suite of bills. They have been misled by the Prime Minister's latest $25 million carbon tax advertising campaign. This advertising implies that the carbon tax will help clean up Australia's emissions profile. The shadow minister for climate action, environment and heritage, the Hon. Greg Hunt, said:


Under Treasury modelling, Australia’s emissions will actually increase from 578 to 621 million tonnes between now and 2020. The fact that the tax will raise $105 billion is not disclosed in the advertisements let alone the fact that emissions will go up.


There is no mention of the fact that in addition to the Carbon Tax, Australians will be sending $3.5 billion overseas each year from 2020 to buy foreign carbon credits. This fundamental plan is not raised anywhere in the advertising.


The entire system is based on the assumption that the United States will have a full national Carbon Tax or cap and trade system by 2016. This is both undisclosed in the advertising and utterly fanciful.


If this was a commercial advertisement, the ACCC in all likelihood would pull the Carbon Tax campaign from the air for being false and misleading.


It is interesting to look at the international perspective on clean energy and carbon tax policies. The United Kingdom climate change policy was recently reversed. They have radically reduced their commitment to cut emissions. George Osborne, a UK MP, said:


The United Kingdom will cut carbon emissions no slower but also no faster than our fellow countries in Europe.


The UK was committed to cutting emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. Europe is only committed to cutting emissions by 20 per cent by 2050. Mr Osborne continued:


We're not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business—


I wish this government would think the same way—


Britain makes up less than 2% of the world's carbon emissions compared to China and America's 40%. The renewables sector will never be a strong enough engine of recovery for the British economy.


Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, John Baird, in Perth for CHOGM, confirmed that Canada will not be introducing a carbon price. Clearly the Canadians have realised that such a scheme, which fails to reduce emissions and is a huge cost to the economy, is not the most effective way of addressing climate change. When they went to their last election, the government won in a landslide because they declared they would not introduce a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. Canada's rejection of a carbon model follows the United States, Japan and Korea distancing themselves from imposing similar policies. 


The implications of this for Australia are significant as the government's modelling is predicated on there being an agreement between the major economies on an international carbon trading scheme. The failure of such an agreement will result in increased costs for Australian households and leave Australian businesses unfairly penalised compared to their international competitors. The carbon pricing mechanism is set at $23 a tonne. The carbon pricing scheme in Australia, a country which accounts for 1.4 per cent of global emissions, is going to generate more tax revenue in three months than the European scheme has in more than six years—and Europe accounts for 14 per cent of global emissions. How ridiculous is that?


As a Western Australian senator, I am deeply concerned about the impact of the proposed legislation on my home state, especially about the impact on rural areas. Despite not being in the top 500 big polluters and not being directly subject to the carbon tax, farmers face additional costs from the clean energy bills. These costs are estimated by the National Farmers Federation to be in the order of $16,000 per year for Western Australian grain growers. Tourism operators face 30 per cent higher energy costs, this coming at a time when the sector is struggling with a high Australian dollar and declining domestic tourism. Although the mining sector is expected to continue to grow under a carbon tax, conservative estimates for 2020-21 of employment forgone in existing coalmines due to emissions pricing are around 4,700 jobs in coalmines and 14,100 jobs in the Australian economy. More detailed modelling of the carbon tax by state governments shows that Western Australia will be significantly affected. The Kimberley will experience a reduction in output growth of five per cent by 2020—this is the largest reduction in growth of any region in Australia. The state government will need to find an additional $50 million in 2012-13 to fund the higher energy costs used in delivering services and more than half of Western Australia's households will be worse off under a carbon tax.


The National Farmers Federation, who are opposed to the carbon tax on the basis that it erodes the competitiveness of the agricultural industry in domestic and international markets, have estimated that the average Australian farmer will incur an additional $1,500 a year in costs under a carbon price of $23 per tonne with fuel excluded. That will erode their net farm income by 2.4 per cent. As a former farmer, I can assure you that farming incomes cannot stand up to that for very long—and of course as each year goes by, the cost of the carbon tax will go up. If the effect of the tax on transport costs is also taken into account, the impact is even higher. The NFF estimates that the average grain farmer in Western Australia will incur an additional $16,389 a year in costs, equivalent to a reduction in income of 6.5 per cent—that is adding the fuel on. 


There is a lot of misinformation around relating to fuel and trucks. Trucks under 4½ tonnes are exempt from fuel tax, but once they go over that they are not. In Western Australian now, there are very few farm trucks, I think, apart from fire trucks, under 4½ tonnes and most of them have very large equipment. Road trains are now becoming part of the farming scene because with their equipment—the headers and the chaser bins—farmers can now take off grain faster than they used to be able to. The storage capacity therefore needs to be a lot greater. So there is the cost of fuel for all these trucks, and then there is the cost of electricity. The cost of diesel, especially when we get up into the Kimberley on the cattle stations, which have already had a huge hit with the live cattle export issue, is going to cause more problems as well. 


Heading into 2012 and subsequent seasons farmers will face not only the ongoing challenge of variable prices, costs and seasons but also the consequences of the carbon pricing mechanism. Under the CPM Australia's 500 or so biggest emitters will have to pay for their emissions. The emissions price, as we have said, will be $23 a tonne of CO2 starting on 1 July 2012, increasing by 2.5 per cent in real terms per year until 2015, when a market based floating price commences. Directly affected businesses will investigate the feasibility of limiting their emissions. Some businesses will simply pay for their emissions and mostly pass on those payments to their consumers, while others will, in combination with restricting emissions and passing on costs, have to purchase credits, known as offsets. 


The export oriented nature of the mixed enterprise farm businesses in WA causes those businesses to have a limited ability to pass on any additional indirect costs to their predominantly overseas customers. With no price cushioning, farmers will simply bear the additional small increases in indirect costs, leading to an erosion of their profit margins. Depending on what economists call the incidence of the tax on inputs affected by the CPM, for example electricity, a range of farm overhead and variable cost items may slightly increase. The end result is a possible reduction of around six per cent in the profit for a typical broadacre mixed enterprise farm business in WA. As I said, this reduction might seem minor to some people but I can assure the Senate that it is not a minor matter. 


Also we have the impact on mining. The Minerals Council of WA considers that the carbon tax will erode the competitiveness of Australia's export and import competing sectors without any environmental benefit. The Minerals Council estimates that the minerals industry will face costs of $25 billion between 2012 and 2020 under the carbon tax package and believes that the decision to include emissions from coal mines is unique. These emissions are exempted under the European Union emissions trading scheme. Certainly as far as the export trade goes it is open slather and we have to cop this extra tax. 


The Australian Tourism Export Council considers that the carbon price mechanism will impact significantly on the tourism industry, at a time when the high Australian dollar and declining domestic tourism are impacting on the sector. These businesses face electricity increases of about 30 per cent and there will be a significant impact on operators reliant on diesel or aviation fuel, who will face a reduction in their fuel tax credit of 18 per cent. The Managing Director of the Australian Tourism Export Council, Felicia Mariani, noted:


The bottom line is that the Government has left the tourism industry high and dry, providing little or no direct support or capacity for businesses to transition to a low carbon economy, or any compensation for the tour operators who are going to be hit hard by the increase in fuel costs. 


Economic modelling commissioned by state governments examined regional impacts of the carbon tax. Such detail was not included in the federal Treasury's modelling. The Western Australian Treasury's 'preliminary assessment' of the clean energy package examined the impact on the Western Australian economy, the budget position and households. 


Some of the key projected outcomes for Western Australia are: a 0.7 per cent projected increase in the consumer price index in the Commonwealth Treasury modelling which translates to an additional $50 million in additional costs in 2012-13 for state government agencies, growing to around $60 million by 2014-15; a combined impact estimated to be between $230 million and $280 million per year for state-owned electricity generation assets; and around 419,000 households in Western Australia out of a total of 810,500 households where the average cost of living impact of the carbon tax is greater than the Australian government assistance for the carbon tax.


The coalition will repeal the carbon tax legislation. The next election will be a referendum on the carbon tax. The 72 Labor MPs have betrayed their communities by voting for the carbon tax in the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister and the Labor government had no mandate for this legislation. The coalition will continue to fight the carbon tax. We will give the community a say on the issue that they were denied at the last election. If elected, the repeal of the legislation will be the coalition's first order of business. If Labor attempts to block the scrapping of the carbon tax, we will go to a double dissolution election. It will be a major attack on democracy if Labor then again rejects the voices of the Australian people. Australians are already facing substantial cost-of-living pressures and the carbon tax will only add to these pressures while doing nothing to reduce Australia's emissions. The coalition believes this carbon tax is absolutely the worst thing for Australia.

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:44):  It is to the great shame of the Australian Labor Party that tonight I have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and 17 related bills. The fact that I along with other senators have that opportunity is an affront to the Australian people, who went to the polls last August secure in the knowledge that whether they voted for the ALP or the coalition they were not voting for a carbon tax. This is because the leaders of both had categorically denied that such a tax would be introduced under them in government. Prime Minister Gillard went so far as to say, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Yet here we are today witnessing a government that is led by Prime Minister Gillard seeking to have a carbon tax passed into law—a flip-flop most magnificent in its enormity and sinister in its deceit. A full 149 of the 150 members of the other place were elected under the policy of no carbon tax. A clear majority of this place were either elected or fought the last election under the policy of no carbon tax. Eighty-five to 90 per cent of voters Australia-wide cast their votes for candidates running under the policy of no carbon tax. Yet here we are debating just such a tax, with each and every government senator lining up to vote for a tax that they and their leader categorically ruled out just days prior to the last election. 


Australian voters have a right to feel cynical about politics and those who practice the art. This is a clear case of politicians saying one thing to get elected and then doing something totally different once they have control of the treasury bench. The government's actions sully the reputation of all politicians and undermine the respect that Australians should feel for our democratic process. The government's only defence to this obvious and blatant deception implemented against the Australian people is that circumstances changed. Maybe they did, but not in any way that was not totally predictable prior to the election. 


At the time that the Prime Minister made her solemn promise to the people of Australia that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads, it was entirely predictable that the circumstances the Prime Minister and the ALP faced after the election would eventuate. Indeed, it was in just such circumstances that the Leader of the Opposition challenged her to rule out a carbon tax, a challenge that she took up and met by ruling out such a tax under a government she leads. So it is a bit rich for Labor senators to suggest in this place that the circumstances the ALP faced after the election were somehow so different that they required a breach of the solemn promise that they made to the Australian people. The fact is they were exactly the circumstances in which that promise was made. 


The government claim that they had to breach their promise to the Australian people because things changed. But the only thing that changed were the numbers—they no longer had them and they wanted them. As a result, this Labor government proved itself willing to do anything to secure the numbers it needed to hang on to power after the election and entered into an unholy alliance with the far left Greens. They would not have had that opportunity had the Prime Minister not promised to not introduce a carbon tax. That promise made by the Prime Minister had a huge impact on an undecided voting public in August of last year, a public that clearly did not want a carbon tax. Without that promise, the Prime Minister would not have had to do unholy deals with the Greens or the Independents because the ALP would not have won the seats it did and Australians would not now be facing the likelihood of a tax on carbon. There is no doubt that the promise made by the Prime Minister on the eve of the election saved her seats because voters across Australia took her, the Treasurer and other Labor cabinet members, and in fact all Labor members and candidates at their word that they would not introduce a carbon tax. This is what saved them from being a one-term government. It saved them seats and given the way the numbers fell, that saved the Prime Minister's government. 


What do the people of Australia feel about this? There is no doubt that they are angry, very angry. They feel betrayed, hoodwinked and duped by a dishonest leader of a dishonest party. At every level, Australians who voted Labor on the basis of the promise cannot wait to exercise their democratic right to change their mind and are clamouring for a new election to set things right. As I travel around my home state of Tasmania, the feeling is palpable. At shows and rural fairs, people literally line up to sign a petition against the government's toxic carbon tax. Young people go seeking out their friends so that they can bring them back to sign the petition. It is a far cry from the situation in Tasmania before the last election when many Tasmanians wanted to give the government the benefit of the doubt and give them another term. They felt comfortable in doing so, at least in part because of the promise made by Labor not to introduce a carbon tax. I doubt that so many of them would feel as comfortable with that decision now. 


I have focused on the broken promise because this is crucial to any consideration of these bills, as the presentation of these bills in this place is a repudiation of democratic process and a representation of all that is wrong with politics in this country. Incidentally, earlier in this debate I heard government senators interjecting about core and non-core promises. I respond to those interjections because, just like accusations about Prime Minister Howard's GST, the raising of these issues is calculated to obfuscate the issue through misrepre­sentation of situations that are entirely different, so much so that comparing them is deliberately deceptive. After the 1996 election, the new coalition government found that the previous Keating Labor government had misled the public about the state of the public finances. The fiscal position was nowhere near as rosy as the then Labor government had represented prior to the 1996 election, so much so that many of the promises made by the coalition in the lead-up based on their understanding of the amount of money available simply were not possible to deliver.


Debate interrupted.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (17:34):  It seems quite a long time since the moving of the adjournment last night. I had expected to be completing this speech on these so-called clean energy bills somewhat earlier today, but there we are. When the adjournment was moved last night one of the issues I was discussing in relation to these bills and my shadow responsibilities was the impact on housing in Australia that will occur after the implementation of this legislation. I was speaking last night about the increases that will result, particularly in rents, as investors in new houses are forced to pass on the costs of servicing those larger mortgages to their tenants.


When you increase the cost of building new homes you inevitably also slow the growth in new housing stock and push up the price of existing homes. We already have a shortage of rental properties, so an increasing shortage of rental properties will only see more low-income earners and more welfare recipients pushed into what is often known as marginal housing. A number of senators in the chamber are familiar with the issues around homelessness. I am not sure that I understand a policy that is ultimately going to exacerbate social problems such as this. It seems to me to be ill conceived. Equally perversely, the additional costs of new housing construction are going to punish those who want to build a house, as modern, newly constructed houses have the highest levels of energy efficiency and therefore the lowest contributions to carbon emissions of Australia's housing stock. It will deter the construction of new, more energy efficient housing, and this is at a time when Australia already has a chronic national housing shortage, which stands at 202,400 as of June 2010 and is expected to exceed 300,000 by 2014. I would really like to have more current, more up-to-date, figures but for reasons known only to members of the government the National Housing Supply Council was not reappointed for an extended period after the last election. In fact, it was in limbo for months and months, notwithstanding the fact that the relevant aspects of the red book for that portfolio indicated that it was a priority action. So we are awaiting a State of supply report which will show Australians and, more particularly, investors what the state of shortage is. In ignoring the important issue of the national housing shortage—and it is extremely frustrating in the estimates process to seek answers as to when we will see a new State of supply report—the government also ignores the fact that the implementation of the carbon tax as it is constructed under this legislation will only exacerbate the problem, and that is a matter of great concern to members of the coalition.


We think, as members of the Liberal and National parties, that there is another way to go about this, and numbers of my colleagues have spoken about that previously. Overwhelmingly, Australians want to see something done about climate change and want to see Australia doing its part. Rather than using the blunt object of carbon pricing, the coalition's plan is to address climate change and to reach its five per cent emissions reduction target by 2020 by positive, direct action.




Senator Chris Evans:
  Oh, come on. Put your heart into it.




Senator PAYNE:
  Well, Senator Evans, I can certainly assist with that. I could in fact bring some light-heartedness to the chamber if this were not so serious. What we see, particularly in New South Wales—and I do not know if other senators are experiencing it as well—is what could only be described as hysterical misinformation spread by members of the government about the coalition's position on these issues.


It is the stuff of politics that ministers visit electorates and shadow ministers visit electorates—it is the toing and froing of the political process; we are all used to it—and a couple of months ago I was very pleased to welcome the shadow minister for health and ageing, the Hon. Peter Dutton, from the other place, to the federal electorate of Lindsay in Western Sydney to meet with senior staff and officials from Nepean Hospital. Nepean Hospital is a very important tertiary hospital in Western Sydney. It serves, as I am sure you would be aware, Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, a very important part of the Western Sydney community, not just around Penrith but also in the lower mountains and further afield.


Mr Dutton's visit to Nepean Hospital had us contemplating the impact of a carbon tax on a hospital like that, and the end result of that contemplation and our discussions on that day indicated that they would be facing an increased electricity cost of approximately $300,000 a year with no compensation, as the Energy Users Association assessments indicate. Not unreasonably, Mr Dutton and I raised this issue in the local community. We raised it through the local media and asked the local member, Mr Bradbury, what he thought about this potentially increased cost of $300,000 and how a hospital like Nepean Hospital, already stretched to the limit but doing an exceptional job at all levels of its operations, was going to deal with an extra $300,000 in electricity costs. I thought it was probably quite a reasonable question. It is his local hospital, they were keen to know how we thought they should deal with it and I was keen to know how he, as a member of the government, thought it should be dealt with.


As I indicated in my previous remarks, there is absolutely no contention on the part of the coalition that nothing should be done in relation to climate change. That is a fallacy. It is an untruth and it is something that we will contest when that point is raised at every opportunity because we have a policy in relation to direct action. So when I asked the local member in Lindsay what his response was to this potentially increased cost for Nepean Hospital it seemed strange to me that he chose not to answer that question but rather to issue a press statement which said that failing to act on climate change will come at a great cost to the health system over time. No-one is arguing that we should fail to act—nobody at all in this particular discussion—but he went on to say:


Without taking action, Australia is expected to experience higher rates of infectious and vector-borne diseases as well as food and waterborne diseases.


If that is not hysterical scaremongering, it is hard to imagine what might fall into the category of hysterical scaremongering. One expects that the vector-borne, and certainly the waterborne, diseases are going to head down the Nepean River to the weir in Penrith and infect the local community if we are not addressing climate change.


I reiterate the point that nobody is suggesting that climate change should not be addressed, but the contention of the opposition is that this is not the way to do it, that this would be a cost on all Australians—a cost on business, on families and on individuals, and one which they should not be expected to meet by a government that did not tell them the truth before the last federal election. The price of addressing climate change should not be lower standards of living and it should not be the exporting of the problem, along with Australian jobs, as I indicated yesterday.


In relation to what the impact will be on housing, in particular, I have indicated that the Housing Industry Association, for example, estimates an increased cost of $5,000 for the construction of a house. Any realistic person in this place, in this chamber or the other one, will know that in the community $5,000 extra is a deal breaker. Five thousand dollars extra on your budget when you are counting every single cent to build your new home is literally a deal breaker. Why should Australian families who want to look after their children and support themselves by building their own home—realising what is often cliched but is in fact very important: the great Australian dream of owning their own home—be faced with that impost because this government refuses to consider other options? We say that it is an unreasonable approach, that it is not an approach we will support and that in fact it is legislation we will oppose and repeal if we are elected to government at the next election.

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:43):  I rise to acknowledge what a sad week this is for democracy and for those who have elected us to represent them as we debate the introduction of the clean energy package of bills, which we know is a fancy name for a carbon tax. It is a debate that the Prime Minister pledged to the people of Australia before the last election that we were not going to have, a carbon tax that we were not going to have. We all remember her solemn pledge only six days before the last election that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. Because she broke that pledge, today we are debating just that: a carbon tax that every Labor senator on the other side of this chamber should be ashamed of. To those on the other side I say: where is your integrity? Stand up for your principles, honour your word to your constituents and listen to what Australians are telling you—not the small minority represented by the Greens, with whom you are in formal alliance, but the majority of everyday Australians, hardworking families, individuals and businesses across the country who do not want a carbon tax.


Whilst I am on the subject of those on the other side of this chamber, I find it passing curious that senators from Queensland, Western Australia and my home state of Victoria have been missing in action this week during this debate. Where are they? What is their position? And why are they not standing up for the workers and families in each of their states? We have not heard from Victorian senators arguing for this toxic carbon tax. And why is that? It is a really good question. It is because they know that this tax is going to kill the manufacturing industry in Victoria. It is going to plunder it in a state where 50,000 jobs are in the manufacturing industry. It is an absolute disgrace.


Prime Minister Gillard made a solemn pledge on behalf of her government to the people of Australia. We now know that her vow—her commitment—was nothing more than empty words and at best an immoral pledge to the nation. We now know that the words of the Prime Minister are meaningless. Australians question everything she says today. If there are any senators opposite who have any real integrity, they will honour that pledge and cross the floor to vote with us on this side. They will choose to honour their government's pre-election pledge and maintain their faith with their electorates. They will support minimising the cost-of-living pressure and will secure and support a manufacturing industry in challenging times rather than threatening jobs.


I received a letter on 17 October—very recently—from the Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group, Ms Heather Ridout. This letter urged me to amend the carbon tax as it was 'a flawed approach to cutting greenhouse gas emissions'. If Ms Ridout wants this Labor legislation to be amended, then we know it surely must not be good for this country. In fact, we know this tax will be lethal to the manufacturing industry in Victoria. I say to Ms Ridout today that the coalition hears you. The coalition will do more than amend the carbon tax; we will repeal the carbon tax. Unlike those opposite, we will not break this promise. This is our covenant with the people of Australia, and we will stand by that covenant.


The government's abject failure, incompetence and dysfunction since the last election has been incomprehensible. The next election will not only be a referendum on the Labor government's policies; it will also be a referendum on this carbon tax. The fact that this government thinks it can effectively implement this vast structural economy-wide tax in Australia beggars belief. Why do I say that? You only have to look back over the last few months and the litany of disasters we have seen this government preside over.


Only this week we saw the government's tardy and incompetent response to the Qantas crisis. To those who are listening to this broadcast today, I remind you of the extraordinary cost blow-outs of the NBN, the $50 billion plus program that commenced without a business plan. I remind you of the BER, with billions spent on school halls without any consideration being given to seeking value for money. And kids are still waiting for their own personal computer through the computers in schools program. And let us not forget GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch and cash for clunkers. The list goes on and on. They are all government policies that have been poorly conceived and that in some cases have been knee-jerk reactions, such as the live cattle export debacle that cost businesses and Australia millions of dollars in lost contracts. And let us not forget the $900 stimulus package cheques under former Prime Minister Rudd—not so long ago—which supposedly saved us from the GFC.


How, then, can the people of Australia trust this government, who now supposedly want to save the planet, to be fiscally responsible with a new tax? How can we trust them with the biggest structural change, the biggest tax, we have seen when they cannot even manage the installation of pink batts in roofs? This government—with its political partner, the Greens—arrogantly claims that it can and will save the planet. What hubris and hypocrisy. If the government is so keen to cut emissions and save the planet, it should start by curbing Mr Rudd's travel and consequent carbon emissions. Maybe they could even use a commercial airline instead of chartering a 737 for one person.


The litany of failure continues with the GP superclinics promised across the nation, which are yet to be delivered. And we have witnessed a rolling immigration crisis that continues today. These are all disasters of the government's own making. We know the Prime Minister has lost control of our borders. She has certainly lost control of the national agenda, because the Greens are actually running that agenda. More importantly for her, she has to spend a lot of time checking behind her back due to the internal division that is racking the Labor Party, the caucus and even her own cabinet, if the reports we have heard of recent cabinet leaks are true. In this climate of absolute mayhem, the government is hell-bent on ensuring that Australia is the first and only nation that will have introduced a carbon tax by the time she and her deputy, the Leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown, pack their bags for the climate change conference in Durban. Not one of the world's developed economies has implemented a carbon tax—not Canada, which voted against it; not New Zealand, which axed the tax; and not the US, which has completely removed it from its policy agenda. And those on the other side of the chamber accuse us of being oppositional in defending the livelihoods and wellbeing of businesses and families. There is one thing that is certain about this sad state of affairs and that is that an Abbott government will repeal this carbon tax.


In my patron seats in Victoria, every day I hear firsthand accounts of the devastating impact that a carbon tax will have on them. Only in August this year I hosted the shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, in the electorates of Deakin and Chisholm, two of my patron seats in Victoria. I went, where the member for Deakin, Mike Symon, and the member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, dare not go—that is, to visit small businesses. As is the case with most SMEs in these electorates, the small businesses that we visited will be negatively affected by the Gillard government's toxic carbon tax.


We visited Daisy Garden Supplies in Ringwood East and Electric Cable Duct Systems in Box Hill South. I asked them: what would the imposition of a carbon tax mean for a small family business like yours? I stress: these people have mortgaged their homes to establish small businesses and have built them up over a long period in the hope that their families will take over when the fathers, uncles or brothers actually retire. Neil Mulcahy is the owner-operator of Daisy Garden Supplies. He has done an amazing job of building up this small business. He now employs no fewer than 60 people. That is not just 60 individuals; that is 60 families who benefit from the employment provided by Mr Mulcahy and his successful local business. It has taken Mr Mulcahy 31 years to build and develop his business. He is clearly a significant contributor in that area and to the community.


During our visit, Mr Mulcahy and his wife told me that his current monthly fuel bill was a staggering $100,000. Daisy Garden Supplies has about 60 trucks on the road, which deliver across the length and breadth of Victoria and beyond. Mr Mulcahy believes that the imposition of this government's toxic carbon tax will impact on his business dramatically. Whilst I was there with the shadow Treasurer, we also talked about the Australian Trucking Association's estimates, which he supports, because he has a number of his own trucks and is a big user of the industry. The Australian Trucking Association estimates that a carbon tax on them will cost their industry and their customers $510 million in 2014-15 alone. That is half a billion dollars in one financial year.


Mr Mulcahy's electricity bills and machinery bills will go up and the member for Deakin, Mike Symon, says that this is okay. Mr Symon, by his inaction on advocating for local small business, such as Daisy Garden Supplies, is essentially saying that he does not care about the effect of this toxic carbon tax on small business. He has been missing in action in Deakin. I have not seen him holding carbon tax forums across his electorate. The people of Deakin have not heard from him on this matter. I would go as far as to say that, by virtue of the absence of him saying anything on this issue, he has to be a strong and devout supporter of this toxic carbon tax.


But, above all, what his inaction demon­strates, which is even more compelling, is that he does not understand small business and how it operates. I guess we should not be surprised, given that he is yet another member with a union movement back­ground. But it is very tragic for the people of Deakin that he has not been able to learn on the job and understand how these businesses operate since becoming the member for Deakin. One can only describe the Mike Symons of this world as gutless in their position on this matter. Before the last election he was a sitting member of the government, the same government that pledged that there would be no carbon tax. Now he stands by Prime Minister Gillard when she visits the electorate of Deakin, advocating and prosecuting the case for why a carbon tax should be introduced. For people like Mr Mulcahy at Daisy Garden Supplies there is not a dollar of compensation. There is no assistance, there is nothing—zip.


Daisy Garden Supplies is a classic small to medium sized family business and Mr Mulcahy will have to wear the cost or pass it on to his customers. It is abundantly clear that, for many of these businesses, passing the cost on to the customers is not an option because their profit margin is so slim. This will have huge ramifications on his capacity to employ 60 individuals and it may well have huge ramifications on the families of those 60 people.


In the electorate of Chisholm we met the owners of Electric Cable Ducting Systems. The member for Chisholm, Anna Burke, has some serious questions to answer—as does Mike Symon, the member for Deakin— which, I think, demand some urgent answers. Whilst the member for Chisholm has recently been very outspoken on the Prime Minister's Malaysia solution and has been very strident in her opposition to offshore processing, in particular to the Malaysia solution, she has been absolutely mute on the issue of a carbon tax and she has been mute in defending the interests of those in her electorate. Electric Cable Duct Systems, ECD, began as a small family business operating out of a shopfront, with a workshop at the back, in 1979. ECD is now an Australia-wide leader in electrical cable management. Thirty-two years on this family company, ECD, have outlets in New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland, the Northern Territory, the ACT and New Zealand. Under a carbon tax the cost of aluminium, which is the main material that ECD uses to assemble their products, will significantly rise.


The world's largest aluminium company, RUSAL, recently launched a scathing attack on the Gillard government's carbon tax. It was reported online at news.com that in a submission to the federal government RUSAL said the clean energy legislative package, the carbon tax and emissions trading scheme, was a threat 'to the viability of the Russian group's major investment in Australia.' RUSAL owns 20 per cent of the giant Queensland Alumina refinery at Gladstone, the second largest alumina refinery in the world, which employs 1,800 people. The estimated cost of a carbon tax to this industry was in the order of $30 million to $40 million in the first year of the tax, and nearly $400 million over the next 10 years.


There is a very consistent theme if you go out there and talk to businesses, people who are actually creating jobs and wealth, which is that this toxic carbon tax is going to kill their businesses. My office was recently in contact with three families in Victoria who, on the government's own figures, will be worse off under the carbon tax. Each of these families entered their details into the household assistance estimator on the government's clean energy future website. I must point out that these families are operating on the assumption that the estimator is accurate. With good reason, the families who have contacted my office doubt the accuracy of the calculations and believe that they will in fact be worse off than what is estimated on this website.


Kathleen and Chris were one of those couples. They are young, married and have two kids. Kathleen worked for the first 12 months of their marriage before becoming pregnant and giving birth to their first son. Chris works in the finance industry and has received promotions in the time that Kathleen has remained at home, although he is the sole income earner. According to the government's own estimator, under the carbon tax they will be worse off. I have pages of examples of people who have contacted my office in the electorate of Deakin who have all expressed their concerns about that website. It confirms to them that they are going to be much worse off under this carbon tax.


In essence, what does it mean for these families? It means an additional financial burden and it means that businesses will be challenged in continuing to provide the employment levels they currently do. But what for? Why are we dealing with this now? Why is it so incredibly necessary for Australia to be the only nation to introduce an economy-wide carbon tax when all other countries have turned their back on it. As we know, and we have heard it this morning, it is because Bob Brown, the Leader of the Greens, who sits over there on the government side, wants to go to Durban with a carbon tax under his arm.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (18:03):  As I stand here in the chamber tonight and look down at the list of bills being considered together, there is a temptation to go through each of the bills, to talk about each of the schedules, to examine the purpose of the carbon tax, to look at the efficacy of the mechanism, to look at the compensation arrangements and to look at all of the consequential provisions of other pieces of legislation. That is a temptation, but I think to do so would be a mistake because the real significance of the debate we are having here today is not actually the provisions contained in the bills. The real subject matter of the debate is that of deceit. It is that of a government that went to the last election with the solemn pledge that it would not introduce a carbon tax. The exact phraseology used by the Prime Minister was:


There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.


She was echoed in that sentiment by the Treasurer, who referred to the hysteria that people who believed that a Labor govern­ment could possibly introduce a carbon tax were expressing. Anyone who had the temerity to doubt the statement of the Prime Minister that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led was basically branded an hysterical. The Australian people took the word of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in good faith. They cast their ballots, whether it was for the government or the coalition parties or for another party, in the sure and certain knowledge that if Labor re-formed government they would not introduce a carbon tax. We know all too well and all too clearly that what the Prime Minister said before the last election represents perhaps the most blatant, clear and unequivocal lie in recent Australian political history. That is why I say that it would be a mistake in this debate to focus on the provisions of the bills. That is what the government would like us to do, and indeed that is what many government senators are doing: looking at the actual provisions of the bills. But to do so obscures the very reason that we are here in the first place: because those opposite are seeking to give effect to a fundamental breach of promise.


I do, however, at the outset, want to focus a little bit on my home state of Victoria. My state of Victoria will be hit first and it will be hit hardest by the carbon tax. The reason for that is Victoria has a great comparative advantage: it has access to a cheap energy supply; it has access to cheap brown coal. It has been the underpinning of Victorian industry. It has been the underpinning of the success of many Victorian businesses that they can access such a cheap and constant power supply.


Another reason I contend that Victoria will be hit first and hardest by a carbon tax is the importance of manufacturing to the Victorian economy. A few kilometres from my electorate office in Mentone is the centre of Dandenong. Dandenong is at the heart of the manufacturing precinct of Victoria. Something in the order of 44 per cent of Victoria's manufacturing output comes from the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, particularly based around Dandenong and Dandenong South. I have visited many manufacturers over the last several months. I have visited quite a few of them with Ms Mirabella, from the other place, the shadow minister for industry. I visited many of them with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott. And the story at each and every manufacturer is the same: the carbon tax will be bad for business.


I had the great pleasure a couple of months back of going to the annual general meeting of the South East Melbourne Manufacturers Association in Dandenong. There would have been 300 manufacturers there. The reasons I went along were twofold. Firstly, I like spending time with manufacturers, I like hearing about their business success stories and I like hearing about the people they employ. But the other reason I went along to the annual general meeting of the South East Melbourne Manufacturers Association was the guest speaker at that meeting, who was Mr Mark Dreyfus QC, the member for Isaacs and the parliamentary secretary for the carbon tax. I have to hand it to Mr Dreyfus. He did have a fair bit of front. He addressed these 300 manufacturers on the topic of the carbon tax and 'why it is good for your business'. That was an audacious thing to do, but clearly he has the strength of his convictions. So Mr Dreyfus was standing there, addressing 300 manufacturers on the subject of the carbon tax and 'why it is good for your business'. When it came time for questions, one manufacturer stood up and said, 'Mr Dreyfus: the electricity bill for our business is $120,000 a year and it is going to go up by 10 per cent.' Mr Dreyfus listened to that. Another manufacturer stood up and said, 'Mr Dreyfus, I can top that: our power bill is going to increase under a carbon tax by $130,000 a year'—an electricity bill increase of $130,000 a year! Mr Dreyfus's response to that was words to the effect of, 'Well, I think that just goes to prove my point that the effect of a carbon tax will be modest.' Another manufacturer got to his feet and said, 'Mr Dreyfus, we're in the medical devices business. One of our leading products costs $1,500 a year to produce. We have a margin on that product of $5, and the carbon tax is going to wipe that margin off.' The response of Mr Dreyfus to that manufacturer was, 'Well, I think what that tells us is that your business has other problems, doesn't it?' The arrogance, the condescension, the lack of understanding of what it actually takes to build a business, to invest your capital, to take a risk, to employ people—no understanding at all. The best that I can say of Mr Dreyfus in that circumstance was that at least he had the guts to front up, but I have to say he was on a hiding to nothing—and quite rightly so.


I have been spending a fair bit of time in my part of Melbourne. On Saturday mornings I like to get out, visit a shopping centre, set up a card table, put up a few banners—the wording on them, you may be interested, Madam Acting Deputy President, says, 'Say no: stop Labor's carbon tax', in lovely bright yellow letters on a crisp black background. I am usually flanked by two of those. And with some friends I collect petitions against the carbon tax. I have to say that I have been bowled over by the rush of people saying, 'Where do I sign? Where's a pen? Let me put my name down. How do I get rid of this government? Come on you guys, what are you doing? Can't you get rid of this government? How do we stop this carbon tax?' It has happened time and again. I set up my card table with my friends in the shopping centre of Berwick, in the seat of Ms Laura Smyth, the member for La Trobe. I have to say I was bowled over with people saying, 'Where do I sign? How do I stop this tax? How do we get rid of this government?' On another Saturday morning I set up my card table in Mordialloc, in front of the Safeways, in the electorate of Mr Mark Dreyfus QC, the local member for the seat of Isaacs. And again the same thing: bowled over by people saying, 'Where can I sign? How do we stop this government? How do we get rid of this carbon tax?'


On another Saturday morning I set up my card table at Dingley Village shops in the electorate of Mr Simon Crean, the electorate of Hotham. The same thing happened there with people saying: 'Give me a pen. Where do I sign? How do we get rid of this government? How do we stop this tax?' On another Saturday morning at the Cranbourne shops I set up my card table in the electorate of Mr Anthony Byrne, the member for Holt. The same thing happened again with people saying: 'Where do I sign? How do we stop this government? How do we stop this tax?' It was the same thing over and over again.


The reason there was that passion and the reason we obtained literally thousands of signatures from people was that these people felt like they had been gypped, if I can use that technical term. They know they were lied to. They know they were fibbed to. They know they were sold a bill of goods. They know they were told, 'There will not be a carbon tax.' They feel ripped off. They are not happy about it and they should not be happy about it because there should be a fundamental bond of trust between the electors and the elected. This government has broken that fundamental bond of trust and the Australian people are not happy about it.


Madam Acting Deputy President, I know you are interested in what I do with my Saturday mornings and you are probably also interested in what I do with my Friday nights. On the night that Her Majesty had a reception here in the Great Hall, I could not attend. I conveyed my apologies because I had a prior engagement. That prior engagement was in a hall in the suburb of Cheltenham in the south-east suburbs of Melbourne. Coincidentally, it happens to be in the electorate of Mr Mark Dreyfus QC, member for Isaacs and parliamentary secretary for the carbon tax. The occasion was a rally against the carbon tax and we had 90 or 100 people there. I do want to tell you in my own words what occurred there but I can do better than that—I can quote the words of Mr Dreyfus who obviously felt very strongly about the event because he wrote an opinion piece for Fairfax. I will just share a little bit of it with you. It is headed 'Baillieu government joining Abbott's circus.' It starts:


The Tony Abbott circus of lies and misinformation about climate change and the carbon price came to my electorate, Isaacs in Melbourne, last week. And this time the state Baillieu government joined the show, with no less than six state MPs lining up to deceive and alarm the residents and business people of southern suburban Cheltenham.


Quite frankly, I think it is good to see state MPs working on a Friday night. It continues:


On stage before a not-so-large crowd of about 90—


Not-so-large crowd of about 90! I think 90 people on a Friday night about a public policy issue is not bad. You have got to be pretty arrogant as a local member to discourage 90 of your constituents who are gathering on a Friday night. Anyway, Mr Dreyfus says:


On stage before a not-so-large crowd of about 90 were Liberal federal frontbenchers Andrew Robb and Senator Mathias Cormann (who came all the way from WA to recite his slogans), state Energy Minister Michael O'Brien, and ringmaster Senator Mitch Fifield. In the audience were state Liberal MPs Inga Peulich, Murray Thompson, Lorraine Wreford, Donna Bauer and Elisabeth Miller. That's nine Liberal MPs in attendance at the circus!


I actually think it is a good thing that you have got nine members of parliament out there meeting their constituents, talking to them and listening to them. That is not something to be disparaged. It is a good thing to have members of parliament out and about and to have their constituents there engaging with them. That is a good thing. Mr Dreyfus continues:


The performers – Robb, Cormann, O'Brien and Fifield spouted the usual Liberal false claims.


I have got a little bit of advice for Mr Dreyfus: if one of your political opponents has got under your skin do not let them know, do not write an opinion piece for the paper and just pretend it is water off a duck's back. Anyway, I am grateful to him for putting pen to paper. It has given a lot of encouragement to many to continue the fight.


My point is that Labor are out of touch. They still do not understand that you cannot fib and you cannot lie to the Australian people and expect them to say: 'That is okay. No worries. Think nothing of it.' That fundamental bond of trust, which I spoke of before, between the electors and the elected has been broken. It is bad enough that that has been broken. It is bad enough that this government did not do the decent thing and take the carbon tax to the last election. But we do not expect much better from the Australian Labor Party. It is bad enough that they did that. I am tempted to say almost worse but it cannot be worse than that, because nothing can be worse than lying to the Australian people. You would have thought, having lied to the Australian people, that to try and reclaim a bit of dignity and to try and reclaim a bit of decency you would ensure that there was a decent parliamentary process—that there was proper scrutiny in this place.


We know the analogy that many on this side have cited before of the goods and services tax and the new tax system. There were five months of parliamentary inquiry and countless Senate committees meeting concurrently to examine that important legislation. This package of legislation, which is before us here, will have a much greater effect, and not for the good of the Australian people. It would be an understatement to say it was disappointing that only two weeks were provided for the Australian Senate to look at this legislation: this week, which is apparently meant to be for all the second reading speeches, and next week for the committee stage. It is bad enough that a motion was put through this place to bring a guillotine into effect to terminate the second reading stage at 3.45 pm on Thursday of next week. It is bad enough that the guillotine was to be put into effect to terminate all stages of the bill, regardless of where we are at, and bring the matter to a conclusion at the end of Thursday next week. That was bad enough, but we have the incredible situation today where that is going to change. Tomorrow the government, with the connivance of the Greens, is going to seek to bring this package of bills to a conclusion by 11 o'clock next Tuesday. This is in stark contrast to the words of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, who said in his press release of 21 September that the Senate would have more than two full weeks to debate the clean energy package of bills. That is not true; that is a fib. The Senate will not have two full weeks; the Senate will not even have a week and a half. The guillotine is being brought forward. What we are talking about here is a gag on a gag. This is shameless, having a gag on a gag. We were promised that there would be two full weeks of debate. We do not think that is enough. Personally, I think there should have been about five months of appropriate examination.


But the ultimate deceit was Senator Evans's press release today, which is about putting a gag on a gag, headed 'Extended sitting hours for Senate to pass clean energy package'. Talk about doublethink—extended sitting hours. No, the government are not extending sitting hours, they are putting a gag on a gag. They are bringing a guillotine forward from a Thursday to a Tuesday. That is not extending hours, that is truncating hours, that is curtailing debate. It is an outrage. Compounding the fact that this government lied to the electorate at the last election, compounding the fact that they have not provided proper parliamentary scrutiny, what they are now doing is truncating the limited parliamentary scrutiny that is available. This is appalling. This bill should be opposed. This legislation should be opposed.

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator ADAMS
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:24):  I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related bills. To continue in Senator Fifield's vein, I too was very surprised when I sat down at my desk and found 'Labor and Greens shut down carbon tax debate'. Once again we are really being truncated, I guess you could say, and it looks as though 12 of our coalition senators who are very keen to participate in this debate will miss out. Where is this government going? The government refused to give the community a say on the carbon tax at the last election by promising not to introduce it. Once more the government is shutting down the debate. The government is desperate to ram through this legislation because it knows that it is electorally unpopular, as Senator Fifield just explained. I can certainly give many examples in Western Australia at the local shows where we had exactly the same reaction. I have never before had a petition that I have not had to ask people to sign, but they have come and asked me whether they can sign it, where do they sign it, what do they do and how do they go about it.


We have not even debated these hours but obviously it is a fait accompli. They want to limit the debate because the more the carbon tax is debated and more people understand how it will impact on their lives, the more they want to get rid of it. Instead of ramming the carbon tax through the Senate, the Prime Minister should take the bills to an election as a matter of urgency and decency. The coalition will make the next election a referendum on the carbon tax. If elected, the coalition will introduce legislation to repeal the tax as the first order of business. I am sure all those listening are fully aware of what the coalition government intends to do if they are successful in being elected at the next election. We will have a contract with the community to honour the mandate to scrap the tax as a priority, and we expect Labor to respect the mandate.


The tax is first and foremost an electricity tax, which is why it will not work. After $105 billion of taxes Australian firms, and through them the consumer, will still have to buy almost 100 million tonnes of foreign carbon credits at a cost of $3.5 billion a year by 2020. This is absolutely ridiculous and we are determined to ease the cost-of-living pressures on Australians and ensure that they will be better off under a coalition government rather than under Labor's carbon tax that will not even reduce Australia's emissions.


I will go back to my description of how all of this came about. If the Gillard government had been honest with the Australian people before the last election, we would not be here today debating these bills in their present form. The government was elected on a mandate of no carbon tax, and six days after the newly constituted Gillard-Brown government the carbon tax, funnily enough, reappeared. As the Australian people had not been consulted regarding the carbon tax, it was proposed to hold a community forum with 150 appointed delegates. These delegates were supposedly to advise the government on how to deal with the carbon tax. Of course, the forum did not eventuate and instead the government formed a new committee and held an inquiry into Australia's clean energy future. This inquiry had no terms of reference, which meant that all submissions were relevant to the inquiry. Of the 4,500 submissions that were received, it was interesting to note that only 70, two per cent, were published on the website and protected by parliamentary privilege. This means that the Gillard-Brown government listened to two per cent of Australians who had put forward submissions but the other 98 per cent have not been heard or were completely denied a voice. Is this representative of a democratic country? I think not. 


This inquiry has been a farce and without the Gillard-Brown government releasing its modelling it means little to the Australian people. Without seeking the permission of the Australian community at either an election or a referendum, the government is taking billions of dollars out of our economy and giving it to foreign interests. At the same time it has ignored landowners' rights and has turned a blind eye while some of our best agricultural land is turned into a worthless landscape. It seems the Australian people have lost their basic right to democracy through this suite of bills. They have been misled by the Prime Minister's latest $25 million carbon tax advertising campaign. This advertising implies that the carbon tax will help clean up Australia's emissions profile. The shadow minister for climate action, environment and heritage, the Hon. Greg Hunt, said:


Under Treasury modelling, Australia’s emissions will actually increase from 578 to 621 million tonnes between now and 2020. The fact that the tax will raise $105 billion is not disclosed in the advertisements let alone the fact that emissions will go up.


There is no mention of the fact that in addition to the Carbon Tax, Australians will be sending $3.5 billion overseas each year from 2020 to buy foreign carbon credits. This fundamental plan is not raised anywhere in the advertising.


The entire system is based on the assumption that the United States will have a full national Carbon Tax or cap and trade system by 2016. This is both undisclosed in the advertising and utterly fanciful.


If this was a commercial advertisement, the ACCC in all likelihood would pull the Carbon Tax campaign from the air for being false and misleading.


It is interesting to look at the international perspective on clean energy and carbon tax policies. The United Kingdom climate change policy was recently reversed. They have radically reduced their commitment to cut emissions. George Osborne, a UK MP, said:


The United Kingdom will cut carbon emissions no slower but also no faster than our fellow countries in Europe.


The UK was committed to cutting emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. Europe is only committed to cutting emissions by 20 per cent by 2050. Mr Osborne continued:


We're not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business—


I wish this government would think the same way—


Britain makes up less than 2% of the world's carbon emissions compared to China and America's 40%. The renewables sector will never be a strong enough engine of recovery for the British economy.


Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, John Baird, in Perth for CHOGM, confirmed that Canada will not be introducing a carbon price. Clearly the Canadians have realised that such a scheme, which fails to reduce emissions and is a huge cost to the economy, is not the most effective way of addressing climate change. When they went to their last election, the government won in a landslide because they declared they would not introduce a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. Canada's rejection of a carbon model follows the United States, Japan and Korea distancing themselves from imposing similar policies. 


The implications of this for Australia are significant as the government's modelling is predicated on there being an agreement between the major economies on an international carbon trading scheme. The failure of such an agreement will result in increased costs for Australian households and leave Australian businesses unfairly penalised compared to their international competitors. The carbon pricing mechanism is set at $23 a tonne. The carbon pricing scheme in Australia, a country which accounts for 1.4 per cent of global emissions, is going to generate more tax revenue in three months than the European scheme has in more than six years—and Europe accounts for 14 per cent of global emissions. How ridiculous is that?


As a Western Australian senator, I am deeply concerned about the impact of the proposed legislation on my home state, especially about the impact on rural areas. Despite not being in the top 500 big polluters and not being directly subject to the carbon tax, farmers face additional costs from the clean energy bills. These costs are estimated by the National Farmers Federation to be in the order of $16,000 per year for Western Australian grain growers. Tourism operators face 30 per cent higher energy costs, this coming at a time when the sector is struggling with a high Australian dollar and declining domestic tourism. Although the mining sector is expected to continue to grow under a carbon tax, conservative estimates for 2020-21 of employment forgone in existing coalmines due to emissions pricing are around 4,700 jobs in coalmines and 14,100 jobs in the Australian economy. More detailed modelling of the carbon tax by state governments shows that Western Australia will be significantly affected. The Kimberley will experience a reduction in output growth of five per cent by 2020—this is the largest reduction in growth of any region in Australia. The state government will need to find an additional $50 million in 2012-13 to fund the higher energy costs used in delivering services and more than half of Western Australia's households will be worse off under a carbon tax.


The National Farmers Federation, who are opposed to the carbon tax on the basis that it erodes the competitiveness of the agricultural industry in domestic and international markets, have estimated that the average Australian farmer will incur an additional $1,500 a year in costs under a carbon price of $23 per tonne with fuel excluded. That will erode their net farm income by 2.4 per cent. As a former farmer, I can assure you that farming incomes cannot stand up to that for very long—and of course as each year goes by, the cost of the carbon tax will go up. If the effect of the tax on transport costs is also taken into account, the impact is even higher. The NFF estimates that the average grain farmer in Western Australia will incur an additional $16,389 a year in costs, equivalent to a reduction in income of 6.5 per cent—that is adding the fuel on. 


There is a lot of misinformation around relating to fuel and trucks. Trucks under 4½ tonnes are exempt from fuel tax, but once they go over that they are not. In Western Australian now, there are very few farm trucks, I think, apart from fire trucks, under 4½ tonnes and most of them have very large equipment. Road trains are now becoming part of the farming scene because with their equipment—the headers and the chaser bins—farmers can now take off grain faster than they used to be able to. The storage capacity therefore needs to be a lot greater. So there is the cost of fuel for all these trucks, and then there is the cost of electricity. The cost of diesel, especially when we get up into the Kimberley on the cattle stations, which have already had a huge hit with the live cattle export issue, is going to cause more problems as well. 


Heading into 2012 and subsequent seasons farmers will face not only the ongoing challenge of variable prices, costs and seasons but also the consequences of the carbon pricing mechanism. Under the CPM Australia's 500 or so biggest emitters will have to pay for their emissions. The emissions price, as we have said, will be $23 a tonne of CO2 starting on 1 July 2012, increasing by 2.5 per cent in real terms per year until 2015, when a market based floating price commences. Directly affected businesses will investigate the feasibility of limiting their emissions. Some businesses will simply pay for their emissions and mostly pass on those payments to their consumers, while others will, in combination with restricting emissions and passing on costs, have to purchase credits, known as offsets. 


The export oriented nature of the mixed enterprise farm businesses in WA causes those businesses to have a limited ability to pass on any additional indirect costs to their predominantly overseas customers. With no price cushioning, farmers will simply bear the additional small increases in indirect costs, leading to an erosion of their profit margins. Depending on what economists call the incidence of the tax on inputs affected by the CPM, for example electricity, a range of farm overhead and variable cost items may slightly increase. The end result is a possible reduction of around six per cent in the profit for a typical broadacre mixed enterprise farm business in WA. As I said, this reduction might seem minor to some people but I can assure the Senate that it is not a minor matter. 


Also we have the impact on mining. The Minerals Council of WA considers that the carbon tax will erode the competitiveness of Australia's export and import competing sectors without any environmental benefit. The Minerals Council estimates that the minerals industry will face costs of $25 billion between 2012 and 2020 under the carbon tax package and believes that the decision to include emissions from coal mines is unique. These emissions are exempted under the European Union emissions trading scheme. Certainly as far as the export trade goes it is open slather and we have to cop this extra tax. 


The Australian Tourism Export Council considers that the carbon price mechanism will impact significantly on the tourism industry, at a time when the high Australian dollar and declining domestic tourism are impacting on the sector. These businesses face electricity increases of about 30 per cent and there will be a significant impact on operators reliant on diesel or aviation fuel, who will face a reduction in their fuel tax credit of 18 per cent. The Managing Director of the Australian Tourism Export Council, Felicia Mariani, noted:


The bottom line is that the Government has left the tourism industry high and dry, providing little or no direct support or capacity for businesses to transition to a low carbon economy, or any compensation for the tour operators who are going to be hit hard by the increase in fuel costs. 


Economic modelling commissioned by state governments examined regional impacts of the carbon tax. Such detail was not included in the federal Treasury's modelling. The Western Australian Treasury's 'preliminary assessment' of the clean energy package examined the impact on the Western Australian economy, the budget position and households. 


Some of the key projected outcomes for Western Australia are: a 0.7 per cent projected increase in the consumer price index in the Commonwealth Treasury modelling which translates to an additional $50 million in additional costs in 2012-13 for state government agencies, growing to around $60 million by 2014-15; a combined impact estimated to be between $230 million and $280 million per year for state-owned electricity generation assets; and around 419,000 households in Western Australia out of a total of 810,500 households where the average cost of living impact of the carbon tax is greater than the Australian government assistance for the carbon tax.


The coalition will repeal the carbon tax legislation. The next election will be a referendum on the carbon tax. The 72 Labor MPs have betrayed their communities by voting for the carbon tax in the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister and the Labor government had no mandate for this legislation. The coalition will continue to fight the carbon tax. We will give the community a say on the issue that they were denied at the last election. If elected, the repeal of the legislation will be the coalition's first order of business. If Labor attempts to block the scrapping of the carbon tax, we will go to a double dissolution election. It will be a major attack on democracy if Labor then again rejects the voices of the Australian people. Australians are already facing substantial cost-of-living pressures and the carbon tax will only add to these pressures while doing nothing to reduce Australia's emissions. The coalition believes this carbon tax is absolutely the worst thing for Australia.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2011-11-02,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:44):  It is to the great shame of the Australian Labor Party that tonight I have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and 17 related bills. The fact that I along with other senators have that opportunity is an affront to the Australian people, who went to the polls last August secure in the knowledge that whether they voted for the ALP or the coalition they were not voting for a carbon tax. This is because the leaders of both had categorically denied that such a tax would be introduced under them in government. Prime Minister Gillard went so far as to say, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Yet here we are today witnessing a government that is led by Prime Minister Gillard seeking to have a carbon tax passed into law—a flip-flop most magnificent in its enormity and sinister in its deceit. A full 149 of the 150 members of the other place were elected under the policy of no carbon tax. A clear majority of this place were either elected or fought the last election under the policy of no carbon tax. Eighty-five to 90 per cent of voters Australia-wide cast their votes for candidates running under the policy of no carbon tax. Yet here we are debating just such a tax, with each and every government senator lining up to vote for a tax that they and their leader categorically ruled out just days prior to the last election. 


Australian voters have a right to feel cynical about politics and those who practice the art. This is a clear case of politicians saying one thing to get elected and then doing something totally different once they have control of the treasury bench. The government's actions sully the reputation of all politicians and undermine the respect that Australians should feel for our democratic process. The government's only defence to this obvious and blatant deception implemented against the Australian people is that circumstances changed. Maybe they did, but not in any way that was not totally predictable prior to the election. 


At the time that the Prime Minister made her solemn promise to the people of Australia that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads, it was entirely predictable that the circumstances the Prime Minister and the ALP faced after the election would eventuate. Indeed, it was in just such circumstances that the Leader of the Opposition challenged her to rule out a carbon tax, a challenge that she took up and met by ruling out such a tax under a government she leads. So it is a bit rich for Labor senators to suggest in this place that the circumstances the ALP faced after the election were somehow so different that they required a breach of the solemn promise that they made to the Australian people. The fact is they were exactly the circumstances in which that promise was made. 


The government claim that they had to breach their promise to the Australian people because things changed. But the only thing that changed were the numbers—they no longer had them and they wanted them. As a result, this Labor government proved itself willing to do anything to secure the numbers it needed to hang on to power after the election and entered into an unholy alliance with the far left Greens. They would not have had that opportunity had the Prime Minister not promised to not introduce a carbon tax. That promise made by the Prime Minister had a huge impact on an undecided voting public in August of last year, a public that clearly did not want a carbon tax. Without that promise, the Prime Minister would not have had to do unholy deals with the Greens or the Independents because the ALP would not have won the seats it did and Australians would not now be facing the likelihood of a tax on carbon. There is no doubt that the promise made by the Prime Minister on the eve of the election saved her seats because voters across Australia took her, the Treasurer and other Labor cabinet members, and in fact all Labor members and candidates at their word that they would not introduce a carbon tax. This is what saved them from being a one-term government. It saved them seats and given the way the numbers fell, that saved the Prime Minister's government. 


What do the people of Australia feel about this? There is no doubt that they are angry, very angry. They feel betrayed, hoodwinked and duped by a dishonest leader of a dishonest party. At every level, Australians who voted Labor on the basis of the promise cannot wait to exercise their democratic right to change their mind and are clamouring for a new election to set things right. As I travel around my home state of Tasmania, the feeling is palpable. At shows and rural fairs, people literally line up to sign a petition against the government's toxic carbon tax. Young people go seeking out their friends so that they can bring them back to sign the petition. It is a far cry from the situation in Tasmania before the last election when many Tasmanians wanted to give the government the benefit of the doubt and give them another term. They felt comfortable in doing so, at least in part because of the promise made by Labor not to introduce a carbon tax. I doubt that so many of them would feel as comfortable with that decision now. 


I have focused on the broken promise because this is crucial to any consideration of these bills, as the presentation of these bills in this place is a repudiation of democratic process and a representation of all that is wrong with politics in this country. Incidentally, earlier in this debate I heard government senators interjecting about core and non-core promises. I respond to those interjections because, just like accusations about Prime Minister Howard's GST, the raising of these issues is calculated to obfuscate the issue through misrepre­sentation of situations that are entirely different, so much so that comparing them is deliberately deceptive. After the 1996 election, the new coalition government found that the previous Keating Labor government had misled the public about the state of the public finances. The fiscal position was nowhere near as rosy as the then Labor government had represented prior to the 1996 election, so much so that many of the promises made by the coalition in the lead-up based on their understanding of the amount of money available simply were not possible to deliver.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (18:50):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


It is now widely known that the former Commonwealth Ombudsman, Mr Allan Asher, in whose name most of these reports under section 486O of the Migration Act stand, developed serious concerns about the resources available to his office to investigate such matters. I note with particular interest the Ombudsman's assessment and recommendations in report 643/11 of 5 September 2011, paragraphs 25 to 31; report 652/11 of 5 September 2011; and, report 654/11 dated 20 September 2011. I have no concerns about a statutory office holder making such matters public. I have no concerns about a statutory office holder questioning or criticising government policy, and I have no concerns about a statutory office holder mounting a robust case for greater resources. I have seen suggestions that the government found Mr Asher's criticisms in his role as Immigration Ombudsman unacceptable. For the record, I could not care less about Mr Asher or any other Commonwealth Ombudsman high­lighting matters that might make a minister uncomfortable or embarrass the government of the day. I am one who will defend the right of any Ombudsman to report on their concerns with absolute frankness, in unvarnished truth, however disturbing such views may be to a government or any office holder in government. But I also believe the public and the parliament are entitled to expect the highest standards of behaviour from the Ombudsman and his office.


When Mr Asher appeared at Senate estimates two weeks ago, I asked him questions about his role in writing questions and providing them to a senator for the budget estimates round this year. I asked Mr Asher:


Do you think that an integrity agency such as the Ombudsman should set an example, should have the highest standards in government?


Mr Asher responded:


Yes, it should.


I then asked:


Have you met those highest standards?


Mr Asher:


I think this was clearly an error in judgment. It was clearly a mistake.


It is important for us to acknowledge that Mr Asher said to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee that he considered his actions to be an error of judgment and a mistake. He apologised to the committee and said it would never happen again. As I am sure all senators are aware, Mr Asher has since resigned—a decision he made and a course of action he was not questioned about. Nor was it suggested to him at Senate estimates. It was not suggested that might be an appropriate course of action. It is my intention to address some important issues surrounding these events when further opportunities allow in the Senate's very full program. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (19:20):  Firstly, Mr Deputy President, thank you for your assistance this evening; I do appreciate it. 


The date of 28 October was officially recognised as 'Day for Daniel'. Most of us in the Australian community have heard of Daniel Morcombe and the loss, horror and grief that his family suffered, which became public knowledge over the last years since Daniel did not come home when he went shopping on Sunday, 7 December 2003. No-one knew what happened to Daniel, but we found out in the last couple of months that he will never be coming home. So when we gathered on 28 October at his local area of Woombye, in the beautiful Sunshine Coast, there was a very special feel about this year's walk for Daniel. 


I have been fortunate enough to attend a number of these with many people who have gathered together in that region. One way that the family of Bruce and Denise Morcombe have chosen to ensure that Daniel's memory is kept alive is to ensure that we have a regular commemoration about the need to keep child safety on the agenda. They have generously opened up their hearts and their lives to so many of us so that we can have this focus, so that we can remember their son and so that we can be aware of the need for immediate action across our community to ensure that all children are safe.


When we gathered this year there was a special poignancy because we knew that police action was underway because Daniel would not be returning. Over 2,000 people gathered at the area to take part in the walk for Daniel. There was a sea of red; it has now become the signature colour for this campaign. Not only in Nambour and the Woombye area, which is Daniel's local home, but across Australia, this process of remembrance and hope is being carried out each year on 28 October. Mr Deputy President, you know that in this place tomorrow we are having our own Day for Daniel. The family has accepted that, because of the vagaries of our sitting pattern, this was the nearest day we could do it. We are hoping that parliamentarians, staff members and visitors to this place will be wearing red tomorrow to maintain this vigil, this acceptance and also this message to the whole community that child safety must be an absolute priority. Somehow in the Senate it really works because we have a room of red to remember Daniel tomorrow.


We need to ensure that the wonderful work that the family has started is maintained. After Daniel's disappearance, Bruce and Denise Morcombe established the Daniel Morcombe Foundation, with two objectives: to educate children regarding their personal safety so that they know what is safe and they take their own personal control, and to assist victims of crime, particularly where it involves children. The foundation was established partly to keep Daniel's memory alive but also to have this ongoing awareness program to stop such events ever affecting any other families or communities.


Since Daniel's disappearance, the foundation has introduced many programs to help children everywhere and to keep this issue of child safety at the forefront of our minds. Some of the achievements of the foundation to date, apart from the way that it has drawn people together—and that is one of the most encouraging signs, that people know the story, they want to be involved and our memories are twigged when this happens—are more concrete, such as a DVD which has been made for distribution to schools to teach children about their personal safety and so that they see it as part of their daily lives. So far over 13,000 DVDs have been distributed through Australia, and these can be readily obtained by going onto the website.


Also working with the wonderful University of the Sunshine Coast and the Queensland Police Service, there has been developed an internet safety program called Being Safety Smart, with a comprehensive 'feeling safe' animated interactive program, which is due to be released late this year or early next year. Also there has been a pledge by the foundation of over $125,000 to support young victims of crime. The Daniel Morcombe Foundation is working with the Queensland government to develop a Daniel Morcombe Child Safety Program, which will become a core component of the Queensland school curriculum.


The Queensland government announced in conjunction with Bruce and Denise Morcombe a package that funded a paid ambassadorial role for Mr and Mrs Morcombe to deliver a child safety package or message using Daniel's story as a core theme in schools. I know that we said last Friday at the walk that the family has already begun visiting schools all across Queensland. Having the parents come and sit down with the school community and tell their story, tell the fact that a young man, 12 years old, could leave his home on a quiet afternoon and never come home has a special impact, and it also makes sure that children get the message that they need to be in control of their own safety.


There is also the development of a child safety package targeted at prep to year 9, the core years of youth, for inclusion in our school curriculum, and the state support and promotion of additional fundraising activities for the Daniel Morcombe Foundation, such as the Day for Daniel. Although many communities have already taken up the challenge to have their own remembrances and their own sea of red to remember Daniel, we expect that this will widen and that, when people become aware of the issues, they will want to take part, and there will be some support from the Queensland government for that.


The Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, who was there with us on Friday walking and dressed in red stated that she intended to lobby for the child safety package to become part of the national curriculum, because this message does not stop at state boundaries. We need to ensure that the issues of child safety are clearly there for everybody. As Denise Morcombe said on Friday, this year's walk was particularly poignant in that everyone now knew that Daniel would not be coming home, but his message remains real for all of us.


The matter of Daniel's disappearance and the charge is now before the courts, so we cannot talk about that. We also need to remember that the court process must proceed and the individual who has been charged has not been found guilty. So I think there is another message there for people who have been talking openly about this process: there has been no conviction. It is important to put that on record.


What happened to Daniel and his family was a real tragedy. However, out of that has grown a community response and a recognition that what happened should not have happened. We will probably never know exactly what happened to Daniel Morcombe on that afternoon, but what has happened since then is that families across Queensland have begun to talk about the issues of child safety in their family homes and most particularly in the school community, where kids have the chance to ask questions, to talk to their school counsellors, to talk to their parents and teachers and to ask questions about how they can make themselves safe and what the danger signals are.


One of the wonderful things has been the proactive, positive role of the Queensland police force. There has been a longstanding process in Queensland schools of Adopt a Cop schools, and that has been working with mixed results but mainly very positively. When we were there on Friday walking down the beautiful hill in that area around Woombye, many police were gathered. There was wonderful, positive interaction between the people who were doing the walk and the police who were maintaining vigilance. In that area we do have some speeding issues, so when we see police on that road we might not always be so excited to see them!


Nonetheless, on Friday we saw young people waving and calling out to the local police by name. They felt that safety and security. One of the core messages that has come out of this whole process has been the wonderful personal engagement of individual Queensland police and the whole structure of the Queensland police led by the Queensland Police Commissioner, who was there with us again on Friday to say that the police are there to provide safety and advice, realistically for everyone to know that if they are in trouble, if there is fear, they can turn to their local police person, regaining that trust and ensuring that that message is clear.


Tomorrow in this place I expect that we will see lots of red, and that is important. But we now need to have this entrenched in our parliamentary calendar, and I know that will happen, so that we expect on the sitting day closest to 28 October that there will be an established Day for Daniel in this place. The community expects that we as their representatives will maintain the message of child safety. We will do everything we can within legislation at both the Commonwealth and the state level—and these Days for Daniel are being celebrated and acknowledged in state parliaments as well. We can provide the legislative basis to ensure that there are laws around the protection of children and effective policing. We need to lead by example to show that we care for our community and we care for our families, and we will share with the Morcombe family their remembrance of their son Daniel.
