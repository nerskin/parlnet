Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:32):  AUSTRAC oversees the compliance of Australian businesses defined as 'reporting entities' under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988. The legislation requires reporting entities to implement programs for identifying and monitoring customers and for managing the risks of money laundering and terrorism financing; report suspicious matters, threshold transactions and international funds transfer instructions; and submit an annual compliance report.


In its intelligence role, AUSTRAC provides financial information to state, territory and Australian law enforcement, security and revenue agencies and certain international counterpart agencies. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011 seeks to: (1) give effect to the 2010-11 budget announcement that AUSTRAC would recover the costs of its supervisory activities from 1 July 2011; (2) allow the minister for justice to determine by legislative instrument the amount of levy payable by a leviable entity in any given financial year; (3) provide for the collection of the levy imposed by the levy bill and related administrative matters, such as issuing notice of assessments and late payment penalties; (4) provide the AUSTRAC CEO with the power to waive part or whole of the levy or late payment penalty; and (5) amend the Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorism Financing Act to make it mandatory for reporting entities to enrol with AUSTRAC within 28 days of providing or commencing to provide a designated service.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee conducted and inquiry into the bills and reported yesterday. I note that my colleague Senator Guy Barnett, the ranking Liberal senator on the committee, is in the chamber, and I expect that he will have a word to say on this matter in a moment. Liberal senators, under the able leadership of Senator Guy Barnett, noted the concerns raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in its Alert Digest No. 5 of 2011. In that digest, the scrutiny committee drew attention to the potential for AUSTRAC to overcollect its regulatory costs. The coalition considers that this situation should be closely monitored. Liberal senators take the view that the current safeguard that has been proposed by the government of reviewing the calculation methodology after five years is inadequate because a five-year review period is too long—at least in the initial stages of the new scheme.


Liberal senators note that the first year in which the levy will be collected is the 2011-12 financial year. Given that the bills are therefore due to commence on 1 July 2011, the Liberal senators were concerned to ensure that adequate consultation and education has preceded the measure. This is what concerns the coalition: the rushed process and lack of proper consultation behind the introduction of these bills, particularly where there is additional red tape and expense for business as a result of them. That is a matter for which we hold the government responsible.


The committee heard concerns that the levy will place Australia and its financial institutions at a substantial competitive disadvantage. Citigroup's submission to the committee complained:


The levy will have unintended consequences in relation to Australia's ability to compete in the Asia-Pacific region given the additional significant costs that the levy will impose on Australian financial institutions. We recommend that the composition of the levy be re-assessed to ensure a more equitable distribution reflective of the designated services that AUSTRAC monitors and supervises.


The government's rationale for basing the large entity component of the levy on the earnings of the entity or group is that AUSTRAC incurs greater expenses in regulating larger entities because larger entities have more customers and usually provide more complex products. However, this calculation does not take into account the extent to which a leviable entity's earnings are related to the provision of designated service.


Under the formula prescribed by the bills, an entity with high earnings may incur a large entity component even though the entity only provides a small volume of designated services. There therefore exists the potential that the levy may have a disproportionate effect on those large entities which only provide designated services as an incidental part of their business. The Australian Bankers' Association Director, Tony Burke, said the government's clear objective was to recover costs rather than to provide any benefit to those subject to the regulation. He said:


As the paper currently stands, the potential cost of compliance would be high.


Charge-backs to internal groups and agencies would add significant overheads in tracking costs and reconciling payments.


The Institute of Chartered Accountants Executive General Manager, Lee White, told the Australian newspaper on 17 January this year that members already incurred signifi­cant costs in supporting AUSTRAC's regulatory aims and it was unreasonable to ask them to bear more. He said:


Our members provide legitimate services to clients who overwhelmingly are law-abiding individuals and businesses.


If these legitimate services are exploited by criminals, it is these wrong-doers who create the need for regulation and who should contribute to the costs through the confiscated proceeds of their crimes.


These concerns are, in the coalition's view, legitimate, and accordingly we will closely monitor the effects of the legislation. To alleviate our concerns and to facilitate parlia­mentary oversight of the effects, including the possible unintended conse­quences to which I have adverted, I can foreshadow that the coalition will be moving amendments in the committee stage of the bill. The amend­ments will provide for a review of the operation of the legislation and the levy calculation methodology after two years operation of the regime, particularly having regard to the regulatory and fiscal burden on small business, and a moratorium on late payment penalties for the first six months of the regime's operation to allow for an appropriate transition and for small busin­esses to be properly informed of their obligations.


These two amendments reflect recommendations made by the Liberal senators on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry. The Liberal senators who participated in that inquiry recognised the importance of ensuring that AUSTRAC can continue to provide a regulatory environment that maintains community confidence in financial flows and minimises the risk to business of exploitation for money laundering or terrorism financing. The coalition acknow­ledges the importance of introducing a supervisory levy to enable AUSTRAC to recover the costs of its supervisory activities. For that reason—subject to the reservations that I have expressed, which will find form in our amendments—we support the bill.


Whether the bills will achieve their aims without imposing an unnecessarily heavy regulatory and fiscal burden remains an open question. The opposition's amendments will assist the parliament in making the necessary assessment when the new regime has had two years of operation against which to assess its workability. Subject to those reservations, the coalition supports the bills.

Senator BARNETT,LP,2011-06-21,"



Senator BARNETT
 (Tasmania) (12:40):  I stand on this side of the chamber to associate my remarks with those of our shadow Attorney, Senator Brandis. I refer to the additional comments of the Liberal senators on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, of which I am deputy chair, in the report that was tabled in the Senate yesterday afternoon. It had a range of recommendations in it, but can I say upfront that we are very strongly in support of the bill before us, the Australian Trans­action Reports and Analysis Centre Super­visory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011, though we believe there are areas that have been overlooked and areas for improvement.


It has been noted at Senate estimates and in other places that this country incurs an estimated cost to the community of some $15 billion a year as a result of the social and economic impact of organised crime. The type of measures in this bill will assist the government and our community in combat­ing organised crime, people smuggling and other untoward activities by untoward people and groups. 


It is noted that the government indicates the supervisory levy will collect some $118.3 million over the forward estimates period, which is the four-year period 2011-15. It is also noted that there was a discussion paper and there was consultation with key stakeholders last year, and that was made available for public comment. Senator Brandis referred to some of the feedback from the community, including to our Senate committee inquiry, which had to be short, sharp and to the point. It was advertised on 25 May. We got 12 submissions, considered those and then delivered our report.


I refer specifically to the report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. This Senate is very well served by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. They have made some observations which we Liberal senators picked up in our additional comments. They sought the minister's advice as follows: 


… as to whether consideration has been given to including a safeguard in the legislation to provide that any overcollection will be adjusted.


They indicated that in respect to the retrospective application of the bill that the clear intention of the bill is that the levy imposed may be charged to cover a period that precedes the commencement of the relevant legislation, and they drew that to the Senate's attention. Obviously, when they do that it is very important.


That is one of the reasons one of our amendments ensures there is a proper, full and comprehensive review of how this legislation will roll out in practice. It is all very well to stand here in the Senate or in government and say, 'This is what we want to do.' We know that this will have implications for business right around Australia, not just for the large entities that will be paying the bulk of the charges that are flowing from this legislation but for the small businesses. In that regard, the advice I have received is based on government information that 199 of the large entities will be paying the bulk of the charges, their levy component. They will be paying between $14,000 and $425,000 per entity in the 2011-12 year, according to the summary of charging arrangements set out in the cost recovery impact statement by the government. It also identifies some specific information about AUSTRAC's projected recovery of the levy. It also refers to and identifies 8,500 other entities that will be subject to the base component, remembering there are some 17,000 entities across the country that relate to this legislation. This legislation specifically targets the 199 that will be paying the bulk, those whose turnover is $100 million or over. But the smaller entities, which are small businesses of five to 20 employees—the definition of a small business is one of 20 employees or fewer—will be paying $284 each. That is the base component for the first year of operations in 2011-12.


We are saying that it will have an impact, and not just on the 199 entities who will be paying the bulk. I am very thankful for the information I received through the committee secretariat. I put on the record my thanks to the committee secretary and the wonderful support of the committee. I want to acknowledge Sandra Kennedy for her good work and her assistance in pulling the Liberal senators report together in very quick time; under challenging circumstances she made it happen as swiftly as possible. For that, on behalf of the Liberal senators, I am thankful. The smaller entities, according to that advice, will pay $284 in the first year. We want to know the impact of the costs of compliance and regulation for those smaller businesses. We think that should be reviewed very carefully.


Another thing we have recommended in the report is that there be a proper education and information campaign as soon as possible, remembering that this bill is meant to commence from 1 July. When is that? I will tell you when it is: it is Friday week. We are talking a matter of days. In one week and a couple of days this bill will commence and the relevant entities will be responsible for paying the fees. The government has indicated in this legislation that any fees that are paid late will incur a late payment fee. That is why we have recommended a moratorium on any late payment fees for six months following passage of the legislation. Let us give these businesses a chance to get their heads around and understand how this system is going to work. This is new to them. Yes, there was public consultation last year, but the fact is we are here debating this legislation today, it is going to start Friday week and they are going to have to start paying these levies from that day. That is why we have made a recommendation with regard to a moratorium.


We have also made a recommendation with regard to the urgent need for an education, information and awareness campaign designed to advise affected entities of their new obligations. That should be rolled out immediately. Based on the advice I have received, it is not simply about sending a letter to the 199 major entities. If that is not correct, could the minister please prove me and the coalition wrong. The advice we have is that the smaller entities will be paying $284 a year in the first year, and that is why they need to know. And why should they pay late penalties? Why should small businesses across this country have to suffer those consequences? That is the other thing. We are the party of small business, and that is why we have made that recommendation, No. 2, which says:


Given the unknown impact that the introduction of the levy will have on small and micro businesses, Liberal senators recommend that, in that initial review, the government investigate the impact of the legislation on these businesses and in particular, its effects on the costs to them of complying with regulation and red-tape.


Surely that is fair, reasonable and understandable, and I urge the government to seriously consider that recommendation. We have also had concern expressed in the Scrutiny of Bills report. This is a highly regarded committee in this Senate and in this parliament. It has indicated there are con­cerns regarding overcharging and over­collecting by the government.


All that being said, I want to put on record my thanks for the chairmanship by Senator Trish Crossin of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee during this inquiry. As I said the other day in my valedictory speech—and I want to say it again—it has been an absolute honour and a pleasure to work on the committee, both as chair of the references committee and as deputy chair of the legislation committee. I thank all of the members of that committee, including Senator Crossin for her leadership, cooperation and professionalism in the relationship that we have had over the past few years in those roles. I also want to put on the record my thanks to the secretariat for their good work not only on this matter but on all the other matters over many years. There is professionalism across the board in the Senate committee. The secretariats are wonderful, professional people who do fantastic jobs, under a great deal of pressure with time constraints in challenging circumstances. I have the highest regard for those people and the service that they offer, not just the current members of the various committees but the past members and, no doubt, the future members.


In conclusion, I stand here supporting the coalition and the recommendations that we have made in this report. I hope they are considered positively by the government and I look forward to hearing the government's response. I stand with Senator Brandis in supporting, firstly, the bill and, secondly, the coalition amendments. I thank the Senate.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Trood
):  Senator Xenophon, do you wish to be recognised in this debate?

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-06-21,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:51):  Yes, I do. It is a last-minute addition, Acting Deputy President. I too support the second reading stages of this bill and support the general principles in relation to this bill with respect to Australian transaction reports and dealing with the issue of organised crime. There are costs involved in ensuring that these transactions are tracked and establishing whether there is an organised criminal element to them.


I apologise to my colleagues for the late notice of this. With the volume of legislation, ideally you would like to give more notice to your colleagues, but I can indicate that I will be seeking to move amendments in relation to this to give AUSTRAC increased access to intelligence in order to more easily crack down on money laundering in casinos and other gambling venues. The amendment that I will be moving shortly would require all eligible gambling venues—defined as venues with more than one poker machine—to keep on record the details of any patron who wins more than $1,000 while gambling on a poker machine and for this information to be available to AUSTRAC. Currently there are exemptions for a number of venues. This proposes that there not be exemptions for any venues. Money laundering on poker machines is a serious issue, albeit not one that is particularly well known. I rely on academics who have done research on this issue, in particular Dr Charles Livingstone from Monash University together with a number of his colleagues.


Hotel sources have told the Sydney Morning Herald that nationally $2 billion is laundered through hotel, club and casino poker machines and gambling chips, and as much as 40 per cent of this is in New South Wales alone. That is an extraordinary figure and I believe it ought to be appropriately tested. But that is on the basis of sources to the Sydney Morning Herald. There are also reports that certain venues are known by crime gangs as 'LLs' or 'local laundries'. This is how it works, as I understand it. A player may insert $2,000, $5,000 or even $10,000 into a poker machine and, after playing a handful of lines, decide they want to cash out. They then do so. It is a way of laundering the money. They might spend a few hundred dollars but launder thousands of dollars in the meantime.


This is a huge problem but is one that could easily be fixed if AUSTRAC were able to gather the information it needs to better track the movement of money through casinos, hotels and clubs. There is an old saying that if you want to get to the bottom of a matter you need to 'follow the money'. When it comes to crime gangs laundering an estimated $2 billion a year, according to those media reports, that saying could not be more apt. There is a position at the moment where for certain winnings—in some jurisdictions as low as $1,000—there needs to be a record kept in any event and the winnings need to be paid by cheque. It depends on the jurisdiction. So it would not be onerous for those records to be kept. The fact is, not too many people win big jackpots on poker machines. The house always wins—the venue always wins in the long run, or eventually. So this is a case where it would not be onerous; it would strengthen the purpose of this legislation.


I will address the issue of the coalition's amendments—and I do commend Senator Barnett for the very thorough work that he has done, at breakneck speed given the tight deadlines. People do not appreciate the sort of work the Senate does in Senate com­mittees. Whilst there may be disagreements, there is collegiality and goodwill between senators from different sides of the political fence in getting to the truth of the matter, seeing whether there can be improvements to legislation to sort out unintended conse­quences and the like.


Again, I regret that I have not been able to give earlier notice of this. That is not due to any grand plan; it is just a question of the workload in my office. It would be remiss of me not to raise this issue for this piece of legislation to ensure that they are dealt with appropriately, and I would welcome debate in the committee stage in relation to the amendments that I am foreshadowing. Again, I look forward to further discussion and debate in relation to the coalition's amendments on this bill, but, broadly, I do support the second reading stage of this bill. I believe the legislation is essential but could be improved with the amendment that I have foreshadowed.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Xenophon. It was a late intervention but I think the Senate would like to hear from you more often than not.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (12:57):  In concluding this debate before the Senate I will focus on some of the issues that have been raised specifically by those who have contributed to this debate. 


Firstly, thank you to all those who have contributed to this debate. In relation to the comments by Senator Brandis and also Senator Barnett on the bills through the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report, I can advise that a review of the calculation methodology is planned after five years—or earlier if there are material changes to the AUSTRAC operating environ­ment. However, AUSTRAC will monitor the cost-recovery approach on an ongoing basis.


I would make the general observation—and this is from experience in a number of other areas of financial regulation where levies have applied: insurance, superannuation and, in particular, through ASIC and APRA for companies—that when you apply cost recovery it is always very difficult to satisfy the various entities which are required to pay a levy. Some want to, obviously, pay little or nothing. Whether it is justified or not, some want to shift the levy-paying level from one area to another. That is not an unusual approach. To the best of my recollection, whenever we have been faced with levy bills in this place, there have been relatively common controversies and disputes around who should pay, how much and so on.


The AUSTRAC supervisory level will be set annually. Legislative instruments containing the details of the levy arrangements for the next financial year will be published in draft form after the Australian government budget is released in May and will be issued in a final form prior to the commencement of the financial year. The cost recovery impact statement, or CRIS—another exciting acronym; I quite like that one—will be reviewed over the next 12 months and a new CRIS will be prepared for 1 July 2012. Consistent with the Australian government cost recovery guidelines, a revised CRIS will also be developed should there be any material changes to the cost recovery arrangements. 


In relation to small business—which Senator Barnett is interested in and, obviously, as the Minister for Small Business, is an area that I am interested in—the cost recovery model has been modified in a number of ways to reduce the regulatory impact on small business. As a result, many small businesses regulated by AUSTRAC will not be subject to cost recovery at all.


Let me give some examples of affiliates of a registered remittance network, which in the normal course of events you would expect to pay a levy. Affiliates are excluded on the basis that AUSTRAC's primary regulatory relationship will be with registered remittance networks rather than individual affiliates. This removes a range of small businesses from the operation of the levy—licensed post offices and newsagents, for example. This partly goes to Senator Xenophon's gambling amendment, if I could refer to it. We have reporting entities which have been exempted from part 7 of the AML/CTF Act on the basis that AUSTRAC does not incur substantial costs in regulating these entities. Those entities include small gaming venues with an entitlement to 15 or fewer gaming machines. They are exempt from part 7 of the act and would therefore not be subject to cost recovery.


In terms of our general approach to small business, it is correct, Senator Xenophon, that some gambling venues would not be paying the levy; and obviously we will debate the intent of your amendment when we get to that in the committee stage.  So far as the government is concerned, it would be unreasonable to apply this levy to entities—including post offices, newsagents and gambling entities with fewer than 15 machines—of this size: We see that as inappropriate. This has been our approach to reduce the impact on what we call small business and, indeed, microbusiness.


We are removing from the levy non-employing entities, sole proprietorships and partnerships without employees, and microbusinesses—businesses employing fewer than five people, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. These are removed from the base component of the levy. This means that, of the entities which are subject to the levy, 6,800 are expected to be subject to only the base component of the levy, estimated to be $284 in the first year. I think we have taken a very reasonable approach with respect to small business and microbusiness. 


AUSTRAC will monitor the impact on all businesses subject to the levy. To the extent that changes need to be made to improve the equity or efficiency of the cost recovery model, these considerations will be taken into account through the review process, to which I have already referred.


In terms of consultation on the proposed arrangements, extensive consultation has already occurred with affected stakeholders. I will make a general point. We often hear criticism and concern about lack of consultation. There has been very significant consultation. The bottom line is: some people do not to pay the levy. That is their attitude, but there can be no complaint about lack of consultation on this issue. Some people disagree. I respect them for that, but it is not a matter of lack of consultation. So often people use this line 'lack of consultation' when they do not agree. They should tell us they do not agree and why. There has certainly been significant consultation on this.


In November last year, AUSTRAC released a discussion paper and held three industry forums, in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Through the feedback received, the cost recovery model was further refined, and an exposure draft of a CRIS was released in February this year. In March AUSTRAC undertook further limited consultation on the 'large entity' definition of the model, and on 12 May AUSTRAC published a final CRIS on its website. In addition, a draft of the 2011-12 ministerial determination for cost recovery proposed details to be collected through the enrolment process, and a draft privacy impact assessment in respect of the enrolment obligation was also published for comment. Prior to invoices being issued in the 2011-12 year, a final ministerial determination will be made, and AUSTRAC will communicate with industry about the process and time frames for complying with both the cost recovery and mandatory enrolment processes.


Finally, in relation to late payment fees for the first year, invoices for the 2011-12 financial year are not planned to be issued until February or March 2012. Accordingly, there is no intention to issue late payment penalties in respect of cost recovery within the first three months following the passage of this legislation. 


To conclude, we know that organised crime is a significant national security threat and it is a challenge. Through the Com­monwealth Organised Crime Strategic Framework, the government is ensuring that Commonwealth intelligence, policy, regu­latory and law enforcement agencies are working together to prevent, disrupt, investigate and prosecute organised crime. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, AUSTRAC, plays a very important and critical role in the fight against organised crime. Through its regulatory activities, AUSTRAC helps to mitigate the risk of Australian businesses being used for money laundering, terrorism, finance and other organised crime. This package is necessary to give effect to the 2010 budget commitment. Consistent with the govern­ment's cost recovery guidelines, AUSTRAC will recover the costs of its regulatory activities from 1 July 2011. This cost recovery process is entirely consistent with that of the former government. In fact, to the best of my memory, the former Liberal-National Party government established this cost recovery process. So it has been a consistent approach across a whole range of areas of government.


The collection bill enables AUSTRAC to collect the supervisory cost recovery levy and establish the necessary framework for administering the levy, including matters relating to collection, invoicing and dealing with late payments. It provides that the amount of levy payable for each financial year will be determined by the minister by legislative instrument and cannot exceed a statutory limit of $33 million in total, indexed. The collection bill also introduces a system of administrative review of a decision by the AUSTRAC CEO to waive a levy or late payment penalty. Significant consultation has occurred with industry around the structure of the levy. Through this process the government has listened to the concerns of business and has made significant adjustments to lessen the burden, particularly in the area of small business.


The consequential amendments bill amends the AML/CTF Act to introduce compulsory enrolment for all reporting entities regulated by AUSTRAC. This formalises current arrangements where AUSTRAC encourages entities to volun­tarily enrol. Mandating this requirement will mean that AUSTRAC can better identify its regulated population for the purposes of calculating and applying the AUSTRAC cost recovery levy. The consequential amend­ments bill also amends the current infringement notice scheme to allow the issuing of notices for failure to enrol and failure to appropriately maintain enrolment details. I commend this package to the Senate and I thank all senators for their contributions.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:10): by leave—I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7095, relating to the collection bill; and opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7096, relating to the consequential amendments bill:


 (1)   Clause 2, page 2 (table item 2), omit the table item, substitute:





2. Sections 3 to 8




At the same time as section 3 of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Act 2011 commences.






3. Section 9




At the end of 6 months after section 3 of the Australian Trans­action Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Act 2011 commences.






4. Sections 10 to 16




At the same time as section 3 of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Act 2011 commences.









(1)   Page 3 (after line 5), after clause 3, insert:


4  Review of operation of AUSTRAC cost recovery levy


(1)   The Minister must cause an independent review of the operation of the levy imposed by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Act 2011 to be undertaken as soon as possible after the second anniversary of the commencement of section 3 of that Act.


(2)   The person who undertakes the review must give the Minister a written report of the review within 6 months after the second anniversary of the commencement of section 3 of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Act 2011.


(3)   The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving it.


(4)   A report prepared under subsection (1) must include but is not limited to:


   (a)   a review of the levy calculation methodology;


   (b)   consultation with industry participants including small and micro businesses about the impact of the levy and the costs of complying with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Act 2011;


   (c)   whether the definition of small business that is to be used (of a business employing less than 5 employees) should be amended to the definition of small business currently used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (a business employing less than 20 employees).


In reliance upon the advice of the clerks, the substantive amendment takes the form of an amendment to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011. But, because of the interlinking of the different bills in the suite of legislation, it will give effect to the operation of the scheme established by the principle bill—that is, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Collection) Bill 2011—as we are advised.


The amendment, as I have indicated, which gives effect to the opinion of the Liberal senators in the committee would mandate a statutory review of the operation of the levy and the methodology for the calculation of the levy within two years or as soon as practicable after the second anniversary of the commencement of the legislation. I note the minister's comment that the legislation provides that there may be a review, depending on the circumstances, after five years. There are two reasons why that is not sufficient from the opposition's point of view. First of all, there is no guarantee of a review after five years. The opposition's amendment would mandate that there be a review and so remove any element of contingency. Secondly, for a new scheme—which, as both opposition senators and Senator Xenophon have pointed out, imposes an uncertain but potentially very significant regulatory cost, especially on small business—it is the view of the opposition that five years is way too long for there not to be a review of its operation.


If this were an adjustment of an existing scheme of regulation, that might be fair enough. But as there is no scheme of calculating a levy and compliance with these statutory requirements at the moment, and therefore the way in which it will impact, particularly on small business, is unknow­able. For that reason, we believe having a review after two years is appropriate. Nobody can seriously suggest that the features or characteristics of the operation of this levy will not be able to be ascertained within two years of its operation. Nobody could seriously maintain that, if there are problems experienced in the operation of the levy, particularly in relation to regulatory burden, it should take five years before there is an opportunity to review and correct them. For that reason, as I have said, we favour a mandatory review as soon as practicable after the second anniversary of the com­mencement of the act. As indicated in subsection (4) of our proposed section 4 of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011, the report would review the levy calculation methodology; conduct consul­tation with industry participants, including small and micro businesses, about the impact of the levy and the costs of complying with the levy; and consider whether the definition of small business that is used—that is, of a business employing fewer than five employees—should be amended to agree with the definition of a small business currently used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics: a business with fewer than 20 employees.


As I have said, we support the principle of the legislation and we support the legislation itself, but this is, let me urge the government, a sensible measure. If there is reason for concern about the way in which the collection and the calculation of this levy impinges on small business, it is unthinkable that small businesses so affected should have to wait for five years for a review of its operation. A mandatory levy after two years is the opposition's recommendation to the chamber.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (13:15):  We generally have agree­ment and sympathy with the points you raise, Senator. You might consider and take a moment to discuss the following with your adviser. We can accept the amendments you move, but there is one concern, and that relates to amendment (1)(4)(c) on sheet 7096, which begins 'whether the definition of small business that is to be used'. Our concern is not with the definition as such but with actually putting it in the legislation. I am advised that that will already occur by ministerial determination. To put it in the bill would mean that a range of other changes to the legislation would be necessary. If you do not proceed with that part of your amendment, we are happy to accept all the rest.

Senator BARNETT
 (Tasmania) (13:17):  I thank Senator Sherry and Senator Brandis for that dialogue across the chamber. I am pleased that the minister is willing to accept those amendments put by the coalition.


During his second reading speech, the minister referred to the number of small businesses affected. He said there would be 6,800 entities paying $284 a year in the first year. The advice I have from AUSTRAC is that they have estimated that in that first year there will be 8,512 leviable entities subject to the base component. Clearly there is a difference of 1,712 small business entities between your advice and the advice provided by AUSTRAC. For the record, I think we should get clarity around how many entities are likely to be required to pay that base component.


You suggested that we said there had not been adequate consultation, but we did not say that. I did not say that; I said there had been consultation. What we were supporting in our recommendation was an education and information effort by the government going forward, bearing in mind this is starting on Friday next week, 1 July. I ask the govern­ment to positively consider a proper education campaign going forward. Of course there has been consultation, and there was a discussion paper. I make the point that the cost recovery model did change earlier this year. Here we are in June; it changed in January or February or thereabouts. So you cannot just say that business across the board is totally up to date with exactly where we are. There have been changes along the way. AUSTRAC knows this and the government knows this, and that is why businesses need to be advised of the latest developments and changes and exactly how they will be affected.


The minister also said in his second reading speech that there would be no late payment penalty for the first three months. We recommended that it be extended for at least six months through to the end of this year because the first three months is not adequate—it should be six months.


I thank the minister for agreeing to Senator Brandis's recommendations and the coalition's amendments and look forward to his feedback on the number of entities that will be subject to the base component.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (13:21):  Senator, I have some rough figures, which is the best I can do in the circumstances. Approximately 17,000 businesses are affected by the AML/CTF Act. There are 6,000 small businesses, known as affiliates, that are exempt because of their status as affiliates. They are small businesses and microbusinesses. There are a further 3,000 microbusinesses that are specifically exempt because of their microbusiness status. That gives us a figure of approximately 8,000. I am advised that the number affected on the volume of activity is 8,512. I can only give you approximate numbers other than that last number. If I gave an earlier figure that was incorrect, I stand corrected, but they are the approximate figures and the way in which we reached that total.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:22):  I move the amendment standing in my name on sheet 7079:


(1)   Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 8), after item 1, insert:


   1A  At the end of subsection 43(1)


      Add:


      ; or (c)   in the case of an eligible gaming machine venue—a person cashes in winnings of more than $1,000.


I indicate, as foreshadowed in my second reading contribution, that this is a very important issue. It relates to very serious concerns about money laundering at poker machine venues. I refer to reports in the Sydney Morning Herald that say that nationally $2 billion has been laundered through poker machines and gambling chips at hotels, clubs and casinos—as much as 40 per cent of that amount in New South Wales alone. There are also reports that certain venues are known by crime gangs as LLs, or local laundries. This is an important issue.


The current position is that venues are required by statute to pay certain winnings by cheque— as I understand it, in Victoria it is $1,000—so there is a record or a money trail, if you like. In New South Wales it is $2,000. My understanding is that in South Australia it is in the vicinity of $1,500. I cannot be absolutely certain of that, but it is in that order. The fact is that there are not too many jackpots of more than $1,000 each day at a venue. It is not onerous. It is quite reasonable that these transactions be monitored. If the reports in the Sydney Morning Herald are correct—that we are talking about $2 billion being laundered this way—and we want to tackle the issue of organised crime and money laundering, this amendment should be passed.


I must say that I have had my run-ins—and I will continue to have my run-ins—with the hotel, club and casino industries in this country, but I accept that they would not in any way countenance this sort of behaviour. I urge them to support this measure. I am sure that people such as Anthony Ball, the head of Clubs Australia, would be horrified at any suggestion that there is money laundering occurring at Australian clubs, poker machine venues or, indeed, hotels. That is something that I think they would have genuine concerns about. I think it is important. We have an opportunity to strengthen this legislation. If we did not include these amendments, it would mean a weakened piece of legislation. It would ignore the very significant amounts of money that are being laundered through poker machine venues by virtue of what I indicated earlier: you go in, load up a machine with up to $10,000 in some jurisdictions, play the machine for a while, lose $200 or $300, press the cash-out button and go to the cashier—and at the moment it is not a reportable transaction. To require it to be a reportable transaction would be a very powerful tool in dealing with those organised crime syndicates that use poker machine venues to launder money.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (13:26):  We have only just been presented with this amendment. I accept the time constraints that Senator Xenophon has been working under. Senator Xenophon, I do accept your concern. Whether or not this is an issue to the extent you or some in the media have identified, I simply do not know. I do not have advice on that. I accept the concern that you have expressed about gaming related activities, although I do not necessarily agree with at least some of the points you make. The amendment you are suggesting would have some significance. Our concern is, firstly, whether or not it is a justifiable response, given what we are informed of at this late stage—whether it would be justifiable in the context of the concern you have. It is very, very late to be raising an amendment of this nature.


The objective of the AML/CTF Act relates to the deterrence of money laundering and to hardening reporting entities against terrorism financing. The regulation of gaming venues—of course, we have heard a lot about this in recent times—and their oversight for other purposes is undertaken at a state or territory level. There is a whole set of other proposals and they are controversial, depending on your perspective. All the states and territories other than Tasmania, I am advised, have limits on the amount of cash that can be paid out in winnings from poker machines. The maximum amount that can be paid out is $2,000. Interestingly, my home state of Tasmania bans the use of note acceptors, which means that winnings in that state tend to be lower, because they do not have the facilities of note acceptors—




Senator Xenophon:
  And South Australia.




Senator SHERRY:
  Yes, and South Australia. Under the AML/CTF Act, any payments made by gaming venues which are suspicious give rise to the obligation of the reporting entity to lodge a suspicious matter report with AUSTRAC. In addition, state and territory gaming regulators centrally monitor payouts from gaming machines. So, even if the current arrangements are not sufficient to meet your concerns, Senator Xenophon, you have raised the issue at this late point in time. I understand the constraints you work under. For that reason we are not going to support this amendment. We think it would have significance. For example, you referred to Mr Ball—whom I know—the CEO of the gaming industry, not wanting the sort of behaviour that you and some in the media claim is occurring. I suspect that is indeed the case, but I also suspect that Mr Ball and the club industry would be somewhat surprised to see an amendment of this significance moved to this legislation very late in the day. The government is willing to examine the claims that you make, but we are not willing to support an amendment of this type at this point in time.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-06-21,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:29):  I indicate on behalf of the opposition that our conclusion is similar to the government's conclusion. We of course accept entirely Senator Xenophon's concern, bona fides and deep study of this field. But in the time that has been made available to us—and, as the minister said, this reflects no criticism of Senator Xenophon, who has been operating under a lot of pressure lately and I am well aware of that—we just have not had time to properly assess what would be the consequences for clubs in particular and other venues also, of lowering the threshold of the reporting requirement, in effect, to $1,000. I am instructed that at the moment the threshold is $10,000, and for there to be a tenfold reduction of the threshold would, it seems to me without professing any specialist knowledge of the area, be potentially a highly consequential restraint upon the operation of those businesses. No clear evidence, I am bound to say, has been demonstrated to us that the correct balance between the efficacy of what you are seeking to do and the cost of compliance will be struck by lowering the threshold from $10,000 to $1,000. So the opposition concurs with the government's reluctance to adopt this amendment at this late stage of the debate.


The other point I would make, Senator Xenophon, is that the opposition's amendments mandating a review of the legislation after two years have now been accepted, and that review, although it specifies certain matters which must be undertaken as part of the review, can address other matters as well. If at the time of that review two years hence there is a body of evidence assembled to show that the threshold for the reporting requirements should be lowered to the level you say or to some other lower level than exists currently, then that is a matter that could perhaps be considered by the review. We have had not had time to consider this in detail. I think it is bad legislative practice to adopt an amendment at a late stage simply because it sounds like it might be a good idea and without considering the impact it will have upon those affected by it. For those reasons, and with no disrespect to you, Senator Xenophon, the opposition feels unable to accept this amendment.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:32):  Madam, Acting Chair, somehow I do not think I have the numbers for this amendment! The sheer arithmetic tells me it is the case, but I want to put some things on the record. I do appreciate the way that both the government and the opposition have given this some consideration. It has been at late notice, but I will put this up as a private senator's bill. It is something that is worth investigating.


I want to put on record a couple of things about this issue. The report that was in the Sydney Morning Herald on 21 October 2010 headed 'Dirty laundry' sets out in considerable detail what goes on, according to this investigative report, in the poker machine industry. In response to Senator Sherry's comments, I want to make it clear that I do not say that Anthony Ball, who I have had many dealings with—I think they have been involuntary for both of us, given our debate on the poker machine issue—would necessarily support this move, but I do say that I think I know him well enough to say that he would be horrified to have any organised crime involvement, through money laundering, in the poker machine industry. I say that as a compliment to Mr Ball; I believe he is genuinely concerned about organised criminal elements. It is a positive reflection on Mr Ball, rather than anything else.


Money laundering through poker machines is big business in hotels and clubs. It is a real issue, and what has been described in this investigative piece in the Sydney Morning Herald is that, after they enter a hotel, the launderers do a reconnaissance of the gambling venue to check if there are any prospective muggers. A money belt would be an obvious choice to carry the cash, but they shun those. They wear a jacket rather than carry a bag. Professional launderers are almost exclusively male, and they do this as a full-time job. During the initial visit they will play a small amount of cash through a machine and then reserve it, going back to their car to collect up to $10,000 in $100 notes. They often make several trips to their car to collect more cash and then return to the same machine. Unlike other automated cash machines, such as ticket dispensers, poker machines are not fussy about gamb­lers, who can clean $10,000 in just minutes by feeding $100 notes before the reel starts spinning, just a few seconds apart. The gambler then gets a clean cheque from the hotel, and that is the way that the money laundering takes place.


The report states that as much as $2 million passes through the poker machines in a week at each of the state's top poker machine venues. It produces a net profit of $160,000 a week, or $8.3 million a year. I think they are talking about some specific venues. Money launderers do not even need to play the machines; they just feed in the dirty cash and then press the 'win' button and receive a cheque. Some hoteliers say that some public sector in Sydney are well known to criminals as local laundries. An estimated $2 billion is laundered on an annual basis, and this is a large slice of the $14 billion fed through the nation's poker machines in pubs and clubs each year. This method is favoured because it is a relatively quick and easy way to convert funds, and we need to bear this in mind. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre has been sending out formal questionnaires for months, asking hoteliers to declare who their big winners are, and, as I understand it, they are not happy with the response that they have received. AUSTRAC is working with the Australian Crime Commission, but no hotels or clubs have been prosecuted, despite the fact that there are harsh penalties including jail and fines of $1 million for each offence.


I think money laundering using poker machines is an issue that needs to be dealt with. I appreciate that this amendment was moved at short notice, but there will be a private senator's bill to deal specifically with the issue of money laundering. This is a significant issue. Mr Ball and others can give their evidence, as is appropriate, at such a Senate committee, and I hope that the Senate will not stand in the way of such a bill being considered appropriately. Money laundering using poker machines is the elephant in the room for many in the poker machine industry and is an issue that has not been approp­riately addressed. I am grateful to the investigative journalists who have reported on this issue and grateful to experts such as Dr Charles Livingstone from Monash University, who has raised this issue previously. I would like to think that this parliament will have an opportunity to deal with the issue of money laundering sooner rather than later, and I foreshadow that I will be moving a private senator's bill. I accept that it is lost on this occasion, but, because of the short notice they were given, I criticise neither the government nor the opposition. I hope it is understood that this is an issue that will not go away. I hope that this is considered fully in the coming months.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:32):  AUSTRAC oversees the compliance of Australian businesses defined as 'reporting entities' under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988. The legislation requires reporting entities to implement programs for identifying and monitoring customers and for managing the risks of money laundering and terrorism financing; report suspicious matters, threshold transactions and international funds transfer instructions; and submit an annual compliance report.


In its intelligence role, AUSTRAC provides financial information to state, territory and Australian law enforcement, security and revenue agencies and certain international counterpart agencies. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011 seeks to: (1) give effect to the 2010-11 budget announcement that AUSTRAC would recover the costs of its supervisory activities from 1 July 2011; (2) allow the minister for justice to determine by legislative instrument the amount of levy payable by a leviable entity in any given financial year; (3) provide for the collection of the levy imposed by the levy bill and related administrative matters, such as issuing notice of assessments and late payment penalties; (4) provide the AUSTRAC CEO with the power to waive part or whole of the levy or late payment penalty; and (5) amend the Anti-Money Laundering/Counter-Terrorism Financing Act to make it mandatory for reporting entities to enrol with AUSTRAC within 28 days of providing or commencing to provide a designated service.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee conducted and inquiry into the bills and reported yesterday. I note that my colleague Senator Guy Barnett, the ranking Liberal senator on the committee, is in the chamber, and I expect that he will have a word to say on this matter in a moment. Liberal senators, under the able leadership of Senator Guy Barnett, noted the concerns raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in its Alert Digest No. 5 of 2011. In that digest, the scrutiny committee drew attention to the potential for AUSTRAC to overcollect its regulatory costs. The coalition considers that this situation should be closely monitored. Liberal senators take the view that the current safeguard that has been proposed by the government of reviewing the calculation methodology after five years is inadequate because a five-year review period is too long—at least in the initial stages of the new scheme.


Liberal senators note that the first year in which the levy will be collected is the 2011-12 financial year. Given that the bills are therefore due to commence on 1 July 2011, the Liberal senators were concerned to ensure that adequate consultation and education has preceded the measure. This is what concerns the coalition: the rushed process and lack of proper consultation behind the introduction of these bills, particularly where there is additional red tape and expense for business as a result of them. That is a matter for which we hold the government responsible.


The committee heard concerns that the levy will place Australia and its financial institutions at a substantial competitive disadvantage. Citigroup's submission to the committee complained:


The levy will have unintended consequences in relation to Australia's ability to compete in the Asia-Pacific region given the additional significant costs that the levy will impose on Australian financial institutions. We recommend that the composition of the levy be re-assessed to ensure a more equitable distribution reflective of the designated services that AUSTRAC monitors and supervises.


The government's rationale for basing the large entity component of the levy on the earnings of the entity or group is that AUSTRAC incurs greater expenses in regulating larger entities because larger entities have more customers and usually provide more complex products. However, this calculation does not take into account the extent to which a leviable entity's earnings are related to the provision of designated service.


Under the formula prescribed by the bills, an entity with high earnings may incur a large entity component even though the entity only provides a small volume of designated services. There therefore exists the potential that the levy may have a disproportionate effect on those large entities which only provide designated services as an incidental part of their business. The Australian Bankers' Association Director, Tony Burke, said the government's clear objective was to recover costs rather than to provide any benefit to those subject to the regulation. He said:


As the paper currently stands, the potential cost of compliance would be high.


Charge-backs to internal groups and agencies would add significant overheads in tracking costs and reconciling payments.


The Institute of Chartered Accountants Executive General Manager, Lee White, told the Australian newspaper on 17 January this year that members already incurred signifi­cant costs in supporting AUSTRAC's regulatory aims and it was unreasonable to ask them to bear more. He said:


Our members provide legitimate services to clients who overwhelmingly are law-abiding individuals and businesses.


If these legitimate services are exploited by criminals, it is these wrong-doers who create the need for regulation and who should contribute to the costs through the confiscated proceeds of their crimes.


These concerns are, in the coalition's view, legitimate, and accordingly we will closely monitor the effects of the legislation. To alleviate our concerns and to facilitate parlia­mentary oversight of the effects, including the possible unintended conse­quences to which I have adverted, I can foreshadow that the coalition will be moving amendments in the committee stage of the bill. The amend­ments will provide for a review of the operation of the legislation and the levy calculation methodology after two years operation of the regime, particularly having regard to the regulatory and fiscal burden on small business, and a moratorium on late payment penalties for the first six months of the regime's operation to allow for an appropriate transition and for small busin­esses to be properly informed of their obligations.


These two amendments reflect recommendations made by the Liberal senators on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry. The Liberal senators who participated in that inquiry recognised the importance of ensuring that AUSTRAC can continue to provide a regulatory environment that maintains community confidence in financial flows and minimises the risk to business of exploitation for money laundering or terrorism financing. The coalition acknow­ledges the importance of introducing a supervisory levy to enable AUSTRAC to recover the costs of its supervisory activities. For that reason—subject to the reservations that I have expressed, which will find form in our amendments—we support the bill.


Whether the bills will achieve their aims without imposing an unnecessarily heavy regulatory and fiscal burden remains an open question. The opposition's amendments will assist the parliament in making the necessary assessment when the new regime has had two years of operation against which to assess its workability. Subject to those reservations, the coalition supports the bills.

Senator BARNETT,LP,2011-06-21,"



Senator BARNETT
 (Tasmania) (12:40):  I stand on this side of the chamber to associate my remarks with those of our shadow Attorney, Senator Brandis. I refer to the additional comments of the Liberal senators on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, of which I am deputy chair, in the report that was tabled in the Senate yesterday afternoon. It had a range of recommendations in it, but can I say upfront that we are very strongly in support of the bill before us, the Australian Trans­action Reports and Analysis Centre Super­visory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011, though we believe there are areas that have been overlooked and areas for improvement.


It has been noted at Senate estimates and in other places that this country incurs an estimated cost to the community of some $15 billion a year as a result of the social and economic impact of organised crime. The type of measures in this bill will assist the government and our community in combat­ing organised crime, people smuggling and other untoward activities by untoward people and groups. 


It is noted that the government indicates the supervisory levy will collect some $118.3 million over the forward estimates period, which is the four-year period 2011-15. It is also noted that there was a discussion paper and there was consultation with key stakeholders last year, and that was made available for public comment. Senator Brandis referred to some of the feedback from the community, including to our Senate committee inquiry, which had to be short, sharp and to the point. It was advertised on 25 May. We got 12 submissions, considered those and then delivered our report.


I refer specifically to the report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. This Senate is very well served by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. They have made some observations which we Liberal senators picked up in our additional comments. They sought the minister's advice as follows: 


… as to whether consideration has been given to including a safeguard in the legislation to provide that any overcollection will be adjusted.


They indicated that in respect to the retrospective application of the bill that the clear intention of the bill is that the levy imposed may be charged to cover a period that precedes the commencement of the relevant legislation, and they drew that to the Senate's attention. Obviously, when they do that it is very important.


That is one of the reasons one of our amendments ensures there is a proper, full and comprehensive review of how this legislation will roll out in practice. It is all very well to stand here in the Senate or in government and say, 'This is what we want to do.' We know that this will have implications for business right around Australia, not just for the large entities that will be paying the bulk of the charges that are flowing from this legislation but for the small businesses. In that regard, the advice I have received is based on government information that 199 of the large entities will be paying the bulk of the charges, their levy component. They will be paying between $14,000 and $425,000 per entity in the 2011-12 year, according to the summary of charging arrangements set out in the cost recovery impact statement by the government. It also identifies some specific information about AUSTRAC's projected recovery of the levy. It also refers to and identifies 8,500 other entities that will be subject to the base component, remembering there are some 17,000 entities across the country that relate to this legislation. This legislation specifically targets the 199 that will be paying the bulk, those whose turnover is $100 million or over. But the smaller entities, which are small businesses of five to 20 employees—the definition of a small business is one of 20 employees or fewer—will be paying $284 each. That is the base component for the first year of operations in 2011-12.


We are saying that it will have an impact, and not just on the 199 entities who will be paying the bulk. I am very thankful for the information I received through the committee secretariat. I put on the record my thanks to the committee secretary and the wonderful support of the committee. I want to acknowledge Sandra Kennedy for her good work and her assistance in pulling the Liberal senators report together in very quick time; under challenging circumstances she made it happen as swiftly as possible. For that, on behalf of the Liberal senators, I am thankful. The smaller entities, according to that advice, will pay $284 in the first year. We want to know the impact of the costs of compliance and regulation for those smaller businesses. We think that should be reviewed very carefully.


Another thing we have recommended in the report is that there be a proper education and information campaign as soon as possible, remembering that this bill is meant to commence from 1 July. When is that? I will tell you when it is: it is Friday week. We are talking a matter of days. In one week and a couple of days this bill will commence and the relevant entities will be responsible for paying the fees. The government has indicated in this legislation that any fees that are paid late will incur a late payment fee. That is why we have recommended a moratorium on any late payment fees for six months following passage of the legislation. Let us give these businesses a chance to get their heads around and understand how this system is going to work. This is new to them. Yes, there was public consultation last year, but the fact is we are here debating this legislation today, it is going to start Friday week and they are going to have to start paying these levies from that day. That is why we have made a recommendation with regard to a moratorium.


We have also made a recommendation with regard to the urgent need for an education, information and awareness campaign designed to advise affected entities of their new obligations. That should be rolled out immediately. Based on the advice I have received, it is not simply about sending a letter to the 199 major entities. If that is not correct, could the minister please prove me and the coalition wrong. The advice we have is that the smaller entities will be paying $284 a year in the first year, and that is why they need to know. And why should they pay late penalties? Why should small businesses across this country have to suffer those consequences? That is the other thing. We are the party of small business, and that is why we have made that recommendation, No. 2, which says:


Given the unknown impact that the introduction of the levy will have on small and micro businesses, Liberal senators recommend that, in that initial review, the government investigate the impact of the legislation on these businesses and in particular, its effects on the costs to them of complying with regulation and red-tape.


Surely that is fair, reasonable and understandable, and I urge the government to seriously consider that recommendation. We have also had concern expressed in the Scrutiny of Bills report. This is a highly regarded committee in this Senate and in this parliament. It has indicated there are con­cerns regarding overcharging and over­collecting by the government.


All that being said, I want to put on record my thanks for the chairmanship by Senator Trish Crossin of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee during this inquiry. As I said the other day in my valedictory speech—and I want to say it again—it has been an absolute honour and a pleasure to work on the committee, both as chair of the references committee and as deputy chair of the legislation committee. I thank all of the members of that committee, including Senator Crossin for her leadership, cooperation and professionalism in the relationship that we have had over the past few years in those roles. I also want to put on the record my thanks to the secretariat for their good work not only on this matter but on all the other matters over many years. There is professionalism across the board in the Senate committee. The secretariats are wonderful, professional people who do fantastic jobs, under a great deal of pressure with time constraints in challenging circumstances. I have the highest regard for those people and the service that they offer, not just the current members of the various committees but the past members and, no doubt, the future members.


In conclusion, I stand here supporting the coalition and the recommendations that we have made in this report. I hope they are considered positively by the government and I look forward to hearing the government's response. I stand with Senator Brandis in supporting, firstly, the bill and, secondly, the coalition amendments. I thank the Senate.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Trood
):  Senator Xenophon, do you wish to be recognised in this debate?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2011-06-21,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:51):  Yes, I do. It is a last-minute addition, Acting Deputy President. I too support the second reading stages of this bill and support the general principles in relation to this bill with respect to Australian transaction reports and dealing with the issue of organised crime. There are costs involved in ensuring that these transactions are tracked and establishing whether there is an organised criminal element to them.


I apologise to my colleagues for the late notice of this. With the volume of legislation, ideally you would like to give more notice to your colleagues, but I can indicate that I will be seeking to move amendments in relation to this to give AUSTRAC increased access to intelligence in order to more easily crack down on money laundering in casinos and other gambling venues. The amendment that I will be moving shortly would require all eligible gambling venues—defined as venues with more than one poker machine—to keep on record the details of any patron who wins more than $1,000 while gambling on a poker machine and for this information to be available to AUSTRAC. Currently there are exemptions for a number of venues. This proposes that there not be exemptions for any venues. Money laundering on poker machines is a serious issue, albeit not one that is particularly well known. I rely on academics who have done research on this issue, in particular Dr Charles Livingstone from Monash University together with a number of his colleagues.


Hotel sources have told the Sydney Morning Herald that nationally $2 billion is laundered through hotel, club and casino poker machines and gambling chips, and as much as 40 per cent of this is in New South Wales alone. That is an extraordinary figure and I believe it ought to be appropriately tested. But that is on the basis of sources to the Sydney Morning Herald. There are also reports that certain venues are known by crime gangs as 'LLs' or 'local laundries'. This is how it works, as I understand it. A player may insert $2,000, $5,000 or even $10,000 into a poker machine and, after playing a handful of lines, decide they want to cash out. They then do so. It is a way of laundering the money. They might spend a few hundred dollars but launder thousands of dollars in the meantime.


This is a huge problem but is one that could easily be fixed if AUSTRAC were able to gather the information it needs to better track the movement of money through casinos, hotels and clubs. There is an old saying that if you want to get to the bottom of a matter you need to 'follow the money'. When it comes to crime gangs laundering an estimated $2 billion a year, according to those media reports, that saying could not be more apt. There is a position at the moment where for certain winnings—in some jurisdictions as low as $1,000—there needs to be a record kept in any event and the winnings need to be paid by cheque. It depends on the jurisdiction. So it would not be onerous for those records to be kept. The fact is, not too many people win big jackpots on poker machines. The house always wins—the venue always wins in the long run, or eventually. So this is a case where it would not be onerous; it would strengthen the purpose of this legislation.


I will address the issue of the coalition's amendments—and I do commend Senator Barnett for the very thorough work that he has done, at breakneck speed given the tight deadlines. People do not appreciate the sort of work the Senate does in Senate com­mittees. Whilst there may be disagreements, there is collegiality and goodwill between senators from different sides of the political fence in getting to the truth of the matter, seeing whether there can be improvements to legislation to sort out unintended conse­quences and the like.


Again, I regret that I have not been able to give earlier notice of this. That is not due to any grand plan; it is just a question of the workload in my office. It would be remiss of me not to raise this issue for this piece of legislation to ensure that they are dealt with appropriately, and I would welcome debate in the committee stage in relation to the amendments that I am foreshadowing. Again, I look forward to further discussion and debate in relation to the coalition's amendments on this bill, but, broadly, I do support the second reading stage of this bill. I believe the legislation is essential but could be improved with the amendment that I have foreshadowed.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Xenophon. It was a late intervention but I think the Senate would like to hear from you more often than not.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania—Minister Assisting on Deregulation and Public Sector Superannuation, Minister for Small Business and Minister Assisting the Minister for Tourism) (12:57):  In concluding this debate before the Senate I will focus on some of the issues that have been raised specifically by those who have contributed to this debate. 


Firstly, thank you to all those who have contributed to this debate. In relation to the comments by Senator Brandis and also Senator Barnett on the bills through the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report, I can advise that a review of the calculation methodology is planned after five years—or earlier if there are material changes to the AUSTRAC operating environ­ment. However, AUSTRAC will monitor the cost-recovery approach on an ongoing basis.


I would make the general observation—and this is from experience in a number of other areas of financial regulation where levies have applied: insurance, superannuation and, in particular, through ASIC and APRA for companies—that when you apply cost recovery it is always very difficult to satisfy the various entities which are required to pay a levy. Some want to, obviously, pay little or nothing. Whether it is justified or not, some want to shift the levy-paying level from one area to another. That is not an unusual approach. To the best of my recollection, whenever we have been faced with levy bills in this place, there have been relatively common controversies and disputes around who should pay, how much and so on.


The AUSTRAC supervisory level will be set annually. Legislative instruments containing the details of the levy arrangements for the next financial year will be published in draft form after the Australian government budget is released in May and will be issued in a final form prior to the commencement of the financial year. The cost recovery impact statement, or CRIS—another exciting acronym; I quite like that one—will be reviewed over the next 12 months and a new CRIS will be prepared for 1 July 2012. Consistent with the Australian government cost recovery guidelines, a revised CRIS will also be developed should there be any material changes to the cost recovery arrangements. 


In relation to small business—which Senator Barnett is interested in and, obviously, as the Minister for Small Business, is an area that I am interested in—the cost recovery model has been modified in a number of ways to reduce the regulatory impact on small business. As a result, many small businesses regulated by AUSTRAC will not be subject to cost recovery at all.


Let me give some examples of affiliates of a registered remittance network, which in the normal course of events you would expect to pay a levy. Affiliates are excluded on the basis that AUSTRAC's primary regulatory relationship will be with registered remittance networks rather than individual affiliates. This removes a range of small businesses from the operation of the levy—licensed post offices and newsagents, for example. This partly goes to Senator Xenophon's gambling amendment, if I could refer to it. We have reporting entities which have been exempted from part 7 of the AML/CTF Act on the basis that AUSTRAC does not incur substantial costs in regulating these entities. Those entities include small gaming venues with an entitlement to 15 or fewer gaming machines. They are exempt from part 7 of the act and would therefore not be subject to cost recovery.


In terms of our general approach to small business, it is correct, Senator Xenophon, that some gambling venues would not be paying the levy; and obviously we will debate the intent of your amendment when we get to that in the committee stage.  So far as the government is concerned, it would be unreasonable to apply this levy to entities—including post offices, newsagents and gambling entities with fewer than 15 machines—of this size: We see that as inappropriate. This has been our approach to reduce the impact on what we call small business and, indeed, microbusiness.


We are removing from the levy non-employing entities, sole proprietorships and partnerships without employees, and microbusinesses—businesses employing fewer than five people, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. These are removed from the base component of the levy. This means that, of the entities which are subject to the levy, 6,800 are expected to be subject to only the base component of the levy, estimated to be $284 in the first year. I think we have taken a very reasonable approach with respect to small business and microbusiness. 


AUSTRAC will monitor the impact on all businesses subject to the levy. To the extent that changes need to be made to improve the equity or efficiency of the cost recovery model, these considerations will be taken into account through the review process, to which I have already referred.


In terms of consultation on the proposed arrangements, extensive consultation has already occurred with affected stakeholders. I will make a general point. We often hear criticism and concern about lack of consultation. There has been very significant consultation. The bottom line is: some people do not to pay the levy. That is their attitude, but there can be no complaint about lack of consultation on this issue. Some people disagree. I respect them for that, but it is not a matter of lack of consultation. So often people use this line 'lack of consultation' when they do not agree. They should tell us they do not agree and why. There has certainly been significant consultation on this.


In November last year, AUSTRAC released a discussion paper and held three industry forums, in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Through the feedback received, the cost recovery model was further refined, and an exposure draft of a CRIS was released in February this year. In March AUSTRAC undertook further limited consultation on the 'large entity' definition of the model, and on 12 May AUSTRAC published a final CRIS on its website. In addition, a draft of the 2011-12 ministerial determination for cost recovery proposed details to be collected through the enrolment process, and a draft privacy impact assessment in respect of the enrolment obligation was also published for comment. Prior to invoices being issued in the 2011-12 year, a final ministerial determination will be made, and AUSTRAC will communicate with industry about the process and time frames for complying with both the cost recovery and mandatory enrolment processes.


Finally, in relation to late payment fees for the first year, invoices for the 2011-12 financial year are not planned to be issued until February or March 2012. Accordingly, there is no intention to issue late payment penalties in respect of cost recovery within the first three months following the passage of this legislation. 


To conclude, we know that organised crime is a significant national security threat and it is a challenge. Through the Com­monwealth Organised Crime Strategic Framework, the government is ensuring that Commonwealth intelligence, policy, regu­latory and law enforcement agencies are working together to prevent, disrupt, investigate and prosecute organised crime. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, AUSTRAC, plays a very important and critical role in the fight against organised crime. Through its regulatory activities, AUSTRAC helps to mitigate the risk of Australian businesses being used for money laundering, terrorism, finance and other organised crime. This package is necessary to give effect to the 2010 budget commitment. Consistent with the govern­ment's cost recovery guidelines, AUSTRAC will recover the costs of its regulatory activities from 1 July 2011. This cost recovery process is entirely consistent with that of the former government. In fact, to the best of my memory, the former Liberal-National Party government established this cost recovery process. So it has been a consistent approach across a whole range of areas of government.


The collection bill enables AUSTRAC to collect the supervisory cost recovery levy and establish the necessary framework for administering the levy, including matters relating to collection, invoicing and dealing with late payments. It provides that the amount of levy payable for each financial year will be determined by the minister by legislative instrument and cannot exceed a statutory limit of $33 million in total, indexed. The collection bill also introduces a system of administrative review of a decision by the AUSTRAC CEO to waive a levy or late payment penalty. Significant consultation has occurred with industry around the structure of the levy. Through this process the government has listened to the concerns of business and has made significant adjustments to lessen the burden, particularly in the area of small business.


The consequential amendments bill amends the AML/CTF Act to introduce compulsory enrolment for all reporting entities regulated by AUSTRAC. This formalises current arrangements where AUSTRAC encourages entities to volun­tarily enrol. Mandating this requirement will mean that AUSTRAC can better identify its regulated population for the purposes of calculating and applying the AUSTRAC cost recovery levy. The consequential amend­ments bill also amends the current infringement notice scheme to allow the issuing of notices for failure to enrol and failure to appropriately maintain enrolment details. I commend this package to the Senate and I thank all senators for their contributions.

Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (13:39):  On behalf of Senator Brandis I rise to speak on the Trans-Tasman Proceedings Amendment and Other Measures Bill 2011. The bill seeks to give effect to the Closer Economic Relations trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand, in particular the agreement on trans-Tasman court proceedings and regulatory enforcement of July 2008. The latter agreement was substantively given effect to by the Trans-Tasman Proceedings Act 2010, which was passed with coalition support. 


The trans-Tasman proceedings regime implements the agreement between the governments of Australia and New Zealand on trans-Tasman court proceedings and regulatory enforcement. The regime came about following the establishment of the Trans-Tasman Working Group on Court Proceedings and Regulatory Enforcement in 2003. The working group's terms of refer­ence were to examine the effectiveness and appropriateness of current arrangements relating to civil penalty proceedings as well as criminal proceedings relating to regulatory matters. Its membership comprised senior officials from relevant government departments in both countries.


In 2007, the Australian and New Zealand governments agreed to implement the recommendations of the working group. The agreement based on those recommendations was signed on 24 July 2008 by the Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, and the New Zealand Associate Justice Minister, Lianne Dalziel. The regime now allows civil proceedings from a court in one country to be served in the other without additional requirements and extends the range of civil court judgments enforceable between the two countries. Enforcement can only be refused if it conflicts with public policy in the country of enforcement. The regime also adopts a common rule to apply when a dispute could be heard by a court in either country and encourages greater use of technology for trans-Tasman court appearances.


This bill makes minor amendments to the principal act to ensure consistency of language and application with the corresponding New Zealand legislation and to adopt the recommendations of the New Zealand parliament's justice committee. Those recommendations were directed towards preventing spurious claims for a stay of proceedings based upon reliance on jurisdictionally-specific statutes. The bill also corrects a technical error in amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 in relation to court fees payable in respect of de facto relationship financial proceedings.


As we witnessed yesterday with the historic address of the Prime Minister of New Zealand to a joint sitting of this parliament, the ties between Australia and New Zealand are exceptionally close—perhaps closer than those between any other two nations in the world. The harmonisation of our legal systems is yet another example of the closeness of that relationship and one that has bipartisan support, as evidenced by the history of the discussions giving rise to the regime. The coalition is pleased, therefore, to support this bill.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:02):  I do not think this sort of low-level politics does Senator Abetz any good. The churlish comments about Senator Ludwig pursuing Australia's national interests are, I think, petty. Senator Abetz has asked me this question at least once before, if not two or three times. The Gillard government have made it clear that climate change poses a very significant challenge to our environment and the Australian economy. We, like John Howard in 2007, argue the need for a comprehensive government response. This government has set about trying to build a consensus in this parliament for putting a price on carbon. As you would be aware, we sought in the previous parliament to introduce a CPRS, which was not able to gain the support of the parliament.


The opposition, after originally supporting that proposition, rolled their leader and determined to oppose any action on climate change. In fact, the opposition now deny that climate change is a problem; I think the deniers have the numbers. I do not know whether, when Senator Minchin goes, the numbers will turn again. I think you are losing a couple of deniers, and it will be interesting to see how the balance goes. Malcolm Turnbull may be back and the believers might be in charge again.

All these rhetorical flourishes, which may well go down at the Hobart Liberal Party council, are not the same as having a proper policy debate. I would encourage the opposition to engage in a proper policy debate—not making three-word slogans and accusations about lying et cetera but actually debating the policies. Does the opposition believe climate change is occurring? Do they believe humans contribute to that? Do they believe we need to take serious action to address those concerns? The reality is that everyone who accepts the logic of those propositions accepts that we need to put a price on carbon, and that is what this government is going to do.

It is one of those theories that people like when it suits them and abandon when it does not. The reality is that this government is going to put a proposition before the parliament that the elected members of parliament, including those opposite, will get to vote on. They will get to vote on legislation to put a price on carbon. Then they can decide whether they are going to support the legislation or not. That will depend on how the numbers in the party are going, whether the loss of a few of the old right-wing warriors means the numbers swing back again. But that is what we will see. Decisions about a price on carbon will be made in the Australian parliament by all of us. All of the elected representatives of the people will get a chance to vote on carbon legislation later this year.

 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by Senators Evans, Wong and Carr to questions asked by all coalition senators today.


Mr Deputy President, one of the great joys of being in this Senate is having the opportunity to speak before you and through you at this time of day.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator FIFIELD:
  It is a statement of fact.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  It has always been a great joy to sit in here.




Senator FIFIELD:
  We are approaching the first anniversary of what former Prime Minister Rudd refers to as 'Assassination Day'; and, while Mr Rudd may have cancelled the anniversary wake, there are those opposite who are starting to think more than a little wistfully about Mr Rudd's administration. While I think there is general consensus that Mr Rudd is probably the worst administrator ever to hold the office of Prime Minister, there is one thing that he did not do: he did not break the fundamental compact of trust that exists between the Prime Minister and the voting public.


Senator Brandis today asked Senator Evans if the Prime Minister still believes in the words she said:


I think when you go to an election, and you give a promise to the Australian people, you should do everything in your power to honour that promise.


Senator Evans's response was quite extra­ordinary. Senator Evans said that the coalition was seeking to rerun arguments of past years. It seems that truth is so passe; truth is so last year. It was an extraordinary comment by the minister. But I would want to forget last year as well if I were Senator Evans, because it was last year that Prime Minister Gillard solemnly stared down the camera and said to the Australian people, as we know, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'


As we know, she is seeking to do the opposite: she is seeking to introduce a carbon tax. When someone says that they are going to do something and then they do the opposite, that is called a—I will not say the word, because it is unparliamentary, but it starts with 'L' and ends in 'E'. The Prime Minister also said before the last election that, before seeking to price carbon, she would seek a community consensus. You will recall that that was the gestation of the idea of a citizens' assembly. That idea, being so absurd, fell by the wayside, and shortly thereafter the promise not to introduce a carbon tax also bit the dust.


The Prime Minister has abandoned her solemn commitment, and it is not surprising that the Australian people in response are abandoning her. The Prime Minister has tried to put this broken promise into context. She has said that she is seeking the same destination, just by a different road. She has said that this carbon tax will represent reform. We all know economic reform. It has to do one of a few things: it has to help lift productivity, lift employment, lift the regulatory burden on business or reduce tax. The carbon tax, clearly, does none of those things.


Her latest attempt to provide a justification for this tax and put it in context is to say that she wants to 'remake how we experience what it means to be Australian'. She sure would—Australians would experience higher petrol prices and higher electricity prices, and there would be fewer jobs, less manufacturing and business would do it tough. She would change the way that Australians experience what it is to be Australian, but it will not be too long before we see another change of Prime Minister. I believe we will see Mr Rudd at the lectern in the Blue Room or in the Prime Minister's Courtyard, and we will hear Mr Rudd commence his press conference by saying, 'As I was saying before I was interrupted'. We will see this change, because this government has broken the compact with the Australian people. Our view is that they should put this matter to a plebiscite to test the will of the people. We know what the answer would be.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:11):  I agree with one thing that Senator Fifield has just said: it has always been a pleasure during this process, Mr Deputy President, to have you in the chair in this period of taking note. In turn, I think it is splendid that we can agree on that.


It is interesting that we have heard so much protestation from the other side about the concerns over having community consensus and the issue of getting people together. The one little element that was not mentioned in this great cry for a plebiscite of all people—getting out and testing the market, finding out what Australians really want—is that the person who is advocating that has already said that it does not matter what comes out of such a plebiscite. It is not going to make any difference, because he is still going to be opposed to the carbon tax—that is, carbon pricing or any other response to climate change. He is opposed to the whole kit and caboodle, in fact. That is the one clear element that has been maintained throughout this debate; the people on the other side have made it really clear. There is no doubt—they oppose.


So in the debates that have been going on we have heard protestations that the Prime Minister made statements before the election that after the election were not fulfilled. At no time has the Prime Minister or anyone on this side denied that that statement was made. At no time did we say, 'No, that's not true.' What we and the Prime Minister said was that, because of the overwhelming threat of climate change to our community, there needed to be some action taken. The Prime Minister then went out to the community and said that she was trying to seek a cross-party working group to look at the issues around climate change and at responses which could include a climate tax. Those were the words.


We did set up a cross-party process, only it did not include all the cross parties. It included the Labor Party, the Greens and the Independents. In that part there was a genuine attempt to come up with a proposal that would then be taken to the Australian public. That is what was going to happen. There is no surprise and no hiding; there is a process by which there has been an attempt to get more information through Professor Garnaut's work and through the work of the Productivity Commission so that we would have the facts to would determine the best way to respond to what people believe is an important threat to our community: climate change.


The response from the other side is not a surprise. It was to oppose. They said: 'No, it won't work. It won't happen and it won't happen under our watch.' That has been said so many times in various ways by the opposition. We understand their position. It does not matter what arguments are put up. It does not matter why people think this should happen, because there is a genuine threat and there needs to be a response. The Prime Minister has said that as a result of the cross-party working group there will be specific information provided so that discussion can continue around the issues.


We now have a premise but we do not have the core detail, which gives open slather to people on the other side to create the most horrific exaggerations and myths around what could happen. That is an easy tactic and is something for which we must be prepared. It is going to be the job of the government and of the people who want to work with the government to ensure that there are clear facts for the community so that they understand exactly what the government response will be. Then that whole debate will be taken through this place—it is the only way the system works—and there will be particular legislation developed. There will be a full debate which will engage with the community through the media across the whole of our country to identify the best way forward.


As I have said so many times in this place, this is not an issue just for Australia. We are part of a world community and we must be part of a world response. It is no good to say that we do not have a role. It is no good for anyone to say, 'Just oppose'. We have to identify the issue and then make a concerted effort to find a response.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2011-06-21,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:16):  I support the previous two speakers in relation to your position here today, Mr Deputy President. I am sorry to see it soon to conclude.


The question to Senator Evans was about the carbon tax. Senator Moore said that we are going to proceed with action and the department will decide. The fact is that the Prime Minister said to the Australian people before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under any government I lead.' Prime Minister Julia Gillard is now leading the government—that is why she resides in the Lodge—and now she is bringing in a policy to introduce a carbon tax. That is what this motion to take note of answers is about.


Why was this policy brought on? No doubt the Greens played a big part in this whole issue and contributed enormously to the decision of a price on carbon, which the Productivity Commission says is the cheapest way to address climate change. If it is the cheapest way, why isn't the rest of the world doing it? Why is Australia the only one with a plan to put a price on carbon across the whole economy? Europe has not done that. New Zealand, which produces 0.1 of just one per cent—which is three parts of nothing—of the world's greenhouse gases through burning fossil fuels are trying to keep their price down as they know what it is doing to their economy. Last night I was listening to the radio and a New Zealand dairy farmer was talking on 2CC in Canberra. Apparently it is going to cost the average dairy farmer $11,000 over three years in New Zealand, and they are going to move in 2015 to include agriculture.


But why is this so? In the days after the election, when the Prime Minister was talking with people such as the Independent member for New England, Mr Windsor, who said, 'Will you form the multiparty com­mittee and revisit climate change policy?' He was driving this same issue with the Greens. This week Mr Abbott has done his best to try to get the Australian people to have a say on this very issue. Let us have a look at what Mr Windsor said back in 2003 in relation to Senator Alston and the privatisation of Telstra:


If Senator Alston doesn't like the wording of my survey, then I invite him to do his own survey of the people of the New England electorate.


Senator Alston has the resources to undertake the task and I would encourage him to do it.


What's he got to be afraid of?—finding out what the people want!


That's what democracy is all about—finding out what the people want and representing their views in the Parliament and I challenge Senator Alston to debate the issue in any forum ...


When the committee gets it final decision on how they are going to introduce this carbon tax—which, as a result of the Copenhagen collapse, is not going to affect the world in any way whatsoever—I wonder if Mr Windsor is going to survey the people of New England? I wonder if he is going to practise what he preaches? I would say probably not. He said he will survey his electorate when it comes to issues such as same-sex marriage. That is perhaps a delicate decision he might have to make for fear of getting offside with some of his voters. But on these issues I would be very interested to see if Mr Windsor practises what he preaches.


I will certainly survey the people of New England and the people of Lyne in Mr Oakeshott's electorate. Mr Oakeshott said that he would 'vote for the carbon tax tomorrow', but that was a couple of months ago, and now he is back-peddling at a rapid rate of knots. I will certainly carry out a survey in those electorates. We will see if these Independents, who claim to be the people's representatives, really are the people's representatives and whether they pay attention to their electorates or are just Labor Party stooges. We have known for years how the Labor Party has supported the Independents in regional New South Wales. Well, on 26 March the people of New South Wales saw through that. That is why three out of four of them have been cleaned out. 


We come back to trust in government. Treasurer Wayne Swan said there was 'This hysterical allegation' by the opposition that if somehow they won government they would introduce a carbon tax.' He was denying that before the election. Now what are we facing? The government are going to put a price on carbon because it is the cheapest way to go, according to Mr Swan. But I say it again: if it is the cheapest way to go, why isn't the rest of the world doing it? The United States, China, India, Japan, Korea—they are not putting a price on carbon. The fact is that the government have betrayed their commitment to the Australian people and the Australian people will square up next time they have a say.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:21):  Mr Deputy President, I too would like to congratulate you on your term, and your commitment and contribution to this place. Having been here with you for six years I have appreciated your guidance at times during the taking note of answers proceedings of the Senate—not all the time, but most of the time.


We have to be realistic: when we come into this place it is quite wrong for a senator to mislead the Australian community. I want to put it on the record, in relation to what is happening with carbon pricing around the world, that Australia is not tackling this alone. We know that. Even those people on the other side know that. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, a conservative I might add, addressed a joint sitting of both houses of parliament yesterday. We know, as those opposite do, about the actions that New Zealand is taking against climate change and the emissions trading scheme that was introduced there in 2008. The Prime Minister of the UK, David Cameron, is seriously talking about the need to tackle climate change. It is quite wrong for those opposite to say that Australia is trying to go it alone and what we are planning to do will not have any impact. That is quite wrong.


The stunt that Mr Abbott tried this week by recommending and moving legislation in relation to a plebiscite once again demon­strates how those opposite underestimate the Australian community. The Australian community are not silly. They know that this is another stunt, just as they know Tony Abbott is the Leader of the Opposition you could not possibly trust to be Prime Minister of this country. We know his record when it comes to health. We talk about core and non-core promises and election commitments that those opposite seem to think are not being kept, but we know what Tony Abbott did when he was Minister for Health. We know because we are still trying to recover the billion dollars he gutted out of health when he was minister. Those opposite should not for one minute believe that the Australian community are going to be conned. In terms of broken commitments, those opposite—and Senator Ryan was not here at the time—know the former Howard government were the experts when it came to core and non-core promises. We know and the Australian community know what the opposition's track record is.


Let us turn to the other issue raised in question time today: the refugees and the Malaysian solution that we are putting forward. I find it quite extraordinary that those opposite come into this chamber and try and lecture us about how to deal compassionately with refugees. We all know that the issues that Australia confronts with people-smuggling is a travesty. We should be, and we are, doing everything we can to stop the people smugglers. The opposition suggest that they know better when they had 11½ years to resolve these issues. We know their track record on how they treated women and children in the refugee camps. We know their track record and so do the Australian people.


I was really glad the whip asked me to speak in this debate, because those opposite once again tried to come into this chamber and lecture us about financial responsibility when it was those opposite that voted against just about every measure that we put in for savings in this budget. The response of those opposite when the global financial crisis hit Australia was: 'Let's keep our heads in the sand. Let's just wait and see what happens. Let's not overreact.' But the reality is, if we had not invested in the infrastructure in this country, had we not kept Australian workers in jobs, we would have been in a depression. What we did was talk about things that are positive instead of doing the opposite all the time.


Talking about the great investment made by this government in education, look at the BER funding. It was the best investment in education in this country for decades. Those on the other side can come in and try and rewrite history when we talk about financial responsibility, when we talk about the treatment of refugees, when we talk about the need to confront and deal with the tough issues like climate change. We will take the leadership.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2011-06-21,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (15:26):  Mr Deputy President, I join my fellow speakers in congratulating you. I can say that as a mentor to newer senators like me—I have only been here for three years—and as a former housemate, you will indeed be missed. I wish you all the best.


I do not know where to start following Senator Polley's contribution, in the most liberal use of the word. I will have to limit myself to only a few issues raised in question time today. This government, its ministers, its senators and its members all stand condemned. There are various reasons for it, including their profound mismanagement of the nation's finances—which, in a vain attempt to defend, Senator Polley could not even bring herself to mention the numbers that are involved in Australia's record debt for which this government only has a defence that our neighbours are worse off. The government's only defence of the amount of money it has borrowed in a record ramp-up of debt is simply, 'The guy over the road owes a lot more.' The people of Australia deserve better than comparisons to the fiscal disaster zone that is Europe and that is the United States. This government could have ensured Australia did not have the level of debt that people like David Murray and economic commentators right around Australia are saying has exposed us to economic risk that was completely unnecessary. 


This government stands condemned for its sheer incompetence in managing the resources and programs of government. I cannot believe that Senator Polley decided to refer to the government's so-called investments in infrastructure as a badge of honour. We could refer to the billions of dollars wasted in home insulation, the billions of dollars wasted in school halls—both of which those opposite were warned, before the money was spent, before the money was appropriated and while it was being spent, were leading to record waste. If this side of the chamber had been in office, I can only dream of the wailing that would have occurred from those opposite, the champions of the workplace and of workplace safety, when people died on the watch of the programs that they appropriated money for. That just goes to show how this government has no credibility.


We come to the most important issue of all—and that is the issue of trust. We all know circumstances change. We all know the world is an evolving place, whether it is security, whether it is the international economy, but on the issue of the carbon tax there was no doubt: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Those are the words of the Prime Minister, no matter what the contrived or confected excuse, including the allegation that we cannot be left behind the world. The Productivity Commission has punctured the myth that the world is acting and that Australia will be left behind. In a reflection of the diseased state Labor parties from which so many members of this government have been drawn, they changed tack, they reverse course and they hope that people will forget by the time of the next election. Well, the Australian people have seen that and it has been rejected right around Australia at the state level—whether it is Bob Carr promising to get rid of tolls on Sydney's toll roads or Steve Bracks prom­ising there will be no tolls on the Scoresby Freeway, there have been numerous promises made by the state Labor governments to be elected and then reversed. This goes to show that this government simply cannot be trusted. Like a person on a winter's day, the government hides under the doona of reform, shivering from the people and claiming that the word 'reform' will cover them. But you cannot hide from the bitter cold of a people who are aggrieved by the breach of trust. The people will hold this government accountable. The truth is that this proposed carbon tax has nothing to do with economic reform; it has nothing to do with the reform agenda of the eighties.


In the eighties and nineties we removed trade barriers, we removed embedded costs on the Australian economy and we made our tax system, labour market and financial systems more competitive—all of which will be reversed by a carbon tax. This carbon tax dramatically increases the scope of govern­ment activity in our economy, and the truth is that that is the reason they want it. They want a carbon tax because they want to be able to hand out favours—whether it is in the form of free permits or welfare payments—to their favourite groups. As the Prime Minister said, you want to remake Australia. Well, the opposition will not only fight you but will do so proudly and make sure this Labor government, this pale reflection of a once great Australian political party, is rejected by the people at the next election.

That this bill be now read a second time.




Senator ABETZ:
  I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011 seeks to address the democratic deficit occasioned by the proposal to inflict a carbon tax on the people of Australia.


Having solemnly promised that there would be no carbon tax, Labor received a mandate from the Australian people not to introduce a carbon tax.  Similarly, the Coalition promised no carbon tax.  Between them the Coalition and Labor obtained the vast majority of votes and seats in the Parliament at the 2010 election.


And therefore, the views of the electorate—when it came to the question of Australia's introducing a carbon tax—were clear and unequivocal.


Shortly after the election, the Government broke their promise when the Prime Minister announced that she would impose a carbon tax.  A carbon tax will impact every Australian's cost of living, jeopardise jobs and our international competitiveness, whilst doing nothing for the environment.  Its impact will be immense.  That is why six days before the last election—in the face of polls indicating a possible hung parliament—the Prime Minister solemnly promised that there would be no carbon tax.


There is no doubt that if the Government had promised a carbon tax before the election, the Coalition would have won.


The carbon tax is the price the Australian people are being asked to pay for Labor to form its alliance with the Greens.  Through this Bill, the Coalition proposes to give the Australian people a voice that was denied them at the last election.  A voice will be given to the Australian people by affording them an opportunity to vote pursuant to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984.


The Australian Electoral Commission will conduct the plebiscite—voting will be compulsory.  The vote will be held on a date to be determined by the Government, but before or on the last Saturday in November 2011.


The question to be asked will be:  ""Do you support the Government's plan to introduce a price on carbon to deal with climate change?""  This is a neutral question. And if the Government is so sure that it has the people's support to price carbon, then it shouldn't be scared of this question, a plebiscite or the result.


But yet the Government has a huge moral dilemma which is preventing them taking the honourable position of supporting this Bill.  It made a solemn promise not to introduce a carbon tax.  The Government has broken this promise—it intends to introduce a carbon tax.


The people of Australia have been denied a voice.  The suggestion that the hung parliament introduces a new paradigm is correct.  It does not, however, justify a complete and wholesale breach of a fundamental and central election promise made by the Government to the Australian people.  The Coalition offers its support for the Government to remain true to its word.  The faith of the Australian people in their democratic processes is being severely tested by the breach of trust represented by the Government's intention to introduce a carbon tax.


This Bill will restore the rightful place of the Australian people in the debate over a carbon tax.


And if the Prime Minister was honourable, she would give the people their chance to be heard.


If she doesn't listen then it is more likely than not that the Australian people will speak even more loudly at the next election.

 (South Australia) (15:57):  I present the explanatory memoranda and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.

Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



At the outset, I would like to make it clear that I do not support the excessive exit fees that have been imposed by lenders to date.


There are multiple examples of home owners who have been forced to sell their homes to cover fees in the tens of thousands of dollars, and this is simply not acceptable.


For too long, banks and other lending institutions have profited off these unreasonable fees—with customers left with little choice.


However, I am also aware and concerned about the impact the Government's blanket ban on exit fees will have on smaller lending institutions.


Access to funds for smaller lenders is much more expensive than it is for the major banks, and some of the measures taken during the Global Financial Crisis only worked to cement the market domination of the 'Big Four' banks, in fact the Government's measures had the effect of increasing their dominance.


For smaller lenders, exit fees are a valid way of recouping some of their costs should a customer decides to break their contract and change products or providers.


These lenders do not have the multi-billion dollar bottom lines of the Big Four, nor are they able to offset these costs elsewhere, so a blanket ban of exit fees will seriously impact small lenders.


There is far too little competition in Australia's banking sector, and we must protect what little competition exists.


If the smaller players are not able to apply fees they will be severely disadvantaged. If this happens, then the Big Four banks will increase their share in an already too-concentrated market.


Broadly speaking, consumers deserve the flexibility to move from one lender to another, or from one product to another, to ensure they are getting the best deal for their money.


But part of ensuring that customers are able to do this is making sure there is a robust sector, and a wide range of products and providers, for customers to choose from.


The recent Senate Economics Committee Inquiry into competition in the banking sector estimated that the big four banks account ""for around three-quarters of deposits and assets and a larger share of home loans"".


The Committee also pointed out that:


""There are hundreds of corner stores competing with Coles and Woolworths but this does not mean that these two stores do not dominate grocery retailing. In the same way, the four major banks dominate the banking market, notwithstanding a long tail of small financial organisations.""


It is vital that we support the smaller players of the banking sector.


This Bill requires APRA to prohibit banks with a market share of more than ten percent from charging exit or early termination fees for any loan agreement or mortgage contract.


This prohibition will also apply to any subsidiary company or organisation which is owned 51 percent or more by a bank with more than ten percent market share.


That is, a financial subsidiary which is effec­tively an extension of one of the major banks will also be prohibited from charging exit or early termination fees.


This provision will ensure that only small, independent financial organisations will be able to apply reasonable fees to recoup some of their costs.


This Bill also inserts a provision into the National Credit Code to provide some guidance on the meaning of 'reasonable'. The provision states that a credit fee or charge must not materially exceed the credit provider's reasonable costs of undertaking the activity or service related to the fee or the credit provider's average reasonable costs of undertaking the activity or service.


This means that smaller providers who do apply fees related to the extension of credit—whether it be for a personal loan, home loan or credit card—must ensure it is reasonable and materially relevant to the cost incurred to undertake the activity or service.


The Bill also provides that ASIC may apply to the court for an order to annul or reduce a fee it feels does not meet these criteria.


There is no doubt that urgent action needed to be taken in relation to exit fees, and I applaud the Government for taking that action.


However, a blanket ban is not the solution.


All it will do is push the smaller players out, reinforce the dominance of the Big Four and, as a result, reduce choice, pushing up other banking costs for consumers.


Small lenders and operators play a vital role in our financial sector, and we must ensure that they are protected.


On the surface it might seem slashing all exit fees is a good idea.


But when you scratch the surface it becomes clear that abolishing exit fees for smaller lenders could have a devastating effect on competition, and consumers will end up paying a lot more in the long run.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (19:11): I say a special hello to all those people I know that are listening tonight—one special friend, Joe, under a bit of sufferance. I rise to speak on a fundraising event that my husband and I hosted in Hobart in May. This event was a quiz night held as a fundraiser for three orphanages in Vietnam: the Phu My Orphanage, the Mai Tam Shelter and the Anunciation Shelter, all in Ho Chi Minh City. As I have mentioned before, my husband and I did volunteer work there in December last year. Following our time volunteering there, we decided that we wanted to do a bit more when we came home and to raise some funds that are so dearly needed by those orphanages.


Having spoken about that trip previously I want to focus on the quiz night itself. It was a really great night and one of those fundraisers where political differences are put aside. People came from far and wide to participate. We had participants from all across southern Tasmania. I think the furthest was from Granton, a good 30-plus minutes away from the venue, a long way on a wet May night in Tasmania. I thank everyone for attending that night. 


Robert and I along with our very good friend Eric Siedler organised the event. Like all these events, a lot of hard work went into the planning as well as the night itself. The venue was kindly donated by Mackillop Catholic College, which is on Hobart's eastern shore and where Eric is chairman of the board. In addition to finding a venue, we had the usual general organisational issues around invites, getting the word out, seeking donations for prizes and seeking donations to the general appeal. And, of course, we had to come up with some quiz questions and a few activities to add some entertainment to the night. 


I would like to place on the public record my thanks to Eric Siedler for all the hard work he put into organising the event. He was on leave at the time; he had a few weeks leave from his more than full-time work, and he spent a lot of his personal time organising the quiz night for us. He really went above and beyond for us, as he always does, and we sincerely thank him. As I said, there were people from all over southern Tasmania in attendance. We did send some emails out to people, but many attended because they had heard about it from a friend or colleague or read about it in the church magazine. Regardless of how they heard about the event, everyone there had the common goal of raising money for this worthy cause and for the kids in Vietnam—and, of course, everyone wanted to have a bit of fun while they were there. So we had questions on the Royal family, sport and history. Some rounds required you to match a sound clip to a movie or name the band or song title, while another round had you matching countries with their flags. To make it relevant to the cause, we created a round on a Vietnam, and of course we had the obligatory quiz night round where you have to match celebrity names to their photos. I am pretty happy that I was not an organiser of the event and did not have to do any of those, because I think I would have let the side down somewhat in those things. We had a couple of rounds that did not earn points, which was interesting because the people who took part told me they were just as challenging. Although this night was a fundraiser for the Vietnamese orphanages, let me tell you that the competition between the different tables and teams was very, very strong. There was a great competitive spirit which saw people racing up to the scorers to hand in their answer sheets in some of the rounds between challenges.


To help increase the fundraising we had an auction of three items as well. We had a giant lint-stuffed bunny. We also had a fish tank that was donated by the pet shop at the local shopping centre—and I will thank them later as well. When they handed over the fish tank they said, 'All you need is water and fish,' because it was a complete fish tank. We also had a gorgeous handmade teddy bear that friend of ours had made. All of those things, as I said, were generously donated.


As I said, I would like to thank Eric Siedler for helping to organise the event and for being master of ceremonies and quizmaster extraordinaire. He really is great as a quizmaster. We have had quiz nights for other things, and we get so many people commenting on how well organised they are and what a great quizmaster Eric is, so I really have to say thank you to him. I also thank the rest of his family—his wife, Tracy, and his two sons, Declan and Kieren, who were there on the night helping to set up and score and generally running around. I also thank my own son Kieren for helping out on the night.


I would especially like to mention Matt Monaghan and his young son Riley. Riley is only 5½ and he wanted to come and help. He was a fantastic help on the night. He was running around collecting rubbish from people and doing whatever we asked him to do. A 5½-year-old at 10 o'clock at night—it could have ended up not quite pleasant, but he was absolutely fantastic. I would also like to thank Rick and Chris Goninon for helping as well. They all played an important role in making sure the event ran smoothly, whether it was serving behind the bar, scoring, delivering and collecting answer sheets from the tables, picking up rubbish or helping to clean up.


I thank the Principal of Mackillop Catholic College, Mrs Sally Towns; the acting principal, Sue Howard; the business manager, Kaylene Bentley; and the school community for donating the use of the hall. It was a perfect venue for the event. We had about 29 tables with eight people at each table. For an event in Hobart on a May night, that was a really good turnout. Thank you also to Miss Andrea Towns for setting up the PA system, to the maintenance staff for setting up the tables and chairs and to the security people who were there as well.


Thank you to all the businesses and individuals who donated prizes and auction items for the night or a monetary donation. I will quickly run through who they are: Robert Rockefeller; the State Cinema; McDonalds Rosny Park; Cadburys; Eastlands Pet Supplies, who donated the fish tank; Bennett's Petroleum Supplies Pty Ltd; David Eyles; Nick Cooling; Skigia; John Redeker; Shannon Stennings; Tori van Nieuwkuyk; Judy Hayden; Wesfarmers Kleenheat; Charlie Rich; and Ben Daley.


Thanks must go to everyone who participated on the night. The entry fee and the purchase of raffle tickets and auctions items altogether raised $5,000 on the night. Robert and I had also done a bit of fundraising in the preceding weeks and raised $5,000. Robert told me through the week that the total money we were able to send was over $11,000, which, for four or five weeks fundraising, is a brilliant outcome. The money will be given to the orphanages in Vietnam directly and that will make life a little bit smoother and a little bit more comfortable for those children. The $11,000 raised was far above our expectations.


I offer my sincere thanks to everyone involved. It just goes to show that if you want to make a difference in this world you can. And it does not have to be a big donation. If you add all the donations together, the $11,000 will make such a difference to those kids. I cannot even put into words what a difference it will make. The orphanages will be able to buy physiotherapy equipment, toys or whatever they need. It is up to the orphanages to determine what they need. I look forward to updating the Senate at a later date on what they have used that money for. I send my thanks to everyone for their participation.
