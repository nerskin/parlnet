"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-05-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanation.
The government claims it has nothing to hide in relation to its involvement in the whole waterfront fiasco and specifically in the training of industrial mercenaries in Dubai, but to date everything has been hidden. I have enunciated a number of actions which the government has taken to hide information, including consultancy reports from ACIL, from Dr Webster, from Dr Davies, from David Webb, from BGC Media and from Minter Ellison, and I have asked some specific questions which the government has chosen 
 not to respond to in the appropriate time. A number of questions were put on notice that go to the question of the government's role in the Dubai exercise and the mass sacking of workers because they happen to be members of a union. That is not only my view; it is the view of the Prime Minister of Australia. Let me remind the Senate what Mr Howard told A Current Affair  on 9 April. When asked about the sacking of workers in ports such as Townsville and Burnie, he said:
They're all part of the one union. One of the consequences of having a bargaining monopoly . . . is that some innocent people get affected.
These questions go to matters of legitimate public interest. The exact role of this government and of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, in particular, in the fiasco we have all been watching played out on our television screens for weeks is of legitimate public interest. We have seen the guards and the dogs on chains, and we have heard the seemingly endless chants from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. He is clearly locked into a script prepared for him by Jonathan Gaul and he cannot get out of it.
The questions that remain unanswered are important. They go to the question of Mr Reith's relationship with the National Farmers Federation. They go to the question of who has accessed the consultant's reports that have so far been denied to the Senate. They go to the amount of money the government has spent on consultancies which we know about and they seek information on any new consultants the government might have engaged.
For example, the Senate and the public are entitled to know why the government hired Dunhill Madden Butler. What did that firm do for Mr Reith? What was Attorney-General's up to? Was Mr Amendola from that firm employed as a consultant to the department of workplace relations or to Mr Reith personally? What other legal advice was provided to the department and the minister? When, and at what cost? Mr Reith has confirmed that the government had a team of lawyers on stand-by in London in case there was an attempt to put in place an international boycott. When 
 was that team of lawyers engaged? Who were they? How much did they cost?
The questions also asked for copies of all invoices relating to the consultancies undertaken by Dr Webster and Dr Davies as part of the government's waterfront strategy. These invoices were provided to Dr Greg Feeney in the Maritime Transport Division of the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business, and he paid them. Those two consultancies cost the Australian taxpayer $191,000 and, as one of those taxpayers, I want to see where my money went.
This whole bizarre affair still has some considerable way to go. And all the details of the role the government played in the illegal sacking of an entire work force of 2,000 Australians who support 2,000 Australian families are yet to be revealed. But they will be.
It is often the case that questions on notice are not answered within the required 30 days, and there are often good reasons for such delays, but these questions go to a very important issue, as I have said. They go to an issue that has commanded more space in the newspapers and more time on radio and television than just about any other issue in recent times. They go to an issue that has entangled not only the minister for workplace relations but the minister for foreign affairs, the Minister for Defence, the former minister for transport and now the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself. That is the reason I am pursuing the answers today, and that is why the government should have provided the answers to me when they were due.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-05-12,"—On the last day of sitting I undertook to provide further detail to Senator Stott Despoja on a matter concerning the employment services market. I have written to Senator Stott Despoja and seek 
 leave to have the letter detailing further information  incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The letter read as follows—
SENATOR THE HON. CHRISTOPHER ELLISON
Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training
Senator for Western Australia
Senator Stott Despoja
Deputy Leader, Australian Democrats
212 Grenfell Street
ADELAIDE SA 5000
12 May 1998
Dear Senator Stott-Despoja
I refer to your question in the Senate on 8 April 1998 which I took on notice, regarding the taping of feedback sessions for the Employment Services Market.
Feedback sessions were offered to all organisations who tendered for the Employment Services market, whether they were successful or unsuccessful.
Each tenderer was offered a half hour session in which the details of the processes used to ensure that decisions were reached on a fair and consistent basis were explained and feedback was given in relation to that organisation's tender.
The sessions were being taped to ensure, should an issue arise, that there can be no dispute about any advice given. The tapes are for Departmental reference only and will not be transcribed or used for any further purpose.
A letter was sent to each tenderer requesting a feedback session, confirming the appointment, outlining the boundaries of the sessions and stating that ""you should note that the Department will retain a record of the session on tape.""
For feedback sessions being conducted by telephone (in addition to the letter), the Department notified the participants that it was being taped. This is consistent with the telecommunications legislation.
Some tenderers have also taken the opportunity to tape their own session.
It should be noted that all information sessions that were provided to prospective tenderers before the tender process were also taped. There have been situations where tenderers have disputed what was said at these sessions. The tapes have provided a quick solution to any of these queries.
I hope this information is of assistance to you.
Yours sincerely

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-05-12,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Thursday 9 April 1998, of David Bernard Vigor, a senator for the State of South Australia from 1984 to 1987, places on record its appreciation of his public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
David Vigor was born in France on 24 June 1939. He moved to Australia with his family when he was 12. David was educated at Adelaide Boys High School and the Universi 
 ty of Adelaide. He was also one of the first research students at Monash University. Before entering federal politics, David had been a university lecturer, a pioneer in the area of computer science and a farmer. While lecturing at the University of Glasgow, he developed the first computer data-based expert system used for medical diagnosis by the Western Regional Hospital Board in Scotland.
In 1971, David and his wife Susan returned to Australia and David joined the South Australian Institute of Technology as head of the school of data processing and director of the computer centre. Together, they bought a mixed cereal, dairy, poultry and sheep farm in the Barossa Valley in South Australia to accommodate their growing family, as well as to expand their business challenges. Today, their farm is a base for an executive training facility and computer consultancy which developed and markets an innovative medical system to help in-patient care and management of medical practices.
David was a founding member of the Australian Democrats and was elected to the Senate in 1984. He was national Vice-President of the Australian Democrats from 1983 to 1984 and a member of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Science, Technology and the Environment. In his maiden speech he stated his belief that you can `change the world in which we all live'. These were words to live by for David Vigor.
He assumed his Senate duties with enthusiasm. He introduced private members' bills on varying subjects and was tenacious in his questioning in Senate estimates sessions. He was also a staunch supporter of proportional representation and self-government in the ACT. He showed endless support for individuals and struggles with the legal system and bureaucracy. For example, he highlighted the problems with the Australia Card.
He left the Senate in 1987 and went on to become a founding member and at the time of his death was Secretary of the Association of Former Members of the Parliament of Australia. After politics David returned to computer consultancy and software develop 
 ment. The day before his death he attended the opening of a dental research unit at the University of Adelaide which featured software developed by his company.
Madam President, on behalf of the government, I extend to his family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Former Senator David Bernard Vigor</title>,Condolences,5,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-05-12,"—On behalf of the opposition, I wish to associate the opposition with this condolence motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) on the death of David Vigor, a former Democrat senator from the state of South Australia. Labor senators expressed our sorrow at David Vigor's sudden death last month and we, too, offer our deepest sympathy to his family.
As Senator Hill has indicated, David Vigor was elected to parliament until 1984, but he was unsuccessful in retaining his Senate seat in the 1987 double dissolution. So David Vigor was a senator for only a very short period of time, but I am assured by many people in the chamber who served with him that he certainly made his presence felt during that period.
He was a man of strong principle and conviction. He fought hard and, I am assured, long for the issues that he believed in. He did advocate strongly proportional representation and self-government in Canberra. That was part of what was a strong personal commitment to fair elections and responsible government. He was also very active on consumer issues as well as fighting to ensure funding for all levels of sport Australia wide. I understand from colleagues how vigorous and thorough his questioning was at times at Senate estimates committee hearings, and many senators in this chamber have shared those experiences with him.
There was another one of David Vigor's achievements which perhaps he is not recognised as widely for, which is the role that he played in stopping smoking on Australian aircraft. That perhaps was an achievement not welcomed by all Australians but I must say, as a frequent traveller and one who does not smoke, it was certainly one that I would 
 welcome and I am sure many other fellow travellers do.
Let me say to David Vigor's family, on behalf of all opposition senators, we offer to his family our most sincere regret at his death and our condolences to his family and friends.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Former Senator David Bernard Vigor</title>,Condolences,5,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-05-12,"—I rise also to speak on the unexpected passing of former Senator David Vigor. Twenty-three Democrat senators have served in this chamber over the past 21 years, but this is the first time that a condolence motion has been necessary for a Democrat. Therefore, it is fitting that I, as current leader of the party, should make these comments.
There have been obituaries published which detail David's life prior to politics and told by people in a better position than I who only came to know David at the time that I became involved in the South Australian division actively in 1986. So I would like to take up the tale at the time that I met him.
Yes, I knew him through his and my involvement in the party in South Australia. In those early days of our acquaintance he struck me for the very qualities that no doubt he is best remembered for by those who served in this place with him. He was enthusiastic, indeed incredibly enthusiastic, about all the issues that he was involved in. He was capable of great passion. He was a man of commitment and an avid technophile.
He was a founder member of the Democrats and gave long service both on our state executive and also at national executive level. He served as deputy national president, as has already been mentioned, in 1983-84. Later in 1984 David Vigor was elected to the Senate, giving the Democrats a second South Australian Senate seat, a seat today held by Senator Stott Despoja. This was a milestone for our party in South Australia and one of which David could be rightly proud. When elected, David was one of only five non-British European born MPs in the Australian parliament. He and his father in particular were incredibly proud of their cultural heritage.
There are many in his class of `84 who are still with us—amongst them Senators 
 Vanstone, Cooney, Knowles and McKiernan, who probably all have a personal story or two about David Vigor. Unlike many of these honourable senators, the then Senator Vigor did not have any period on the back bench. On his first day in the Senate chamber in the Old Parliament House he held the portfolios for us of trade, transport, science, communications, local government and administrative services and territories. He attacked all of them with gusto. I am told by some who were around at the time that whatever David Vigor did as a senator he did with gusto, whether it was legislative debates, committee work—and I have quite a few stories about his work in estimates committees—or indeed placing questions on notice. I suspect that, if one goes back through the Hansard, one would see that he held close to the record for the largest volume of questions ever placed on notice in any 12-month period.
 In the 1984 campaign which saw David elected, our party's slogan was `You can change the world' and, in many ways, this describes David's attitude to politics. He believed in it, he tried to achieve it and indeed he lived it. He was a central player in the move to self-government in the ACT and a tireless advocate for the science community within public life. He also took a strong interest in improved electoral and parliamentary procedures. One of his many ideas, a 1987 amendment to require senators to declare any interest in the outcome of a vote, is well known to current senators. Indeed, it is what we dealt with immediately prior to this condolence motion. While it took until 1994 to be accepted by this chamber—and, unfortunately, by that time David was no longer here—it is one of his many initiatives.
 Outside the parliament, David Vigor was an enthusiastic contributor to the community—a founding member of the Australian Democrats, active in the campaign for proportional representation, a founding member of community television through ACE Television in Adelaide, and a founding member of the Association of Former Members of the Parliament of Australia. At the time of his death, he was secretary of the association.
 Before I conclude my remarks, I cannot fail to mention the fact that, eventually, David Vigor and I found ourselves on the opposite sides of an inter-party disagreement within South Australia, one which saw David Vigor unsuccessfully contest the 1987 election as a candidate for another party. This party was a very short-lived one. However, many members of the party in South Australia still hold great affection for him and view the internal drama of 1987 in the context of a life of active enjoyment with and contributions to the community in which he lived.
David can rightly be described as having lived an extraordinary life. I offer my sincere sympathies to his wife, Susan, to his children and to his grandchildren. It must be for them a time of great sadness. My final words which best describe the motivation behind his political involvement have been provided by David Vigor himself. Knowledge is power, power to change the world we live in for the better if we care. No-one who ever knew him in the Australian Democrats or elsewhere will ever doubt that David Vigor cared.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Former Senator David Bernard Vigor</title>,Condolences,5,1
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1998-05-12,"—I join with my colleagues in speaking to the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill in respect of former Senator David Vigor who came here in 1984, and I express my sympathy to his family at his death. He could only have been 57 or 58 years old, which is too early to go. Not only did he have a parliamentary career but I believe he was very successful in the computer industry. One thing you could say about David Vigor was that he was enthusiastic. I believe that he was the most vigorous debater this parliament has ever seen. In fact, at one stage we took a rough calculation and we believe that one senator, David Vigor, was using one-third of the Senate's time. He almost had former Senator Walsh driven to distraction at the estimates committees. He gained some fame in his one term of office.
 He was a pleasant person, a person who really got excited about any issue that he became involved in. He became involved in very many issues in his one term of parliament. He is one of those characters who will 
 always stick in your mind. Many people come and go, but David Vigor was different. He will be remembered by all of us who were here in 1984. I once again express my sympathy to his family and his wife and say to them that we are thinking of them in this hard time.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Former Senator David Bernard Vigor</title>,Condolences,5,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-05-12,"—I support the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill on the passing of David Bernard Vigor. I do so as I regarded his friendship as being very important. Vigor by name and vigour by nature, although they are spelt slightly differently. His name was spelt V-i-g-o-r, but in the v-i-g-o-u-r category he left other people for dead. His enthusiasm for this place and for this particular chamber was extraordinary, probably a little overemphasised. He had a little bit of an inflated view about the power of the parliament as distinct from the power exercised by others outside of this parliament. I am stating this as a matter of fact, not as a desirable proposition.
He of course placed numerous questions on notice and his questioning of ministers in this chamber was direct and well researched. He had a number of private members' bills prepared and tabled in this place. I would like to associate myself with my parliamentary colleagues in offering condolences to David's wife, Sue, to his family and extended family.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Former Senator David Bernard Vigor</title>,Condolences,5,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,1998-05-12,"—I would like to take the opportunity of this condolence motion to express my sympathy to the family of the late David Vigor. He was a hardworking senator, highly motivated, and had a huge capacity for hard work. His office in Parliament House was a mass of files, with a major shelving arrangement bisecting his room.
There are not many technocrats in this place. However, it is a lot richer for people like David Vigor and even Bruce Childs, who was another technocrat. Such people bring to this place a specialisation that makes people sit up and take notice when they talk.
Although he was here for only one term, David Vigor put much energy and enthusiasm into his work and placed many issues on the Senate agenda. It would take others 10 years to achieve such a record. His questioning at 
 estimates brought profound respect—the manner in which he researched his questions, the number of questions and the vast range of issues that he covered simply amazed many of his admirers as well as his detractors. I believe he made a significant contribution to this place. However, I do not think he realised all his expectations as a result of coming to the Senate, but I think few of us do. Certainly while David was here he enriched this place. He was one of those senators who people will long remember.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-05-12,"—I move:
That in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The failure of the Howard Government to set up an independent legally-constituted public inquiry into the serious allegations which have been made about the nature and extent of the Government's role in the waterfront dispute.
It is now clear that the Howard government has well and truly outsmarted itself with its plan to smash the Maritime Union of Australia. The plan has landed the government in the Federal Court facing conspiracy charges. There has been massive economic disruption on our docks. That disruption continues as everyone tries to unravel the mess Mr Reith has created. For weeks on the nightly news the community has been confronted with the images of guards with their faces covered and vicious dogs on chains. Australians are now far from relaxed and comfortable.
Let me remind the Senate of the details of the Reith plan that led to all this. Advice to Mr Reith on 27 February last year from Mr Derren Gillespie, Assistant Secretary, Industry Strategy Team, stated:
. . . a dispute would not, of itself, remove or alter MUA coverage, remove or suspend registration, or cancel the award or terminate any agreement . . . although it could provide the basis for taking action to one or more of those ends.
What would be needed for the MUA's influence on the waterfront to be significantly weakened would be for a range of affected service users and providers to take decisive action to protect or advance their interests.
Stevedores would need to activate well prepared strategies to dismiss their work force—
I repeat, `dismiss their work force'—
and replace them with another, quickly, in a way that limited the prospect of for example, the Commission ordering the reinstatement of the current work force.
The first problem with the Reith plan was that its success depended on conflict and division. The second problem with the Reith plan was the role required of the government. It was not a role of setting a policy and legal framework, as governments normally do. The government and the minister in particular had to be active participants in the implementation 
 of the plan. And the third problem with the Reith plan was that, in fact, it broke this government's own laws. That is now the major problem facing the government and Mr Reith.
The plan to dismiss an entire work force and replace it quickly is in breach Mr Reith's own Workplace Relations Act. The act specifically prohibits the termination of an employee's employment because the employee is a trade union member. The Prime Minister has, in effect, already confessed to this charge on national television. When asked why the entire Patrick work force was sacked, Mr Howard told A Current Affair:
They're all part of the one union.
One of the consequences of having a bargaining monopoly, ruthlessly used in the hands of the union that won't listen to reason, is that some innocent people get affected.
That means that people were sacked because they were members of a union. The sackings were also in breach section 170CL of the Workplace Relations Act, which requires prior notification to the CES of proposed sackings. The sackings were also in direct breach of the Stevedoring Industry Award 1991, which of course is a law of the Commonwealth. Clause 43 of that award specifically required Patricks to notify their employees and their union of any definite decision that is likely to	 have a significant effect on employees, including termination of employment, and it obliged Patricks to discuss such changes before they come into effect.
But don't just take my word on the question of the legality of the government's actions. Let me remind senators of the findings of Justice North which were upheld by the full bench of the Federal Court and then upheld by the full bench of the High Court. Justice North found that there was an arguable case that Patrick acted illegally by breaching employees' contracts of employment. There was an arguable case that Patricks breached the Workplace Relations Act by dismissing workers because they were members of a union. There was evidence that Patrick's owners and others agreed on the unlawful acts as part of an overall plan. There was an arguable case that Patrick's owners and 
 employer companies engaged in an unlawful conspiracy.
There was evidence that Patrick's owners and others agreed on the unlawful acts as part of an overall plan. There was an arguable case that Patrick's owners and employer companies engaged in an unlawful conspiracy. The Reith plan to beat the commission by getting rid of one work force and getting a new one in place quickly might have beaten the commission, but it did not beat the Federal Court.
Mr Reith now has another legal problem, again of his own making. The alleged conspirators—the Howard government being one of them—have to prove they are not guilty, rather than the MUA having to prove that they are. This arises from Mr Reith's own legislation. The explanatory memorandum tabled in parliament with the Workplace Relations Bill states that the section containing the freedom of association provisions reversed the onus of proof applicable to civil proceedings. Normally, the onus of proof would fall on the complainant to prove the charges, but not in this case. Mr Reith has certainly got himself and the government into an awful mess. The High Court highlighted the size of this mess. Chief Justice Brennan said:
If the damages consist of the lost earnings of the entire workforce for the rest of their working lives, one must wonder about the sufficiency of the defendant's assets.
That must be taken into consideration.
The question is conspiracy, and what remedy might be appropriate on an interlocutory basis when the case of conspiracy is mounted against a number of the defendants.
It would have regard to all the mitigating circumstances in relation to lost earnings, everything that would be relevant to the damage suffered by those series of individuals.
And Mr Justice McHugh said:
The damages in this case could be enormous and they could include punitive damages and that is something that has to be kept in mind.
This was not a plan prepared in haste. It was a strategy that was a long time in the making. It was carefully put together with the use of a large number of consultants starting in May 1996 when the then minister for transport, Mr 
 Sharp, convened talks in his office with a core group of players including Mr Andrew Robb, Mr David Trebeck and Mr Paul Houlihan.
Mr Trebeck's company, ACIL, was commissioned to develop a plan. That plan was handed to the government in August 1996. The central points of that plan were: how to keep the ports moving during a strike; how to hire new labour during an all-out stoppage; the legal aspects of banning secondary boycotts; the role of common law action; and how to target the MUA and highlight dock inefficiencies.
Mr Corrigan—we have heard a lot about him—was also involved in the plan. He met with Trebeck early in 1997. The option of mass sacking of Patrick's work force  was discussed at that meeting. Mr Corrigan said that the pair met at Patrick's Sydney offices to discuss options if the MUA took unilateral action over the sale of ANL. The senior public  servant responsible for waterfront policy, Mr Derryn Gillespie, met with Mr Corrigan on 25 February. Corrigan sought advice on how the new act could be used to weaken the MUA.
The Reith strategy was further developed through a second ACIL contract, awarded without a tender process being followed, on 20 June last year. The principal contractor was again Mr David Trebeck. But Mr Reith wanted Dr Stephen Webster involved. Greg Feeney, from the maritime branch of the department of workplace relations, advised the estimates committee on 12 November last year that Mr Sharp had instructed the department to engage Webster following meetings of the cabinet subcommittee established to look at maritime reform issues.
On 30 July Dr Webster was formally appointed as a consultant on waterfront reform to Reith but he was on Mr Sharp's payroll. In September, Liberal pollster Mark Textor's company, Australasian Research Strategies, was commissioned to provide a report to ACIL on community attitudes, at a cost of $42,000. He found that although waterfront was not a top of the mind issue there was strong concern over waterfront 
 efficiency, international competitiveness and hindrances to exports.
Another consultant and long-time Liberal Party election strategist, Jonathan Gaul, through his company, Canberra Liaison, used this research to develop a formal communications strategy. The strategy addressed ways for the government to convey concern about the privileged wharfies. John Howard claimed his government had reformed and changed the law. He said the climate now existed for companies to act in a way that they had not been able to act before. He did not mention plans to manipulate public opinion, however. Nor did he mention the government's strategy to get around key provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. This was a political campaign put together by political strategists.
Dr Webster then employed a number of other consultants, and the Reith plan was further refined. We are now told by Mr Wells from Fynwest, in a sworn statement, that Dr Webster kicked off the Dubai venture on 30 July, the day he officially started work for Mr Reith.
The first attempt by the minister for workplace relations to smash the MUA was launched in Cairns on 18 September last year. It was a disaster but, again, do not take my word for it. Let me quote Mr Greg Bondar, the former senior maritime adviser to Mr John Sharp, former minister. Mr Bondar is quoted in the Daily Commercial News as saying of Cairns:
It was initiated by Peter Reith's department but I think in a way it got out of hand.
So Mr Reith and Mr Sharp then moved on to plan B. They met in Melbourne with advisers to talk about waterfront reform on the same day—18 September. A key item on the agenda was the establishment of a new stevedore. The ever-present Dr Stephen Webster wanted to bring the NFF into the discussions. Within an hour, Ms Craik and Mr Ferguson were in the room. And, after some discussion, Craik and Ferguson agreed to consider setting up a new stevedoring company. Fancy that! Present at that meeting were Dr Alan Hawke, secretary of the department of transport and Dr David Rosalky, secretary of Reith's department.
The government, together with the NFF, launched plan C at Webb Dock on 27 January. But when the minister was asked whether he was aware of the NFF plan on the 7.30 Report that night he claimed not to know anything. He was asked:
Mr Reith, you are now telling me you did not know the National Farmers Federation had registered a stevedoring and training company?
Mr Reith answered:
No, I didn't know. Your people told me in the last twenty-four hours.
But the weekend edition of the Australian  newspaper later revealed that one of the architects of the NFF strategy and former consultant to Mr Reith and then to Mr Sharp, Mr Paul Houlihan, had briefed Mr Reith on 6 January. Houlihan was quoted as saying:
Reith was briefed on January 6. Even then we didn't spell out the details of the operation. But I have to add he was not unhappy with what we had to tell him.
And John Coombs told AAP on 28 January that the minister, Mr Reith, threatened him with the farmers at a meeting before Christmas. John Coombs said:
He taunted me with this information about farmers coming down to take over the waterfront on the last occasion I met with him in Melbourne before Christmas . . . 
It is also interesting indeed that Mr Paul Houlihan—one of the key architects of the Reith plan—just happened to be in the office of the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) when the Dubai plot was raised in parliament on 3 December. Mr Houlihan was reported as saying:
A cold clammy feeling ran down my spine as I took the call—
that is, from a journalist—
I was praying the reporter did not know where I was. If she did all hell would have broken loose.
Houlihan did not say why he was in Mr McLachlan's office. And what about Mr Corrigan and Dubai? Chris Corrigan was asked on 4 December whether his company would ever get involved in something like Dubai. He said:
Not really. It's just so hypothetical a proposition. I can't, I can't respond to it. 

He was not telling the truth, was he? And what about Mr Reith? He was asked:
Can you guarantee that no member of your staff, or your department, had any prior knowledge or involvement in the operation? If you cannot give this guarantee, will you undertake to make all the necessary inquiries and advise the House before we finish today?
Mr Reith said:
I am not going back to my office and have a Spanish inquisition with my secretaries, my staff, my this, my that. All I can tell you is that I knew nothing of this until I heard about it yesterday.
Well, he should have. And now we know that there were several meetings between Dr Webster, who was on his staff, and the Fynwest people. And there were sworn statements from a man who served this country with honour that Dr Webster was a key to the Dubai exercise. And there were clearly many meetings between Corrigan, Webster and the minister. Mr Reith said he regularly had talks with Corrigan but knew nothing of the Dubai venture until Corrigan confessed to his involvement.

"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,1998-05-12,"—This is another diversion by the Labor Party from the fundamental thing that the government is tackling—waterfront reform. Why are we tackling waterfront reform? I remind the Senate that Australia is a trading nation. We trade about 20 per cent of our GDP and most of that is in goods—there is only a small proportion in services—and over 95 per cent of those goods move over our wharves.
We were elected more than two years ago. One of our election promises and pledges to the community was that we would fix up the wharves, and we are about doing that. All Australians know that there have been rorts and inefficiencies on the Australian wharves for a long, long time. A lot of that inefficiency is tied up with the monopoly control by the MUA. This government has provided leadership and it is going on with the job of providing efficiency changes and reform on the waterfront. I add that the public fully supports the government's call for waterfront reform. We are doing the hard work needed to bring the waterfront up to world's best practice. 
Australia's ports are some of the least efficient and the most expensive in the world. The Productivity Commission's report of two weeks ago confirms that. Inefficiency is a burden to all in the nation. Australian exporters pay for this inefficiency as they struggle to compete against other nations with much more efficient ports. Part of our mandate when we were elected was to improve the waterfront, and that is what we are doing.
Our ports are the worst in value for money terms. For example, Adelaide may have crane rates of 21 lifts an hour, but it is also the most expensive port in the country. The average crane rate at our five major ports is 18.3 lifts per hour—the government benchmark is for a modest 25 lifts an hour. The main port in Thailand averages 30 lifts an hour. Working days lost on the waterfront are more than nine times those recorded across all industries, and injury and disease rates are four times those of the national average across all industries. Industrial disputes are 12 times higher than the national average and reached a peak under the Labor government in 1994.
In the meantime, the wharfies go home with salaries of $70,000-plus: compare that with average weekly earnings of $37,000. Pity the poor battlers on average weekly earnings and lower when they look at what the wharfies are getting: five weeks annual leave with 25 per cent holiday loading; 10 weeks cumulative sick leave that can be cashed in; two weeks extra leave every 15 weeks; subsidised meals at major cost; paid stop-work meetings; and clothing, laundry and telephone allowances. The Productivity Commission has revealed the overtime culture that the wharfies work to. The only time they work to world's best practice is when they can finish a shift and knock off early, or go do down to the pub, or go and watch a strip show.
Labor had 13 years to fix these problems. Back in the eighties they threw $420 million—of which $165 million was supplied by the taxpayer—on its WIRA reform process because it knew, and it confirmed to the public, that the waterfront was largely overstaffed. But that process was largely a waste of taxpayers' money; not much was changed. The only improvement has been in bulk grain 
 handling where we now have world's best practice. Why do we have that? Because we got rid of the MUA out of that process.
Labor cannot do anything about the wharves because it is still tied hand and foot to the MUA. Labor will not condemn the MUA's actions; Labor will not do anything about them. Regarding the dispute, Mr Beazley said on 19 April:
On the whole the union movement handled this quite well and I think they ought to go on handling it that way.
Quite well! This is after lots of confrontation. He thereby condoned children on the picket lines, unlawful picketing, defiance of Supreme Court injunctions and international threats made to Australia's trade. Between 1983 and 1996, the previous Labor government gave the unions nearly $92 million. In 1994-95, the unions received more than $16 million from the taxpayer funds of the Labor government. Labor is hamstrung and wants to stop our government from doing what Labor cannot—reforming the waterfront.
The government has put forward its seven benchmark objectives for the efficiency of the waterfront. The first objective is to end overmanning and restrictive work practices. The overmanning of container terminals is a major factor behind the restrictive work practices and resistance to change in the industry. Reducing the numbers will make a marked improvement in productivity. The government has put in place a very generous redundancy package worth up to $270,000 each to help wharfies made redundant in the process.
The second point is about higher productivity. We have commitments from the two major companies, P&O and Patricks, to achieve 25 container lifts per hour as a national average. This is not world's best practice, but it shows that the government is flexible and it is a marked improvement on 18. This is an intermediate target and we want to see this achieved within 12 months.
The third point relates to greater reliability through less disruption. Australia has a reputation for great unreliability through its wharves—it is near the bottom of world rankings. Greater reliability is crucial for the 
 shippers, and they will not achieve this unless we stop the disruption which we continually have had until now.
The fourth point relates to injury and fatality levels being reined back to the all industries average. Between 1991 and 1995, the actual response on the wharves was seven times the all industries figure,—seven times—and can be seen as a measure of poor practices on the waterfront. This is unacceptable to all Australians, and achieving this goal would be welcome as it would mean saving the lives of many Australians.
The fifth point is lower costs through the logistics chain of the waterfront gateway—in other words, the movements in and out of the wharves. The government has made a commitment to talk to state governments to examine ways of containing costs and improving the efficiency of those movements in and out of the wharves.
The sixth point goes to making full use of technology that is available to increase productivity. The major stevedoring companies have invested $400 million over the last three years and have done so with very little return. That equipment must be used efficiently for the benefit of everybody.
The seventh point relates to improved training. The government is prepared to commitment funds to training to maximise benefits flowing from the new technologies over the next three years. We will encourage stevedores to develop apprenticeships and training opportunities to enhance the overall pool of skills.
Senators, the waterfront reform is under way. The government, and I guess anyone who has had anything to do with the waterfront, always knew that it would be a very difficult process and that there would be lots of complications. And so it has proved. But the government is determined to proceed. We are making a commitment to the people that we will go on with the reform and make sure that there is improved efficiency on the waterfront. Already this week the major companies are signalling that they want major reductions in manning. Both P&O and Patricks are indicating that they can work the wharves efficiently with something like a one- 
third to one-half reduction in the number of people they employ on the wharves.
The government is committed to seeing this through. The first step it made when first coming to government was to change the law with regard to industrial relations and restore the secondary boycott legislation that the previous government had removed from the statutes. That change was made with the help of Cheryl Kernot. With that change, secondary boycotts are now outlawed. That has made a big difference and made possible an attack on the waterfront.
Patricks is to be congratulated for having a go at changing the waterfront practices. Sure, we do not agree with all the tactics that took place, but we always knew that it was going to be difficult. With hindsight, some of those tactics should perhaps have been better, but this is a difficult and dangerous game. Many of the people involved at the managerial level are under threat of physical violence. The government is committed to seeing this through.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-12,"—I rise to support the motion of Senator O'Brien. On the industrial relations and competition fronts, the Democrats see that there are five issues at stake: freedom of association, job security, monopolistic and restrictive practices, secondary boycotts and productivity reforms.
The Democrats oppose compulsory unionism. We also oppose compulsory non-unionism. Freedom of association is entrenched in the Workplace Relations Act, which means that workers can choose whether or not they wish to belong to a union. Under the act it is unlawful for an employer to make unionism or non-unionism a condition of employment.
I think it is important to note that the Employment Advocate has not, to this date, indicated that the MUA or the NFF practices are illegal. To date, neither the government's aggression against the MUA nor its support for the NFF has been dealt with by the Employment Advocate, who has responsibility for freedom of association provisions. However, these issues are being dealt with by the courts. 
Sacking workers because they belong to a union, sacking the good and the bad together, regardless of their work record and actual productivity, is clearly unethical; it is also illegal. Serious questions concerning the minister's and Patricks' alleged breaches of the letter and spirit of the act, of complicity in unfair and unlawful dismissals, are, as you know, currently before the courts.
The Democrats are strong supporters of job security. Volumes of research confirm that happy, secure, well-trained and well-managed employees with good working conditions and wages are not only much more productive but are much better for society as a whole. Claims that the Patricks group of companies contrived in-house job contractors and then turned them into bankrupt corporate hulks through slick legal and accounting footwork in order to evade their rights and responsibilities to employees are also before the courts. If those stratagems can be used by any unscrupulous employer, then every Australian employee is at risk. My expectation is that the courts will find such stratagems unlawful, but if not, then that legal loophole must be closed, and both Labor and the Democrats have indicated that they will move to do so.
The Democrats oppose private sector monopolies, oligopolies and cartels, whether they are in the hands of labour or capital. The wharves have been characterised by monopolistic and restrictive practices on both the labour and capital fronts. The MUA has a historical monopoly on the supply of labour but, in law—and we all recognise it—they now cannot prevent any employer employing non-union labour as well. On the company side, 16 of Australia's 46 ports are in the hands of various monopolies and nine are in the hands of various duopolies. Jeff Kennett does not oppose corporate monopolies, as we know from the Crown Casino. He feels the same way about duopolies, having prevented a third stevedoring company coming on to the Melbourne docks.
In an act of bias, and contrary to its own supposed commitment to competition, the government has been supportive of these practices on the capital side but has attacked them on the labour side—that is, until Peter 
 Costello came along. Just recently, both the federal and WA governments approved the reduction from two stevedoring employers down to one at Dampier Port.
The Democrats oppose secondary boycotts as an instrument of industrial action. The 1996 Workplace Relations Act retained Labor's laws, allowing the innocent third party to seek civil damages if a boycott damages their business. It introduced special protection against boycotts affecting international trade, but only if the boycott was not about employment related matters or issues such as consumer or environmental protests. By all accounts, the MUA has not infringed the secondary boycott provisions in the act.
 The Democrats support the advancement of productivity improvements on the wharves, but the government rhetoric has been way over the top and, in consequence, you have lost the support of the community. The lowest figure I have seen of potential benefits to Australia is $150 million, and the highest is $1 billion. Those figures are significant and important, but they are not critical.
Our bulk cargo movements rank with the world's best, and some container ports, such as Townsville, Burnie and Adelaide, were before this dispute very productive. At Fremantle, which has a way to go yet on productivity reform, costs per unit in cargo have decreased by 48 per cent in real terms over the past six years, with container trade per employee quadrupling over the same period. It is not true to say that there has been no productivity improvement. There have been significant productivity improvements over the past 10 years, and there are bound to be significant productivity improvements in the years to come.
There are two themes on the political front. The first theme is the coalition hard Right's frustration at being unable to forcibly crush union power on the wharves, until they found two willing waterfront union breakers—the farmers union and Patricks. Gaining absolute control over Australia's wharves is the coalition hard Right's dogma.
The second theme is a broader anti-unionism. Some powerful members of the coalition seem to have a strong prejudice 
 against unions and workers which descends into visceral hatred in some quarters. While not all Liberal and National supporters feel like that, the gloating and savage triumphalism of Mr Howard and Mr Reith at the loss of 1,400 union jobs reflected the views of many. The gloating was quickly suppressed when they realised it was bad public relations.
There are just two issues on the parliamentary and public interest front: have the minister and the Prime Minister been telling the truth in their answers to parliament; and have the partisan and prejudiced stance of the minister and the Prime Minister resulted in activities that have improperly committed the government and exposed them to the serious charge of unlawful conspiracy?
Let us understand that if that charge were found to stick in the courts, we would be in a constitutional crisis. Senator O'Brien, the mover of this motion, is quite right in saying that this issue therefore deserves proper investigation by either the government, the Senate or the House of Representatives.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-12,"—Think of a country where a work force is shut out from its lawful workplace; think of a country where troops or police are sent in against those workers; think of a country where greater rights are given to workers who illegally are put in to replace those workers with the assistance of dogs and police; think of a country where the government has laws in place that enable prosecutions to even be attempted for members of a union who communicate with other unions in other countries and communicate—or even think of communicating—that what is happening to them is illegal; think of a country that treats its workers and its own laws with contempt; and think of being able to proceed honourably with countries that treat their workers in that way for wishing the `crime' of acting collectively. I could be describing many countries in the developing world, but I am not. Unfortunately, I am describing Australia in the late 1990s.
I was down at the docks in Fremantle on a number of occasions over the last few weeks amongst people who included not only non- 
unionists but also small business people or unemployed people looking for work. It seems that, on a number of occasions, the attempt by this government to drive a wedge between one group of workers and the rest of the community has not worked. This wedge politics is about creating a situation to divert the attention from those people who are hurting: the larger group of working poor in our society who are being handed worse working conditions on a daily basis. They include the 300,000 people who last year were cut off benefits by this government and who have to work for whatever is available. This is the country we are talking about, and these are the issues that are recognised by all of those community members who joined with me and other people down at the docks in Fremantle and across the country. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Waterfront</title>,Matters of Urgency,13,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,1998-05-12,"—One of the things that is typically Australian—and we are fortunate indeed in this regard—is that commonsense prevails. Commonsense will prevail on the waterfront because it is in the best interests of Australia and everyday Australians that it does. Our aims in government are simple, honest and appropriate in the 1990s with respect to waterfront reform.
What do we want? We want a more productive waterfront, providing for the creation of more jobs in the wider community, more employment flexibility and more legitimacy, so that more shipping companies and potential customers will come here. It is all because productivity on the Australian wharves is far below our trading partners and worse than many Third World nations. In terms of container lifts, Thailand has 30 per hour; the Philippines, 29 per hour; Mozambique, 27 per hour; and Australia languishes at 18.5 per hour.
Next, we want to remove the Maritime Union of Australia's monopoly on waterfront labour. If you run the taxi driver test, you get two answers about the MUA: firstly, answers about violence and thuggery and, secondly, answers about continued rorts and strikes. Simply, the stevedoring industry has the second worst strike record of any industry in 
 Australia—after coalmining, which is another industry that has a sorry history of union manipulation at the expense of everybody else.
In 1997, stevedoring working days lost amounted to 930 per 1,000 employees, which is 12 times the national average. It is interesting to note that we have two per cent of world trade and 25 per cent of dock disputations. Well-known waterfront rorts indicate a work force which is out of control. Issues range from the petty, like going on strike about where the billiard table has been moved to—can you believe it?—to the outrageous, like delaying a ship to cause an extension of overtime and then nicking off before the ship is unloaded.
Next, we want to improve occupational health and safety because in that area the waterfront has the worst record of any industry in Australia. Most importantly, we want to provide for a fair day's pay for a fair day's work and we want to deal with overmanning. Australia's container terminals are overmanned by about 50 per cent. Basically this means that for every existing job you have 2½ people employed, with one doing the job—reasonably inefficiently, I suspect—and the other 1½ making sure that that wharfie does not work too hard.
On our commitment to a fair day's pay, I ask you, Mr Deputy President, to compare the MUA workers' average wage of $74,500 per annum with that of really important members of the community—real contributors to the community. For instance, nurses earn in the high $30,000s; middle-ranking police officers earn in the low $40,000s; and school teachers—the people who have the future of our children in their hands—earn about $40,000. But just remember that this day at Port Botany the meter reader is back at work earning $73,000 a year.
We have no desire to see the MUA—or, for that matter, any other union—destroyed. That will be determined by the good sense or otherwise of union leadership, but the MUA is a dinosaur in the modern global world and it has been for quite some time. Before the war, the Bulletin, a good left-wing magazine in those days, used to refer to the MUA as 
 `our foreign policy'. It was not until Hitler invaded its heartland—the Soviet Union—in June 1941 that the Federation of Waterside Workers actually started loading the ships properly for the war effort in World War II.
The MUA is generally a law unto itself. This has been shown to be true in the creation of the unlawful pickets in the current dispute. Mr Carr has made absolutely pathetic efforts to look for credibility somewhere. The most tragic leader of any state is today in South-East Asia telling them that New South Wales is a good place to do business because it has the competitive advantage. We will wait and see about that.
The MUA's philosophy can be summed up as being jobs for all or jobs for no-one. In the months leading up to this dispute the MUA workers were on strike and, after being sacked, they became very agitated. I remind the Senate that they offered to work for nothing. That is one for the history books.
—What about the illegal sackings?
—We see you, Senator Mackay, hand in glove with the MUA—with their rorts and their closed shop. Mr Tanner, the shadow minister for transport, who is more intelligent than you, and probably franker and more practical, allegedly made this aside to Laurie Oakes: `How can we defend the indefensible?'
—Order! Remarks should be addressed through the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is time for Mr Beazley to do what he knows is right. He should repudiate the MUA's record of violence and he should support the ALP's now forgotten Hobart resolution to allow new stevedores to operate the Australian wharves. He should also repudiate a typically stupid comment by Mr Gareth Evans who said, `So what if the inefficiencies cost another $50 per container!' I will tell you what that means: it means $100 million, and that is a lot of money that could be used to create jobs and to make a profit for producers and exporters.
As a government, we never assumed that it would be easy to reform the waterfront, but we said we would and we will. Dealing with a powerful, cornered and rich union with a monopoly was never going to be easy. Margaret Thatcher took over seven years to reorganise the labour arrangements in the British coal industry. At that time, public opinion and support for her reform program fluctuated, as it has in this dispute. But one thing is sure: this government is resolved to do what is right.
I would like to make two brief final comments. Firstly, I have a word of support for the Patrick company. It has been brave enough to do something that should have been done 25 or even 60 years ago. At great personal cost and at great personal risk—which is especially evident if you read some of the threats made against them over the last few weeks—they will achieve the reforms that we want. P&O's decision to move makes it surer than ever that the waterfront will never be the same again. The game is up for the MUA. It should realise that. Congratulations to P&O for coming in—although a little belatedly, I might say—and acting in a way that is appropriate and is in the best interests of the company and in the best interests of Australia.
Secondly, I note the proud record of the NFF and all Australian primary producers generally in bringing reform to the waterfront and to other industrial relations areas—including the live sheep dispute, the wide combs dispute and Mudginberri.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-05-12,"—I find it interesting that not one coalition speaker on the urgency motion on the waterfront today has addressed the substantive issues that were raised. We have heard the usual stuff about how they are all about waterfront reform, but not once have they mentioned the illegality of the sackings. Why? Because it is indefensible. Let's have a look at some of the facts. Let's look at how the government spent $1.3 million of taxpayers' money on secret waterfront consultancies.
Fact: in April 1996, the government commissioned a consultancy to determine the views and concerns of industry about waterfront reform and to provide a strategy for the implementation of the government's reform agenda. Fact: in May 1996, the first ACIL contract was awarded with no tender process. Dr David Trebeck was asked to begin discussions with various industry groups and port users about their needs, and Mr Paul Houlihan was asked to look at the industrial relations situation in each port.
Fact: in June 1996, the draft ACIL report was completed. Fact: on 18 September 1996, the ACIL report was completed and received by the government. We are aware of some of its contents, and I think Senator O'Brien has already covered that. Fact: on 20 June, the second ACIL contract was awarded, again without a tender process being followed, and the principal contractor was again Dr David Trebeck.
Let us have a look at the existence and content of the now infamous departmental minute. Fact: a departmental minute in February to Minister Reith from Derren Gillespie entitled `Meetings with stevedore employers' describes in detail what happened on the waterfront, with absolutely astounding prescience, I believe. Fact: the minute advises Minister Reith not to commit to any strategy but draw out the employers' commitment to reform and their assessment of risk.
Let us look at the government's refusal to produce the ACIL consultancy reports. Fact: the government has consistently refused to produce the ACIL consultancy reports, despite the Senate asking the government to do so. The government has given the usual old excuse—commercial-in- confidence, cabinet-in-confidence; `whatever it takes we don't want to give you the documents.' Finally, let us look at how the Dubai debacle was finally exposed. Fact: the story broke that a $20 shelf company was set up by Mr Wells and Mr Kilfoyle to recruit people in Dubai as an alternative work force on the waterfront.
Let us look at how this government is inextricably linked to Dubai. Let us look at Minister Reith's total misleading of the people of Australia on the 7.30 Report, a 
 matter that was questioned today in question time. Fact: despite clamming up on 27 January and saying that he did not know anything about the Dubai debacle prior to the ABC informing him, Paul Houlihan informs us that Minister Reith was actually briefed on 6 January and was `not unhappy with what we had to tell him'. Question: who is telling the truth here—Mr Houlihan or Mr Reith? Question: what was the minister so happy about? I think we now know what the minister was so happy about.
Let us look at the claims that the government knew nothing about the Dubai debacle. Fact: the sworn affidavit by Mr Mike Wells, former director of Fynwest, claims that Dr Webster telephoned Wells on 30 July 1997 and asked him to contact Chris Corrigan about a possible job. Fact: the sworn affidavit claims that Dr Stephen Webster, a government consultant on waterfront reform, told Mr Wells that he was doing a special job for John Howard. Fact: this discussion occurred on the very day Dr Webster took up the $1,000 a day consultancy to advise the federal government on waterfront reform—a consultancy which resulted in a report which still remains secret, despite the Senate directing the government to table the information.
Question: what was the special job? Question: who was behind the Dubai scheme? Question: what was the involvement of the government? Question: did the government provide any moneys or support for the plan? Question: what was the nature of this contact? Question: did Dr Webster brief Minister Reith on his discussions with Mr Wells? Question: did Dr Webster talk to anybody else about the matter? Answer: this government does not want the people of Australia to know. Question: what does this government have to hide?
Fact: on 7 August Michael Wells telephoned Stephen Webster to advise him of his meeting with Corrigan. Webster asked if Wells could recruit the people he sought. Wells said, `Yes, sure.' Of course he could. Fact: on 5 September 1997 Wells telephoned Stephen Webster and advised him everything was in place to proceed with the Dubai operation. Dr Webster advised that as everything was okay it was probably not wise to 
 contact him again unless Mr Wells had a particular problem. Fact: at all times, Mr Wells states, he believed that Dr Webster was reporting back to the federal government.
Question: is Mr Wells's statement correct? Question: if not, why doesn't this government hold an inquiry to clear itself? Answer: because this government is in it up to its neck and it does not want the people of Australia to know the actual truth. Question: what does this government have to hide? Fact: it is alleged that discussions occurred before 3 December, the date when Minister Reith told parliament the government was unaware of the Dubai scheme, and that Dr Webster had had detailed discussions regarding this.
Fact: documents obtained by the Age allegedly confirm that Mr Wells placed several calls to Dr Webster. Mr Wells claims that this was about the Dubai recruitment. Phone records and diary notes reveal a series of contacts between a key government adviser and the Dubai organisers.
Fact: according to reports in the Weekend Australian on Saturday, 9 May, `a key government adviser has admitted having a series of discussions with organisers of the Dubai training scheme, but said they had nothing to do with the secret plan to break the waterfront union'. The Weekend Australian of 9-10 May reported that Dr Webster stated that `not only had he never discussed the plan to replace MUA members with former soldiers, he advised against it'. To whom did he advise against it? That is another question.
The story gets more intriguing. Dr Webster confirms that he has had several conversations with Mr Wells, but Dr Webster's version of events is that the conversations concerned arranging a chauffeur and a bodyguard for Mr Pratt. Apparently the reason for this series of calls was that Mr Pratt had decided to hire the person full time. What an absolute joke! It gets more intriguing.
Question: the telephone calls apparently took place. Exactly what was the nature of the telephone calls? Question: why are Mr Wells's and Dr Webster's stories inconsistent? Question: was Mr Reith briefed on the communications between Mr Wells and Dr Webster? Answer: the government does not 
 want the people of Australia to know. The government does not want to answer this. Question: what has this government got to hide?
Let us have a look at Mr Downer's office and its link to Dubai. Fact: according to information, if passports were not issued promptly the personnel were simply to mention a Mr Tweddell of Mr Downer's office, after which passports were issued within hours of their application—a couple of hours, as I understand.
Let us look at what have now become Mr Corrigan's quite clear lies with regard to funding Dubai. Fact: the documents assert Mr Corrigan fully funded the Dubai plan in contradiction of his sworn evidence before the AIRC. Fact: Commonwealth Bank statements dated 9 January 1998 obtained by the Age show that Patrick Stevedores deposited $140,000 into Fynwest's bank account. Wells states that Corrigan totally funded the Dubai operation. Under oath before the AIRC, Corrigan said that he had no financial involvement in Dubai except for leasing some equipment. Corrigan denied any knowledge or involvement until he owned up in early February this year.
Let us look at Mr Reith acknowledging the secret discussions he had with industry with regard to this. Fact: Mr Wells has stated that at all times Mr Corrigan made it clear that he, Mr Corrigan, had the support of the federal government and that he was reporting back to the federal government. Fact: Mr Reith has confirmed that the government had canvassed with Patrick Stevedores throughout last year the option of replacing its unionised work force. Fact: the Age on 9 May reported that Minister Reith said, `There were certainly discussions about what could be done, but as to what he [Corrigan] was intending to do or thought he would do that was always a matter for him.' Question: what communications did Minister Reith or anybody associated with Minister Reith have with Mr Corrigan? Question: what was discussed with regard to those?
The allegations in the affidavits are very serious. No government would want them on the public record without having an inquiry so 
 that they can be repudiated. It is simply not good enough for Minister Reith to claim in respect of Dubai, as he did yesterday, that he is not sure that anyone actually came up with the idea. That is probably the most astounding statement. I think you start to absolutely lose the plot when you start making those kinds of statements.
 The Australian people deserve to know to what extent, if any, this government was involved in creating the environment for the waterfront dispute. They deserve to know. Ten out of 11 judges agree that there is a case to be answered. We already know from Mr Howard that one of the reasons for the dispute was that the workers were union members. I restate what I think Senator Murray said. The Employment Advocate has had no communication with Minister Reith's office with regard to an alleged breach of the freedom of association provisions on the waterfront—not a single communication. In fact, he routinely has a barrage of complaints from Minister Reith's office to his office saying, `Please investigate this closed shop or that closed shop'—every closed shop in Australia except the one they allege, which is the one on the waterfront.
 Questions that should have been answered include: who is behind the Dubai scheme? Where would the men be put to work? What was the involvement of the government? Did the government provide any moneys or support for the plan? The government has had regular contact with P&O and Patricks during the industrial dispute. What was the nature of this contact? Did Dr Webster advise Minister Reith on 5 September last year that all was in place to proceed with the Dubai operation?
Question: why does the government not want an inquiry? Answer: this government does not want an inquiry because it does not want the people to know what the truth of the matter is. Answer: this government is in this scandal up to its back teeth. Answer: this government is involved, I allege, in a conspiracy of gargantuan proportions. It does not believe it can defend itself. It does not believe it has a case to answer despite criminal proceedings going ahead in various legal forums. This government is running scared. 
 Not one single coalition minister has been able to answer in either chamber today allegations directly related to this matter. The bottom line is that this government cannot and will not put itself at risk, but it cannot defend itself in terms of a process that is open and transparent. I commend the motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Waterfront</title>,Matters of Urgency,13,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,1998-05-12,"—Senator O'Brien calls for a public inquiry into the nature and extent of the government's role in the waterfront dispute. He alleges, for example, that the conspirators—and one assumes that he includes the government in that—have to prove that they are not guilty rather than the MUA having to prove that they are. That would be an easy task for the MUA because they are guilty as charged: charged with the crime of presiding basically slothlike over an overmanned, inefficient, indefensible waterfront.
 The allegations about the government are very interesting. As the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has said, we will plead guilty to conspiracy because we have encouraged reform on the waterfront. He said, `Let's have a conspiracy. Let's fix up the waterfront.' In fact, he said that he will write a book on how we conspired to fix up the Australian waterfront. What he said, and what is absolutely right and what those opposite are choosing to ignore, is that most Australians would say—and they are saying in polls—that it is about time somebody did something to encourage the employers to finally fix up the rorts, the overmanning and the excesses which have plagued this country for years.
 In moving this motion the opposition calls for an inquiry. We can only presume that they are hoping the inquiry will not even glance in their general direction, because it would find a closeness of relationship that would defy even the most vivid imagination. What a public inquiry would find is a relationship between the MUA and those opposite that is extraordinary in the extreme. We have journalists, for example, saying that Labor is drafting affidavits for the MUA.
I think I heard Senator Conroy use the phrase `up to their necks'. It is the Labor 
 Party that is up to its neck in a conspiracy with the MUA by running their campaign. It has been given research by the MUA so that the MUA can tell it what to say publicly on their behalf. They demanded of Mr Beazley that he oppose voluntary unionism on the waterfront so that they can retain their monopoly and so that crane drivers can earn $90,000 for about 14 hours a week.
The MUA dictated to Mr Beazley what his policy will be and he, like a very good boy, has publicly announced that they will repeal the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Why is that? Because the MUA like to have a monopoly. Mr Beazley is going to remove the one sanction that there is against them, in spite of their ability in the past to hold this country to ransom with the stranglehold of their monopoly holding up trade. Just what are the links that we would suggest are a conspiracy between the Labor Party and the MUA? What about the commitments given secretly by the Labor Party to the MUA about policy? What about the involvement of senior members of the Labor Party with the MUA? What about the deals with senior frontbenchers of the Labor Party to publicly encourage people to break state laws and injunctions issued by state supreme courts? You want a full public inquiry but you cannot have a full public inquiry because, as you well know, the matter is already before the courts. The ALP is obviously aware that the MUA has made allegations against the government with regard to the events on the waterfront.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—They do not want to listen, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I am not going to stop. These issues cannot be the subject of an inquiry until the legal matters have been concluded.
—So you have joined the uglies in New South Wales!
—You would not have to move very far, Senator Carr. The reality is that the companies involved in this dispute have already suffered significant damage as a result of the industrial campaign run by the MUA, and they will continue to face those significant challenges—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Conroy and Senator Carr, we might proceed with some decorum.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. They will continue to face significant challenges to comply with the orders of the High Court. This is an industry that was in need of urgent reform. It takes leadership, not only from the companies involved but also from the government, to fix it. It is up to the MUA and the ALP as to whether they want to be part of that process or whether they want to continue to sabotage the Australian waterfront.
It seems to me that it is very easy to ignore the facts here. We can call for inquiry after inquiry. You can keep doing that, but ultimately the High Court, in part 64 of its decision, said:
As the orders made by North J. were not subject to the power of the administrators to determine whether or not to resume trading by the employer companies, there was an appealable error which can and will be rectified by the insertion of an appropriate qualification.
The government will support the administrator in that task and will give the administrator the authority necessary to manage the affairs of the company. But what about the MUA? Oh no, it considers itself above the law in that regard. It does not consider itself as required to abide by that resolution of the High Court. Let us return to the government's key policy objectives—that is, the achievement of real competition on the waterfront and fixing up the problems which have delivered this country such a poor international reputation. Those opposite have alleged that the government's role in this issue is somehow nefarious, somehow underhanded.
—Nefarious—it's criminal!
—What the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business said in this regard is instructive. He said that, in the end, what we face is a situation where we have an unproductive waterfront and there are commercial pressures on the parties to do better than what they have done. The government's role has been to facilitate and 
 encourage reform. As previous governments have done, we have a structure in place to help the companies meet the government's national policy objectives.
I would like to refer briefly to the position of business in, for example, my own state of New South Wales. Today's statement by the Executive Director of the New South Wales State Chamber of Commerce, Katie Lahey, is instructive and a good indicator in this regard. More than 70 per cent of businesses surveyed by the New South Wales State Chamber of Commerce have indicated that they feel that the current situation on the waterfront will result in an improvement in waterfront efficiency and that is what they are looking for.
Some 150 businesses across New South Wales were surveyed and only nine per cent were confident that the Maritime Union of Australia was legitimately committed to efficiency on the waterfront. Some 51 per cent of respondents said they had confidence in the federal government's handling of the dispute. When asked about the picket line situation, 88.7 per cent of respondents had no confidence in the New South Wales state government's handling of the issue—an instructive piece of information for the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr. As Katie Lahey, an executive director of an important chamber of commerce in this country, said:
It is obvious that the business community is firmly behind the process of reform and although the dispute has had a significant impact are keen to see real change.
The government is determined to push ahead with waterfront reform in Australia and that determination is in no way diminished. (Time expired)

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-05-12,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Obviously, I welcome the findings of the Auditor-General, particularly his clear and unequivocal statement:
. . . the NHT decision-making process is fundamentally sound in providing transparency and rigour and there was no evidence of systemic bias in the allocation of funds to projects.
This inquiry was instigated after a demand by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, who thought he could achieve some short-term political benefit not only at the expense of the government but also at the expense of the Natural Heritage Trust and, therefore, the 
 commitment of so many thousands of Australians who are contributing to wrestling with Australia's natural resource problems. In effect, they are overcoming and remedying damage that has been done in the past and putting in place better processes to ensure the sustainable management of those resources with proper conservation for the future.
Another finding in the Auditor-General's report is that in the overwhelming majority of cases the reasons for rejecting or varying state and territory recommendations were adequately documented and related to the published decision-making criteria. Even though the Auditor-General noted that there were a small number of cases which could have been better documented he found that there was satisfactory oral advice as to the background and reasons for the decisions in all cases. He confirmed that the reasons behind decisions taken by the ministerial board were sound and related to the board's desire to see more money go to community groups instead of state government agencies and more money go towards projects on the ground and outcomes.
He also examined those projects which had not been recommended by regional or state 
 assessment processes. I mention in particular the Baillieu family from whom the opposition sought to make some political mileage. He found that of the 16 such projects that can be classified by electorate, interestingly nine were in Labor seats and only seven in coalition seats. More importantly, he found that each of these projects met the published eligibility criteria for funding under the trust. He acknowledged that most of these projects were incorrectly assessed by the regional and state panels as ineligible. In other words, that is exactly what we said in this place.
He confirmed also, as we have been saying all along, that the major programs of the Natural Heritage Trust are aimed at the major environmental problems which are found in rural areas, which is why most of the money was going to rural areas. I have reminded the Senate before that, if 90 per cent of rural seats are held by the coalition, it is not surprising that in this instance that is where the money ends up. As I have said before, it was exactly where the money ended up when Labor administered its much smaller scheme when in government—something that Labor conveniently forgot when it decided to attack the coalition in this instance.
He also states that the number and value of project applications from coalition seats were significantly higher than from Labor seats. I have mentioned that. He found that rural communities are well organised and more familiar with the types of programs being run by the trust. Therefore, he put forward some suggestions that will encourage a broader range of applications in the future, and we will, of course, take up those suggestions. We already are, by the appointment of facilitators, trying to extend beyond the original landcare groups to other groups the capacity to make applications and quality applications. We accept these suggestions he made for improvements.
He said he would like to see more biodiversity experts on the panels. We have already put that in place. We acknowledged from the start that that was necessary, and this year's regional assessment panels will be better represented in that regard, as will the state assessment panels. He wanted us to 
 further communicate the emphasis the Commonwealth was placing on particular selection criteria. We have already done that this year through our letters and other published material to the states and to regional and other organisations.
These findings are a complete vindication of the government's actions in relation to the Natural Heritage Trust. I would like to put on the record too that they are a vindication of my departmental staff as well. The professionalism of the departmental staff in properly documenting all the decisions that were made should be commended.
It is a matter of great regret that literally tens of thousands of dollars of public money has now been wasted as a result of this Labor Party attempt to gain some political points when they knew they were never there in the first place. A lot of extra work had to be put in by departmental officers to meet the opposition's demands. Nevertheless that was duly done. In summary, this report is, therefore, a damning indictment of the Labor Party's politically motivated muckraking.
The most important thing now is for Senator Faulkner in this place, who I am pleased has come in here, to finally have the intestinal fortitude to apologise to the Baillieu family for so unjustly and maliciously defaming them in an attempt to try to attack us. We demonstrated in this place there was no foundation at all for his attacks on the Baillieu family. He accused them of colluding with us for their financial advantage. He accused some of those who have actually been dead for decades of colluding with us for financial advantage. It has been demonstrated that he failed to exercise any or due care in his attacks on those individuals.
It is time that he had the stomach, as I said, to come in here and apologise for doing that to that innocent family who are prepared to commit part of their land to protect important remnant vegetation in the public interest. For that, what did they get? They got attacked and abused by Senator Faulkner under the privilege of this place.
Now the Auditor-General has shown that there was no basis for that attack, surely the time is there for Senator Faulkner, if he is to 
 demonstrate any sort of leadership at all of the Labor Party in the Senate, to be willing to now stand up and say to the Baillieu family, `I'm sorry. I missed it. I got it wrong.' That would be the least he could do to demonstrate that sort of leadership to those of the Australian community who are prepared to make this commitment to better environmental practice.
I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that some 6,000 different groups or individuals made applications under the first full year of this trust, which demonstrates how many Australians out there do want to contribute to better environmental management. By apologising to the Baillieus, he can indicate to those Australians that he recognises finally that the Natural Heritage Trust is a sound investment in Australia's environment. In fact, it is the largest investment by any Australian government in rectifying the damage that has been done to the Australian environment.
Senator Faulkner could finally be prepared to come on the record and say, `It's true. It is a good investment. The Labor Party recognises it. We fought it up hill and down dale. We opposed the funding basis for it. We said it would not work. We tried to rip the guts out of it in the attacks on the ministerial board. We even got the Auditor-General to assist us in that task. It has been demonstrated now publicly and with authority that there was no foundation at all for our baseless attacks. We're now prepared to get behind the trust and help make it work.'
If Senator Faulkner was prepared to get up here today and say that, he would actually be contributing to the good of Australia, which would be something of a change from what we usually get. Apart from that, if he does not get that far but at least apologises to the Baillieus, it would be a small step in the right direction.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,16,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-05-12,"—Audit Report No. 42 1997-98: Preliminary inquiries into the Natural Heritage Trust  very much vindicates the opposition's highlighting of the funding imbalance, where $9 out of every $10 went to coalition electorates. In his report, the Auditor-General states that neither DPIE or Environment Australia chal 
 lenges Labor's analysis. This report also confirms Labor's highlighting of the degree of ministerial intervention into the process. It also states that, notwithstanding the circulation of extensive eligibility and selection criteria:
. . . the emphasis placed on particular criteria by the Ministers was greater than expected by applicants, RAPs, SAPs, State and Territory Ministers and the Departments for the 1997-98 funding round.
In other words, the published criteria cannot explain the decisions that the ministers made. We were absolutely right in pointing out the unrepresentative nature of the panel composition, and the ministers themselves have agreed to make changes to that for the next round.
Our concerns that the Natural Heritage Trust must be improved if the environmental priorities, rather than the political priorities, are to be addressed are vindicated by this report. This report is not a clearance, as the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, reckons. In fact, the ANAO concludes, `There is scope to enhance the geographic reach.' As far as the selection process is concerned, the opposition stresses that this report indicates that the flaws in this program flow from the structure of the selection process.
What we have here is a scheme at the mercy of a submission-driven process which was grafted on to some existing rural landcare and catchment programs. A national government proposing a national scheme intended to address national problems should have ensured that funds went to all areas of need and should have avoided a situation where those already established groups were able to take advantage of the first round. By the time the ministers and the Australian National Audit Office acknowledged the imbalance in the representation on the community panels, the first round of funding—almost $200 million—had underwritten the coalition's political imperatives in the electoral cycle.
One of the concerns which the opposition had and which we put vigorously was the level of intervention by Senator Hill once the recommendations were put to him after this exhaustive, costly and independent process 
 had taken place. We recognise that the Auditor-General addressed himself to this particular concern and, given that Senator Hill invited me to comment on it, we note the very guarded language the Auditor used in reference to the Woodhouse Pastoral Company project or, if you like, the Baillieu family project. Let me go to that in the Auditor's report. The report states:
Project		 Protection of significant natural estate remnant vegetation..
Proponent 		 Woodhouse Pastoral Co
. . .              . . .             . . .
SAP Assessment	 Rated ineligible.
. . .              . . .             . . .
NHT Guidelines 	 Assistance for on-ground activities by individuals on private land will only be available where there is a `clear and substantial public benefit' (Funding for individuals is only available in the 1997-98 round)
This is what the Auditor said. This is the great clearance that Senator Hill talks about. This is what he wants apologies for. Listen to what the Auditor said about this shonky operation from Senator Hill. He said:
While on balance the project would appear to be eligible, judgement is required to interpret the extent to which there is a `clear and substantial public benefit'.
The Auditor went on, and this is what he said about this shonky grant:
The evidence would appear to support the eligibility for the project . . . 
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Congratulations to the Auditor-General for those verbal gymnastics to deal with what is a very contentious project. The Auditor-General acknowledges some projects did result from direct representations from the proponent to the Minister for the Environment, but there is no light shed at all on who sought and who obtained ministerial approval for the shonky Woodhouse project. None at all. The minister, under direct questioning in this chamber, has never offered an answer on those issues about this shonky project. He has never been able to offer an answer.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—We still want to know who sought and obtained ministerial approval for this rort and shonk that Senator Hill has been responsible for. I have got to say that, in this context, it is worth noting—
—Order! Senator Faulkner, I do not seek to interrupt you at the moment, but I think it would be appropriate that, if people are so interested in this matter—as senators obviously are—we endeavour to hear the statements of the respective senators in silence. I should also remind senators that it is only appropriate for them to speak when they are seated in their own place. I call Senator Faulkner.
—In this context, it is worth noting—(Quorum formed)  As I was saying, in this context, it is worth noting that the ANAO chose not to examine the records from the office of the ministers, which, of course, had it been done, would have shed light on the issue of who sought and obtained ministerial approval. But our concerns on funding dispersal ratios are vindicated in table 6. I draw the attention of everyone who is interested to table 6 on page 21 of the report. If you want to follow the matter, have a look at the table. I will come back to it if I have time.
Perhaps the most notable defect in the Auditor-General's report is his failure even to address, let alone pass any judgment on, Senator Hill's extraordinary practice of involving his backbench colleagues in the decision-making process—a practice that we were able to prise out of Senator Hill at the estimates hearings last year. Why did Senator Hill find it necessary to involve Senator Crane in making decisions about trust fund grants in Western Australia? Why did he fly Mr Billson to Adelaide to assist with the Victorian grant? Why was Senator Eggleston in the room? Any reader of this report looking for answers to those questions, for the Auditor's view of the propriety of Senator Hill's actions, would be very severely disappointed. He did not even look at it and he did not even address it.
The processes associated with the selection of the NHT projects may well have been transparent, but so is the inherent political 
 bias of those processes. Notwithstanding this report, the opposition remains very concerned at the skewed outcomes of the first round of funding under the multi-million dollar program. We hope and expect that the changes that the Auditor-General has recommended will produce more equitable outcomes in the second round.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—I say this to the Senate: go to table 6 on page 21. This is what you will read about ministerial approvals by political parties. Number and percentage of projects: Coalition—87.1 per cent; Labor—8.4 per cent; Independent—4.5 per cent. Value of ministerial approvals: Coalition—90 per cent; Labor—we go down here—4.6 per cent; Independent—5.3 per cent. Average value of the projects: Coalition—$46,500; Labor—$25,000; Independent—$52,500.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order!
—Senator Hill has been involved in one of the greatest shonks and one of the greatest rorts we have seen since this government has been elected, and that is saying something in a government of shonks and a government of rorters. Senator Hill stands condemned for this program.
(Time expired)
—Before I call Senator Alston, can I remind senators on both sides, as I said earlier, that there seems to be a degree of interest in this matter and it would be more appropriate if we were able to hear what was being said. I remind senators again that it is not appropriate—in fact, is a breach of standing orders—to speak or interject when they are not sitting in their own place.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,16,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-05-12,"—Senator Faulkner's departure from the chamber, I think, says it all. Quite clearly, he is not the slightest bit interested in the findings of this report, which are a devastating indictment of the Labor Party's approach. This gives not only Senator Hill but the process a clean bill of health. 
 You are not interested in the slightest in the findings. In fact, what Senator Faulkner had to say was, `Notwithstanding this report, we remain concerned.' That says it all. What he is saying is that, irrespective of the evidence and irrespective of the findings of an independent arbiter—the Auditor-General who is brought in to check these things and who gives it a tick on all counts—you are interested only in the gutter.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—It speaks volumes for your ethical standards and codes of practice. This will haunt you at election time because you have had 2½ years in the gutter, you have passed up innumerable opportunities to get into the policy game and you have decided not to do it.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Order! Senator Conroy!
—But these things come back to bite you. You think you can get a cheap shot on the way through but it comes back. When you find, time and again, that these sorts of slurs are baseless, then your credibility is what suffers, not Senator Hill's and not the Bailleau family's.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order!
—We long ago abandoned any prospect of Senator Faulkner having the guts or the decency, because it is not in his nature. His approach is: you never concede, you never apologise and you just plough on regardless.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order!
—You might be the biggest buffoon or dolt who has ever been elected to this chamber, but you think that somehow political progress consists of actually—
—Order! I am quite sure there is a lot of interest in this matter. It is a broadcast day and members of the public might be interested in 
 what people in this place have got to say. It would be appropriate that we do allow them to have some chance of hearing what people have to say.
—I am very conscious of the fact that I have got one minute left. The public ought to know that this decision-making process has been found by the Auditor-General to be fundamentally sound in providing transparency and rigour. There is no evidence of systemic bias in the allocation of funds to projects. The Auditor-General has gone through all of these muckraking allegations and found that they are completely baseless. The attack on the Bailleau family is utterly disgraceful and indefensible. It could not possibly have been made outside this chamber, because you know you would have the pants sued off you. You do it nonetheless, under parliamentary privilege, because you think there is some cheap political mileage in somehow slandering those who are outside the political process.
This has not worked. You have been exposed. We never expected anything more of Senator Faulkner, because he has made it perfectly plain by his conduct that he would never apologise, irrespective of the circumstances. So we are not surprised, but I think the public will give you your award in due course.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-05-12,"—Audit Report No. 42 1997-98: Preliminary inquiries into the Natural Heritage Trust  very much vindicates the opposition's highlighting of the funding imbalance, where $9 out of every $10 went to coalition electorates. In his report, the Auditor-General states that neither DPIE or Environment Australia chal 
 lenges Labor's analysis. This report also confirms Labor's highlighting of the degree of ministerial intervention into the process. It also states that, notwithstanding the circulation of extensive eligibility and selection criteria:
. . . the emphasis placed on particular criteria by the Ministers was greater than expected by applicants, RAPs, SAPs, State and Territory Ministers and the Departments for the 1997-98 funding round.
In other words, the published criteria cannot explain the decisions that the ministers made. We were absolutely right in pointing out the unrepresentative nature of the panel composition, and the ministers themselves have agreed to make changes to that for the next round.
Our concerns that the Natural Heritage Trust must be improved if the environmental priorities, rather than the political priorities, are to be addressed are vindicated by this report. This report is not a clearance, as the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, reckons. In fact, the ANAO concludes, `There is scope to enhance the geographic reach.' As far as the selection process is concerned, the opposition stresses that this report indicates that the flaws in this program flow from the structure of the selection process.
What we have here is a scheme at the mercy of a submission-driven process which was grafted on to some existing rural landcare and catchment programs. A national government proposing a national scheme intended to address national problems should have ensured that funds went to all areas of need and should have avoided a situation where those already established groups were able to take advantage of the first round. By the time the ministers and the Australian National Audit Office acknowledged the imbalance in the representation on the community panels, the first round of funding—almost $200 million—had underwritten the coalition's political imperatives in the electoral cycle.
One of the concerns which the opposition had and which we put vigorously was the level of intervention by Senator Hill once the recommendations were put to him after this exhaustive, costly and independent process 
 had taken place. We recognise that the Auditor-General addressed himself to this particular concern and, given that Senator Hill invited me to comment on it, we note the very guarded language the Auditor used in reference to the Woodhouse Pastoral Company project or, if you like, the Baillieu family project. Let me go to that in the Auditor's report. The report states:
Project		 Protection of significant natural estate remnant vegetation..
Proponent 		 Woodhouse Pastoral Co
. . .              . . .             . . .
SAP Assessment	 Rated ineligible.
. . .              . . .             . . .
NHT Guidelines 	 Assistance for on-ground activities by individuals on private land will only be available where there is a `clear and substantial public benefit' (Funding for individuals is only available in the 1997-98 round)
This is what the Auditor said. This is the great clearance that Senator Hill talks about. This is what he wants apologies for. Listen to what the Auditor said about this shonky operation from Senator Hill. He said:
While on balance the project would appear to be eligible, judgement is required to interpret the extent to which there is a `clear and substantial public benefit'.
The Auditor went on, and this is what he said about this shonky grant:
The evidence would appear to support the eligibility for the project . . . 
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Congratulations to the Auditor-General for those verbal gymnastics to deal with what is a very contentious project. The Auditor-General acknowledges some projects did result from direct representations from the proponent to the Minister for the Environment, but there is no light shed at all on who sought and who obtained ministerial approval for the shonky Woodhouse project. None at all. The minister, under direct questioning in this chamber, has never offered an answer on those issues about this shonky project. He has never been able to offer an answer.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—We still want to know who sought and obtained ministerial approval for this rort and shonk that Senator Hill has been responsible for. I have got to say that, in this context, it is worth noting—
—Order! Senator Faulkner, I do not seek to interrupt you at the moment, but I think it would be appropriate that, if people are so interested in this matter—as senators obviously are—we endeavour to hear the statements of the respective senators in silence. I should also remind senators that it is only appropriate for them to speak when they are seated in their own place. I call Senator Faulkner.
—In this context, it is worth noting—(Quorum formed)  As I was saying, in this context, it is worth noting that the ANAO chose not to examine the records from the office of the ministers, which, of course, had it been done, would have shed light on the issue of who sought and obtained ministerial approval. But our concerns on funding dispersal ratios are vindicated in table 6. I draw the attention of everyone who is interested to table 6 on page 21 of the report. If you want to follow the matter, have a look at the table. I will come back to it if I have time.
Perhaps the most notable defect in the Auditor-General's report is his failure even to address, let alone pass any judgment on, Senator Hill's extraordinary practice of involving his backbench colleagues in the decision-making process—a practice that we were able to prise out of Senator Hill at the estimates hearings last year. Why did Senator Hill find it necessary to involve Senator Crane in making decisions about trust fund grants in Western Australia? Why did he fly Mr Billson to Adelaide to assist with the Victorian grant? Why was Senator Eggleston in the room? Any reader of this report looking for answers to those questions, for the Auditor's view of the propriety of Senator Hill's actions, would be very severely disappointed. He did not even look at it and he did not even address it.
The processes associated with the selection of the NHT projects may well have been transparent, but so is the inherent political 
 bias of those processes. Notwithstanding this report, the opposition remains very concerned at the skewed outcomes of the first round of funding under the multi-million dollar program. We hope and expect that the changes that the Auditor-General has recommended will produce more equitable outcomes in the second round.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—I say this to the Senate: go to table 6 on page 21. This is what you will read about ministerial approvals by political parties. Number and percentage of projects: Coalition—87.1 per cent; Labor—8.4 per cent; Independent—4.5 per cent. Value of ministerial approvals: Coalition—90 per cent; Labor—we go down here—4.6 per cent; Independent—5.3 per cent. Average value of the projects: Coalition—$46,500; Labor—$25,000; Independent—$52,500.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order!
—Senator Hill has been involved in one of the greatest shonks and one of the greatest rorts we have seen since this government has been elected, and that is saying something in a government of shonks and a government of rorters. Senator Hill stands condemned for this program.
(Time expired)
—Before I call Senator Alston, can I remind senators on both sides, as I said earlier, that there seems to be a degree of interest in this matter and it would be more appropriate if we were able to hear what was being said. I remind senators again that it is not appropriate—in fact, is a breach of standing orders—to speak or interject when they are not sitting in their own place.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report No. 42 of 1997-98</title>,Documents,16,2
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-05-12,"—Senator Faulkner's departure from the chamber, I think, says it all. Quite clearly, he is not the slightest bit interested in the findings of this report, which are a devastating indictment of the Labor Party's approach. This gives not only Senator Hill but the process a clean bill of health. 
 You are not interested in the slightest in the findings. In fact, what Senator Faulkner had to say was, `Notwithstanding this report, we remain concerned.' That says it all. What he is saying is that, irrespective of the evidence and irrespective of the findings of an independent arbiter—the Auditor-General who is brought in to check these things and who gives it a tick on all counts—you are interested only in the gutter.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—It speaks volumes for your ethical standards and codes of practice. This will haunt you at election time because you have had 2½ years in the gutter, you have passed up innumerable opportunities to get into the policy game and you have decided not to do it.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Order! Senator Conroy!
—But these things come back to bite you. You think you can get a cheap shot on the way through but it comes back. When you find, time and again, that these sorts of slurs are baseless, then your credibility is what suffers, not Senator Hill's and not the Bailleau family's.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order!
—We long ago abandoned any prospect of Senator Faulkner having the guts or the decency, because it is not in his nature. His approach is: you never concede, you never apologise and you just plough on regardless.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order!
—You might be the biggest buffoon or dolt who has ever been elected to this chamber, but you think that somehow political progress consists of actually—
—Order! I am quite sure there is a lot of interest in this matter. It is a broadcast day and members of the public might be interested in 
 what people in this place have got to say. It would be appropriate that we do allow them to have some chance of hearing what people have to say.
—I am very conscious of the fact that I have got one minute left. The public ought to know that this decision-making process has been found by the Auditor-General to be fundamentally sound in providing transparency and rigour. There is no evidence of systemic bias in the allocation of funds to projects. The Auditor-General has gone through all of these muckraking allegations and found that they are completely baseless. The attack on the Bailleau family is utterly disgraceful and indefensible. It could not possibly have been made outside this chamber, because you know you would have the pants sued off you. You do it nonetheless, under parliamentary privilege, because you think there is some cheap political mileage in somehow slandering those who are outside the political process.
This has not worked. You have been exposed. We never expected anything more of Senator Faulkner, because he has made it perfectly plain by his conduct that he would never apologise, irrespective of the circumstances. So we are not surprised, but I think the public will give you your award in due course.

Leave granted.
—Tonight the Treasurer is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1998-99.
In March 1996 our country set out on a new journey.
It started from a bad position. We had lost our way—our budget, under Labor, was $10.3 billion in deficit. Government debts had grown nearly $80 billion over five years. Looking out to the next century there was just a haze of deficit upon deficit and climbing ranges of debt which hemmed us in and closed off our future opportunities.
Australia needed direction. Australia had to change its way.
So our Government laid out a map. We marked out the places we wanted to get to. We identified the goals we wanted to achieve and we put down a timetable so we could measure our progress. So we could stay on track.
We wanted to get the budget out of deficit—out of the red and into the black—in three years. We wanted to stabilise our growing debt then halve it (in proportion to GDP) in five years. We wanted to achieve our goals not by raising taxes but by spending taxpayers' money more efficiently and well.
That was two years ago. This coming year is the third year of the journey. We will finish the first leg in good shape. We have achieved our goal. Our budget is now in surplus. We are back in the black. We are back on track.
The Commonwealth budget will be in surplus in 1998-99—a surplus of $2.7 billion.
When we set out on this journey we knew it would be a tough road. If it were otherwise our predecessors would have taken it. And in many respects the road has become tougher—with the severe turmoil in the Asian region.
But we all know that worthwhile achievement requires work and dedication and we have never lost sight of our goals.
The burdens were shared and the benefits will be shared. It was something that all of us—as Australians—have achieved together.
And now we set out on the second leg of our journey.
Our second leg is to pay our way now and set up opportunities for the future by repaying Labor's debt.
Repaying the debts of the past will secure the jobs for the future. Lower debt means lower interest payments. Our taxes will be lower and they will go on new services, better services, improving living standards, rather than servicing the past debts and the past failures.
We are now well on track.
In fact today we can map out even more exciting possibilities. The Government's sale of one third of the equity of Telstra gave millions of Australians the opportunity to share in the ownership of this company—mums and dads, employees—many people who have never owned a share before in their lives.
The Government proposes to sell the further shares in this company—not because we need to balance the budget. The budget is already balanced. But a once only sale will let us get a once only reduction in our debt burden—a once only opportunity to reduce net debt to 1½ per cent of GDP—to wipe out Labor's debt for good. This would put the Commonwealth, at the Centenary of Federation, back in the strong position it had in the mid 1970s—in its best position in twenty-five years.
I said earlier that the burdens that have been shared mean that the benefits will be shared.
When we began this journey two years ago mortgage interest rates were 10½ per cent. Now they are closer to 6½ per cent. These are the lowest home mortgage rates since 1970. For the average Australian home buyer this represents a saving of $320 per month—they are $3,800 per year better off.
And low home interest rates means the affordability of housing has, according to the HIA index, improved by 24 per cent over the last two years. What this means is more 
 young Australians, more young families can buy their own home and get a start in life.
Young people and families are sharing the benefits of good economic policy.
Two years ago small business overdraft interest rates were over 11 per cent. Now they have come down to 7.7 per cent. These are the lowest rates for small business since the 1960s. At the start of the decade, under Labor, small business interest rates were 20.5 per cent—nearly three times the current rate. Small business is sharing the benefits of good policy.
If we had not acted to repair the nation's finances, if we had not acted to lock in low inflation, if we had not been able to enjoy lower interest rates, if we had not been able to help small business, jobs would have been lost. But these measures have allowed new jobs, better jobs to be created. Employees are sharing the benefits of good policy.
There are now more Australians in work then ever before. Whilst unemployment is too high, it is now the lowest it has been in Australia since 1990—the lowest in eight years, the lowest since Labor's recession. That was the recession we did not have to have. Finally, we are over it.
CHALLENGES
In his first Budget Speech two years ago, he said that unless we acted decisively then "". . . Australia would be dangerously exposed to shifts in the international outlook . . .""
We did not know then that the Asian region would, as happened late last year, experience its greatest financial crisis ever and its largest downturn in economic growth since the oil shocks of twenty-five years ago. We did not know then that the Asian region, which for decades has been an engine for growth in Australia, would become a brake on our growth.
But we knew that prudent management meant we should strengthen the Australian economy against shocks outside our control. And we did. And it is now clear what an important decision that was. Our critics opposed us. Labor, which had put Australia in deficit, fought to keep it there. We are fortunate their views did not prevail.
In the midst of the turbulence of the region, Australia's economic growth will remain strong—not as strong as it could have been without this external downturn, a downturn beyond our control—but Australia will have one of the highest growth rates in the developed world. Importantly, Australia will be the strong economy of this region. Our economic fundamentals are as good as they have been for twenty-five years: low inflation, low interest rates, good growth, falling unemployment, falling debt and a budget swinging into surplus.
It is important to remember that this is the result of a coherent policy framework:
.	 a new framework for the conduct of monetary policy with  an agreed inflation objective—set with the Reserve Bank—keeping inflation low;
.	 a Charter of Budget Honesty recognised as a standard setter by the International Monetary Fund—implementing the best practice in the world—keeping the budget on track;
.	 a leading edge reform of the financial sector which has proven strong and will be strengthened further under new institutional arrangements flowing from the Financial System (Wallis) Inquiry; and
.	 a programme of Corporate Law Reform that will make Australia one of the most efficient, stable, reliable centres in the world to do business—directed to our objective of providing economic growth and jobs.
But the turbulent events of Asia in recent times should remind us of the need to continue to work to strengthen our future. While many hard yards have been covered, many more have to be travelled to improve our tax system, to improve our ports and wharfs, to keep our focus on a stronger economy and jobs, to maintain our commitment to help families, the elderly, and those in regional and rural Australia.
BUDGET OUTCOMES
Madam President, we have turned around the nation's finances without increasing the tax burden on Australians.
For the third time in a row, tonight the Treasurer will announce that there will be no 
 increase in income tax rates, no increase in the company tax rate, no increase in the wholesale sales tax, no increase in the petrol excise.
The uplift factor for provisional tax in 1998-99 will be reduced again one further percentage point to 5 per cent, half the rate that applied under Labor at the beginning of this decade. This will save business and individuals around $75 million in provisional tax instalments in the forthcoming year.
We are putting the nation's finances in order by being careful with government spending—targeting the areas of need, whilst eliminating rorts and wastage. In the social security area alone, in the first eighteen months of the Coalition Government more than $600 million was repaid by people who had received more than their entitlements. In 1996-97, $28 million a week was saved by cancelling payments to those who were not entitled to them.
Budget outlays as a proportion of GDP are expected to fall from around 27 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 to below 24 per cent by 2000-01. This represents an outcome not achieved since the early 1970s.
And careful management of the nation's finances has allowed us to redirect spending to those with greater need.
Care and Support for Older Australians
Madam President, the Government has already demonstrated its strong commitment to older Australians.
This is the only Government that has, by legislation, set the benchmark rate of the age pension at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. This means that although the Consumer Price Index did not increase last year, the rate of the age pension did. This delivered an increase in the pension of $6.80 per fortnight in March 1998. The Government has also provided for this increase to flow to the recipients of War Widows' pensions.
This Government also delivered tax fairness to the self-funded retiree. The Government has now introduced, in full, the availability of the pensioner tax rebate to self-funded retirees. Self-funded retirees now pay no more in tax for the same income than do pension 
 ers. This allows a qualifying single self-funded retiree to earn up to $12,163 without paying tax.
Starting from 1 July 1998, the savings rebate will reduce tax on savings by 7.5 per cent and by 1 July 1999 reduce tax on savings by 15 per cent up to the first $3000 of income.
The Government has decided that from 1 January 1999, a Gold Card for health care will be made available to an additional 50,000 Australian World War II veterans—those who faced danger from hostile forces during that war. This measure, which costs around $500 million over four years, recognises the significant contribution made by Australia's war veterans. A grateful nation acknowledges the debt we owe them.
The Gold Card provides the veteran with free treatment as a private patient with choice of doctor or medical practitioner in hospital, together with a wide range of other services such as optical, dental, physiotherapy, podiatry and chiropractic services free of charge. These services are provided whether the conditions treated are service related or not. Gold Card holders receive the pensioner concession on pharmaceuticals. They are not required to pay the Medicare Levy. Their treatment is free.
This Government wants to encourage people to save for their own retirement. And so it is determined to support those retirees who through thrift are now living from their own savings.
To further encourage and support self-funded retirees, I announce tonight that eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card is to be expanded from 1 January 1999.
The income test threshold for the card, which will be based on taxable income, is to be increased from around $21,000 to $40,000 per year for singles and from around $36,000 to $67,000 per year for couples. This change, costing $190 million over four years, is expected to allow some 220,000 additional self-funded retirees to qualify for the Seniors Health Card.
It will enable cardholders to purchase eligible pharmaceuticals for $3.20—the same concessional rate as pensioners—with any 
 prescriptions above 52 within a year being available free of charge.
1999 is the International Year of Older Persons. A Government programme which will focus on implementing practical initiatives for improving the health and well-being of older Australians and recognising their contribution to the community and nation is being put in place to mark this occasion.
A Healthy Australia
Madam President, the Government is also building a stronger health system.
Under Australian Health Care Agreements, Commonwealth funding available for public hospitals will increase by $2.9 billion over the next five years. In total, this will increase funding nearly 15 per cent in real terms and bring Commonwealth spending to $30.2 billion over the five year period. As part of this, the Commonwealth has taken on the full cost of purchasing veterans' health care, which is separately funded at $150 million per year. The extension of the Gold Card to an additional 50,000 veterans, separately funded for free treatment as private patients, creates additional places in the public system for others.
Health Care Agreement funding will ensure that public patients receive free access to public hospitals, and will facilitate reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health services. This demonstrates the Government's strong commitment to the public hospital system.
Earlier this year, the Government announced a range of measures to enhance the care of older people staying in the community, and to provide greater recognition and support for carers. The Government's package Staying at Home—Care and Support for Older Australians , announced in April, will assist elderly Australians to remain independent and live in their own homes with additional care and support.
The measures, costing around $280 million over the next four years, will see the number of people receiving assistance through Community Aged Care Packages to stay in their own home double to 22,000; they expand eligibility for the Domiciliary Nursing Care 
 Benefit; they will establish another fifteen Carer Respite Centres to give those caring for older people the chance for respite and help them to look after elderly relatives; and they provide additional respite care places for people with dementia.
This year, the Commonwealth will also provide increased funding for the States of $130 million over five years under the new Commonwealth State Disability Agreement. This will provide for additional accommodation support services for people with disabilities. This funding is in addition to the $54 million in extra funding which was provided in the 1997-98 Budget.
Our efforts to improve the health of Australians do not end there.
Tonight, I am announcing the provision of around $80 million over four years to enhance preventive health programmes. This will fund a number of new programmes, including:
.	 a free annual influenza vaccine to all Australians over 65 in order to treat this preventible illness, as recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council; and
.	 a $6.1 million programme to reduce tobacco-related illness including school education campaigns to warn our children of the dangers of smoking.
Following the successful introduction of Medicare claims units in pharmacies in rural Australia, the service will be extended to outer metropolitan and growth areas. Two hundred new units will open in pharmacies to allow people to access Medicare refunds from their local chemist.
Foster parents, who generously give love and care to children, will be entitled to have a Health Care Card for the child, if the child qualified in his or her previous family, to use for health expenses. This recognises the important role of carers and the health needs of those who are cared for by them.
The Government's commitment to medical research is demonstrated by our decision tonight to provide additional on-going funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council at a cost of around $175 million over four years. This provides longer term certainty 
 for the health and medical research industry, and will encourage those with research skills to participate or continue in medical research.
Expenditure on diagnostic imaging has grown significantly in recent years. Although this growth was slowed by measures introduced in the 1996-97 Budget, further reforms are needed to ensure that growth does not become unsustainable. The Government will be working with peak professional bodies to constrain diagnostic imaging expenditure.
The Government will also be taking steps to ensure that abuse and waste in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is minimised, through enhancing the compliance activities of the Health Insurance Commission and the development of education and awareness programmes.
Youth, Education and Training
A key priority of the Government has been to expand employment opportunities, through labour market reform and improvements in Australia's education and training system. A particular concern has been our unemployed youth.
The Government's initiatives have included the major reform of the provision of employment services, with the establishment of the Job Network from May this year; improved incentives for employers to take on apprentices; and the Work for the Dole scheme.
The Work for the Dole scheme is based on the principle of mutual obligation. A person out of work is given income support by the community and is expected, in return, to support the community by doing useful projects, learning skills and keeping up work habits.
The Government is also providing an additional $350 million over four years for a range of measures to address problems associated with youth unemployment.
In particular, the Government is taking the Work for the Dole initiative further, requiring all young people unemployed for six months or more to participate in an activity in addition to looking for work. The additional activities required can include the Green Corps, education and training, a new 
 programme for literacy and numeracy or community job projects.
This Budget provides for the extension of the Job Placement, Employment and Training programme until the end of 1999-2000. This programme helps young people up to 21 years of age who face multiple disadvantages, particularly the homeless. It provides individual assistance, tailored to their particular needs, to help them overcome the barriers they face in putting their lives back on track.
A new Youth Allowance is being introduced, which simplifies income support arrangements for young Australians and encourages them to further their education and develop the basic skills needed to secure their future.
Additional funding is also being provided for programmes to facilitate the transition of young people from school to work and to assist those at risk of early school-leaving.
This year, the Government will establish a Volunteer Ambassadors for Development programme. This will provide the opportunity for around 500 young Australians of up to 30 years of age to live and work as volunteers in the Asia Pacific region. Volunteers will be involved in activities such as teaching, providing health services, advising small business and improving the environment. This will help build Australia's ties with the region. Importantly, it will also expand the skills and experience of the young people themselves.
In this Budget, the Government is also providing significant increases in resources to fight the scourge of drugs through the National Illicit Drugs Strategy. The Strategy involves funding of around $215 million over five years to reduce the demand and supply of illicit drugs in the community, for drug treatment and rehabilitation and for community education. The new initiatives funded in this Budget will involve establishing new strike teams against illegal drugs and fighting the drug trade at its source with new Federal Police posts overseas where the drug trade can be intercepted before it reaches our shores.
Rural and Regional Australia
Madam President, the importance of the rural industry to Australia, to the nation, can never 
 be forgotten. We know that many in the bush have faced difficult times, particularly because of drought.
Sound policy and low interest rates are of enormous benefit to rural and regional Australia. The $525 million Government package, Agriculture—Advancing Australia , aims to help farmers out of debt and drought problems and, through the new FarmBis programme, provides assistance to farmers to improve the management of their businesses.
Shortly after tonight, the Government is introducing legislation to provide a tax rebate for landcare works of 34 cents in the dollar. This will apply to expenditure in the 1997-98 financial year. Primary producers will be able to claim the rebate for works on levee or contour banks to control soil erosion, drainage works to control salinity, and the eradication of pests. There will be an annual limit of up to $10,000 for eligible landcare expenditures. The rebate will be available for those with taxable incomes of up to $20,700 from primary production—or around 70 per cent of farmers. The landcare rebate is an incentive for farmers with low taxable incomes to improve their land—one of our country's greatest natural resources. The rebate, worth $80 million, will be paid from the Natural Heritage Trust.
In the coming year over $200 million will be spent on natural resource management and sustainable agriculture under the Natural Heritage Trust and other programmes.
Steps are being taken in this Budget to improve rural and regional health, through the expansion of multi-purpose health and family services for Australians in rural or remote areas. This involves providing a flexible, integrated range of health and family services in conjunction with the States, in areas where individual health and care programmes would not otherwise be viable. An extra thirty rural areas will have access to new multi-purpose services, with an additional 836 residential aged care places to be made available over four years. This is designed to complement services to older Australians in rural areas who want services near their friends and families.
Other Measures
Madam President, one of the first areas where the impact of the downturn in Asian economies has been felt is the Australian tourism industry. We recognise the importance of tourism for the Australian economy. In that context, we recognise the need to promote Australia effectively in the world tourism market.
Accordingly, this Budget provides increased funding of around $50 million over four years for the Australian Tourist Commission to improve Australia's promotional effort overseas in existing and emerging markets. A further $8 million will be provided over that period for the promotion of tourism in regional Australia.
The Government is also taking steps to enhance the effectiveness of Australia's immigration and visa procedures. Experience shows that there is a high risk that visitors from certain countries will attempt to remain in Australia after their visas expire. Accordingly, visa applications from those countries are to be more closely scrutinised. These measures are to be funded by introducing a new visitor charge for applicants from high risk countries. At the same time, arrangements provide for faster processing of travellers from low risk countries.
BUDGET REVENUES
In August last year the Prime Minister announced the Government's commitment to fundamental reform of the Australian taxation system.
Our current tax system is not serving Australia's interests and is therefore no longer appropriate to a modern and dynamic economy.
It is unnecessarily complex—the result of years of changes to patch up a system that was first developed in the 1930s.
It imposes high rates of personal tax on additional earnings for Australians who do not have high incomes. The interaction of the tax and social security systems reduces the incentive to find work, or to earn more. Reward for effort is taken away through tax and reduced benefits. 
The tax system includes a Wholesale Sales Tax which applies high tax rates on a relatively narrow range of goods including many everyday items. The structure of the indirect tax system also adds to the costs of businesses and penalises our exporters.
A more certain, fair and efficient tax system is necessary as Australia enters the next century. We need a tax system that ensures that all parts of the community pay a fair share of tax.
In its first two Budgets the Government has taken action to protect honest taxpayers by clamping down on tax avoidance and tax minimisation. This has been achieved without increasing the overall tax burden facing the community.
But repair and maintenance of the present taxation system can only go so far. In short, it is no longer a sufficient option for achieving fairness and avoiding disincentives to work. We must have fundamental reform of the taxation system.
Madam President, since the Government is committed to ensuring all taxpayers meet their obligations, I am announcing tonight an extension of the funding for a special taskforce within the Australian Taxation Office which is investigating the tax minimisation practices of some high wealth individuals. Examination to date has already unearthed a number of undesirable practices. Tonight's Budget sets aside $19 million for this taskforce which is expected to yield $200 million in additional tax compliance over the next two years.
Year 2000 Computer Software
The Government considers that expenses incurred in detecting and remedying software problems associated with the Year 2000 millennium bug should, in general, be immediately deductible for taxation purposes.
To a limited extent this is provided for in the current law but amendments will be made where this is not so. This decision reflects the Government's determination that businesses should be encouraged to take all steps to iron out possible computer software failure before the Year 2000.
The Government has also decided to amend the taxation law as it applies to computer software expenditure in response to a recent announcement by the Commissioner of Taxation withdrawing a ruling that deals with the taxation treatment. Unless the Government acted, most software expenditure could not be written off for taxation purposes or at best could be written off over twenty-five years. Most software expenditure would have been treated as capital and therefore as not deductible in the year incurred.
The Government has decided to act in response to provide that expenditure on acquiring or developing computer software—apart from that associated with Year 2000 compliance—will be written off over 2½ years.
The write-off rate of 2½ years reflects the relatively short expected effective life of software arising from rapid developments in the information technology industry.
The proposed arrangements are generous compared to those applying in comparable overseas taxation jurisdictions.
The new arrangements will encourage business modernisation and apply from the time of withdrawal of the ruling.
I am also announcing some measures that will simplify the tax law and address some potential anomalies.
A new generic tax framework will be introduced for the demutualisation of non-insurance organisations. Demutualisation is an emerging trend as more sectors of the Australian economy respond to increasing competition and structural reform. The development of the framework has benefited from extensive public input. It will provide greater certainty for organisations about the taxation consequences of demutualisation.
The Government has decided to increase the revenue collected through telecommunications numbering charges in order to better reflect the market value of these numbers and discourage hoarding. Additional revenue of around $30 million per annum will be collected from telecommunications carriers for the use of special service telephone numbers such as `13' and `180' numbers. The Government's decision recognises the fact that 
 special service numbers are a valuable community resource and previous charging levels have undervalued their true worth.
Finally, Madam President, I am announcing an increase in the Passenger Movement Charge of $3, taking it to $30. This will take effect from 1 January 1999. This increase will help meet the additional costs associated with the transit of people and goods for the Sydney 2000 Games.
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
Madam President, it is expected that economic growth will remain solid in 1998-99, although it will slow from 1997-98. But for the effect of Asia we would be looking at a continuation of rapid growth in 1998-99.
The strong growth in activity in 1997-98 reflects strong private sector demand. This is expected to carry into 1998-99. Investment plans remain strong, supported by low interest rates and high corporate profits. The housing recovery is proceeding and consumption will be supported by continued favourable labour market conditions.
Employment growth should remain firm, supported by recent and prospective growth in non-farm activity. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to around 7¾ per cent in the year ahead.
While inflation will rise gradually in the year ahead, it is under control and expected to remain within the RBA's medium-term target band.
The slowdown in some of our Asian trading partners will reduce Australia's export returns. Continued strength in the domestic economy will lead to a temporary rise in the current account deficit, edging it up to an average 5¼ per cent in the coming year.
However, the rise in the current account deficit in prospect is expected to remain below the peaks in the 1980s and mid-1990s.
And importantly, the rise in the current account deficit in prospect is taking place in clearly different circumstances to those earlier episodes. It does not reflect excessive growth in domestic demand. It is taking place in a period where the Government has locked in low inflation. It is occurring against the 
 backdrop of policies designed to increase public saving and to provide a better environment for private saving.
As a result, investor confidence in Australia can be expected to remain strong.
CONCLUDING COMMENTS
Madam President, on its election the Government mapped a course for economic and social prosperity into the next century.
This Government was determined to deliver, not just for this generation, but the next. When we set out, we said that the burdens would be shared so the rewards would be shared.
That is why young people, homebuyers, small business, job seekers now have better opportunities and a bright future—why we can care for the older citizens and hope for the younger ones.
The journey is not yet finished. We should not stop now. This is an important milestone along the road. With the confidence and continued support of the Australian people, we will not stray from the task.
I commend the Budget to the Senate. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the budget statement and documents.
Leave granted.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-05-12,"—Tonight I wanted to speak on the state 
 of the Australian pork industry. On 7 April the Senate supported a motion that I moved calling on the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, to take immediate action to assist the Australian pork industry. Specifically, the Senate called on the Howard government to launch an immediate inquiry to determine whether the level of imported pig meat was the primary cause of the industry's current difficulties. If that proved to be the case, then the Senate called on the government to look to the `emergency protection of an industry' provisions of the World Trade Organisation rules to limit the volume of imports. The motion also called on the government to review the current level of financial assistance available to the industry and put in place proper labelling arrangements.
There is no doubt that the industry was in a state of crisis at that time. In many instances, the prices received by growers were well below the cost of production. Following that Senate resolution, two things happened. Prices deteriorated further. The front page of the May issue of the Pig Producer says it all with the heading `Farmers Shoot Pigs—They can't sell them'. The minister, Mr Anderson, decided to play politics with the issue. In an interview on the ABC Country Hour, the minister claimed that there had not been a rise in imports. He said:
My honest assessment of that is that at the moment it is likely to be found that there's been no particular rise in what's coming in.
In fact, what's coming in now is what was allowed in under the 1992 protocol set up by Labor.
He continued:
Nothing extra is coming in from Canada or Denmark under the slightly revised protocols that were issued in November last year which caused so much concern.
I was very surprised that the minister was so out of touch with the circumstances of this important industry. The reason why I raised this matter in the first place was because it was obvious to me—and to everyone else except Minister Anderson—that the pork industry was in trouble and needed help from the government. That is why governments are elected, is it not? That is the reason why we 
 have a minister for primary industries, is it not?
I said that this was not the minister's fault because import protocols for imported pig meat were varied last November. I said that there had been a surge in imports and a collapse in the domestic price and that the government needed to look at that as a matter of urgency. I said that, if imports were the major problem, then there were things that the government could go to to assist the industry. I called on the government to look at what action could be taken within the terms of our GATT arrangements.
That was the view, apparently, of 75 other senators. The resolution had the support of National Party senators, Liberal Party senators, my own colleagues, the Democrats, the Greens and the Independents, but apparently not Mr Anderson or Mr Fischer. I believe that the Senate saw this as an apolitical issue, but the minister was not of the same view. He did not say, `Yes, there is a problem and we will do what we can.' He said, `There has not been an increase in imports and, anyway, it's all Labor's fault.'
There were record imports in 1997. Over 11,000 tonnes were imported, resulting in a fall in pig prices in the lead-up to last Christmas for the first time in history. Most of these imports were boneless leg meat, which is the premium market segment in Australia. The majority of this meat is manufactured into ham. Canadian imports now account for 30 per cent of this segment of the market in this country. The fact that an unlimited quantity is available through imports means that processors are able to bargain the domestic market down.
A number of processors have also contracted for imports and are, therefore, not in the market for Australian pigs whatever the price on offer. Some producers cannot even give their pigs away. Despite what the minister might say, there has been a significant increase in imports over the past year, and in imports of special cuts, not just pig meat. The prices being received by growers are now at their lowest level for 30 years. Prices are currently in the range of $1.28 to $1.70 a kilogram, with a national average of around 
 $1.50 a kilogram. The average cost of production is around $2 a kilogram. A farmer with an average 100-sow piggery is currently losing over $1,000 a week.
The minister must also be aware that pork producers do not have the same options as the extensive livestock industries to hold stock back during periods of low prices. The pigs have to be fed and if they are fed they grow, and if they grow too much there is no market for them. For that reason, when the government failed to respond quickly to the terms of the Senate motion, I wrote both to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. I urged both ministers to immediately investigate the state of the industry and the impact imports were having. Mr Anderson had the courtesy to acknowledge my letter. Unfortunately, Mr Fischer has not even bothered to do that.
On 24 April, Mr Anderson finally released a media statement announcing that he would consider an application from the pork industry for the provision of exceptional circumstances assistance to producers. He said that he had asked the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics to conduct an analysis of the state of the industry. I understand that that work has been completed and is with the minister.
There is a need to look at how this industry can best be helped through this extremely difficult period. The provision of exceptional circumstances assistance is, in my opinion, not the answer. At best, it is part of the solution. Some action to deal with the volume of imports must also be considered and the Deputy Prime Minister has a key role to play in this regard. The government plan for this industry is to help it export its way out of trouble. I believe that the $10 million package that the government offers this industry is designed to do just that.
I note that, in a media release, Mr Fischer said that a trade delegation to Russia in the next few weeks will include representatives from the pork industry. I agree that the future of the industry is to be found in a growing export sector, but that cannot happen if the breeding sow herd is not sustained. The herd 
 is now clearly under threat, with the prospect of hundreds if not thousands of producers being forced out of business. I am sure that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy understands this point very well. It was an issue which he pursued with some vigour in relation to the nation's sheep and cattle breeding herds during the 1994 drought.
The record shows that the pork industry supports trade that is fair and free, but the industry is quite rightly opposed to competition from countries which subsidise and protect their own industries. Denmark has granted unimpeded access to Australia for pork product exports to Denmark, but only as long as our local producers pay a tariff of up to $3,145 a tonne. I believe that Canada provides its domestic industry with production subsidies of around 16 per cent. The Canadian High Commissioner has contacted my office and suggested that this figure has been reduced to 11 per cent. I am investigating that matter further.
If the Australian pork industry were to enjoy a production subsidy of 16 per cent a year, it would cost the government around $100 million annually. We are certainly not talking about level playing fields when we talk about Canadian and European Union imports. I note that a recent issue of the Pig International magazine refers to the active role of provincial governments in Canada in the expansion of the pork industry. In a column in that magazine, the editor, Mr Peter Best, says that there is expected to be a significant expansion in pig production in Alberta `now that projects have access to a preferential loan program underwritten by about $50 million of government funds'. That is what he says the Canadian government is doing.
It is important to note, and it is important for the government to acknowledge, that the Australian pork industry has been going through a significant period of change. In the 1970s, there were more than 40,000 producers; now there are just over 3,000. Very few sectors in the rural economy have experienced such a significant change. The pork industry for the 1990s produces more meat of a better 
 quality at a lower production cost than ever before.
Such a radical change was not without difficulties, but this sector accepted that it had no choice. It has been underpinned by a considerable producer investment—around $12 million annually—in research and development and marketing programs. This change has come about without the support of the price stabilisation schemes, floor prices, single-desk arrangements or import tariffs and quotas enjoyed by the wool, wheat, sugar and dairy producers.
Some 34 days have passed since the Senate called on the government to take action in support of the pig industry. Since that day, the industry estimates that it has lost another $10 million. In these circumstances, and considering the desperate situation that this sector of the economy is in, it is incumbent on the government to act and to act soon.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Pork Industry</title>,Adjournment,19,1
