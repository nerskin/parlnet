"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-14,"—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together. After debate on the motion for the second reading has been adjourned, I will be moving a motion to have the bills listed separately on the Notice Paper . I move:
That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-14,"—Madam Temporary Chairman, I had the impression last night that we had not finished opposition amendments Nos 35 and 36. Had we?
—That is correct.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-14,"—My colleagues and I share the view of Senator Murray that we had not quite fin 
 ished, but I am happy for the record to stand. I know we dealt with the substantive points, but there were some other amendments and we were not sure whether we actually did—
—Senator Conroy, may I just clarify this. Section 614 and items 283 and 363 were put last night together, so we are now on the Democrat amendment No. 2 on revised sheet 1592.
—Just before we move on, can I flag the possibility that there may be a consequential amendment that arises out of deleting the mandatory bid. I flag that we may wish to come back to deal with a particular amendment in this section. Because of time constraints, I have not had a chance to consult Senator Murray on it yet.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-14,"—Now that we are all straight on that issue, I would like to move Democrat amendment No. 2 on sheet 1592 revised:
(2)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 158 (after line 19), after paragraph (j), insert:
	 (ja)	 if, during the period of 4 months before the date of the bid, the bidder or an associate gave, or offered to give or agreed to give a benefit to another person and the benefit was likely to induce the other person, or an associate, to:
			 (i)	 accept an offer under the bid; or
			 (ii)	 dispose of securities in the bid class;
			 and the benefit is not offered to all holders of securities in the bid class under the bid—details of the benefit
This amendment relates to the provision of collateral benefits during a takeover bid. My understanding is that it is presently the case that a person may not provide collateral benefits during the period of four months which precedes a takeover bid that are likely to induce a person to accept an offer under a bid. Because of a recent interpretation by the courts as to the definition of collateral benefit, the government has chosen to remove that prohibition. That decision is given effect to by government amendment No. 14 on sheet EP247, which will follow this amendment. The Australian Democrats are not concerned about the removal of the prohibition, but we do believe that the provision of collateral 
 benefits to any prospective seller of shares should be disclosed to all subsequent offerees, and that is the effect of our amendment. We have advised the government and the opposition of this amendment, and I therefore commend it to the committee.

Subsection 665D(3) or (4)
Penalty: 25 penalty units or imprisonment for 6 months, or both.
Section 665E
Penalty: 25 penalty units or imprisonment for 6 months, or both.
These amendments relate to the new provision in section 664A that will allow a person who owns 90 per cent or more of the shares in a company to compulsorily acquire the remaining shares in the company. The acquisition must occur at a fair price and the minority shareholders have the right to object and have the matter determined by a court if they believe that the price does not represent a fair price. For many people, this issue is probably the most contentious issue in the bill, and I am sure Senator Conroy will speak on it at length later on when he comes to his amendment.
I made a number of comments in relation to the compulsory acquisition power in previous remarks. I am not going to repeat those except to say that we do accept the need for a power of compulsory acquisition, and of course that is where the debate will be later on, I suspect. This amendment, however, is part of our effort to increase the safeguards attaching to the compulsory acquisition process. We all know that compulsory acquisition needs to be dealt with with great care. The effect of these amendments is to require a shareholder who acquires more than 85 per cent of a company to give notice to the company that they have reached that shareholding. When a company receives notice from a shareholder that that is the case, the company is obliged to give notice to the remaining shareholders that there is an 85 per cent holding and that if that holder increases their holding to 90 per cent the minority may 
 be subject to compulsory acquisition. In other words, it is an early warning device designed to make the market as informed as possible so that people can take action and not have the compulsory acquisition ability descend on them by surprise and not have them unable to plan in advance of that event.
Our desire in moving this amendment is to forewarn minority shareholders that their shares may be the subject of compulsory acquisition in the future. The situation we are trying to avoid is a person holding shares for a number of years while a substantial shareholder creeps over the 90 per cent line and that minority holder receiving a letter in the mail out of the blue which states that their shares are going to be acquired compulsorily. This provision will result in those shareholders being given notice in advance that their shares may be compulsorily acquired in the future. As with our other amendments, we have advised both the government and the opposition of our intention and of these amendments. I commend them to the committee.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-14,"—I foreshadow that we will move amendments Nos 17, 18, 19 to 26 and 37 after the Democrat amendments. I indicate that under the current arrangements a bidder seeking to take a 100 per cent ownership of a company after the initial step of a part A or part C offer has effectively three steps or options to achieve that goal. Firstly, the bidder might wish to extend the offer period till at least it gains 90 per cent of the shares. On successfully acquiring 90 per cent of the shares in the target company, the bidder could then inform outstanding shareholders of their rights as well as convincing them further of the merits of the bid. Thirdly, should the bidder gain 75 per cent of the outstanding shareholders—that is, shareholders of the remaining 10 per cent—the bidder could then after the close of the offer period issue the outstanding shareholders with a compulsory acquisition notice.
These steps are not as entirely onerous as the government might claim. These are appropriate and necessary steps before one party is given the authority to take the proper 
 ty of another. I would concede that a slight improvement may be worthwhile. That is why the opposition supports part of the government's changes to compulsory acquisition. We agree that compulsory acquisition should be allowed once 90 per cent of all securities, not just shares, have been acquired and when 75 per cent of the outstanding securities—that is, by the number of securities, not shareholders—have been acquired by the bidder. But we consider that the government is simply going too far with the proposition that compulsory acquisition can be initiated at any time after 90 per cent of all securities have been acquired, with only a notice of acquisition being issued with an independent report valuing the remaining security.
The latter proposition is totally inappropriate, particularly as the concern over greenmailers is not well documented. The government's amendments today on this proposal do not change the inequity it propagates. Many talk about greenmail but before the committee few were willing or unable to give concrete examples of the impact of the so-called greenmailer. It could be concluded from the lack of evidence put before the committee and put before me at various stages that greenmailer activity is exaggerated.
Yesterday Senator Campbell commented positively on the qualifications and reputation of Mr Ted Rofe and of the Australian Shareholders Association in arguing their point over the issue of the mandatory bid rule. So why doesn't Senator Campbell listen to Mr Rofe and the ASA about their concerns over the extension of the compulsory acquisition? Mr Rofe stated the following in the ASA submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities:
Compulsory acquisition involves the expropriation of the property of the shareholders whose shares are to be acquired. Minority shareholders in a partly owned group of companies are in a particularly vulnerable position. It is therefore essential that any compulsory acquisition of their shares can be seen to be fair to both majority and minority shareholders. As the courts have pointed out on a number of occasions, fairness in this context involves both fair dealing and a fair price. The proposed new compulsory acquisition power in its 
 present form tips the scales too much in favour of the majority shareholders.
As more and more Australians are becoming shareholders, changes to compulsory acquisition become a significant concern. As we have already said, a recent survey by the stock exchange earlier this year estimates that 4.4 million Australians now hold shares directly, about 31.9 per cent of the population. The majority is likely to be inexperienced first-time shareholders who may not be able to best represent their own interests.
With little doubt, the extension of the compulsory acquisition rule was conceived and designed to placate vested interests. There is absolutely no need for it. But what disappoints me more than the government's proposal on extending compulsory acquisition is the Democrats' willingness—albeit to make it better—to give their support to this proposal. More and more each day I get surprised by the propositions originating from the government and I am surprised by the Democrats finding sense in supporting this proposal. I always believed that the Democrats had a noble role of tempering the excesses of the government of the day, but those days seem to be gone.
This issue in particular is about small shareholders, big corporations and vested interests. We are seeing what I believe to be a fair-minded attempt by the Democrats to make this proposal more workable but I believe it will fall short of allowing genuine protection for people in this position. I understand that the ASA is already receiving reports of shareholders being threatened that their shares will be expropriated as soon as this bill becomes law.
As a concession, the opposition will support the Democrat amendments that would ensure the valuer is truly independent, but I do not believe that this is sufficient. We have a situation, if this bill is passed, that sees large companies now able to reach out and begin compulsory acquisition for the next 12 months after the declaration. I think, to quote from a famous film, that it will be like the smell of napalm in the morning as the companies move in and, as they would see it, `simply mop up' at the expense of small shareholders. 
It is possible to argue that you may want to go forward to ensure that future takeovers are not hampered by the so-called greenmailing effect. But to allow open slather for companies that are in a position to try to benefit from this change—to give them the 12 months—is just an extraordinary step and I believe many Australians will be disadvantaged by this proposal to allow an immediate move on their shares as a result of a change in parliament. People will lose out because of this.
There are some protections, as I said, and I believe it is a fair-minded attempt by the Democrats in this area to try to ensure an `independent valuation'. That is almost an oxymoron nowadays, as we have seen with the GIO example. We have seen the valuations that have recently been done in the GIO case. I think their shares are now trading down around $3 and people were told, not three or four months ago, that they were worth $5.50. Many hundreds of ordinary Australian battling mums and dads shareholders believed the valuation that they were given by GIO and acted in accordance with that, only to find—a few months later—that their shares had almost halved in value. A class action has begun to try to bring to account whoever was responsible for giving such misleading information to the market.
I believe that, while the Democrat amendments will go some way to protecting the valuation process—and a truly independent valuer is a very important step—they do not go far enough, and it is disappointing that representations from many shareholders have not been addressed. I know there is one in particular who has made many representations to all members of the government. I have my own filing cabinet now dedicated to Mr Fielding, as I am sure everyone else in the chamber has, and I know he has made many representations and has many concerns which he has documented at length. It is disappointing that some of his concerns have not been directly addressed. His most recent correspondence to me suggests that he will consider moving offshore. In actual fact he quotes an example where he believes greenmailing will not be fixed by this particular amendment: 
 that if a number of small companies get together and buy up the 10 per cent you will still have this greenmailing. So orchestrated greenmailing will not be fixed by this amendment. The only people who will be disadvantaged are the vulnerable and those who do not quite have all the information necessary to defend themselves.
I will be interested in Senator Murray's responses to that. I do not think the Senate chamber has enough time to deal with all of Mr Fielding's concerns, but I would certainly be interested in a response from him on the greenmailing issue. I would also be interested in the government's response. I know they have had extensive correspondence with Mr Fielding. I do not know if he is still a member of the Liberal Party; I think he said he was when he first appeared before me. If Senator Campbell has a few moments, I would be particularly interested to talk about how we will still be able to get together and frustrate orchestrated greenmailing by a couple of companies—I do not know if you have seen his latest correspondence—and how this legislation will deal with a situation like that.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-14,"—I omitted to relate my previous remarks to yesterday's mandatory bid situation. I want to put on record that Senator Conroy's strong advocacy for caution in that area was indeed responsible for the mandatory bid effort being preserved. We were dealing there with 80 per cent of shareholders. Given those circumstances and the timing, the right decision was made. Now we are dealing with 10 per cent of the shareholders, and the question before us is: is what we are doing fair? The Rubicon that anyone considering this had to cross was whether it was appropriate and good policy for a minority to be compulsorily bought out. Should there be some mechanism for that to apply? There always have been some mechanisms, of course.
We crossed that particular Rubicon, and once we had done that, we had to pay attention to the questions of fair value, of fair notice, of proper market information and of due process. We have three sets of amend 
 ments. We are dealing with the first set now, which relates to better market information and better notice. The second set deals with the independent valuation issue, and the third question deals with ensuring a fairer price. I do not think our sequence of three improvements should be considered minor; I think they are quite significant and quite helpful in ensuring as much fairness as possible in this process.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-10-14,"—I will not delay the committee. I have been asked to respond to a couple of points, and I will respond first to the question asked by Senator Conroy. We believe that the proposition put by the gentleman he mentioned is entirely without foundation and silly. Under these provisions, 10 per cent of the remaining 10 per cent—that is, one per cent of the entire company—can still get together and take a matter off to court.
These provisions have been carefully designed to try and balance the interests of all shareholders—to reach a balance between oppression of a minority and dictation by a majority. Senator Conroy raised a fair point about someone who does not want his or her shares acquired. They are a minority; they may get oppressed by a majority. One has to look equally at the small shareholder, the householder, the so-called mums and dads who are on the other side of the barrier between the 90 per cent and the 10 per cent and who are missing out on the benefits of being a wholly-owned subsidiary. They will not get any of the benefit of the 100 per cent control if the 10 per cent who are compulsorily acquired get a bigger amount paid for their shares because the valuer decides it. The 90 per cent do not get any of the value of that, so the 10 per cent are in a powerful position because they hold a leverage over the rest of the corporation. There is a significant benefit, in many respects, in having a 100 per cent ownership of a company—in administration, reporting, taxation and a whole range of things—and that, of course, is what corporations seek.
So the point I make, hopefully clearly, is that there are small shareholders on either side of the divide. Surely there will be small shareholders in the 10 per cent which could be compulsorily acquired, but there will be small shareholders on the other side of the divide. Furthermore, we should not think of big businesses or even big institutions as big, nasty fat cats. The reality of institutional as well as direct investment in Australia is that the big institutional investors in Australia—AMP, Colonial, AXA—invest on behalf of lots of small shareholders. The directors of these companies, as well as institutional investors and managed investment schemes, are investing on behalf of small investors.
I will quickly summarise the government's position in relation to this. We think that the balance struck in the CLERP bill is sound and that it contains a series of safeguards that protects small shareholders. It involves the disclosure of all material information to minority shareholders; independent experts' reports; a process by which shareholders can object to the compulsory acquisition, which I have already outlined; court approval of the fairness of the price where at least 10 per cent of the shareholders object—so you only need one per cent of the company to object and you can have it referred; and a requirement that the person seeking to make the compulsory acquisition fund any reasonable court costs incurred by the minority shareholders.
We do not think the Democrat amendments are necessary or an improvement. However, we believe that it is very important that this legislation is passed. Greenmailing is a serious problem in Australia. ASIC have said publicly that greenmailing is a serious problem. Greenmailing acts to the benefit of a minority of greedy people to the detriment of the great majority of small shareholders, who miss out on the opportunity to use their leverage. That is what a greenmailer does. They use a strategic position—often planned out years in advance—to extort an exorbitant price at the cost of the other shareholders. It is a serious problem. ASIC have said that it is a serious problem in the Australian marketplace, as have experts on CASAC, the Corporations and Securities Advisory Committee.
I do pay very close attention to the views of people like Ted Rofe, as I have said on a number of occasions in this debate. Ted thinks that we have got the balance slightly wrong in this case; I think we have got it slightly right. But we are happy to see these provisions put in place with the Democrat amendments. We do not welcome the amendments but we want the provisions to go ahead. We will not oppose the amendments. If it means passage in that form, we will be pleased to support them.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-10-14,"—This is another example of where legislators—and in many cases quite correctly, in my view—interfere with market forces. It is an attractive demonstration of a socialist approach to society. What you are trying to do is to adjust the balances between two forces. I hope that philosophy remains in this chamber when we come to talk about the Workplace Relations Act, because what we will be doing then is trying to find means whereby we can adjust unequal forces.
This is a strike against the old capitalist system. It is a strike for the socialist approach to things; that is, where you try to get some fairness into the system by frustrating forces which flow within the marketplace normally. To get over that problem you say it is going to be more efficient and you demonise a particular group of people. You say that the 10 per cent—not the 90 per cent—are the demons because they are capable of greenmail, and if you are within that 10 per cent you must be a greenmailer by definition. In the old days they used to call that a witch-hunt. Then you get some authority from the Australian Securities Investment Commission to say, `These are evil people and therefore we will frustrate the market forces that operate in their favour.' Not only that, but you then say, `If there's going to be a court case about this, you're not going to be able to call your own witnesses. We are going to tell you what witnesses to call. ASIC, which has been very upset about greenmail, will choose those witnesses for you.'
I would not like to run the sort of case where you say, `These 10 per cent of people are all greenmailers; they are evil people. We 
 have to suppress them. ASIC has told us about these people who get too much money. We are going to get ASIC to choose the witnesses in this case and they will have to be happy about that.' It just seems to me an extraordinary approach that, where property—and property of course is at the basis of Western society, as Senator Hutchins knows, and we have respect for property—is in the hands of that 10 per cent of people, we say that these people are evil and therefore we are going to affect their property rights. If they want compensation we will give them that—it is fair compensation—and if they want to call certain witnesses we say, `No, you're not allowed to call those witnesses; we will tell you what witnesses you can call.'
I can understand all this. It does my old socialist heart good. I am not sure it does my old socialist heart so good when I know that I cannot exercise the rights that I should be able to exercise to at least run my own court case. Nevertheless, if the—I almost have to say—bolshie government and the Democrats want to take this approach, I do not think we can do anything about it.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-10-14,"—I would just like to respond to the comments of the government in relation to, as the government put it, one per cent of the company having leverage over the rest of the company in relation to the prices that they would receive for their shares. The first thing I would like to raise is that a person's right to buy and sell at any given time is part of the market. If a person chooses to hold their shares for a longer period with the desired benefit of achieving a higher price for them, that cannot be regarded as being to the detriment of the other 90 per cent who are locked out, because those 90 per cent of shareholders have the free option of when they wish to purchase their shares.
The other side of the balance is that the persons holding that one per cent of the shares are still exposed to the normal market forces. Market forces can move those share prices up or down, and that can be a result of either intentional actions by the company or unintentional actions. There could be equally as great a danger in that small percentage of 
 shareholders retaining that holding and then finding that the share price has been driven down. They would be left with no option other than to cut their losses and sell their shares and, in doing so, give the company the 100 per cent it desires to hold. The government is saying there is leverage for that small percentage of shareholders; in actuality there are equally well balanced reasons for those shareholders to end up suffering for having held those shares. So I believe it is incorrect for the government to raise just one side of the issue in relation to this 10 per cent of residual shareholders and not raise the downside: that those people would actually be exposed, either by intentional or unintentional actions, to market forces.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-14,"—I have been drawn into referring to the contribution made in the other place by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, unfortunately. He has again been on his feet, as he was yesterday, accusing the Labor Party of opposing everything—opposing corporate law reform. He is saying that we are the problem; we are the reason that this bill has been slow. I just want to take up a little more of this chamber's time, unfortunately, because the minister in the other place cannot control himself. As I said, he has again been on his feet slagging us, saying that we do not understand the issues, that we are being laughed at globally because of this, that we are going to pay the price and that the sky is going to fall in.
It is good to see that he has dragged himself away from the many lunches he has been telling the Financial Review he has been having—`the Minister for Lunch', as he is becoming known now. His comments are disappointing because this bill was brought on yesterday for the first time. We are seeing the government attempting to paint the Labor Party as the reason it has taken three years for this bill to make it into this chamber; whereas the government has not seen fit to give this bill the priority that I believe it deserved. This is not actually a criticism in any way of Senator Ian Campbell, because he has a case of Grange on it for a start, Senator Murray possibly has a couple of bottles to come out 
 of it, and I don't drink so I am clear on the Grange.
—Perhaps I could have your bottle then.
—Yes, Senator Murray, you can have my bottle. Senator Ian Campbell has done everything he can to speed the passage of this bill; I can personally attest to that, as I am sure Senator Murray can. The problem we had is that this government did not bring this bill forward until yesterday. This government had not sought to prioritise this bill and bring it on. Yet, it has continually gone into the boardrooms of this country saying that the Labor Party has been the problem and that the Labor Party has been the reason that this bill has not been passed.
Let us look at Mr Hockey's comments recently when he was being asked in an interview with the Financial Review to justify his $7 million given to him for his portfolio area. He said that the `financial services ambassador' has to have a high profile, that you have to have one on one contact and that anyone who is expecting a major statement in this area would be disappointed. He said:
There's no big bang, there's no great unveiling. It's a brick-by-brick construction job. . . 
The journalist goes on to say:
. . . the strategy essentially involves Mr Hockey sitting down to a lot of lunches, dinners and boardroom meetings with multinational bankers.
Well, what a portfolio that would be to have. We could not get that lucky, Senator Murray. The minister went on to say:
I'll meet with anyone from insurers to international banks to exchanges to central banks, and from chief executives to divisional heads.
I have to tell you: that is a long lunch list. No wonder this bill has not been able to get here. He has been in the job for 12 months and it has taken him 12 months to bring this bill into the chamber. Then he wants to turn around and accuse us, in between his international junkets, in between being overseas and wooing the world, as he describes it. He then wants to blame the Labor Party and say that we are slowing down this process. It is not good enough; the government cannot have it both ways. We have sought to cooperate at all points. We have legitimate points of differ 
 ence on this bill. We have made them clear for months. It is not the Labor Party that did not prioritise this bill and bring it on in this chamber. The minister also said, in answer to a dorothy dix question a month or two ago:
The Labor Party is solely responsible for the delay in this bill. It is solely responsible for the bill not beginning on 1 July.
That is the minister's statement, Senator Campbell. You should point out to him that he did not list this bill, and that the first time it appeared was yesterday because that is what the government's priorities were, not, as he continually asserts—and he has just asserted again in the other place—because we have been the problem here. Further on in his answer, he said:
The Labor Party should have the courage to come into this House and admit that it has been deliberately delaying government legislation in the Senate.
Again, this is not true. The government chose its priorities; it wanted the GST package through before 30 June. It did not have the courage to list CLERP in this chamber before 30 June; it did not list it until last week. He goes on to say:
I am not going to cop the member for Melbourne coming in here and reading the instructions from Senator Conroy.
And I am not going to cop the minister standing up in the other place making accusations without foundation against me and the member for Melbourne when in actual fact what happened is that he has not been able to drag himself away from his international trips to New York—the roving `financial services ambassador'. All he had to do was rove over to the Senate and list the bill. That is all he had to do.
—Where are you going next week?
—I will be trying to keep pace with Joe, but it is a pretty tough call. So I am not going to cop the minister standing up and giving us a serve every time he sees fit to try to paper over his own deficiencies by blaming the Labor Party. It is not good enough, and I am not going to stand for it, just like he said he is not going to stand for it. So, if Mr Hockey wants to be fair dinkum about this process, he should stand up 
 and say, `We did not list this bill. We did not give it priority, but now we have finally done it.' It is not Senator Ian Campbell's fault, as I have said. Senator Campbell has fought, kicked and scratched to try to get this bill up and through as fast as he can. So this is in no way a reflection on Senator Ian Campbell. But the minister should not be allowed to mislead the chamber, to mislead the business community in this country and to mislead the Australian public about the way the movement of this bill has happened.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-14,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6 on sheet 1592 revised:
(4)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 232 (before line 5), before paragraph 667A(1)(a), insert:
		 (aa)	 be prepared by a person nominated by ASIC under section 667AA; and
(5)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 232 (after line 21), after section 667A, insert:
667AA  Expert to be nominated
	 (1)	 A person who proposes to obtain an expert's report for the purposes of section 663B, 664C or 665B must request ASIC in writing to nominate a person to prepare the expert's report.
	 (2)	 Within 14 days after receiving a request under subsection (1), ASIC must nominate:
			 (a)	 an appropriate person to prepare the report; or
			 (b)	 up to 5 appropriate persons, one of whom the person making the request may choose to prepare the report.
	 (3)	 In determining whether a person is an appropriate person to prepare an expert's report, and without limiting the matters that ASIC may consider, ASIC must consider the nature of the company to be valued.
(6)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 233 (after line 25), at the end of section 667C, add:
	 (2)	 Without limiting subsection (1), in determining what is fair value for securities for the purposes of this Chapter, the consideration (if any) paid for securities in that class within the previous 6 months must be taken into account.
I will speak very briefly to these amendments. Amendments Nos 4 and 5 relate to the new 
 compulsory acquisition power and are all about ensuring that the price minority shareholders are paid is fair. Under the existing provisions of this bill, an expert is commissioned by the 90 per cent holder to prepare an expert report on the value of the securities being compulsorily acquired.
As I mentioned during my speech on the second reading, the Australian Democrats think it is appropriate for the expert to be appointed by an independent body. During negotiations with the government we canvassed numerous possible options as to who the independent appointee should be. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that ASIC is in the best position to undertake this role. It will be incumbent on a 90 per cent holder to request ASIC to nominate a person or up to five persons from which the 90 per cent holder can choose to prepare the report. In determining whether a person is appropriate to prepare the report, ASIC is obliged to consider the nature of the company to be valued and, obviously, obliged to consider the appropriateness of the professionals available. Our desire is that these amendments increase the independence and the perception of independence of the preparation of the expert's report, and that has been a longstanding aim of ours.
Amendment No. 6 relates to the new compulsory acquisition provisions and particularly to the determination of a fair value for the securities which are the subject of the compulsory acquisition. The amendment requires that, in determining what is fair value for securities, the price, if any, paid for securities within the previous six months must be taken into account. I commend those amendments to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-10-14,"—I just want to say something about this independent choosing of experts, as if ASIC is a body that has the capabilities of deciding whether a person is a reasonable expert or not. That is normally something that is left to the court to decide, and it also locks in the ability of a person to litigate and to have his matter heard on the basis that he wants to put it, or she wants to put—or it wants to put it, for that matter. Apparently it is now the 
 position in Victoria—it used to be the position only in Queensland, and Senator Hutchins will remember this—that you have a panel of doctors and an injured worker has to take one of those doctors as the expert in the field. But, if that doctor is wrong, the person gets nowhere near the compensation that he or she ought to. I notice the position in Queensland—and I must check in Victoria, since it has come in there now—is that the sorts of doctors chosen are not those who are all that sympathetic to the injured worker.
This is a repeat of that. You have the person who is likely to be in the weakest position—the one in the 10 per cent of those who hold shares—having to put up with an `expert' chosen by ASIC, who, we have been told, does not like greenmailers, those in the 10 per cent, and that person has got to make do with that. ASIC cannot be cross-examined about the way they go about choosing the expert. The expert can. But why this great lack of faith in the court's ability to decide who the expert ought to be and what the ability of that expert ought to be? Why do we consistently lack faith in our judicial system? Why do we foist upon people witnesses that they might not want? Yet we say we are in a free society.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-10-14,—The opposition opposes sections 664A to 665C.,SENATE,<title>CORPORATE LAW ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-10-14,"—In rising to support the Labor Party in it opposition to these sections, I would like to raise some concerns with relation to proposed part 6A.2. This section proposes to introduce a new compulsory acquisition power which would enable a majority shareholder to compulsorily acquire the shares of the minority shareholders without making a proper takeover offer. This is not only unfair to minority shareholders, but it is also unnecessary in light of the following: the government's proposal to allow capital gains tax rollover relief for scrip takeover offers; other amendments included in the bill facilitating the acquisition of the shares of dissenting shareholders following a takeover offer which has received 90 per cent acceptance, and other 
 existing provisions in the Corporations Law enabling a majority of shareholders to acquire the shares of minority shareholders at a fair price; section 661E, which proposes to take away the powers of a court to prevent a compulsory acquisition of shares which is clearly unfair to the shareholders whose shares it is proposed are to be acquired; section 667A(1), which proposes to prevent an expert's report from stating whether or not the terms of a proposed compulsory acquisition are fair and reasonable; and, lastly, section 667C, which proposes to impose an arbitrary and unfair formula for valuing securities.
There is a list of companies which at this time are clearly being affected by this proposal from the government. These companies all have a shareholder or shareholders with more than 90 per cent of the capital. I would like to take the time of the Senate to name a few of these companies and the possibilities that they face. They are Albert Street Property Ltd, formerly Fitwear Ltd, and Mr Solly Lew, who owns 90 per cent of that company. Australian Consolidated Investments Ltd, previously known as Bell Resources Ltd, then under the control of Alan Bond, is owned 97.866 per cent by Brierley Investments Ltd, a New Zealand public company. There are 3,053 other shareholders holding the balance of that company. Some of those are banks and sharebroker nominee companies and it would be anticipated that they would represent a number of those minority shareholders.
Allgas Energy Ltd is currently under takeover offer in respect of ordinary shareholdings. It seems this will go to compulsory acquisition after which the preference shareholders will be swept away by the new legislation. Recently, merchant bank advisers have been indicating to the preference shareholders that they may be expected to receive a much lower price for their shares than they would recently have been offered.
Other companies include Bond Industries Ltd; H. Beecham & Company Ltd, which is a class of preferential shareholders, the parent being the Wright family company; Carlton Hotel Ltd, which is a class of preferential shareholders and of which the ultimate parent 
 is Amalgamated Holdings Ltd; Caesar Fabrics Ltd; Goldstream Australia Ltd, whose parent company is Southcorp Ltd; Forbes Securities Ltd; Goldrim Mining Australia Ltd, the parent company there being Marac Ltd owned by the McIntosh family; Goodyear Australia Ltd, which is a class of preferential shareholders, the parent being Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Company of the United States.
Lasarex Ltd has 98.75 per cent of ordinary shares owned by Continental Venture Capital Ltd and there is in excess of another 1,000 shareholders, most of whom have held the shares since that company was floated; Morning Star Holdings Australia Ltd; MBf Carpenters Ltd; National Consolidated Ltd; Pauls Ltd is a preferential share class of 40 shareholders and the parent now is an Italian company. So we have an Italian company which will be in the position to acquire the remaining 10 per cent of Australian shareholders in that company and there are concerns as to whether those people will get just value for their shares. That same Italian parent company has also recently taken over Pauls Ltd, which is the former QUF company.
Public Holdings (Australia) Ltd is more than 90 per cent owned by a Hong Kong based Indonesian group; Quatro Ltd; Standard Chartered Bank Australia Ltd is a preferential share class and the parent company is Standard Chartered Pty Ltd; Van Diemens Land Company, which was established by royal charter from George III and is now more than 90 per cent owned by Tasman Agriculture Ltd; and, lastly, Geoffrey Thompson Holdings Ltd, now more than 90 per cent owned by the Geoffrey Thompson family.
If the government's proposal goes forward, even if these companies do as the government indicated but one per cent of the company holdings—in other words, 10 per cent of the minority 10 per cent shareholders—decide to go to court under the conditions that the government is proposing, these companies will find themselves in a position where they will not be able to argue whether the price that is being offered is just and fair. I believe that this is definitely an unfair impost on those people.
In conclusion, I support the Labor Party's opposition to this section, which will bring a balance, I believe, and give minority shareholders a chance to remain in the market until such time as they believe it is the correct time for them to sell their shares. We are venturing into a section where we are legislating when people can and cannot sell their shares. I think that is to the detriment of the whole intent of publicly listed companies.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-10-14,"—The opposition supports the Customs (Tariff Concession System Validations) Bill 1999 . I notice the Democrats are about to move an amendment, and I would expect that to be on the basis that this is retrospective. I think retrospectivity is bad. The defence, if that is the right word to use, of those proposing the bill is that this was a mistake—that everybody knew what the situation was and the mistake was quite apparent and that, therefore, it is reasonable, in the interests of revenue, to make retrospective legislation so that the money that has been collected will after this have been collected lawfully. Up until now, it is has been collected unlawfully.
The opposition supports this position, but it is good to get legislation right when it is first written. If we get legislation right when it is first written, people do not have the opportunity to get themselves into a position with money whereby it has to be taken from them by retrospective legislation, as you know, Parliamentary Secretary, from your many years as one of the well-known figures on the Regulations and Ordinances and the Scrutiny of Bills committees. In any event, I make those comments and indicate that the opposition is supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS (TARIFF CONCESSION SYSTEM VALIDATIONS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-14,"—In rising to speak on the Customs (Tariff Concession System Valida 
 tions) Bill 1999 , I was amused by two things. Firstly, Senator Cooney and I discussed how the shifting sands of truth, light and justice move. He was vigorously opposed to me just now, and I am now vigorously opposed to him. The second thing I was amused by was his willingness to refer to the many years the parliamentary secretary has been in this place.
—No, on Scrutiny of Bills and Regs and Ords.
—My mother always said to me that you never refer to years, and when she died I discovered that she had always told us the wrong age!
I understand that the purpose of this bill is to remove any doubt about the validity of certain decisions made by officers of the Australian Customs Service in relation to the tariff concession system. The tariff concession system allows for goods to be imported at a concessional rate of duty, essentially in circumstances where there are no local manufacturers of substitutable goods.
In November 1995 the Chief Executive Officer of Customs generally delegated his powers and functions in relation to the tariff concession system to certain officers of Customs. In July 1996 the government made changes to the tariff concession system. Those changes resulted in amendments to the Customs Act, including the introduction of additional powers and functions. New delegations were not sought for powers that were added to sections of the act which were already the subject of the November 1995 instrument. It was thought at the time that that instrument was sufficient.
However, doubt was raised over the sufficiency of the delegations in relation to the tariff concession system in a recent hearing of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In response to this, the Chief Executive Officer signed two instruments on 31 May 1999. The first revoked all delegations for the tariff concession system; the second issued a new delegation covering all the powers and functions in relation to the tariff concession system. Both instruments took effect on 1 July 1999. The consequence of all this is that certain decisions and actions taken in relation to the tariff concession system subsequent to 
 the July 1996 changes to the act may—and I stress `may'—have been subject to inadequate delegations.
This bill will remove any doubt about the validity of decisions made between July 1996 and 31 May 1999. The retrospective validation will not apply to tariff concession matters raised in the AAT as at 1 June 1999 where a customs decision relied on an insufficient delegation or person who, as at 1 June 1999, had already applied for a refund of duty based on an insufficient delegation.
The problem that the Democrats have with this bill is the arbitrary cut-off date. If you applied for a refund of duty because of the inadequate delegation before 1 June 1999, then you were okay. If you have just discovered that you would have had a right to a refund, then it is too late. In other words, same classes of taxpayers are being dealt with in a different way. The Democrats are not comfortable with the backdating of the cut-off date. It should be made clear that people who potentially had the right to obtain a refund of duty were not given notice of that right and, as far as I am aware, the Customs Service did not publicly advertise prior to 1 June 1999 that from that date the rights to refunds would be extinguished.
I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage which has been circulated. It will seek to amend the 1 June 1999 cut-off date to the date on which this bill commences. This amendment would have the affect of allowing anyone who has claimed a refund or commenced review proceedings in the AAT before the commencement date to continue with their application. The right to obtain a refund will be cut off only from the date of commencement.
I understand, from what Senator Cooney has said, that the Labor Party will not support me in that amendment, essentially for the reason that they feel they must deal with the bill in the Senate in precisely the same way as they have dealt with the bill in the House of Representatives. Also, because this issue was not raised with them before the bill was dealt with in the other chamber, they cannot at this time change their position. If that summary of your situation is untrue, I am 
 sure you will tell me but, if that is correct, I think it indicates an inflexibility which is regrettable. The Australian Democrats will take the amendment on the voices and will be supporting the passage of the bill thereafter.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS (TARIFF CONCESSION SYSTEM VALIDATIONS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-10-14,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions and also for the fact that they have done so succinctly. The Australian Democrats have been concerned that the bill may be invalid as it could represent an acquisition of property on unjust terms, contrary to section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. Legal advice obtained from the Chief General Counsel of the Australian Government Solicitor indicates that the bill is not a law with respect to the acquisition of property for the purposes of that section. A copy of that advice has been provided to the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party.
With respect to the amendment, the bill does not remove any legal right that a person or company may have to seek review of a decision made under the tariff concession system. It simply acts to remove any doubt about the validity of certain decisions to the extent that they were taken in reliance on a delegation that may not have been sufficient. It does not change the decisions which have been made. The effect of the amendment would be to provide a windfall gain to any importer who chooses to lodge a refund or AAT application before the bill receives royal assent. This would also reinstate certain tariff concession orders even though application of the provisions of the tariff concession system has established that those tariff concession orders should be revoked. The government will not be supporting the Democrats amendment. I commend the bill to the chamber.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-10-14,"—The opposition supports this bill with an amendment which I understand the government accepts. This is a bill which strengthens the power of Customs at the border. It is a lot better to stop things at the border than to discover them within the country. I think the time is coming when it is more and more urgent to get some sort of system going where matters are stopped before they even get to the border. In other words, we need to come to an arrangement with other countries to stop drugs and other illegal cargo being taken away from the port of departure. In any event, this is a move to strengthen the border, and the opposition agrees with that move.
The opposition's amendment takes away vicarious criminal liability. The bill, as originally written, made employers criminally responsible for the actions of their employees, which is a very harsh approach. It is different with companies. Companies are organisations which, by their very nature, operate through a whole series of people. In the course of that operation, as it were, within its shell—that is, the body of the company that is made up by all of these people—if part of that body acts 
 in a criminal way, then the body itself is criminally responsible. For example, if the hand did something—if it stole with the mind behind it—then that is criminal and the whole body is criminal.
—It depends if you are left or right handed!
—It does not matter what it is. Why should an employer be responsible when he or she had no part in the crime at all? Just because there is an employment relationship between the two, if the employer is punished and given a criminal conviction, it is just not right. I am very pleased to see that the government has realised that it will be fairer to go with this amendment.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-14,"—My colleague Senator Stott Despoja made a number of comments on Labor's amendment in her minority report when the Senate Legal and Constitution Legislation Committee inquired into the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 [1999] . I draw the Senate's attention to those comments. This bill makes companies and people criminally responsible for certain actions of their employees. Statutory and common law determines the obligations of companies. As fictional legal entities, it has been appropriate to attach vicarious liability for the criminal actions of their employees. However, individuals should not be treated in the same way as companies. It is not appropriate for vicarious liability to attach to a person for the behaviour of other persons, whether they be employees or employers.
There are relationships between people which properly attract criminal sanctions. A person might rightly be punished for aiding and abetting another or inciting him or her in the commission of a crime, but the relationship giving rise to those offences is quite different from that established by employment alone. The Democrats cannot accept that a person should be deemed to be a criminal simply because he or she employs someone else who commits an offence. Criminality is a grave matter. It ought not be visited on anyone without due course. I wish to place on the record that the Australian Democrats 
 unreservedly support the amendment moved by the Labor Party and will thereafter support the bill.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech

The Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 [1999]  contains legislative amendments proposed by the government to implement part of the Tough on Drugs strategy, an initiative announced by the Prime Minister on 2 November 1997. The bill amends the Customs Act 1901 with the objective of providing Customs officers with more effective powers in relation to the detection of illicit drugs at the border. The bill also amends the Customs Administration Act 1985 in relation to the use made of information obtained or held by the Australian Customs Service.
The issue of vicarious liability was raised and was the subject of two minority reports of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—one from the opposition and one from the Democrats. The government will agree to the proposed amendment to remove personal liability. Individuals should not be held liable for the action of their employees in relation to vicarious liability. I indicate that the government will be supporting the amendment. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-10-14,"—The Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Border Interception) Bill 1999  seeks to give added protection to the Olympic Games movement in Sydney. I have seen you running through Sydney, Mr Acting Deputy President Campbell. It is not too late to set your sights on the Olympic Games.
This legislation is tied up with the whole concept of intellectual property. It is good to see that intellectual property is given protection. Perhaps we ought to give more protection than we presently do to intellectual property outside the Olympic Games. It has often been said in this place and elsewhere that intellectual property is the way forward to the future. The protection we give to the intellectual property connected with the Olympic Games ought to be the sort of protection we give to intellectual property generally.
In this context, I cannot resist pointing out a report that was done in this general area in 1995 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. It was during that inquiry that the new system of Senate committees came in. The new system came in on 10 October 1995, as the Deputy Clerk will well remember. Like all their works, it was seminal at that time.
—A few of us remember.
—As Senator West says, a few of us do remember. If more people remembered and took regard of reports like this, this legislation would have been passed with enthusiasm.

I thank Senator Cooney for his very succinct speech. I have to agree with you that it is not something that you could make a passionate speech about. The Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  proposes to amend the Customs Act in three separate areas. Those areas are: the introduction of an electronic lodgment and payments system for refunds of customs duty, the introduction of a deferral facility and the extension from one year to three years for customs agent licences.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-14,"—When the message from the House of Representatives came to this chamber this morning, there was some banter about this being fishy legislation. I was guilty of that, as was Senator Ian Campbell. There is nothing flippant about the legislation because there are three main purposes of the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 . The first is to provide for more effective enforcement against foreign vessels and foreign nationals engaging in illegal fishing within Australian waters. The second is to implement a range of legislative measures that will allow Australia to ratify the agreement for the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea relating to the conservation and management of straddle stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. The third is to allow Australia to participate in regional fisheries management organisations under the fish stocks agreement.
The bill consists of two schedules. The first relates to new forfeiture and enforcement powers to combat illegal foreign fishing. These measures are aimed at ensuring more efficient fisheries surveillance and enforcement within the Australian fishing zone. The second relates to implementing obligations necessary to ratify the above convention. Both schedules address the growing use of illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. The issue of illegal fishing in Australian waters has unfortunately been an ongoing and increasing problem, and for that reason the opposition is happy to support this bill.
The fishing industry in Australia is a key primary industry, particularly in regional areas such as the state of Tasmania. It is also an industry that continues to grow in importance. Recent surveys of fish consumption in Australia indicate an increase in consumption of some 13 per cent since 1991. Australian 
 exports have also risen over the past decade from about $783 million to just under $1.5 billion. That remarkable export performance is built around our highly prized and highly priced shellfish and other fish sold at a premium into the Asian markets in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. Tuna, abalone, crabs, prawns, scallops and rock lobsters are all in increasing demand in those markets. It is important to note that these past growth patterns and export performance can only be sustained if these key fisheries are managed in a sustainable manner. A number of these fisheries are very susceptible to overfishing, and the problem of illegal fishing only exacerbates that problem. We are therefore happy to support this bill.",SENATE,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-10-14,"—Having a personal history of working within the fishing industry, I have a particular interest in such matters. I am pleased to report that the Democrats do support this bill, the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 , for the following reasons. Conservation groups, the fishing industry and the general community have expressed a strong interest and concern in the issues of unsustainable high seas fishing and illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, particularly as they affect Australia's living resources. I recall—I think it was only my first week here in the Senate—when orange roughie was fish of the day—if you will forgive me for saying that. Not only is it a practice which is decimating fish stocks around the world; it is also a practice which is threatening the viability of the Australian fishing industry.
This bill provides for far more effective enforcement against foreign vessels and foreign nationals engaging in illegal fishing within Australian waters. It will greatly aid the Australian fishing industry and, in significantly increasing the powers of fisheries to detain illegal vessels, it will provide significant protection for those depleting fish stocks. Firstly, as Senator O'Brien said, it will change the current conviction based scheme for illegal foreign fishers to one which is based on the automatic forfeiture of vessels, gear and catch of illegal foreign fishers apprehended in Australian waters—not only commercial 
 fishers but also recreational fishers. Secondly, it will ensure that the automatic forfeiture regime for foreign fishers will prevail over the Admiralty Act 1988. Thirdly, it will strengthen the powers of fisheries officers to detain and deal with illegal foreign vessels, including use of reasonable force. For example, they will have explicit powers consistent with international law to use reasonable force when requiring a boat to stop to apprehend foreign boats suspected of illegal fishing. Examples of reasonable force could include firing at or into a ship after appropriate warning shots have been fired and using devices to stop propulsion of the boat. Finally, fines for such offences will be doubled with top penalties now rising to $550,000.
In relation to endangered species, the mechanism exists for listing under the CITES convention through appendix 2 of that convention. CITES is, of course, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. The CITES convention protects wildlife against overexploitation to prevent international trade from threatening species with extinction. This listing has been supported by both the Humane Society International and Greenpeace with regard to the Commonwealth government nominating southern bluefin tuna, orange roughie and Patagonian toothfish for listing at the CITES meeting in the year 2000.
In November 1998, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Robert Hill, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Mark Vaile, stated that if CCAMLR—that is, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources—is not prepared to move on Australia's proposals to stop illegal fishing of the Patagonian toothfish, Australia will `assess the role for other international fora such as the CITES convention'. I am confident that the Australian Democrats would be fully supportive of a CITES listing for those species.
A listing on appendix 2 of the CITES convention does not mean that commercial fishing would be banned or the trade of the products of such fishery, rather that they would be regulated under the CITES convention. The export of products of such species 
 would require a management plan to be developed under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 in a similar manner to which the export of kangaroo products is conducted.
CITES is an international tool to keep illegal fishing and its profits under control. We Democrats would certainly welcome this additional tool, which would further strengthen this bill. However, we note that the government must be prepared to deliver a submission to CITES on this matter before the closing date of 12 November this year—less than one month away—otherwise this opportunity would be lost. So, in supporting this bill, I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry if, when she rises to her feet in a moment, she can please explain why it is that the government appears to be dragging its feet on that proposal.",SENATE,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-10-14,"—I would like to thank senators for their contribution to the debate. Senator Greig, I hope to deal with that point that you raised before I finish. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  comes at a time when the issues of illegal and unregulated fishing are receiving a considerable amount of community attention and concern—and rightly so. Australia has the third largest fishing zone in the world. A lot of that zone is isolated and it has therefore been easier for people to make illegal use of our zone. It is a real challenge to adequately supervise such a large fishing area. We have some very valuable fishing stocks in Australia, and these are a considerable degree of attraction to rogue fishing operators, who are looking to free ride off the efforts of Australia to manage its fishing resources sustainably.
This bill will strengthen Australia's powers to manage and protect these resources, and there are two particular initiatives that I would like to mention. Schedule 1 has measures for more effective enforcement against those illegal foreign fishing operations and will provide for greater deterrents for those seeking to take fish from our waters. The second, dealt with in schedule 2, allows for the 
 implementation of the United Nations fish stocks agreement that provides for more effective management of straddling and highly migratory species, many of which are found in Australian waters.
The deterrence measures were developed as a result of the experience in apprehending a vessel poaching Patagonian toothfish in the subantarctic Heard and McDonald islands areas and also from the apprehension of significant numbers of boats to Australia's north. Obviously when you have to travel a very long way over several days, as one did in the Antarctic to apprehend the vessel, it has to be done with equipment that is capable of making such a journey and in secrecy to make sure that the vessels do not abscond in the time that is available for us to reach those isolated areas. Our success in that regard in the Antarctic and Heard and McDonald island areas was somewhat mitigated when the law proved not adequate to enable us to impose the maximum possible penalty, including forfeiture. This legislation removes that loophole provided by the Admiralty Act and should give illegal operators and financiers of their operations, particularly sophisticated fishers from distant water fishing nations, something more to think about.
Schedule 1 also enables the government to put into place new provisions to allow Australia to take action against mother ships located outside the Australian fishing zone but supporting illegal fishing activities within that zone. These mother ships are increasingly prevalent in international waters and their large capacity to process and store fish makes them an extreme threat to responsible and sustainable management of our fish resources.
The bill also allows, for the first time, fisheries officers the capacity to take strong enforcement action and to use reasonable force, including firing at vessels and taking other necessary action. The bill provides for building on current efforts to manage straddling and highly migratory stocks on a regional basis. It supports cooperative regional management and creates a legal framework for the implementation of regional fisheries management arrangements.
The ratification of the fish stocks agreement by Australia and participation in regional fisheries organisations will help secure access to fish resources both within and outside the Australian fishing zone. Regional fisheries organisations will be responsible for devising cooperative measures to conserve and manage the relevant regional stocks. This regime will be legally binding on members, who will be required to abide by these measures or refrain from participating in the fisheries, and members of these organisations will have the right to enforce these measures on the other parties to the agreement. Currently, the value of the straddling and highly migratory species to the Australian economy is over $250 million. Given the importance of these species to employment in many coastal communities around Australia, the bill will ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of these valuable fish species important for environmental and economic viability of our regions.
At this point I want to acknowledge the support that the government has received from industry. Industry sees the benefit of stronger resource security and sustainability offered by the implementation of the fish stocks agreement. This bill is not the only action the government is taking in relation to ensuring better management of our fish stocks. We have the oceans policy; we have ongoing work in the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, particularly current work on a trade certification for toothfish; we have our much publicised efforts in the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna; our ongoing action in the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea to bring Japan to account for its unilateral experimental fishing program; we have ongoing work in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission; we have current negotiations for the development of a regional fisheries agreement in the western and southern Pacific; we have our commitment of $16.3 million to increasing surveillance and enforcement measures in the subantarctic; and we have our work to ensure that the issues of fishery subsidies are discussed in a new round of world trade negotiations. These are all examples of the government's commitment to 
 conservation and sustainable management of our diverse fisheries resources.
Lastly, Senator Greig, I refer to the question you asked me earlier. The fish stocks agreement legislation allows for strengthening regional organisations such as the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources—also, I believe, known as CCAMLR. In CCAMLR a fish certification system is well advanced after intercessional meetings this year, and it is expected that this certification regime may be adopted in the CCAMLR meeting later this year. In the southern bluefin tuna context, catch certification is also well advanced, and where these specific regional organisations have designed trade catch certification processes CITES control may not be so necessary. I hope that answers your question, Senator Greig.
To briefly sum up, the government has made strong efforts in this legislation to pursue strong action to support the sustainability of our fisheries resources, backed by international law. The passage of the bill will send a clear message to those foreign fishers, who might now think twice about fishing illegally. As well, it provides real benefits for the conservation of marine resources in Australia and also the future viability of our very important fishery industry. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-10-14,"—My question without notice is to Senator Ellison, representing the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Is the minister aware of this morning's stampede of the Prime Minister and his ministers to distance themselves from their colleague Dr David Kemp and his cabinet submission on higher education? As the minister representing Dr Kemp in the Senate, 
 will the minister also publicly repudiate his colleague?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Higher Education: Government Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,15,1,question
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-10-14,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Given that you say the Prime Minister has ruled out vouchers, can you confirm that on 17 April 1998 Dr Kemp issued a statement setting out unequivocally that the Howard government had:
. . . no intention of introducing vouchers for post-secondary education or deregulating university fees.
In light of the fact that the leaked cabinet submission proposes exactly that, what possible credibility can Dr Kemp have—or the Prime Minister have, for that matter—having stated as they have today that these proposals are not on the government's agenda?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Higher Education: Government Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,15,1,question
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-10-14,"—At the outset, there is absolutely no distance between the Prime Minister and Dr Kemp. They are of one accord on this. The Prime Minister himself has totally rejected the scare campaign of the opposition over there, who are trying to scare Australian students into believing that we are going to go down the American path. The Prime Minister has said that we will not do that. The Prime Minister has said that we will stick by our commitments and he has ruled out a voucher system. He has said that we will stick with the HECS system. In fact, there is even a proposal to expand it.
—Is that the same commitment as with the GST?
—The opposition obviously do not want to hear this because they want to beat this question up. They want to scare the Australian public into believing that we are going down the path of introducing vouchers—the American system. The Prime Minister has totally rejected that. We will stand by our commitments—commitments to increase tertiary education in this country. In fact, under the coalition we have increased the number of students who have access to undergraduate university education. In 1999 there will be over 13,000 more Commonwealth fully subsidised places than there were in the last year of Labor. In just over three short years we have increased by over 13,000 the number of Commonwealth funded places for university students in this country.
There is other good news in relation to the tertiary education sector. Can I just point out—the opposition do not want to hear this—that university enrolments in 1999 have reached a record high, with just under 30,000 more students enrolling in 1999 than in the last year of Labor. That spells out to the people of Australia that this government is doing great things for those students who want to engage in tertiary education.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-10-14,"—Senator Carr should not premise his question on an absolutely false assumption.
—Are you saying it is not true?
—And a number of them, I might add. What he said is that this is a cabinet submission. They will not even table the document. Why won't you table the document? Because you are saying that this is a cabinet submission.
—Senator Ellison, address your remarks through the chair.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-10-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Ellison) and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill), to questions without notice asked today, relating to higher education fees.
Today Senator Ellison said it all. He exposed the real Howard government policy, that is, `no fee, no degree'. We now have it all spelled out to us: $100,000 per degree is the basis of their new approach to funding higher education in this country. We are told that the Prime Minister and many other members of this government are seeking to walk away from their US style education system and their plans to deregulate university fees. The same approach has been taken as when Dr Kemp said in the past that he would not introduce vouchers—just as Senator Newman claims she has no secret claim to dismantle social security and just as the Prime Minister said he would never ever introduce a GST. The truth is out there for anyone to see. The truth is very simple: this government live by an ideological obsession with the privatisation and deregulation of this industry and the undermining of the capacity of ordinary Australians to enjoy the fruits of a higher education.
We see here a government which, when it says that there will be no introduction of an American style system, really means that there will be an introduction of a Kemp style, market driven Australian higher education system. Today we heard from Senator Hill that he would not even seek to rule out the possibility that there would be an introduction of student loans at commercial rates. We have a government which is seeking to introduce a hire—h-i-r-e—education system.
The government has based its policy on what it regards as core and non-core policies. We have seen senior Liberals explain to journalists `that Dr Kemp's policy is the skeleton of Fightback rattling in the closet, despite the fact that it was pronounced dead and buried by the coalition back in 1993'. We 
 have really seen the exposure of Dr Kemp, who stands naked as a result of his right wing ideological obsessions which are seeking now to be cloaked in some sort of virtue predicated on an assumption that their system is in crisis—a crisis created by this government, a crisis which results from the profound cuts to education that have been made by this government in recent times.
I would have thought that Senator Vanstone would have been saying a great deal more. I am sure she would be distraught to see the difficulties faced by her nemesis, Dr Kemp. I recall that it was Dr Kemp who rose to prominence as a result of his knifing of Senator Vanstone. Right now, Senator Vanstone is probably sending suggestions to the Prime Minister on the types of champagne that might be delivered to Dr Kemp, just as the Prime Minister delivered Senator Vanstone a bottle of champagne shortly before he dumped her. I would say that this is clearly—
—On a point of order, Madam Deputy President: I fail to see what this has to do with the answer under discussion. Would you redirect the senator back to the issues, please.
—This is a wide-ranging discussion. I call Senator Carr.
—It is quite clear to me that Senator Vanstone may well be the person we should thank for exposing this government's hypocrisy and its pattern of deceit with regard to higher education. Senator Vanstone knows only too well what the practices of this government are in reality: they say one thing, they do another. There is no way that anyone can believe for a moment the assurances given by this government, given their pattern of deceit in so many areas.
We have experienced the claims made by this government that they are not undertaking certain policies, when it has been quite apparent on at least two occasions this year, as a result of the documentation that the public has before it, that this government have been considering actions to move towards the deregulation of the university sector, the introduction of oppressive fees and the remov 
 al of any commitment they may have made in previous times. We have before us in written form the fact that this government have sought to introduce a new system of higher education which quite directly benefits those in this community who are already very wealthy and privileged and who will enjoy further advantage as a result of policies which are quite apparently directed at making sure that those who enjoy the fruits of power and privilege in this community will continue to do so.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Higher Education: Government Policy</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-10-14,"—What a waste of five minutes that was, listening to what Senator Carr had to say. I thought he was going to make a serious contribution in relation to educational policy, but talking about champagne between various ministers did not have much  at all to do with the answer to the question.
Moving to this spurious issue which has been brought up in the last 24 hours, we are faced with the situation of a document which is creating a storm in a teacup. This is not at all government policy that we are talking about. It is a great pity that the press has got into bed with the ALP and scaremongered, as we saw by the headlines today. Those headlines have nothing to do with government policy. These matters have not been discussed by cabinet or by the party. I chair the backbench committee and we certainly have not discussed any of them. This issue has no credibility, but at least it is something we can base some discussion on. By comparison, if we went to the ALP policy cupboard and we opened that cupboard, what would we find?
—It would be bare.
—Quite right, Senator Mason; it would be totally bare. Just like Old Mother Hubbard going to the cupboard to get a bone, we would find nothing in there because there is no ALP policy on this area.
The Labor Party were asleep for three years on policy leading up to the last election. They just hoped they would slide in at the end on the GST question without any policies. They did actually have a shadow minister at that time who had a few ideas. That was Mark Latham, who came up with one bright idea one morning and it was gone by the after 
 noon. It was actually an alternative to the HECS system. This was a shadow minister having the temerity to suggest that there should be an alternative to the HECS system. He announced that in the morning and by the afternoon Kim Beazley had stepped in—that other policy free zone—saying, `We can't have something like that. We can't have something that is different.' So that went out the door.
Mark Latham found the official policy of the ALP—it was devised by someone else in a back room somewhere—and he was so disgusted that, following the election, he resigned his position. He was a fellow who had a few ideas on education, unlike the current shadow minister for education, Michael Lee, who hasn't got an original idea in his head about the field of education. When he was the Minster for Communications, from 1993 to 1996, I called him the Rip Van Winkle of communications policy. He is now the Rip Van Winkle of education policy.
—You didn't get a laugh then and you don't get one now.
—Not from you, Senator—shock and dismay, I would have thought, because you know what I say is true. You are a man, Senator, who has some interest in the field of education. It must dismay you that there is no policy on the ALP side. You have been sitting there for five or six years now—
—We got four.
—Well, Senator, I invite you to get up following what I have to say and—
—I will.
—Good, and outline for us what the ALP policy is. We would love to know what the ALP policy is on education.
—Senator Tierney, would you address the Chair, please.
—Through you, Madam Deputy President—
—No, to me.
—Through you, Madam Deputy President, I would like to indicate to the senator that he should get to work. If his shadow minister is not going to write the 
 policy, he should get in and write the policy himself because the ALP certainly does not have one.
We need to continue to develop ideas in education because we were left with a terrible legacy by the ALP government in this area. I came into the Senate in 1991. At that stage in higher education there were 50,000 people knocking at the gates trying to get in. This was after eight years of Labor control of education policy. Over that time, for a start, fees were brought in. Senator Carr starts his speech today with, `No fees, no degrees'—
—That is Liberal policy.
—He starts on this issue but, Senator, your government brought in the fees in the first place. Then you increased the number of students and didn't bring in the resources to match. The result of that under the Labor policy was a decline in standards, a decline in the quality of what was delivered, a crisis in the libraries of the country and a run-down in the IT. That is what you left this country. What we have to do now to make up for your legacy of 13 years is come up with some creative ideas to try to improve the state of higher education. If we wait for the Labor Party to come up with that we will not get it, because you are a policy free zone.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-10-14,"—It is obvious that the government is running scared. The cat is out of the bag and the people of this country, particularly the students, the future university students, those who are about to sit for their HSC, and their families, have now had exposed to them what this government has in store for them in the future. Senator Tierney, in his rambling attempt at defence of this government's position on education, threw out a challenge. The ALP has form in respect of education—great form. You only have to look at some of the people in the ranks of those opposite who have been the beneficiaries of the great improvements that the Labor government made in the 1970s under Gough Whitlam and then in the 1980s under Prime Minister Hawke and then Prime Minister Keating to see what great achievements we produced.
For instance, look at people like the former minister for education, Senator Vanstone. She obtained her degree from university at a time when university fees were essentially non-existent—the great reform brought in by the Whitlam government that I and many others have been beneficiaries of. The same applies to the current spokesperson for education in this chamber, Senator Ellison. It is unfortunate that when they were given the job of running or representing the ministry of education they failed dismally.
For instance, what was Senator Vanstone's first move as the minister for education when this government came to power in 1996? It was to slash $800 million out of the university sector. When she tried to placate the vice-chancellors—not a noted pro-Labor group of people—who were irate about this government's policies on higher education, what was her response? In terms of university cuts it was: `Why don't you think of a number between about one and 15?' That is how seriously she treated it. And Senator Tierney has the hide to make some wisecrack about champagne, which is very relevant if you look at the record of the previous minister in regard to education policy.
But not only did the government do that; they massively increased HECS fees by about 125 per cent. That is what they did for students in this country—so much so that in the next two years there was a significant drop in the number of applications for university places. In 1997 and 1998 there were substantial reductions in applications. Why? Because of the increased costs that this government had imposed upon students together with the problems facing universities because of the massive cuts to their funding. What happened to Senator Vanstone? She couldn't cut it so she was kicked out of the ministry and kicked out of cabinet. I would venture to say that it will not be long before the current minister suffers the same fate, given his proposals for education.
What are those proposals? As we have seen exposed, they involve total deregulation of the university sector and forcing the children of the battler families of this country—whom the Prime Minister Howard said he would look 
 after—to pay $100,00 or more to get a university degree.
—To choose.
—That's right, Senator Hutchins—to have to make choices as to whether they can afford in the future to send their children to university—the dream of every child in this country to get a higher education; the dream of every child and the dream of every parent.
You say that this is a beat-up. Well, the only people that are doing the beating up are this government and this minister. They are beating up the families and those students that right now are about to go and sit for the HSC. That is the real scaremongering. You are frightening the living daylights out of them in terms of the policy that you have in store for them. It has taken the exposure of this policy today to demonstrate the real difference between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. We stand for education, for educational opportunity and for equity for Australian children. We have always done it and we have been responsible for the great reforms. You stand for the wealthy and the privileged. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Higher Education: Government Policy</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1,speech
"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,1999-10-14,"—What a sorry spectacle Senator Forshaw made, having to follow the performance of Senator Carr. Senator Carr rather reminded me of a story I heard when I was younger about a veteran newspaper editor who was teaching younger cadets how to write newspaper headlines. He said, `A good editor can always compress the story into one line.' For example, the story of the first part of Exodus, about Moses, could be compressed to say, `Moses opens mouth; bull rushes out.' We could easily substitute Senator Carr for that, for his performance.
Senator Hutchins interjecting—
—Don't give up the day job.
—No. Stay here and laugh, Senator Forshaw.
—Order! Address the chair, please, and ignore the interjections. Senator Hutchins was being totally disorderly. He was not in his place.
—Madam Deputy President, you described Senator Carr's comments as being wide ranging. He certainly was wide ranging. Nevertheless, the senators on the other side are to be congratulated because they have managed to bring this particular topic up at this time knowing that there is a more serious debate foreshadowed by the Democrat Senator Stott Despoja. I hope that Senator Carr will be able to improve his performance at that time. Bringing this particular motion up at this point is quite a good move of Senator Carr's. We are talking about higher education in this country. There are two political parties in this country which aspire to be in government, and there is only one party that has a policy in education. The Labor Party does not have an education policy, notwithstanding its rhetoric. We took government three years ago in 1996. Has the Labor Party actually enunciated its education policy yet—on university education, on secondary education, on further education, on any of this? Not at all.
You have a shadow minister on education who has managed not to speak on education topics for three years. There is no policy. That is keeping in mind that when Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition in the other house, became Leader of the Opposition, he proclaimed that he was going to be the education prime minister. Yet, all this time, the only policy that the Labor Party actually came up with was, as Senator Tierney mentioned, put up by Mr Mark Latham, who subsequently lost his job. That is his reward for actually coming up with alternative policies.
There is a very obvious reason why the Labor Party have no policy at the moment. It is because they are still recovering from 13 years of managing education without a policy. At the time when the Labor Party lost government, there was enormous unmet demand in the community. We heard that in 1991. The Labor government had introduced a fee payment for university education but they had done nothing about funding universities. They encouraged more students to apply for and go to university and then did nothing to improve the situation there. At the time when the Howard government took over, there was 
 unmet demand of at least 40,000 qualified students who could not get places.
The Howard government has introduced positive policies. We are determined to make Australia an educated, knowledge based society with opportunity for all, regardless of their financial circumstances and the financial circumstances of their institution.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,1999-10-14,"—In taking note of answers this afternoon, I wish to reserve my comments to the impact on regional universities, notably in Queensland, of the Kemp proposals we have seen in the last couple of days. When Senator Ellison made his comments today, he omitted to remember this important sector of higher education in Australia—that is, regional universities across our nation. Haven't this government learned the lesson of Victoria—the lesson that all of us have seen in the last three weeks? Haven't they seen what rural Australia will do when they have been forgotten? I suggest that this Kemp model will herald the end of regional universities across this nation. It is not only I and the ALP that recognise that. Mr Mullarvey, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee Acting Executive Director, said today in the Courier-Mail  that if the proposal was embraced and funding to universities was cut it would be a major concern for Australia. He went on to say that under proposed changes newer and regional universities would find it difficult to survive.
The phone calls to my office today from Townsville, Cairns, Mackay, Rockhampton and Toowoomba support this view. Let me explain to the government about the characteristics of regional universities.
—James Cook has done very well out of this government.
—With the support of the Queensland government, thank you very much. Regional universities, by their nature, have a less wealthy population than universities in the city. They have an older population and they enrol more mature age women. They are emerging in their specialisation. I congratulate the James Cook University on the work that they have done in developing their specialisation. They contribute enormously to 
 their local communities through their participation in the day-to-day operations of the community in which they are placed.
Let us look at the impact of the Kemp proposals on regional universities. Because students in regional universities are poorer than their city cousins, they will be even less likely to embark on a university education in the knowledge that they will have a bill of more than $100,000 to pay on graduation. Older students, many of whom are women—more than 40 per cent of students in some of the regional universities in Australia—are far less likely to return to university to improve their employability. They probably have one or two children and have a mortgage and ongoing financial commitments to their families. They are very unlikely to undertake university education in the knowledge that, on completion, they will have to pay back $100,000 or more.
Under this government we are moving to a system of haves and have-nots. Regional Australia already suffers under the tyrannies of distance and the higher cost of living. This government is driving the wedge between city and country even further in terms of educational opportunities for regional Australia. This Kemp policy will deny regional Australia access to tertiary education.
Let us look further at the impact on the universities themselves. As I have said, regional universities are emerging in their specialisation. They are younger and they are newer—they are establishing themselves. They are struggling to develop their options for students under this government with the incredible cuts they have suffered. They are struggling to develop their research capacity. Come the Kemp model, it is the research arm of those regional universities that will suffer. Regional universities are looking to specialise and carve a niche in the education sector, but what chance will they have to develop those specialisations, as some of our other universities have been able to do?
I now turn to the impact on a community that the Kemp model will bring. Regional universities contribute significantly to our regional centres. I know that personally, coming from Cairns and seeing the change in 
 our community when the James Cook University of North Queensland established its campus in our city. It was a wonderful change that that university brought. The contribution of students and staff to general community activities has improved the quality of life in our centre. Under the Kemp model, those universities will not be able to contribute to the broader society of our regional towns, because they will be spending all of their time focused on the business of teaching. Can I suggest that the Kemp model follows the ideology of this government as a whole. It is back to the future.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,1999-10-14,"—We have heard from Senator Ellison, the Prime Minister and Dr Kemp that there will be no deregulation of fees and no US style voucher system.
—Do you believe them? No-one does in the Labor Party!
—Senator Carr often misunderstands the politics of the eighties and the nineties. The Left are irrelevant in the nineties. Let me explain why. I had the privilege the other day to address students at QUT, Brisbane. They all accept, down to a student, that they should help with their fees.
—And they do in this system!
—That is right. I will get to that in a minute, Senator Stott Despoja. They all accept that they should pay fees. They accept that the government gives them a subsidised tertiary education and that they should contribute to that. All of them believe in the ethic of mutual obligation in tertiary education. Of course, the only ones who gibbered at that were the old Vietnam generation hacks, who sat there going on and on about how dreadful it was. Do you know why? Because the last time this debate came up—the great scare campaign—was back when I was at university. In those days, just before the end of the Fraser government, there was a big debate. The debate was about whether, when tertiary fees were introduced, it would decrease the accessibility of tertiary education for students. That was the argument of the Left and the trendy academics, and they were wrong. What has happened over the 
 last 20 years? Accessibility to tertiary education has increased enormously. It has more than doubled—against every single projection your lot made. Wrong again! The great problem was—and here Senator Carr and I agree, strangely—
Senator Carr interjecting—
—Order, Senator Carr!
—Senator Carr and I could have walked down Collins Street, Melbourne or, better, Anne Street, Brisbane both with one aim in mind: to increase access to tertiary education for everyone—not just for the children of the middle class. That is what tertiary education was a generation ago and now accessibility has more than doubled. That is the great difference. It has helped enormously in this country.
Under the HECS system, tertiary students pay about 30 per cent of their total fees. They still receive subsidy. That is a fair thing; that is a good thing. The question is about how much they pay. I agree with what the minister has said. It is now about right. The current system is a great thing because it has increased access for everyone, and that is a great thing. As Senator Ellison pointed out before, it also enables people to pay fees to enrol in a university course when they would otherwise have missed out even if they qualified. That is a great advantage.
It has also enabled universities—and I make no apologies for this—to be much more entrepreneurial and much more flexible. That is also a great thing. The tired, old, leftwing hack view that, somehow, the state is there to provide a teat for all and that people need not give anything back is absolutely dead and finished. That is the difference. It worries me that this is such a time warp. This debate comes back, and all I can hear ringing in my ears is Senator Susan Ryan standing up and suggesting that the whole system would crumble if we had tertiary fees. A great thing—one of the greatest achievements of your government and one of the greatest achievements of our government—is the enormous increase in access to tertiary education. 
I know it does not accord with left wing views at all—it would not because it is relevant. What is important to the future is this: the quality of tertiary teaching. That is important because at the moment academics are simply talking to each other and not engaging in public debate. That is very important. Also very important is how we are going to fund top-class tertiary education into the next millennium. That is becoming very difficult. We are going to have to do that as well. They are the big questions for the next century—not bleating about scare campaigns being revisited from the 1980s, Senator Carr. You and I agree on one thing for once—that is, that access to tertiary education is all important. You and I should be arm in arm on this question. It is a great pity that once again you are engaging in a bleating scare campaign. (Time expired)
—Order! The time for the debate has expired.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Higher Education: Government Policy</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-10-14,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The government's proposal to deregulate the higher education sector, introduce a system of voucher based funding contrary to previous assurances, replace HECS with student loans repayable with a real rate of interest and reduce public expenditure on higher education, excluding thousands of Australians from further education and cutting investment in human capital.
This debate has already commenced with the speakers we have had during the taking note of the answers given to questions today. Today, this debate has come about as a consequence of a leaked document—a cabinet-in-confidence document—the authenticity of which has not been denied by the relevant minister, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr David Kemp. It is written in the first person and it is clearly an articulation of his views—his narrow so-called vision for the higher education sector in this country.
The cabinet submission contains largely three proposals: the compete deregulation of university fees—that is, allowing universities to set the fees paid by all students; a voucher driven funding system, whereby students are 
 eligible for some government subsidy but must meet the costs of any gap or top-up fee imposed by the university; and a universal loans scheme to replace HECS, which would have a real rate of interest attached. Currently, HECS interest rates are indexed to the CPI. These are some of the most regressive, anti-student, anti-intellectual proposals we have seen introduced or suggested by a minister for education in this country in its history.
The irony is, of course, as has been pointed out in the earlier debate, that many of the ministers in the current government, and indeed a number of backbenchers, have benefited from a system of education that was publicly funded and much more accessible—even Dr David Kemp. He is not even a member of generation HECS; he has benefited from a scholarship, as I understand it, from the University of Melbourne, where he was entitled to pursue a law degree that was taxpayer funded but not contributed to in any individual or private way. Indeed, the former minister for the education portfolio, who did her own burning, slashing and cutting to the education sector, Senator Vanstone, also benefited from a much fairer system of higher education in this country.
The government have consistently battered the higher education sector through cuts to resourcing and to staff numbers, failing to actually meet staff and academic wage claim demands. They have cut regional campuses and increased HECS. They have cut student financial assistance and increased the age rate for independent assistance. The government are already guilty of slashing and burning when it comes to the higher education sector. About $1.8 billion worth of cuts were made in 1996, when the government first got into power.
We have heard a lot of assurances today from government members. Indeed, the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who is present in the chamber, and the speakers in the previous debate on the government side suggested that the Prime Minister's comments on television this morning were a sufficient guarantee that the Prime Minister has definitely ruled out further deregulation. I say 
 `further' deregulation because this government, as its predecessor did, has stood over while deregulation has taken place, more recently of undergraduate fee paying places. Before that, under the ALP, the postgraduate sector was deregulated.
The Prime Minister has given an assurance not that this will not happen ever but that, presumably, it will not happen within the life of this parliament. So I look forward to hearing again in this place, on record, ministers and members of the government giving us a categorical assurance that there will be no deregulation, no introduction of vouchers and no abolition of HECS. Of course, if it is the abolition of HECS to replace it with a system of publicly funded free education, that would be welcomed by all those who believe that we should have a further investment in higher education—education that is publicly funded and accessible to all.
But we cannot really trust this government when it makes such assurances. Today in question time I noticed Senator Carr asked the former education spokesperson for the coalition when they were in opposition, Senator Hill, about some of the assurances he gave on record as to what his political party would do if they got into office. Their election manifesto in 1996 gave assurances that HECS would not be tampered with, that Austudy would not really be affected, that operating grants would not be cut and that regional universities would be protected. What have we seen? As soon as they got into government, within the same year, we saw massive funding cuts and regional and remote institutions hurt more than any other institutions, so much so that this government had to introduce a rescue package in order to cope with the fallout—to stem the flow, if you like.
I note that, in this cabinet-in-confidence document, Dr David Kemp has recognised that universities are currently in a `difficult financial position'. We know that. Unfortunately, of course, it is a financial position that has been brought about or perpetuated by the government of the day. Dr David Kemp goes on to state:
Already eight institutions appear to be operating at a deficit and some regional campuses are at risk. The current enterprise bargaining round is not giving universities more staffing flexibility . . . 
Instead of seeing the government come up with some ways of ensuring that more resources are made available or that teaching quality is improved through funding or meeting the wage claims of academic and general staff, we could see the absolute decimation or the abolition of some regional campuses, or indeed some regional institutions, because we know—research tells us and experience shows us—that a voucher system favours those with wealth and with mobility and we know that, under such a system, as Senator McLucas pointed out in the earlier debate, regional and remote campuses will suffer most.
There has been a lot of talk about policies and records in the chamber today, and I put on record again the Australian Democrats' position in relation to the funding of higher education. We have always believed, since our inception 22 years ago, that education is an investment; it is not a cost. It is part of a caring, enlightened and compassionate society. It has the opportunity to benefit all, including those who want to be involved in the workplace, regardless of what their age or background is, as well as providing an enlightened and intellectual society. That is the premise for education.
—No fees at all?
—No fees at all! That is why the Democrats voted against the introduction of the higher education administration charge, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme and the CPI increase of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme in 1991. The Democrats opposed further deregulation of the postgraduate sector and deregulation of undergraduate fees, even with the caps that this government has imposed. We recognise that it is possible, because governments have to make choices, and gutsy governments have to make choices, to invest in things that lead to an environment that is enlightened and democratic. You invest in areas of human capital so that people have the best opportunities—not only so they can pursue further education or get jobs but also so they can 
 have lifestyles that have quality and health. You do that through a progressive taxation system, because already people are contributing through the taxation system to government revenue. They are contributing to education, but increasingly we have seen over the years a fundamental shift in the costs of education, the financing of education, from the public as a whole—recognising that there is that public benefit—to individuals. That is clearly the intent of Dr David Kemp's proposals before us today.
Senator Tierney interjecting—
—Yes, I am quite proud and happy to put on record the Australian Democrats' voting record and policy perspectives on these matters. I suspect they are probably reflected among a few backbenchers today—from both sides. At the doorstops and on some of the television coverage this morning I could see backbenchers back-pedalling a mile. I saw Dr Brendan Nelson looking a little perturbed at the prospect of students having to pay $100,000 for a degree.
—That is rubbish!
—Order, Senator Tierney. You are on the speakers list. I would appreciate your remaining silent until it is your turn to speak.
—I couldn't contain myself, Madam Deputy President.
—Remove yourself from the chamber if you cannot contain yourself.
—Madam Deputy President, he is giving me my best stuff, so I appreciate the interjections.
—They are disorderly, Senator Stott Despoja. Please address the chair and ignore his interjections.
—They are indeed disorderly, and I will focus on the matters before us. But I will acknowledge the interjection that suggested that $100,000 was rubbish. As I pointed out in question time today, already students are paying exorbitant amounts in fees. Only a few weeks ago we saw Melbourne University introduce a two- 
 year private law degree for $72,000. Under the proposals before us, as I pointed out in question time today, not only is it possible that $72,000 can be paid for a two-year law degree at an institution, but also, if you finance that with a loan which has a fixed interest rate of 7½ per cent and you repay that over, say, 15 years—but who knows how much longer than that students are going to be condemned to debt—then the total cost, excluding bank fees and charges, is over $120,000. That is what these loans will mean. That is what a fixed interest rate means. That is what happens if you are going to abolish the HECS.
It is happening already: students are paying exorbitant amounts, not to mention that this government has increased fees and charges like no other—and that is saying something given the last decade of policy changes to higher education in this country—and hiked them up to a level that does not even make us comparable with Western nations like the United States. We have heard a lot of discussion about the United States in the past 24 hours, but I know that public institutions in America do not have comparable fees, on average, to the kinds of fees that we already have through HECS and up-front undergraduate fees in Australia. In fact, this is very much an attempt by the government to introduce not only parts of the American system—and go further—but also the UK style reforms of vouchers and student loans. I suspect that is where Dr David Kemp is getting some of his so-called inspiration.
These proposals are a hybrid of the worst aspects of both of these systems. They would effectively privatise universities, as in the US, and impose crippling debt on students through student loans, as has occurred in the United Kingdom. In Australia's case, according to these proposals, Australians would be forced to repay the loan at a real rate of interest, and they would introduce increased and substantial funding uncertainty to the sector through vouchers.
Vouchers apparently have been ruled out by the Prime Minister today, yet we know that the cabinet has already seen the proposed reforms and requested that the minister for 
 education investigate them further, contrary to numerous public assurances that the government would not introduce vouchers. These vouchers, of course, are the idea of student centred funding that we have seen closely examined through the West review. Note that the only relevant term of reference that was not included but should have been in the West review was actually looking at how we can fund our higher education system better through public resources. The issue of public funding was not even touched on in that document. Once again, the government has failed to recognise that there is a public good, a public benefit, as a consequence of education in our society.
On fee deregulation, Senator Ellison, representing the minister for education, today has apparently ruled that out, but I do not trust this government, not when it has broken nearly every promise, nearly every assurance, specifically in relation to higher education policy and funding—and not just this minister but also the one who preceded him. I call on the government not only to rule out any move towards a privatised system of funding such as that in the US but also to rule out the UK style reforms of vouchers and student loans.
If these cabinet-in-confidence documents are even a glimpse of what this government has countenanced in relation to higher education reform, we will have an education system that once and for all is an elite system for the rich and blocks out the poor.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-10-14,"—Can I say at the outset that the government totally rejects the motion proposed by Senator Stott Despoja, which is based on an entirely false premise, and that is that the government somehow has some proposals to deregulate the higher education sector and introduce a whole system of fanciful measures. The Prime Minister has made the government's position absolutely clear, as has Dr Kemp, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. We have to go no further than the Prime Minister when he was interviewed today and he stated:
We have no intention, no intention at all, of introducing an American style approach to universi 
 ty funding in this country. It won't work. It's not good for Australia and it's not something that I can support or would ever support. I make that very clear.
Today in question time the Prime Minister reiterated that commitment.
In fact, it was the Leader of the Opposition who asked, `Can you guarantee that you will never allow higher education in this country to go down that path?' The Prime Minister replied, `Look, don't be silly. If you are asking me to do that you are assuming I am going to remain Prime Minister forever and this government is going to stay in government forever.' What he did was a very realistic thing. He gave an undertaking that, while he was Prime Minister, he could rule these things out. You can ask for no more or no less. He can give an undertaking only as to what can and will happen while he is Prime Minister, and he did that. He said in this interview today:
The other thing I want to make clear is that any decisions the government takes will fully honour the promises made both at the time of the election and previously in relation to vouchers, in relation to deregulation of university fees, and also the commitment we made not to introduce HECS charges for TAFE courses.
Those commitments were made quite deliberately and quite explicitly after we got the West review last year.
It is well known, and Senator Stott Despoja and members of the opposition know, that we have had the West review around for some time. It is no secret that the government have been looking at ways of improving the higher education sector. We have been looking at ways of increasing access for young Australians—in fact all Australians—to higher education. That is precisely what the government have been doing. The Prime Minister pointed out that, whilst we are always on the lookout for ways to improve the higher education sector, we also had a system which was pretty good and one which was recognised internationally as being so. I cite the headline in the Australian dated 29 September this year: `Overseas students flock to our universities'. It stated:
Overseas students have continued to pour into Australian universities despite the Asian crisis, with 
 new international enrolments up 20.5 per cent from last year.
That hardly tells the tale of a tertiary education sector in a parlous state. What it tells you is that across the world, internationally, our higher education system is regarded very highly. Of course, what the government are saying is that, whilst we have a good system and whilst it is recognised internationally as such, we still need to look at ways of improving it.
But we do have some achievements that we can be proud of. For instance, under the coalition increased numbers of students have had access to undergraduate university education. In 1999, this year, there will be 13,235 more Commonwealth fully subsidised places than there were in the last year of Labor, back in 1996. This will increase to over 15,500 more by the year 2001. That is an increase in Commonwealth funded places for tertiary education students. What we have done as a government is expand the opportunities for universities to operate. We have allowed for fee paying students so that undergraduates who are capable of paying a fee can enter a course of their first choice. We have not only made more resources available to universities but also given more choices to Australians. I ask you, what is wrong with that?
We have also allowed the private sector to contribute more to universities. I know that in my home state of Western Australia the University of Western Australia has one of the highest rates of private contribution to a university. It does that by all manner of means, one of them being going into joint ventures with the private sector. What we as a government have got to do is make it more attractive for the private sector to donate and contribute funds to universities, and we have done that with tax incentives. That will encourage industry, for instance, to become more involved with universities. We do want to see universities become more entrepreneurial. Senator Stott Despoja mentioned that today in question time. She asked, `Is it true that this is what you want?' Of course it is. I think most universities would want that too. You want to be forward thinking not only in your research but also in the ways that you can 
 offer courses and opportunities to people and in the ways that you can have support from the private sector.
I also mentioned today the advances that we are seeing in indigenous education. In the second quarter of this year from March to June, we saw a jump of just under 2,000 indigenous students in Abstudy take-up rates. That spells good news, going from some 16,000 in the first quarter to 18,000-odd in that second quarter from March to June. So much is happening in the indigenous education sector of tertiary education, and that is something which we as a government are strongly committed to.
What is being lost in all this is the assumption that this is all going to happen today, that these aspects of vouchers and deregulation of fees are foregone conclusions. I have mentioned that they have been ruled out by both the minister for education and the Prime Minister, but you still have Senator Stott Despoja saying on Adelaide radio today:
I just don't see why the government would embark on this so-called vision, and I'm very concerned about it.
I can tell you, Senator Stott Despoja—through the chair—that there is no need to be concerned because it is not happening. It is not happening because the Prime Minister has ruled it out.
What we are ruling in is looking at ways to improve access by Australians to tertiary education, and we have had a number of innovations. I could point to the total research funding for higher education being up from $396 million in the last year of Labor to just over $450 million in the financial year 1998-99. What we are doing is increasing funding for research. But, as well is that, we have established the Committee for University Teaching and Staff Development. We recognise the needs of those who are engaged in teaching and lecturing in the tertiary education sector and we have developed that committee to encourage improved teaching. We have also provided the Australian awards for university teaching, to help give greater status to university teaching. These are very important steps in the recognition of those working in the sector.
This government has done much in the tertiary education sector and the opposition, before it attacks the government, should look at how it locked out tens of thousands of Australians who wanted to take up a university course but could not. They had the money to pay for a course but they could not take one up, because you had a wholly funded government-set enrolment target. As well as that you had Labor's Higher Education Contribution Scheme, which was unfair because students in courses with lower income prospects paid the same amount as those in courses with higher income prospects. Of course, it was only fair for us to recognise the differences in the incomes that those students would be deriving when qualified. What the community ought to realise and should remember is what Labor did not do and then remember what we have done to increase access for all Australians to tertiary education. I urge all Australians not to succumb to the scaremongering by the Democrats and the opposition.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-10-14,"—My colleagues Mr Beazley and Mr Lee have done the people of this country a great service by letting them know the horrors planned by this government in its higher education policies. We have been told again here this afternoon by Minister Ellison that this is not a proposal that the government is considering. We are told that there are not plans before the government. What I would ask then is this: what is the situation in regard to this cabinet submission? I would ask the speakers that follow me to explain to me what is the status of the cabinet deliberations. Is it not the case that Dr Kemp was in fact invited by cabinet to prepare this submission? In fact, was it not the case that on 28 June 1999 the cabinet noted cabinet submission No. JH99\0222 where it said:
I indicated a preference—
these are Dr Kemp's own words—
for deregulating admissions and fees as the central elements of a reform—
a so-called reform—
of higher education and that in the context . . . Cabinet regarded that I come back with further 
 relevant information and with options for workplace reform.
If that is the case, what is the status of this document? What is the status of those discussions and the instructions to Dr Kemp to come back with the suggestions? I say that the truth is very simple: the government has been caught out. It has been caught out comprehensively. It has been caught out and its secret plans have now been exposed; its lies and deceit have been exposed.
I think that no-one in this country ought to believe the Prime Minister when he now seeks to allege—and I emphasise the word `allege'—that he is promising to abandon Dr Kemp's plan for this American style university system. And I am sure that very few, other than a few clowns in the Liberal Party, will in fact believe him. We were told in question time today by Dr Kemp that he had not even proposed in his own cabinet submission a voucher system. But this document says at 6(b) that they propose a `universal tuition subsidy' which follows the student to accredited higher education courses. What is that? Nothing else could be said other than it is a voucher scheme over which this government is seeking to deceive and mislead. It is attempting to present itself other than in its true guise as an ideologically driven government which has sought to destroy the fundamental principles of social equity that the Labor government had sought to impose upon the education system in this country. Government members will never ever stop until they have achieved that objective.
What we are being told is that the government effectively need to respond to what they regard as the havoc in the higher education system. What we have is an audacious attempt by the government to exploit the destruction and the decay which they themselves have introduced, promoted and of course presided over. They have sought to use this as excuse to deliver yet another blow—possibly the final blow—to Australian universities and students.
What they are seeking to do is to establish that there is a crisis in higher education, a crisis which I say is very much of their own making. The realities have to be explained. 
 This afternoon Senator Hill failed to point out a few basic facts that characterise this government's higher education policy. None of us should ever forget that in the 1996 budget this government cut discretionary funding to universities by $216 million, that universities had their operating grant  funding cut by $624 million and that student income support measures were cut by $500 million. It has introduced changes to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme already by increasing charges by $313 million. It has lowered the repayments threshold to many thousands of dollars below average weekly earnings, thus taking a further $817 million from students and graduates.
So what you have is a claim by this government that the system is in crisis. It is a crisis that they themselves have created and, as a consequence, they then need to take action to remedy the situation. What of course is happening is that this government are seeking to use that as an excuse to advance the very crisis that they have created. We have noticed already that this government have overseen a situation where the level of demand for higher education is falling. It is falling under this government because this is exactly what the government seek to achieve. They seek to achieve a situation where the people who can least afford it—that is in both financial terms and their place within society—are given fewer opportunities to participate in the higher education system. It has to be remembered that under this government 21,000 fewer public funded places were at the core of those cuts in 1996. That is, 21,000 fewer opportunities for Australians to participate as a result of this government's action of withdrawing support for public education in this country.
When we look at the government's policy, we notice that students are turning away from universities because this government have sought to increase the price of attendance at university. They then go on with this sort of proposal where we will see the possibility that the charges and fees, imposed by the universities themselves, will rise up to $100,000. Who could possibly afford that? The current charges of universities have increased dramatically. Some students are already paying 
 $5,000 or $6,000 for courses. Others are paying between $4,400 and $4,800. This is their HECS fee, their HECS contribution under this government. This is already far too high for many students. In fact, 15,000 would-be students, who might well have been inspired to go to university under the former Labor government, are not able to do so under this government—15,000 fewer people may not have been able to achieve their aspirations as a result of this government's policies already.
We note that the government seeks to go further. They seek the deregulation of fees which would allow universities to charge whatever they like. Currently, the University of Melbourne charges more than $30,000 for an MBA degree. In the postgraduate arena, fees have been a feature for some time. If commercial rates of interest are applied to loans to pay those sorts of fees, you are likely to see amounts of $100,000 being quite common. What family could possibly afford such an impost? What sorts of opportunities would that really leave for ordinary Australians—middle and lower income Australians—to participate in universities. The University of Melbourne can afford to charge premium rates. It seeks to use its brand name, its prestige and its illustrious history—an illustrious history built up on 150 years of quality public investment. It is now seeking to use that reputation in the marketplace, so that the rich and those lucky enough to receive generous financial support from wealthy corporate employers are able to participate in such programs as Melbourne MBAs.
We are likely to see fewer unemployed people and fewer people involved in small community organisations or charities being able to afford those sorts of fees and imposts. How many ordinary Australians will be able to fork out similar amounts of money to study at Melbourne University or Sydney University or any of the other universities that are at the commanding heights of the Australian education environment? These universities, which will be able to charge fees in the order of $20,000 or $30,000, or maybe more, to secure students from the right sorts of families which can afford to pay those fees and from the 
 right social milieu, will be perpetuating an elitist 1950s concept of what university is supposed to be all about.
When we see Dr Kemp talk about the crisis in the education system, bear in mind it is Dr Kemp and his cronies who have created the crisis. They create the crisis so that they can impose their solution—a solution predicated on the assumption that only some Australians should be privileged enough to enjoy the benefit of an education at the highest level in this country. Regional universities and some of the newer universities are going to be increasingly strapped for cash. Dr Kemp acknowledges this in his cabinet submission. I quote:
Universities are currently in a difficult financial position . . . Already eight institutions appear to be operating at a deficit and some regional campuses are at great risk.
How is it possible that such universities are going to survive under a deregulated regime? They are already desperate; they are already facing enormous pressure as a result of the changes that he has imposed. What is going to happen to universities in Ballarat, Armidale, Townsville and Rockhampton? What is going to happen to their regional economies? What is going to happen to the opportunities that they currently provide for families in those regions? What sort of environment would be created if people in those areas cannot go to university? What sort of social inequality will be encouraged by this government? These smaller universities—the jewels in the crown of regional Australia—could very well be pushed to the wall. They will not be able to compete for students or they will not be able to compete for staff.
Dr Kemp's so-called solution seems to me to be no solution whatsoever. Dr Kemp has the audacity to talk about problems currently being faced by the higher education system. I quote:
Higher student:staff ratios, less frequent lecture and tutorial contact, the persistence of outdated technology and gaps in key areas of professional preparation . . . are fuelling a perception of declining quality.
He could not be more right than he is about that. But who is responsible? I say this government is responsible—that Dr Kemp is 
 personally responsible. Look at student-staff ratios: they have worsened from 12.8 to one in 1989 to 17.9 to one in 1998. They have been in constant decline in recent years. That decline has been exacerbated by the changes we have seen. The numbers have dropped by over 3½ per cent as a direct result of the policies. No wonder we are seeing fewer opportunities for students to actually see their lecturers—there are fewer lecturers for them to actually see. Operating grants have dropped dramatically in real terms since this government came to office. No wonder there is a perception—and I say it is a perception based on reality—of a decline in quality.
What we are noticing on the industrial front is that the government's clear ideological agendas are further exacerbating the sense of crisis and chaos within our universities. Their strategy is to divide universities, to divide administrations from their staff, to blame lecturers and to blame employees within the universities. The government proposes to hold out a carrot so that universities will accept draconian and coercive action as a vehicle by which the staff will then be obliged to accept Peter Reith's draconian industrial agenda. I look forward to watching how this government explains the balaclavas and the guard dogs in the lecture rooms of this country, because that is what this submission proposes: a vigorous pursuit of Peter Reith's industrial relations strategy applied to the universities. You have to ask yourself: why is it that the universities are falling so far behind? Why is the quality falling off so appallingly?

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-14,"—The appalling situation as I see it—independently listening to question time today—is the corroboration by avoiding any disclaimer that cabinet had discussed this matter in April and that the Prime Minister was involved in the discussions which led up to this paper which the opposition has now made public. When you see that process afoot you know it is dinkum and you know that the government's intentions are to proceed with the philosophy that understraps the proposals that have been released here and which are going to make it a factor in this country that 
 you have to be rich if you are going to have choice in higher education.
Let me read into the Hansard the requests to the Prime Minister from the students who have occupied Liberal Party offices in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane today:
On behalf of the students of Australia we demand that John Howard, Prime Minister of Australia:
. Make an immediate announcement that his Government will not endorse the Cabinet Submission by Dr Kemp that was tabled in Parliament yesterday;
. Publicly reject the proposal for a loan scheme which would force many students into crippling debt;
. State his commitment to the Coalition promise not to introduce education vouchers for university funding;
. Rule out that his Government would allow universities to set their own fees;
. Reject the notion that private higher education institutions be allowed to receive public subsidies;
. State his Government's commitment to ensuring access to high quality education for all; and
. Sack his education minister, Dr David Kemp, on the basis that he has an ideological desire to dismantle any notion of accessible or equitable education.
I was in Ireland five or six years ago, and the debate there was how to remove the limited fee structure there to ensure that everybody had free access to tertiary education. We get that assurance as far as primary and secondary education is concerned, and the Greens believe that we should have it for tertiary education.
How far from that ideal of a fair deal for all and equal access to tertiary education is this bundle of extreme Right dogma which is to facilitate the rich and which will end up, as the New Zealand experience has it, expanding those faculties which put already rich students into rich professions, such as, for example, accounting, law and medicine, to the detriment of science and other necessary services coming out of tertiary education—nursing, to name one? This is the wrong way to go. No wonder students around the country are reacting the way they are. The minister ought to go.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-10-14,"—I take particular note of the 
 contributions of Senator Carr, Senator Stott Despoja and, most recently, Senator Brown. We have here the most comprehensive set of scaremongering tactics that I have probably ever seen.
—What does the University of Newcastle think?
—The University of Newcastle is going extremely well, Senator. As we have moved from a system of total dependence on the public purse to fees—introduced by the Labor government—the university has absolutely boomed. I will go into some reasons why that broad direction is the correct direction, but the main focus I wanted to put at this point of time is that all the various scenarios run through by Senator Brown, Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Carr are just castles in the air. These are things which are part of their own fantasies and have nothing to do with government policy whatsoever. That was nailed very comprehensively this morning by the Prime Minister—who in reality killed off this debate, but of course the people on the other side will merrily carry on if they feel they can get any political mileage out of scaring people. It is very unfortunate that they have been in bed with the press on this—which ran some disgraceful headlines this morning across Australia. Those one-third of the public who just read the headlines without reading the story have been given a totally incorrect perception of what has happened.
Policy has evolved over the years in relation to the way we fund and finance higher education. I was pleased to see Senator Stott Despoja take my interjection and expose her party's policy on this, which would return us to the days of Whitlam. She says the whole thing should be off the public purse. We have been there; we have done that. We did that under Whitlam. I was in the sector when we did that under Whitlam, and let me tell you what happened. Resources dried up, class sizes increased, libraries were destocked and, of course, the salaries of staff relatively fell behind. That is the legacy under a system totally funded by the public purse. That is the legacy that Senator Brown—using the Irish example—actually wanted us to go back to. 
 Well, Senator, let me tell you what the outcome of that system is. The outcome is that, outside the gates of the universities in this country, you have a massive long queue of people who cannot get in because, under your system, the government cannot fund enough places. Labor realised that. They were mugged by reality about 1986 when they decided to start to bring in what they called an administrative fee and then it started to evolve from that.
Let me raise, in a related way, another point that Senator Stott-Despoja made in relation to universities that do not charge fees. She was lamenting the fact that the University of Melbourne brings in a large fee in its private university for law, saying, `Isn't this terrible, isn't that inequitable?' No-one has to go to Melbourne to study law and pay that fee. It is a total consumer choice, but if they make that choice and, for example, they have actually been given a position at the University of Western Sydney in law and are prepared to pay and to use their own resources to go to the University of Melbourne, they then free up another place at the University of Western Sydney for someone else to go in who cannot pay that. So it is far more equitable.
The other argument against having a totally government funded system is that not all the taxpayers who fund that system go to university or have children who go to university. You have 70 per cent of taxpayers who do not go to university and whose children never go to university, yet they pay out the money into the tax system to subsidise people who are better off. It is a massive transference of resources from the poor to the rich. When you actually bring in a fee structure, which has been done over the last 15 years, you help balance up that sort of inequity.
Labor, because they stuck with the system initially devised by Gough Whitlam—and they stuck with it for the first five years of their government—created a situation where we had these massive shortages. We do not want to go back to that. We want to set up a system, and we are proposing to do that under this government. We want a system which will resource higher education properly. We have moved a fair way down that track so far. 
 You do not see the queues outside the gates of universities that we saw under the Labor government. Basically, supply is meeting demand pretty well. As a matter of fact, some universities want to try to get more students in because they cannot get enough in some of the courses—a big change in the last six years on this.
Revenue is going up, and those opposite keep creating this furphy that total revenue has gone down in universities—it has not. The composition of the revenue has changed. Revenue has gone up in universities in the last three years and we have a situation now where there is more money in universities than there ever has been. We have also an increase in students of 12,600 since this government came to power—that is up by 3½ per cent. University revenue is up by $376 million, between 1996 and 1999. There is a seven per cent increase in the number of students going to rural universities. Indigenous student numbers are up by 12 per cent. Numbers of students from a lower SES background are up by 9.4 per cent and, wait for this one, Senator Crossin, the numbers of people with disabilities attending universities are up by 61 per cent. The disadvantaged groups are much better off under this policy.
 Let me finally say that this scaremongering that we are going to go to this new type of system was nailed very thoroughly by the Prime Minister this morning at a doorstop interview. He said that `we have no intention to go to an all American, US-style system. We have no intention to bring in vouchers and we have no intention to deregulate fees'. It is disgraceful that people like Senator Carr, Senator Brown and Senator Stott-Despoja are scaring the Australian public by misleading them. We have no intention of going down that line; that is not government policy and it will not be implemented. It is about time you got back onto some real issues.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Higher Education: Government Policy</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-10-14,"—Well, California, here we come! Dr Kemp says in his paper that some universities will position themselves at the premium end of the market and that cost behaviour is unpredictable. Well, off we go to the USA—a system that he wants us to emulate in this 
 paper. Costs of higher education tuition have soared in America. Study undertaken by the Commission on National Investment in Higher Education released in 1997 estimated that if tuition fees rose at their current rate, effectively half of those who want to pursue higher education will be shut out. The main reason for soaring fees is information technology infrastructure costs. Universities are jostling to position themselves near the top of the market. The commission in America recommended that `increasing public investment should occur to arrest this crisis'.
What a lot of hypocrisy we have seen in relation to higher education policies trotted out by this government, not since yesterday but since 1996. We had one minister who did so much damage to the higher education sector that she was demoted. Now we have another minister who has no plan for higher education, other than to put the cost of education in this sector onto students—to pitch students against staff and to pit families against how they can afford this for their children. Let us look at the track record: we have no plan and no vision, other than a strategy that, firstly, cut $800 million from higher education in the 1996 budget and has starved universities of adequate funding ever since then. Now, universities in deficit and at risk will be offered a new funding source—students, families' incomes and staff salaries. We have a minister who said during question time yesterday in the House of Representatives—of course, before this grand scheme was uncovered—in answer to a question about there being eight institutions that appear to be operating at a deficit:
The suggestion that there are regional university campuses at risk is absolutely absurd, and I completely reject that.
Why is it, then, Minister, that in your cabinet submission, in paragraph 3, you admit there are eight institutions that appear to be operating at a deficit and that some regional campuses are at risk. They certainly are! Take yourself five hours flying time away from here and have a long look at what is happening at the Northern Territory University.
This is about an attack on the National Tertiary Education Union, just like we saw 
 with the wharfies and with the building sector. In his submission he goes on to say that what they want to do is interfere in the industrial relations climate in universities—free up universities to determine their own destiny but interfere in the enterprise bargaining and the wage increases they can offer to their staff, and interfere in a very good climate of representation by members and staff in that sector. Let me finish by saying this: this outrageous document is about choice. If you have a fat wallet, you will go to university. If you have two, three, four or six kids in your family, you will choose who goes—and it won't be the girl, I can tell you that. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Higher Education: Government Policy</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-10-14,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill 1999 (No. 2)  gives me the opportunity, for the first time in this chamber, to pay tribute to the efforts of Major General Cosgrove and his troops—and particularly those troops who come from the Northern Territory—who are currently serving under him in East Timor. It is also timely, I think, to recognise those members of the Defence Force who are deployed in duties around this country backing up the work of those currently overseas. We are relying on these people. I, along with the rest of the community, have great confidence in their ability and military skill and their understanding of the situation in which they find themselves.
The aim of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill is to reinstate to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the power to include leave for reserve Defence Force personnel from their employment to participate in the activities necessary to be a member of the Australian Defence Force reserves. This has become a necessary action on behalf of the Labor Party as a result of the short-sightedness of this government and the arrogance of its industrial relations minister back in 1996 when the first amendments to the Workplace Relations Act were presented to this parliament. That legislation excluded Defence Force leave from the 20 allowable award matters that the Industrial Relations Commission was able to deal with. It has now been shown to be one of the many detrimental elements of that legislation, in its impact on 
 not only those wanting to access Defence Force leave but also the Defence Force itself, particularly in situations such as this country is now experiencing, and participating in, in East Timor.
This government has shown that it is so obsessed with industrial relations reform—as it puts it—that it has been willing to sacrifice good defence policy and the care of its troops in the armed forces and those wanting to participate as reserves. But, as the months of the East Timor deployment evolve and the days tick by, we know that this is planned to be a very long commitment of our Australian troops and that there will need to be a rotation of those troops deployed in East Timor.
Our military forces have not experienced this level of activity for some time, particularly in this climate, in the weather conditions that they will be confronted with in the coming months when we hit the wet season in the north of Australia and in the East Timor region, or the emotional strain that they are finding on a day-by-day basis. Already the armed forces are drawing heavily on the reserves, and for the next rotation the reserves will be needed in even greater number.
As Kim Beazley said during his presentation of this bill in the House on 11 October this week:
This bill would not have been necessary had the Minister for Aged Care, Bronwyn Bishop, when she was the minister associated with the Defence Force personnel, heeded the advice of Major General Luttrell—then the Assistant Chief of the Defence Force reserves—when the first form of the workplace relations bill was in this parliament.
He quoted Major General Luttrell:
As Reserve members constitute approximately 40 per cent of the ADF work force, their continued availability for training, as currently provided for in awards, agreements and company personnel policies, is essential to the Australian Defence Force capability.
Major General Luttrell went on to say:
If not identified as a matter for inclusion in awards, Reserve training leave may not be picked up within either the Certified Agreement, Australian Workplace Agreements or other State Agreements which will increasingly supplant existing awards.
Although not one of the safety net employment conditions identified in the Bill, Reserve availabili 
 ty for training is critical to maintaining defence capability and award coverage of this issue is an important component of ensuring this availability. The Bill should therefore include provisions which will permit awards to continue to cover Defence Force leave provisions.
But the exclusion of Defence Force leave from the list of allowable matters has been a mistake by this government, make no doubt about it. It is an example of bad policy, particularly given the situation we are confronted with now in East Timor. This needs to be rectified and changed, and the decision needs to be reversed.
The Defence Reserve Support Committee chaired by Sir James Killen raised this as a major issue at its meeting last November. The response they received from this government was not satisfactory and nothing has since changed. As reserve members constitute approximately 40 per cent of the ADF work force, their continued availability for training as currently provided for in awards, agreements and policies is essential to our continued capability in the defence forces.
But the position of this government is to refer to the provision in the Defence Force Act to solve this issue. I have no doubt we will hear this afternoon arguments that it is okay if Defence Force leave is not in awards. It is all right, members on the government side will say, I am sure. Bear in mind, as Peter Reith has done, that they will point to the provisions for leave in the Defence Force Act. If an investigation were done into the use of this provision, it would show that there has never been a prosecution as a result of the provisions in the Defence Force Act. Those provisions allow for people who are not granted leave from their workplace to take action.
But the Department of Defence does not want to use it, and it has never used it, to enforce the provisions because they do not think they can make it work. The view of the Defence Force is that they would rather jettison the reservist than exercise that section of the act which is to protect a person from being victimised in their employment for their Defence Force activities. A large number of reservists actually rely on their employment conditions for their leave. There are about 
 152—or there used to be, before the 1996 legislation—awards that had Defence Force leave in them. This government has managed, as a result of the 1996 legislation, to strip all of those away. As I understand it, only one has been resurrected—against the wishes of the employer. The result has been detrimental to defence. If this government will not listen to those in this chamber or in the House, then perhaps it may care to heed the advice of its own defence department. The government was advised, when it did this in 1996, as follows:
As Reserve members constitute approximately 40 per cent of the Australian Defence work force, their continued availability for training, as currently provided for in awards and agreements, is essential to the Australian Defence Force capability. Existing awards have been important in providing institutional support for Reserves through the inclusion of provisions which allow leave for military training purposes for members of the Reserve.
That is the formal minute the government got from the defence department, which was ignored. In the usual headstrong, arrogant manner of the industrial relations minister, for ideological reasons alone, and not sound defence policy, he overrode the defence department's requirements and stripped all awards and removed Defence Force leave.
What has the government done about that in the two years since this matter was first raised and in the nearly three years since the legislation that created the problem? The simple fact is that it has done nothing. Labor has recognised that there is a problem and has been willing to do something about it. My colleague Arch Bevis introduced a private member's bill in the House—the Workplace Relations Amendment (Defence Purposes Leave) Bill—on 21 June this year. But the government did not bring it on for debate. The government has found itself in a position where it has fallen short of all of its targets on reserves, and now it really matters.
Let us look at its recruitment against target over the course of 1998-99. The shortfall in recruitment for the RAAF is 44 per cent; for the RAN it is 80 per cent; and for the Army it is 49 per cent. That is a substantial record of failure to encourage people in the general work force to uphold their patriotic duty and make a contribution, if they so choose, to the 
 defence forces of this nation in the reserves. It is now critical, and it will become even more so in the coming months. It will not be possible to sustain the activities in East Timor for any length of time without relying on our reserves. Reserves must be recruited now and given the certainty, in terms of their employment and their capacity whilst in their employment, to be trained properly for circumstances of danger in which they will find themselves.
In the current climate, this bill must proceed, must be debated and must be passed. It will provide job security for those men and women who wish to undertake duty as an Australian Defence Force reservist. It will allow them to undertake the training they need to prepare themselves for any dangerous circumstances and for the opportunity, which they want as members of the Defence Force reserves, to give our soldiers and our people in East Timor the break that they will need, and will deserve, in the coming months. I urge people in this chamber to support this bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SERVICE AND TRAINING) BILL 1999 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-10-14,"—I commence my comments by agreeing with Senator Crossin on only one aspect, that is, the comments she made about Major General Cosgrove and the troops we have in East Timor. I believe Major General Cosgrove has shown superb and inspirational leadership. Our troops have done us proud. They have showcased Australia's defence forces to the world. To try to play politics with this issue is not in the best interests of those that are risking life and limb over there on behalf of this government's policy. I do not believe it is necessarily the best course of action to take. Having said that, I agree with Senator Crossin as to the fantastic way our troops are performing in very difficult circumstances.
However, there is another rationale and reason for this piece of legislation coming before the Senate today. Those of us who know about the treachery that goes on in the Australian Labor Party know what the hidden agenda is. Indeed, some of the treachery within the Labor Party seems to be limitless. Former Labor defence minister Robert Ray 
 once boasted about the Labor Party, `We hunt and kill our own', or words to that effect. That is what he told the Senate, and he was very proud of that statement. I suggest to the Senate today that that is exactly what is going on now.
In putting forward this  Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill 1999 , the Labor Party tacticians knew that we in the government would, of necessity, be referring to one of the most bumbling and incompetent media conferences ever undertaken in this country. Of course, that was the media interview undertaken by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. If I recall correctly, that interview was undertaken some three days ago.
We understand that the opposition have got the knives out for Mr Beazley—that his support within the Labor Party is evaporating even quicker than it is within the community at large. We in the government would prefer to see Simon Crean in the role of Leader of the Opposition because the Australian people would have a very difficult choice to make between Senator Faulkner and Simon Crean as to which person that leads the Labor Party in these chambers of the parliament they would dislike the most. Let me simply turn to this interview, in which Mr Beazley, allegedly a former defence minister—
—You are being so offensive to our reservists!
—Senator Collins asserts that I am being offensive to reservists. I do not think I have made any comment in any shape or form that denigrates reservists—that is, unless Senator Collins is suggesting that Mr Beazley is there only in reserve as leader at the moment.
—I rise on a point of order.
—Your standing order number?
—The point of order relates to the standing order that relates to relevance.
—Your standing order number?
—Since when have I been required to refer to the standing order number on an occasion such as this?
—What is your standing order number?
—Would you like me to stand here and find it for you? Relevance is the point of order. You know there is a point of order, with a number attached, to relevance, and that is the point of order.
—What is the standing order number?
—I ask you to rule.
—There is no point of order.
—It is amazing that the Labor Party raised the point of order just as I turned up the extract of a radio interview on 6PR between Mr Beazley and an interviewer. The most offensive thing that you can do to the reserves in this country is to not know the circumstances and conditions under which they serve and then seek to pontificate about the system and condemn the government for the current system. Indeed, I would suggest to Senator Collins and those on the other side that, if they are so concerned about reservists, they invite their leader to acquaint himself with the circumstances under which reservists serve in this country, before trying to come up with a policy.
I do confess that I think it might be the first policy that the Labor Party has come up with since losing government. This is the basis of the policy, and I invite people to consider this interview. The interview goes for three pages. Within those three pages we have Mr Beazley saying the following about reserves, how they are paid and their circumstances of employment, the subject matter of this particular bill. If Senator Collins does want to raise relevance again, that was the topic of the interview that Mr Beazley was engaged in, although in fairness I could understand if Senator Collins could not understand that that was what Mr Beazley was talking about. Within the three-page interview, very widely spaced, this is Mr Beazley at his best:
Yes, well, that's right. Sorry. Look, mate, I might have misled you there. It would be paid leave, in a sense, like your annual leave, that sort of thing.
Over the page:
Oh sorry, mate, I have misinformed you again. It is unpaid.
A bit further down:
I've got a bloke in here who's sort of waved his hands all over the place—
it must be like a semaphore system of policy making for the Labor Party. Mr Beazley said:
I've got a bloke in here who's sort of waved his hands all over the place and said that that was paid, so in fact as I originally thought, it is unpaid.
Later on in the interview:
I thought I must have made a mistake when I initially mentioned it to you—the arm waving—but I hadn't made a mistake, it was unpaid.
Good Heavens above! This is the alternative Prime Minister allegedly showing concern for the reservists of this nation. He had no idea and the only thing he was concerned about was trying to make a cheap political point in circumstances where we have people overseas.
Quite frankly, if the opposition want to bring up an issue such as reserves and the conditions under which they serve, I would invite them to fully brief their leader so he does not make these embarrassing gaffes one after the other.
—Would you address the bill, Senator?
—Senator Collins interjects again and asks me to address the bill. The Labor Party are very touchy when you refer them to their leader's interview on this very issue. The interview starts off:
Interviewer: Would it work like this—
talking about reserve pay—
that if you need, say, two weeks off, you get paid leave from your employer? Is that how it works?
Kim Beazley: You'd get leave from your employer.
Interviewer: You don't get paid leave?
Kim Beazley: That would be paid by—the Army would give you pay while you're in there and so you've just got the right to leave there.
Interviewer: OK. So it's unpaid leave, in other words?
Kim Beazley: Yes. 

Interviewer: It's paid because the Army pays you.
Kim Beazley: Yes, that's right.
Interviewer: But from the employer's point of view you're saying to your employer, ""I need two weeks unpaid leave because I'm going on exercises""?
Kim Beazley: Yes, that's right.
Interviewer: Nonetheless, I suppose you'll have those in industry saying well, it's all very well and good but I've got to get somebody else to replace that person while they're away and that's going to cost me dough.
Kim Beazley: Yes, well that's right. Sorry. Look, mate, I might have misled you there. It would be paid leave, in a sense, like your annual leave, that sort of thing.
Interviewer: So it's paid leave?
Kim Beazley: Paid leave, yes.
Interviewer: But that's double-dipping, isn't it?
Kim Beazley: Not particularly. They don't get paid huge amounts by the Defence Department.
Interviewer: But they're still being paid by their employer, plus they're going to get money from the Defence Department.
Kim Beazley: That is correct that that's what the case has always been—
according to Mr Beazley. The interview continues:
Interviewer: Well, I get back to the question then: Can you understand why employers even more so then would be upset because they say, ""Well, all right, I'm losing employee X for two weeks and I've got to replace that person and pay someone accordingly""?
Kim Beazley: Oh yes. And that's why it's important that it be incorporated in an award. You take a thing like that out of awards and it's very unlikely that people are actually going to be supportive of it.
Interviewer: All right. Well, what chances do you . . . 
Mr Beazley interrupts:
Oh sorry, mate, I have misinformed you again. It is unpaid.
Interviewer: Oh, OK.
Mr Beazley: I've got a bloke in here who's sort of waved his hands all over the place and said that that was paid, so in fact as I originally thought, it is unpaid.
Interviewer: Right, OK. I think it would have been . . . 
Mr Beazley interrupts again:
I thought I must have made a mistake when I initially mentioned it to you—the arm waving—but I hadn't made a mistake, it was unpaid.
Somewhere along the way clearly he did make a mistake. Having an alternative Prime Minister perform in such a manner on an issue which the Labor Party are asserting is so important is unacceptable to the Australian community. In that interview Mr Beazley seemed to have more turns on policy than former Senator Kernot. As it happens, the interests of the government in this case and those of the Labor Party seem to coincide in giving us the opportunity to highlight the absolute incompetence of the would-be Prime Minister of this country.
To highlight that incompetence, Labor have introduced the  Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill 1999 . This bill will not have the desired outcome. Indeed, it may well have the reverse impact. Let us look at the history of and rationale for this legislation. The trade unions, in a desperate bid to breathe new life into the award system through this mechanism, have in a political and cynical way jumped onto the issue of the reserves.
I invite Senator Crossin to reflect carefully on the terminology she used about the changes she says that the workplace relations legislation has occasioned. She talked about arrogance, about bad policy and about the legislation being for ideological reasons alone. What she failed to inform the Australian people about in this debate was that none other than the shadow spokesman on industrial relations, Cheryl Kernot, supported and championed that legislation through the Senate. Senator Crossin's industrial relations spokesman voted for this legislation which Senator Crossin has been bagging out.
The Labor Party have to make up their minds, or is this just another flip-flop by Ms Kernot? Ms Kernot said at one stage, `This is good for the country', but then all of a sudden said, `Now that I want to progress in the Labor Party it is bad for the country and I will go into the House of Representatives now and condemn it.' The Labor Party have to come clean in relation to Ms Kernot and tell us whether her mark 1 version on industrial 
 relations was the truth and what she honestly believed or whether her reincarnation in the Labor Party is what she truly holds dear to her heart. Chances are that she does not hold much dear to her heart when she is able to make the monumental change from the Australian Democrats to the Labor Party. I think most people in Australia would know that although there isn't much more, there is a little bit more freedom within the Australian Democrats to hold a particular policy view than there is in the Australian Labor Party. So the legislation that Senator Crossin spent all her time condemning was legislation that her shadow industrial relations spokesperson helped guide through the Senate. That is important for the Australian people to remember.
Let us look at what would happen if we went back to the award system, as is being suggested by the Australian Labor Party. Under Labor, only some 152 out of about 3,000 federal awards referred to leave for reservists. So where were these champions of the reservists in the trade union movement in getting these into awards during the 13 years of Labor and before? They had never shown any real concern, as witnessed by these figures: only 152 awards out of 3,000. Out of those 152 awards, 50 per cent of them were in the public sector. So much for their talk about private enterprise.
In contrast—and this is important—the workplace relations regime is working. We happen to believe in flexibility. We happen to believe that employees and employers ought to be allowed to negotiate and come up with an agreement which is adapted to the needs of both sides and which is not determined by the industrial relations club of big trade unions with big employer groups doing sweetheart deals in the Industrial Relations Commission.
Under the workplace relations regime—which, just in case the Labor Party missed, the former Senator Kernot, now Ms Kernot, the member for Dickson, voted for and supported—Telstra, the Commonwealth Bank, the Northern Territory government, Wesfarmers Dalgety and Serco Gardner Merchant are just some examples of employ 
 ers with flexible reserve leave. So reservists are not being forgotten under this new regime; they are being considered. Where appropriate, the employers and employees together work it out.
We as a government also work things out when employers do not give leave, in breach of the Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965. That act prevents employers from penalising or prejudicing employees because of their service. Senator Crossin bemoaned the fact that there had never been a prosecution under the legislation. I simply say that often the best test for legislation is that you do not need to penalise anybody under it because they understand that it is there and they understand the consequences if they offend against it. The defence department seeks to work out any difficulties with an employer and an employee to organise an outcome which suits both sides and not shoehorn employers and employees into award agreements which do not necessarily suit their particular enterprise. We have had successful arrangements with Telstra, and also with the Victorian police where originally there were hiccups but after discussions and negotiations those hiccups have now been sorted out.
We are confident that the current arrangements are working well. The trade union backers of the opposition have told them `You've got to do something in the area of industrial relations. You've got to try and breathe new life into the award system', and in a very cynical way they have unfortunately sought to bring the reserves into this industrial relations debate at a time that I would have thought was most inopportune and most unstatesmanlike. I believe that was why Mr Beazley stuttered and stalled through that interview that I read into the Hansard. I reckon his heart was not in this stunt, either.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SERVICE AND TRAINING) BILL 1999 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-14,"—This is a debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill 1999 (No. 2) , a private member's bill introduced by Senator Collins from Victoria. However, it has its genesis in the House of Representatives. In the House of Representatives, this issue has had all the politics, bluff and 
 bluster attached to it that you get in the debates there—quite different from the high standard we have up here! But the fact is that at the heart of all this there could indeed be a good point. I would like to take you through the actual status of leave in the defence forces to see why I arrive at the conclusion.
The question I have asked is: is Defence Force leave an allowable matter under section 89A(2)(g) of the Workplace Relations Act? As one of the persons involved with that section when it was brought into the parliament, I thought it was and I still think it is. However, the commission is yet to definitively rule on the issue. As far as I am aware, there have only been two commission cases on this—Commissioner Lewin's decision on the Higher Education Award and Commissioner Larkin's case on Airservices Australia—and in the absence of a full bench determination on the matter it was clear that she was uncertain about it. On that decision, Commissioner Larkin said:
I have to date been inclined to the view that military service leave is a form of cultural leave. However, in the light of the reasoning which is contained in relation to other leave entitlement in the personal leave test case, I think the safest conclusion is that this provision is non-allowable. If in due course the issue is further considered at full bench level and the result is different to the conclusions I have reached, an application to vary the award may be made pursuant to section 113.
That is hardly a definitive ruling on the issue. At best, all that can be said is that the matter is not yet fully resolved, and will not be until a full bench rules. But as the government points out, the Defence Act and the Defence (Re-establishment) Act provide a prohibition on employers acting to the detriment of the interests of reservists, so there is legal protection in this area.
My advice is that only five per cent of awards had military training leave in them in 1996 and half of these were in the public sector. Where is the evidence that public sector employers have changed their policy on military training leave? As far as I am aware it is still an Australian Public Service determination of conditions. I might add that the condition of military training leave can be reinserted into awards in the public sector 
 under section 170MX, through arbitration, because these were mostly paid rates awards, and 170MX awards are not bound by section 89A. Or, it could be enforced as an exceptional matters order if an employer refused to agree to it. So the issue here is nowhere near as dramatic as some in the Labor Party might allege. The other half of these awards were single employer awards, and it is likely that the conditions have been replicated in the relevant certified agreements.
The other 95 per cent of awards, including all the big industry awards, do not include military training leave. As far as I am aware, in none of the few negotiated award simplifications that happened prior to 1 July 1998 did the unions or the employers argue for military training leave to be included. In the years when the Leader of the Opposition was defence minister and the years that Labor were in government, there was no change to the lack of military training leave in big industry awards, and there has been no change in the years of the coalition government. So if it was good enough not to have the issue regulated from 1983 to 1996 and to leave it to the provisions of the defence acts which I outlined earlier, why is it not appropriate to do that now? The answer of the Labor Party may be that the Workplace Relations Act 1996 makes a difference.
So on the one hand there is a sense that this is a bit of a beat-up—`It's good politics at this time so let's have a bit of a go'—and on the other hand is my view, where I think military training leave will be found by a full bench to be an allowable matter. And then there is the view we have already had and which I have quoted, where there is some doubt in this matter. So I come to the conclusion that military training leave should be allowable because of its importance to the country and because of the inference within the Defence Act and the Defence (Re-establishment) Act that we should encourage matters which encourage reservists to do their duty. I would make the point that, since we are engaged in East Timor in an international exercise of peace enforcement under international law, conventions are a part of international law which we attach a great deal of 
 notice to. I think the inclusion of military training leave as an allowable matter would help Australia meet its international obligations. Whilst I have doubt as to the validity of the case, to remove doubt I am inclined to support your bill, Senator Collins. That is the conclusion I have come to.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SERVICE AND TRAINING) BILL 1999 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,1999-10-14,"—I rise this afternoon to add my voice to that of my colleagues in urging the government to act on the matter of Defence Force leave for reservists. Like my colleagues, I find it extraordinary that the government have stubbornly refused to address the issue, despite the glaring evidence that they have made a mistake. The government's 1996 Workplace Relations Act deliberately removed from the Industrial Relations Commission any power to provide leave for Australian reservists to participate in the activities necessary to be a member of the Australian Defence Force reserves. It suited them to think that employers would pick up the provision in either Australian workplace agreements or certified agreements. As we know, that has not been the case, and our reserve capabilities are suffering as a result.
In the midst of our biggest troop deployment since Vietnam, we are well short of our reserve recruitment targets in all of the services. The government has been told this repeatedly. We in the Labor Party have consistently pointed out the short-sightedness of the Workplace Relations Act's  omissions in relation to our reservists. We have told current and previous defence ministers that they need to act in the interests of our reservists. We have introduced private members' bills about it, only to have them ignored by this government.
But let us be clear about this. The damage currently being done to our reserve capabilities by the government has been brought to their attention not only by the Labor Party. The Defence Force reserves' own support committee, chaired by a former Liberal defence minister, has raised the matter, as have senior reserve officers and the Victorian Liberal Council, which carried a resolution urging the government to ensure that defence leave for reserve Defence Force members is 
 included as an allowable matter in federal awards. The government are well aware of the problem that they have created with their industrial relations agenda. They have been warned that the current system jeopardises our reserve forces. They have been told that removing reserve leave as an allowable matter is stopping reservists from participating in defence activities, including training. The government have been told what is going on, and they have refused to address it. They are simply unwilling to admit that they are wrong.
Make no mistake: the people on the receiving end of this government's poor policy are our reservists. Please let me give you an example. North Queensland, as senators are no doubt aware, has a strong Australian Defence Force presence, including reservists. The 11th Brigade, based in Jezzine Barracks in Townsville, has an establishment of 1,916 and an effective strength of 852. I have been contacted by a number of reservists in Far North Queensland about this matter, including one person who has 14 years of reserve experience. This person works in a service industry in the north and is employed in a permanent part-time position. Their reserve responsibilities are a source of great personal satisfaction to them and a means of contributing to the community good. In effect, the reserves are this person's second career. As a part-time worker, this person has been able to meet the requisite training requirements for that career over 14 years. That is a lot of time that this person has given to the reserves and, of course, to us as a community.
Recently, the person was asked by the reserves to go overseas as part of the Australian Defence Force efforts in East Timor. It was, this person felt, an honour to be approached and a chance to exercise their skills and training. It was a chance, in the person's own words, `to do what I have been trained to do'. And yet the person turned the opportunity down. Why? Because it required a six-month stint in East Timor  and the person was advised that their job would not be there on their return. There was nothing in the person's award to offer any protection.
This is not an unusual case. That is the point that this reservist is making and that the Defence Force, the Victorian Liberal Council and the Australian Labor Party have been making. We ask a lot of time from our reservists, and it is not always easy for employers to accommodate these demands. Many employers simply will not do it and, under this government's industrial framework, they are not required to. The result is that reservists are being short-changed and our Defence Force is losing the services of good, trained and committed personnel. The government has a responsibility to our reservists. These people give up their own time to serve their community. They are regarded as an integral part of our Defence Force. We cannot do without them, and yet this government will not move to ensure that reservists are not penalised in the work force.
I also draw the attention of the chamber to the treatment of reservists employed by Telstra. Telstra is an organisation which, by the nature of its work force, has many employees who are also members of the Defence Force reserves. In the wake of Australia's East Timor commitment, the company stated its wish to support its reservist employees should they be called to serve in East Timor.
But contrary to its stated intention, Telstra is not supporting all its reservists. Reservists employed on a contract basis have been granted leave with pay for the duration of their service. Reservists employed under an industrial award have been granted just two weeks paid leave in addition to their four weeks Defence Force leave. If this is not enough, these employees will have to use their accrued long service leave or any other accrued leave they have. Contract employees will have access to unlimited paid leave from Telstra while award employees will only receive two weeks plus any existing annual ADF leave they have.
All this has been done without a murmur of protest from the government. How cynical! The government are willing to have some reservists discriminated against rather than question what Telstra is doing. They would rather have some reservists, who have given their time, their holidays and their service to 
 this country, penalised for serving rather than pull up an organisation clearly intent on using the situation in East Timor for its own workplace agenda. How cynical is that?
I want to place on record my admiration for the men and women who make up our Defence Force reserves. They give up their spare time to serve our country and right now, in the midst of the biggest deployment since Vietnam, we are relying on them more than ever. Yet there is a serious problem. The Labor Party has, on numerous occasions, drawn the attention of the government to the fact that reserve numbers are falling. I wonder why! Why would you volunteer your time when you might jeopardise your paid employment in the process? Why would you give up your time when, if you are actually required to report for duty, you might have to draw on your own annual or long service leave? Why would you when you have a federal government which is ignoring advice that you are being disadvantaged by one of its policies? The Labor Party calls on the government to finally do the right thing by its reservists and support this bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SERVICE AND TRAINING) BILL 1999 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1999-10-14,"—I rise to speak briefly to this bill as there are only a small number of issues which I want to raise. I notice that this bill has been introduced by Senator Jacinta Collins and her second reading speech has been incorporated in Hansard . That is not unusual when a bill is being introduced into this place except that, on most occasions when a second reading speech is incorporated in Hansard  before a bill comes on for debate, those who want to participate in the debate have had a chance to read it because it usually does not come on on the same day. I am not suggesting there is anything wrong with the practice, it is just that I have no idea what Senator Jacinta Collins's comments are in relation to this bill because I understand that you incorporated the speech today.
—No, yesterday.
—Yesterday? I do apologise. I thought it was today, because I am one staff member short today and I went to look very quickly.
In relation to this amendment to the Workplace Relations Act 1996, when you are talking about omitting subsections (2) and (3) and substituting subsections (2), (2)(a) and (3), that is really a reinstatement of some old Labor Party principles. I have been through the 1996 amendments to the Workplace Relations Act, and one of the things that came up for discussion then was reducing the number of allowable matters that were contained in awards. Here we have, in this bill that is being brought forward by the Labor Party, not so much an interest in the reservists but an interest in ideology and a return to trying to increase the number of allowable matters that are put in awards by amending the Workplace Relations Act.
I listened carefully to Senator Abetz when he was speaking to this bill. Senator Abetz highlighted to this chamber the confusion that exists between Mr Beazley, as Leader of the Opposition, and his defence science and personnel shadow minister, Mr Laurie Ferguson, who just simply do not understand the laws. Mr Beazley's confusion was highlighted in a transcript that I heard Senator Abetz read out. I also have a copy of that transcript and I cannot believe that a Leader of the Opposition could be so unprepared on an issue that he considered to be so important to the reservists and to the Defence Force of Australia.
Mr Beazley's confusion on 11 October over reserve leave and Mr Laurie Ferguson's comments on employment protection show that Labor simply does not understand the laws and arrangements that have been governing the reserve service. Mr Laurie Ferguson joined the Leader of the Opposition in causing confusion about reserves. He raised unnecessary doubts about the contribution that reserves can make to the East Timor deployment. So it would appear that Mr Beazley, having been defence minister in his own time, simply did not understand the law as it existed when he was minister.
It is quite obvious that the opposition's real agenda is not about having an effective reserve and having effective conditions for those reservists to operate under; it is more about bringing back an outdated and inflex 
 ible award system. We have seen, over the last couple of weeks while we have been having an inquiry into the amendments to the Workplace Relations Act, that the same tired old arguments are being trotted out by witness after witness in relation to award provisions. Here we have just another example of the Labor Party trying to wind back the clock to those days when there were inflexible award provisions—provisions that suited neither the employee nor the employer. They see this and any possible use of reservists, in the emotive time of the Defence Force's activities in East Timor, as an opportunity to be able to wind back the clock in order to try to bring back what was a totally inflexible and outdated system.
We have a situation where the minister himself has outlined the position with the reserves. We have Mr Beazley trying to politicise the reserves. We have a bill that has been introduced into this place by Senator Jacinta Collins which is specifically for one purpose only: to reintroduce an allowable award matter that applies to services and training. You are trying to reintroduce a—
—One. You are arguing against your own case.
—Senator Collins, you have said `one' three or four times; I would have thought that reintroducing an award, whether it is one or any other number, is going back to the old system. We spent a considerable amount of time in 1996 reducing the number of allowable award matters so that people would be able to have a much more flexible workplace in Australia, which we have. All of the economic and employment pointers also tell us that the more flexible arrangements put in place in the workplace by reducing the number of inflexible award matters has made it possible for Australians to get work and to have a much more flexible workplace, which suits the workers.
I have been listening to the ideology of the Labor Party for hour upon hour over the past four or five days of the hearings of the committee inquiry into the legislation that is before this place in relation to amending the Workplace Relations Act—not this particular bill but the other bill we are inquiring into. 
 We have heard the same ideology trotted out hour after hour. No acknowledgment has been given to the government that, since 1996 when this Workplace Relations Act was put in place, unemployment has dropped from 11 per cent to seven per cent. There has been no acknowledgment of that whatsoever, or that in that period of time real wages for the low paid have increased, by the ACTU's own admission, by 9½ per cent. There was no acknowledgment of the government's role in that, because they seem to think it is all their own good work. In fact, this has all happened out of this bill, which they said would be completely unworkable and would strip workers of entitlements and of real wage increases.
During the whole of the time of the accord and the Labor government, real wages decreased. Yet, since the operation of the Workplace Relations Act in 1996—the first bill that was introduced by Mr Reith—we have seen unemployment drop from 11 per cent to seven per cent and we have seen real wages for the low paid increase by 9½ per cent. That is a pretty fair effort, but there has been no acknowledgment of that from the unions that have appeared before us in the inquiry. They always try to find some other reason for all of these things that have happened. Yet when the Labor Party was in government, all they could deliver to the Australian people were high unemployment and no wages growth, and on top of all that high interest rates, which affected people in the work force and people who were not in the work force, particularly in relation to the repayment of home loans and all of those things that affect the average worker so much.
What we have in this bill before the chamber today is a return to the old Labor philosophy of trying to introduce more allowable award matters, when it has been shown that, by reducing the existing allowable matters in the awards, we have been able to produce benefits for Australian workers, which they realise they are getting even if the unions that represent some 29 or 30 per cent of Australian workers do not. I know that the membership of unions has decreased to an alarming level. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order on relevance. I was ruled out of order by the previous Acting Deputy President—and I will be taking that matter up with the President—because I did not know the precise number of the point of order, which is an absolutely ridiculous ruling according to the clerks, but can I highlight that this bill is about one allowable matter. We are seeking to clarify a commission understanding that it is not allowable. It is not about the workplace relations bill that is before the Senate committee.
—There is no point of order.
—I should think that there is no point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I have heard a lot of speeches in second reading debates in this place, and I have heard a lot from members of the opposition. All the time that I have been in this place, speeches in the second reading debate have ranged far and wide. I am talking about allowable awards, and what are you doing in this bill? You are introducing another allowable award matter, and if that is not relevant to the second reading debate, I am surprised.
Senator Vanstone has been in this place a lot longer than I have, and I have no doubt that she has heard a lot more wide ranging speeches from the Labor Party.
—Too right, and from the other side.
—That is what I say, from the other side.
—And this side.
—Thank you, Senator Vanstone—very wide ranging. So your attempt to take a point of order, Senator Collins, was—
—Ungracious.
—Very ungracious. When Senator Collins has been in this place a bit longer she will realise that speeches in the second reading debate give people the opportunity to range somewhat wider than they would in other speeches that they have 
 to make in this chamber. I do not want to continue much longer because I know my colleague Senator Mason wants to speak to this bill, and I know we have to finish in half an hour. I conclude my remarks by reiterating that it is the view on this side of the chamber that this bill to amend the Workplace Relations Act to introduce another allowable award matter is simply a return of the Labor Party to their old ideology, and will simply not stand them in good stead because, as they know themselves, the operation of the existing Workplace Relations Act has provided tremendous benefits to those people who are workers in Australia today—higher wages and less unemployment. With the economy running on very low interest rates, the last thing we want to do is to return to the bad old days of the Labor Party.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SERVICE AND TRAINING) BILL 1999 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,1999-10-14,"—The contribution I will make this afternoon is going to be short. The previous speakers from the Labor Party have covered the main points very well, but there are a couple of matters that I want to clarify in terms of the debate so far. Senator Ferguson mentioned flexibility in our system of industrial relations. That is in fact what the bill allows to happen. It allows the Industrial Relations Commission to deal with Defence Force leave upon a certain ground. It allows the commission to deal with the potential flexibility between the submissions on behalf of employers and submissions by unions as to what form clauses in awards should take in relation to Defence Force leave. This is an important matter, notwithstanding the contribution Senator Abetz made in relation to it, where after a while I came to the conclusion that we were not talking about this bill at all, though it appears that he got to it in the end.
The matters that Senator Murray went to were interesting. However, I want to clarify something in relation to his contribution. He did mention the exceptional matters order as another way of putting Defence Force leave within a framework which the commission may be able to deal with. However, exceptional matters orders have a limited life, unlike an award provision, which would go on ad infinitum and allow the parties to be 
 able to deal with the matter in a sensible and appropriate manner.
This is a matter that I can speak on with some knowledge, not only having appeared in the commission and dealt with these matters but also being a part-time soldier for some 10 years. The number of awards that have been varied is an indication of the take-up rate by employees who wish to be part-time soldiers, and the ability of the commission to be able to deal with it is relevant. Many employers simply understood that the ability was there for the commission to vary such a provision and allow people to have leave in an individual case.
I support the bill. In short, it will ensure that leave for participation in service and training as a member of the Australian Defence Force Reserves can be dealt with by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It must be a matter that the commission can deal with. It is not an argument to say that it is a little-used clause, that it is redundant, that it is superfluous and that as such it should not be considered or that the government will deal with it in other ways. That is not the agenda that Mr Reith is running. He has removed the provision and he has not supported it in any other way. The reserve force should not be treated in such an offhand manner. Workers should enjoy this right, and the Army would benefit from it.
By opposing this, Mr Reith has shot himself in the foot. It hurts the Army Reserve. As I said earlier, I have served in the Army Reserve and I can say that I recognise the difficulties that the Army Reserve has had in recruiting and retaining soldiers, especially those from the private sector. Often soldiers took annual leave or unpaid leave. It sometimes occurred that reservists would have to pack up and head back to work because the employer had expressed concern about the time spent away. The Army Reserve itself spends considerable time talking up the benefits to employers. It gains support from employers. The union I worked for in the past had an agreement with the Army Reserve for support, and many other employers have also demonstrated a strong support. It is a sad day to find that this government cannot support an 
 award provision that the Army Reserve would benefit from. The conditions can be improved upon if the commission is able to deal with it. This government should not be about removing clauses from awards. It should be allowing flexibility and allowing the commission to deal with award provisions in respect of this matter. The government can turn the tide around and say that it supports this bill.
I also take this opportunity to add my full support to Major General Cosgrove and the soldiers serving under him in East Timor. I praise them for the high standard of work that they are performing in very difficult circumstances. Turning to this issue in particular, reserve numbers have plummeted. This government has not seen fit to do much about it, it seems, other than to hurry down the path of reducing available resources. It seems that it is far more interested in trying to draw money out of the education budget to fund its business tax changes than in funding the Army Reserve appropriately.
This bill has the effect of making the award provisions on Defence Force leave an allowable matter. Let us not get hooked up on the term `allowable matter'. Long before the Reith legislation's first wave in 1996, allowable matters were simply matters that the commission could deal with—all matters. Let me go now into these innocuous clauses that Mr Reith has found so unpalatable. It is worth while to do so. In fact, I found in a federal award one of these matters that were not allowable under the 1996 legislation. It is a simple provision. It reads:
An employee who is a member of the Australian Defence Force Reserve shall receive two weeks leave to attend annual training camps. For this period, such employee shall be reimbursed by the employer an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid in respect of such attendance and the employee's base weekly salary (which shall include the tropical allowance, clause 11.4, where applicable).
This was simply a make-up provision to ensure that the employee, while serving and providing support to the nation, was provided with an amount to make up the difference between the two rates of pay. There are other clauses which simply provided for leave without pay and others which provided for 
 paid leave. All these types of things could be argued before the commission and agreed to by employers and unions and placed in awards, but this government will not allow that to occur. What it should do is allow that to occur and support this bill.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SERVICE AND TRAINING) BILL 1999 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,1999-10-14,"—I want to say a few things this afternoon about the people that this bill is directed towards, the Australian reservists. One of my favourite political leaders of this century, Sir Winston Churchill, was right when he described those who serve the national interest as a member of volunteer defence forces while also doing a civilian job or studies as `twice the citizen'. They have a proud tradition of service to the community in peace and war. This country has produced perhaps the finest soldiers this century, and of course the Army reservists have played a very proud part in that tradition. They are an important link between the Australian Defence Force and our community.
Senator Ludwig is one of those who is part of that link, and it is a great link and an old link. Indeed it goes right back to Federation in 1901, when Australia had a military force—comprising militia and volunteers—of 27,000 people with a permanent force of only 1,500. The reserve forces comprised about 96½ per cent of Australia's total force and today of course they represent something like one third of Australia's defence forces.
It is important, and I certainly agree with the opposition, that we provide the men and women in our reserve force with the support, assistance and recognition that they deserve. It is important too that we recognise the support provided by the employers of reservists in allowing them to undertake training and in encouraging them to provide service to our nation. In return, those who participate in the reserve forces learn valuable skills in leadership and also trade skills.
Like Senator Ludwig, my brother David was an Army reservist. He was the first person to walk alone across Australia from the most easterly point to the most westerly point. He did so with three camels. He did it last year and he was the Australian Geographic national explorer of the year for 
 1998. He also raised a lot of money for the Fred Hollows Foundation. He attributes much of that great skill in walking across this entire nation by himself with the camels to the skills he learnt in the Army Reserve. Along with Senator Ludwig, he would have learnt things about navigation, how to control camels and all those sorts of things.
Reservists who volunteer to serve are paid a full-time military salary and, should they be deployed as part of the peace enforcement mission, they receive the same tax-free salary and allowances as their regular counterparts. Reservists are also covered by the same compensation arrangements as regulars when they serve as such. Medical specialists can have their fixed practice costs paid while they serve, thanks to our government's introduction of this condition of service.
Employees who are members of the reserve forces and serve with the Defence Force are protected, as Senator Abetz pointed out, under the existing provisions of the Defence Act 1903 and the Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965 in relation to their civilian employment. These acts prohibit employers from being able to penalise or prejudice an employee who serves in the Defence Force; sections 8 and 9 of the Defence (Re-establishment) Act can be invoked and an employer fined under criminal law. This protection also extends to volunteers who are currently serving in East Timor—something like 38 officers and 49 other ranks in the Army, working principally in areas such as medicine, logistics and personnel.
Our workplace relations system is working well. Examples of companies who have flexible reserve leave include Telstra and the Commonwealth bank, and the Northern Territory government also does so. I pulled off the Web some statements from employers about the Army Reserve. For example, Mr Richard Bluck, who is the Executive Director of the Williamson Community Leadership Program, says:
Reserve service can enhance an employee's performance and expand an organisation's experience and skills base. The leadership and management training reservists acquire is excellent and is certainly applicable to all organisations public or private, big or small. 

If employers and employees wish to make more comprehensive arrangements about service with the Defence Force, they can always of course make a formal agreement on the matter. Sadly but consistently, the ALP has opposed award simplification of any kind—and that was Senator Ferguson's argument. Although the ALP has claimed that reforms introduced in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 had an adverse effect on reservists, it certainly has not shown any particular problems with the manner in which the current reserve system is operating. The ALP option would mean a return to the system before 1996, when there were 152 federal awards—out of 3,000—which had some reference to leave for Army reservists. It was confusing and it was a shambles.
Labor's `one size fits all' forces employers to comply with rules that do not in fact fit the particular employee. Sadly, despite his role as a former defence minister, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, now seems confused as to how the amendments to the Workplace Relations Act that he introduced earlier this week will operate. As Senator Abetz pointed out, Mr Beazley seemed unsure, when interviewed on 6PR on Monday, whether reservists would receive unpaid or paid leave under his amendments. And the comments one day later from Mr Ferguson, the shadow minister for defence science and personnel, showed that Labor still does not understand the laws and arrangements governing reserve service. All that this does is cause unnecessary doubt about the contribution reservists can make to our efforts in East Timor at the moment.
This bill will not assist the Reserve and it certainly will not assist Australia's efforts in East Timor. The agenda here is not practical; it is actually ideologically driven. It calls for centralising outcomes, not for the flexibility necessary in the modern work force. And it is not necessary here, it is inappropriate and it flies in the face of modern workplace relations. It was a pillar of this country in 1901 but, as the opposition still do not understand, the world has changed. They live under the shade of the tree of knowledge at Barcaldine and they cannot get out of the shade.

"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-10-14,"—I think that a number of contributions this afternoon have been somewhat concerning—to me anyway. Probably the most concerning was the one by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. In fact, he spent most of his time—I think some 16 minutes of his 20 minutes—talking about problems in the Labor Party and suggesting that Mr Beazley would not be the leader of the Labor Party. In fact, he said that Mr Beazley was suffering a declining support level within the ALP. Let me assure you that that is not so.
I do not want to spend 16 minutes talking about that, but I want to make just one comment about Senator Abetz. We all know over here that he has a thermometer firmly placed in Senator Newman and he checks the Fahrenheit level every day. I suggest that Senator Newman's body temperature probably dropped to about 90 degrees Fahrenheit today. Senator Abetz is jumping around over there, just waiting for the opportunity to replace her. I do not want to say too much about that because there has already been one point of order taken on relevance—and the senator in the chair said it was okay to go on for 16 minutes with this sort of drivel. Senator Abetz ought to be the last person in here to talk about the demise or decline of anyone on the frontbench—that is, until he gets there himself.
I am concerned about his contribution for another reason. There are a number of issues at stake here. Firstly, is it the case that we have adequate reserve levels in this country? I think the answer is no. Do we have the proper legislative provisions to support those reserves? I think the answer is no. Do we have a situation where we have to look at these issues with some urgency? The answer is certainly yes. The East Timor situation surfaced quite quickly on us. Somebody made the comment years ago that the defence forces in this country, or in any country, are an insurance policy that you hope never to use. 
 That is very much like our household insurance policies; it is very much like the policies we have on our cars and, maybe, on ourselves. We hope that we do not ever have to use those policies. Certainly, for most of my lifetime we have not had to do that in this country. It has been a long time since Australia has had to participate in any forward deployment. In fact, for most of the years since Vietnam, Australia has had a pretty lucky time of it. It could well be argued that Australia and this end of the world has had a very lucky time since 1945. As a result, we have spent progressively less of our economy on defence, much less than we really should have. Both sides of politics are guilty of that charge. What we have done is rely on highly trained individuals who have filled the gap when necessary as reserves in our forces in all three arms of the service.
As a nation, we have concentrated our defence assets and scarce resources on buying equipment that takes years to procure. We have the strongest air force in this region and we know that it takes years to get new aircraft and even longer to train some of the pilots. We have built a powerful navy. We have a powerful navy for a very good reason: we are an island continent and we have a number of island possessions that we need to look after. We have spent a lot of money building naval assets in this country out of our scarce defence budget—a defence budget that has been $10 billion virtually for as long as I can remember, no matter which party has been in power. What we have always relied on is that, cometh the hour, we would be able to pull reserves out and use them. The Timor situation has crept up on us. You could probably say it has galloped up on us.
The defence department has done a pretty good job with available resources. The fact of the matter is that we have committed the 1st Brigade and the 3rd Brigade. Those two brigades are our front-line army resources. The 1st Brigade, sent up to Darwin by the Labor government as part of the army presence in the North—the APIN project—is now fully deployed in East Timor. The 1st Brigade has traditionally been on 180 days notice for any deployment. That had to be reduced to 28 
 days and then to 72 hours. It is now deployed; it is out of Darwin; it is in East Timor. The 3rd Brigade, which has always had a much higher state of readiness—as I understand it, between 28 days and 72 hours; certainly the latter in the course of this year—is no longer in Townsville; it is now in East Timor.
The problem we now have is one of rotation. The other week Senator Newman made it clear to the Senate that we will have no problems with rotation. I hope that her confidence is well founded because I cannot see where we can find two fully trained brigades to go into East Timor should this situation continue well beyond Christmas. I cannot see where we are going to find the replacement forces for rotation. If another problem were to evidence itself somewhere else and we needed to have some military response to it, we would have to pull troops out of East Timor to deal with it.
I can understand the decision making that took place in the Howard government some three years or so ago when the Ready Reserve was ended. I thought it was a bad decision, but I can understand people saying, `We don't need to pay our insurance premiums any longer; we should be okay for a few more years. For budgetary reasons we are going to end this scheme. In fact we will save some money out of it, which means that we can buy'—as I understand it—`some of the better equipment that is needed for 3rd Brigade and that we can actually speed up the process by which we put better equipment into 1st Brigade, in particular, to aircondition the tanks to make them more tropically friendly for the crews who have to operate them, to buy the ASLAV equipment that 1st Brigade desperately needed and to speed up the process for 3rd Brigade of sorting out the problems with the very old equipment that they have.' In fact, quite a large number of the armoured personnel carriers in East Timor that we see on TV each night served in Vietnam. They are 35 and 40 years old. They are well maintained but, as with all equipment that is well maintained, they suffer from an age problem.
I can understand that the government took the view that money that was spent on the reserves up until 1996 was money that could have been used somewhere else. In defence budgets, it is always the case that you can spend and spend but you just do not have the dollars for it. One of the things, however, that we now have to seriously address is the problem of the reserve levels in this country, and it has to be addressed at a number of different levels. Firstly, we have to ensure that there is adequate training for members of the reserve so that we can entice them into the forces, keep them in the forces and ensure that their level of training is such that we can use them if the hour comes when that needs to be the case. Indeed, I think that one of the things that must be heartbreaking for a lot of the defence personnel is to see that, quite often, people who are trained as reservists, for one reason or another—usually to do with employment—have to leave that service after a number of years, and it will take a length of time to be able to get someone trained up to do that job.
On the other level—and this is something that we can do something about here—Senator Collins's bill, in my view, puts in a proper legislative framework to give those people who make the contribution and the sacrifice of joining the reserves much more security than they currently have in terms of employment for when they want to return to their normal work. The comment made here by some of the speakers was that these sorts of arrangements had been made in Telstra and one or two of the government agencies for not all but many of the reserve personnel. I would have thought that, since the first week in September, one of the highest priorities for the government would have been to get this right and to ensure that there is going to be an adequate force level to, at the very least, be able to go to Timor and give some relief to those two brigades that are there right now.
We have heard the government talk about raising other battalions up to a state of readiness. I can only say that we really need to have much more than a battalion at readiness; we are going to need to have at least one full brigade. Even with one full brigade, the problem in Timor is going to be such that, 
 without any fighting or any of the rest of it, we will still need to ensure that peace with one fully armed brigade well into next year. If the problems with the militia materialise—and I hope they do not—we may indeed need to have two brigades up there fully deployed and with other resources that we will have to find, presumably from our allies.
In the last six weeks this government should have been dealing with, at the very least, the issues of where the reserves are going, their security of employment and other necessary important provisions that will ensure that they remain within the defence forces. Over the years, the level of reserves in the forces has been dropping each year. This is a worrying trend that must be reversed. It must be reversed because those soldiers who are now deployed in Timor will need some relief in the very near future and so that we can restrict our defence budget. I support, as far as possible, restricting our defence budget, so that we can spend money on education, health and all those other things that also have budgets that cry out for dollars.
One of the key elements in this debate here today is that Senator Collins's bill addresses a path that the government really should have had us back here addressing a couple of weeks ago to at least give some security to some of those people who are currently in the reserves and others who wish to join. Unless we can build up the morale of our defence forces—and the reserves are an important part of it—our defence bills in the future will be extremely expensive. They will be more and more expensive as time goes on. I think that Senator Collins's bill addresses a part of the problem—not all of it, but a part of the problem. As a consequence of that, I welcome the bill's introduction here today. I think it is important that we get this through as quickly as we can. I know that there are other speakers who wish to address this today. (Time expired)
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SERVICE AND TRAINING) BILL 1999 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-10-14,"—I would like to talk to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill that Senator Jacinta Collins is putting forward. Without entering into too much controversy, I must say as a former national serviceman or `nasho' that I am well aware of our reserve forces and the great record that they have had over the years. You can go right back to the VDC—and I do not reckon a lot of you would even remember what that was, but that was the Volunteer Defence Corps. We then had the Citizen Military Forces and, of course, who could forget the great job that our militia did up on the Kokoda Trail, in Papua New Guinea, during the Second World War. They were reservists who were thrown in at the deep end, and they were the first ones to turn back the Japanese. So the reserve forces in Australia have had a long and distinguished history.
I must say, without being too critical, that I thought some of the comments made here today by the opposition did amount to a tad of scaremongering and nitpicking. That seems to have been the thrust of the debate since we have had troops in East Timor. I really must say that I am disappointed in this. We have quite a few specialist reservists in Tasmania and, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Sherry, some of them are already in East Timor, particularly on the transport side. One of the transport squadrons is based in the area of my electorate that I have my office, at Warrane, and I must say that I have never had a reservist come to me complaining about the fact that they have been badly treated by their employers. The way the government has approached it over the years, to allow negotiation between the employer and the reservists, has worked very well and is the preferred objective of the government.
So, while Senator Collins may have had the best of intentions, I really do not think the bill proposed here today has done a lot to help the situation. It really has not fostered the bipartisan approach that was promised in this matter by the former defence minister, now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. The last thing that our people in East Timor want to know, whether they be reservists or permanent troops, is that the government and the opposition back home are at odds about what is happening. I find it most unusual that the former defence minister did not even know whether reservists were paid, were going to be paid, whether their employers paid them or whether they got double pay. But, of course, we know that reservists who volunteer to serve are paid a full military salary, and if they are deployed as part of a peace enforcement mission they receive the same tax free salary and allowances as their counterparts in the regulars. And so they should, and they should receive the same repatriation benefits when they return.
I listened with interest to Senator Quirke talking about what may be needed next year. I was of the understanding that the United Nations were going to put together a sufficient force and that some of our troops would be returning early in the new year. I know 
 that things change on a weekly basis as to what is happening, but I was of the understanding that there was going to be a much more significant input from the United Nations. But, in any event, I was interested to hear some of the debate today. I say once again that I just do not believe it is doing the opposition any good whatsoever, with the lack of support they seem to be getting and the nitpicking that seems to be going on about our troops in East Timor. I just hope that we do not have any more of it and that we give our troops the full support they deserve, on a bipartisan basis.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Defence Force Service and Training</title>,Adjournment,23,1,speech

State Minister's Response
The Honourable Rob Kerin
Deputy Premier, Minister for Primary Industries, Natural Resources & Regional Development
Mr Kerin welcomed Senator Macdonald, Lyn Breuer-Member of Giles, Barry Wakelin-Member 
 for Grey, Mayor John Smith and forum participants. His response included the following points:
.	 He acknowledged the Federal commitment to regional development over the last two budgets.
.	 The forum process represents an opportunity to deliver a message to Canberra on how funding could be best used in the region.
.	 A lot of thought is required to achieve the outcomes that add value to the region communities. It is acknowledged that the government has not always made the best decisions on regional development in the past.
.	 Care should be taken to ensure that the proposed Rural Transaction Centres don't impact on local businesses.
.	 The Federal Governments Regional Economic Development Organisation's (REDO's) initiative lacked synergy in a region which is extremely large, diverse and includes coastal cities and remote areas. There should be care taken not to revisit the confusion that was created by having two layers of regional development bodies in the same area. There is a good system of state and local Regional Development Boards and it should be recognised that one size doesn't fit all.
.	 He commented on the difficulty for the Federal Government in providing flexible programs and acknowledged contributions made in a number of areas including: rail reform, Agriculture Advancing Australia and telecommunications infrastructure funds.
.	 The State Government has reviewed Regional Development in South Australia with the preparation of the Regional Development Task Force Report. This has brought about a changed definition of Regional Development that considers regions in economic, social and environmental terms.
.	 The State Government has a number of ways to assist regions and has established the Office of Regional Development.
.	 Examples of current issues in the Spencer Gulf area include:
	 .	 The Eyre Peninsula region has strong growth in aquaculture. Towns such as Cowell have received a strong employment boost with the introduction of aquaculture activities and one micro-economic indicator is the fact that training is now required to play for the B grade football team.
	 .	 Land access for the Aboriginal population is a key issue for the region.
	 .	 The Asia crisis has impacted on the mineral sectors of the Upper Spencer Gulf, however 
 some further development has occurred at Roxby and Beverley and the potential exists for magnesium mining at Pt Augusta.
.	 In closing he made two requests:
	 .	 Firstly that all three levels of government work together and focus on outcomes
	 .	 Secondly that all leaders be positive about what happens in regional areas through improved marketing of the region. Decision-makers want to hear positive messages, although it is acknowledged that government requires a ""belt"" from time to time and some regions need more assistance than others.
SESSION 1
Presentation and Discussion of Spencer Gulf Area and its Constituent Regions Regional Future Brief
Session objective: To present and discuss the current context of the Spencer Gulf Area and its constituent regions and to identify area specific economic, social and environmental priorities.
Spencer Gulf Area
Barry Wakelin, Federal Member for Grey
Barry Wakelin, Federal member for Grey, provided a description of key issues in the region from a personal perspective. His presentation included the following:
.	 The Federal seat of Grey comprises 92% of South Australia. He has been the elected member since 1993 and comes from Kimba on the Eyre Peninsula.
.	 The Government is committed to the region and now has stronger regional representation than in 1996 including the recent appointment of John Anderson as Deputy Prime Minister. Barry Wakelin is a member the steering committee for a regional Summit to be conducted in October this year.
.	 Great diversity has brought great strength in the region and self-reliance is a trademark.
.	 Some government programs, which have not been high cost, have demonstrated success including: The Job Network (50% improvement over 12 months compared to the CES) and Work for the Dole schemes.
.	 Development issues in the electorate have included: Western Mining, Beverley, Aquaculture and other existing industries. (70% of new investment comes from existing business)
.	 Long term commitment to the region by Government is important. The Government anticipates that there will be significant improvement in mobile phone coverage over the next two years. 

.	 The small population base of the region is difficult to provide programs for and the region. Government policy over a period has resulted in a number of inequities for the region including: health, education and roads.
.	 There needs to be an improvement in the relationships between Federal, State and regional bureaucracies.

SESSION 2
Presentation by Commonwealth
Sema Varova:	 First Assistant Secretary, Regional Services, Development and Local Government Division, Department of Transport and Regional Services
Session objective: To present a Commonwealth perspective on the range of approaches and initiatives required to improve the Commonwealth's responsiveness to regional needs.
Ms Varova provided a brief outline of the broad range of Commonwealth activity in the Spencer Gulf area and its constituent regions. She described the work to date of the Commonwealth Interdepartmental working group on the Regional Forums Australia Programme and how this mechanism is designed to assist Federal agencies to take a whole of government approach rather than looking at

issues from their own portfolio perspective and dealing with a region in isolation from other portfolios. She also described the task of the Transport and Regional Services portfolio in being responsible for coordinating cross-portfolio issues in relation to regional Australia.
Ms Varova and other Federal agency representatives also took questions from the floor on the Federal Government's approach to regional Australia and particularly the Spencer Gulf Area.
Facilitated Discussion of Commonwealth Position Paper
Issues Raised:
.	 There is a need for regional development programs that provide initiatives, which allow regions to become competitive. A focus on services doesn't allow this. While services such as Austrade and Invest Australia are excellent, they should be considered as the next step after the establishment of a regional development program.
.	 The Federal Government's Green Paper on higher education discusses the potential role of local universities in the regional economy. The Lincoln Science Centre and Rural Health unit at Whyalla indicate that a model exists for building up regional university campuses. A critical issue is human resources and there is a case for providing funding to create higher level academic positions in areas such as agribusiness that would subsequently attract research students and allow building up rather than down sizing.
.	 The inequity between the money collected from fuel taxes and the level of expenditure on roads.
SESSION 3
The Key Strategies and the Agenda for Change
An interactive session with a panel drawn from Commonwealth, State, Local Government and regional leaders:
Session objective: To bring together all spheres of government and regional leaders to begin to identify and agree regional priorities for post-Forum action.

Sema Varova
First Assistant Secretary, Department of Transport and Regional Services 
Issues Raised:
.	 A key policy issue for State, Commonwealth and Local Governments is how to turn a limited amount of money to the strategic advantage of many varying regions. It is critical to develop a communication strategy so people in the regions can understand what can be offered by various government agencies.
.	 There is a need for a whole of government approach.
.	 State employment programs ie Kickstart have provided an excellent example of empowering local communities to determine the priority and direction of funding.
.	 A problem for Regional Development Boards is tapping into funding programs, which are very competitive and require time-consuming submissions. The marketing and communication of these programs also needs improving.
.	 Dollar for dollar matching funding programs of the Commonwealth, disenfranchise poorer areas who most need assistance.
.	 State employment programs eg Kickstart have greater flexibility and give more responsibility to the regions than Commonwealth programs. The region would like to see this ""mature"" type of relationship develop with the Commonwealth.
.	 The SA Regional Development Taskforce report produced a number of excellent recommendations. Ways of implementing these should be investigated.
.	 Projects in Aboriginal lands (eg Gawler Craton) offer employment benefits to local communities and tribal people do not want to hold up development. There is however a need for improved communication in relation to sacred site issues as there have been instances where developers have not acknowledged these issues (Lake Gairdner). Aboriginal people are happy to work cooperatively with Councils to identify areas, which do not have sacred site status. (Wudinna)
.	 The Area Consultative Committee (ACC) should have a broad cross section from the community including representatives from the business sector. It should work with all levels of government and the regional economic development boards.
.	 There are inequities with Commonwealth funding for local roads and Financial Assist 
 ance Grants, between the eastern states and this region. The per capita formulas used for these funds disadvantage the Spencer Gulf area.
.	 Equity of outcomes is a key issue, people shouldn't be disadvantaged by lesser services because of their decision to live in a regional area.
.	 Equity of access to funding should be given to the regions along with the responsibility for dispersing it. Transparency in funding provision is required to built trust.
.	 There is a current lack of coordination in funding programs.
.	 Regions need to be clearly defined for funding programs. Some AusIndustry programs have been unsuitable for implementation in some regions.
.	 Solutions should be defined to fit regions.
.	 Many reports have been prepared for Aboriginal people by State and Federal government including those on health, deaths in custody and employment. Many of these have not been acted on and funding associated with reports has not reached indigenous people. Services should be better coordinated to reach people who really need it.
.	 Equity of access to intellectual capital. There is a need for access to a wider range of tertiary courses in regional areas.
.	 An expectation in coming to the forum was that people wouldn't be told there was no more money and that more innovation is required.
.	 There are opportunities for employment in regional areas. These opportunities and the benefits of country living should be marketed at the Federal and State level. The Federal government could provide economic development officers in established economic development boards.
.	 Access to and equity in social service provision. There are a growing number of people dependent on welfare and services and an increase in the number of social problems. Economic development initiatives may benefit larger regional centres but have alarming affects on smaller centres through shifting of resources.
.	 The time taken in getting approval for regional projects (eg 3 years) can result in lost opportunities. 

.	 There is an opportunity to channel ACC funds into Regional Development boards.
.	 Lack of infrastructure creates loss of development and can constrain associated employment opportunities. Eg Winery expansion disapproved by Council due to insufficient road infrastructure.
.	 ATSIC funding is divided into many programs with different guidelines. Aboriginal people have limited access to funding programs. CDC funding has not benefited Aboriginal communities in the region. (eg Gulf Link Ferry, Oyster farm).
.	 Regional Development boards and the ACC should take a leadership role in the region and develop telecommunications expertise.
.	 Regional areas have greater access to fresh air and an environment with lower levels of crime and stress.
.	 Environmental issues should be seen as opportunities. Ways of integrating economic and environmental issues should be investigated.
.	 Outback mining developments tend to have significant levels of ""fly-in fly-out"" employees and use contractors. These issues need to be considered in estimating their value to the region.
.	 A beneficial aspect of the forum is the opportunity it provides for regional people to link up with Commonwealth agency representatives and pursue issues relating to specific programs.

SESSION 5:
Facilitated Working Groups on Regional Priorities
Session objective: Facilitated Working Groups on agreed regional priorities. The working groups developed implementation strategies and recommended actions.
Workshop No 1: Partnering for Regional Development
Key targeted projects:
.	 In 3 months to explore whether we can have a ""signed off"" memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the recommendations of the Spencer Gulf Common Purpose Group Report
.	 Explore areas for more flexibility in the special purpose funding for infrastructure—roads, power & water
.	 Steering group to develop and facilitate a communication process network between AusIndustry and potential clients in the Spencer Gulf region
.	 ATSIC suggests a proposal for developing an agreed and defined partnerships between the Steering Group and the new ATSIC Regional Council
.	 A memorandum of understanding to be developed by Department of Transport and Regional Services to offer a ""case manager"" service to requests/enquiries from the Spencer Gulf region.
Criteria for models on partnership-to be tested:
.	 Process must be merit driven
.	 Government as a broker
.	 Advocacy
.	 Government to provide a ""case manager""
.	 Potential for early communication and advice
.	 Distilling from previous models for success
.	 How to build personal relationships?
.	 Marketing programs and also the regional group
.	 Flexible time length (set in MOU)
.	 Develop a model MOU for use with all projects (either by service or region)
.	 Learn lessons from ""excellent"" contact officers- what works and what would help
.	 Explore flexibility in: approach, process, application, reporting, evaluation & funding models
.	 2 way approach to streamlining & rationalisation- ""We don't just want more-we are all prepared to give and take"" 

Workshop No. 2: Equity for Regions
Scope:
.	 Program/funding information
.	 Funding (including : Local Government Financial Assistance Grants (FAGs), GST, Tax Share)
.	 Intellectual capital/education
.	 Health and social services
.	 Information & technology
.	 Government services
Focus on:
1.	 Gaining improved equity from traditional sources ie FAGs, road grants, GST allocation, major State/Federal programs
2.	 Improving equity for the region by community action in attracting and holding private investment-self help
3.	 Inclusive decision making processes-a holistic approach which gets the regions in the decision making loop from day 1
	 .	 New investment opportunities
	 .	 Withdrawal of services and
	 .	 Structural adjustment processes
All underpinned by the need for flexibility—one size, one process doesn't fit all.
The Action Plan
Over the next four months we want to engage with Federal, State, Local and regional leaders to examine
.	 Funding formulae in relation to major regional grants. Action: Nominate a working group within 2 weeks of today and meet within 1 month
.	 Live case study around investment proposal- 2 or 3 projects. Action: Selection of studies and a working group to consider inclusive decision making structures and processes within 1 month.
Message: Renewal fostering of leadership
Workshop No. 3: Opportunities for the Region
.	 There is a need to develop
	 .	 A belief in the region. ""Be different and tell people""
	 .	 Partnerships with both government and the private sector
	 .	 The right mindset to build on opportunities
	 .	 Campaigns to market itself both within and outside the region
	 .	 Involvement from the media
	 .	 A regional brand 

A number of opportunities that could be developed or further built upon include:

.	 Non coastal
Along the way the project must have all agencies agreeing with the process
.	 Define projects
.	 Terms of reference
	 .	 Long term model covering economic environmental and social considerations
.	 Time Line
	 .	 1 month for regions to agree on the project
	 .	 2 months for all parties to meet
	 .	 3 months DECISION to go
Workshop No. 6: Better Co-ordination for Aboriginal Development
1.	 Regional autonomy
.	 More direct funding to the regions would offer benefits including reduced time constraints, which is commercially beneficial. Two regional plans currently exist in the region. Port Augusta & Ceduna. Approach to RCC. Refer SA Regional Development Taskforce.
2.	 Promotion of positive achievements
.	 Eg Public relations, Ministerial endorsement for local initiatives. Eg Buttlingarra
3.	 Building trust/brokering—
.	 A brokering role by Regional Development Boards could improve project credibility
4.	 Consider a changed perception of accountability
.	 ATSIC has comprehensive evaluation and audit processes. Regional communities also have a responsibility in relation to accountability.
