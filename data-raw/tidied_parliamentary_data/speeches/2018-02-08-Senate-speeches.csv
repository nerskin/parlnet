The PRESIDENT
 (09:31):  I inform the Senate that I have received a letter from Senator Brandis resigning his place as a senator for the state of Queensland. Pursuant to the provisions of section 21 of the Constitution, I will shortly notify the Governor of Queensland of the vacancy in the representation of that state caused by the resignation. I table the resignation letter.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2018-02-08,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (09:32):  The Future Frigate Program, which is the subject of this discussion, is currently undertaking a competitive evaluation process, a CEP, to select a designer/builder to deliver nine antisubmarine warfare frigates to the Royal Australian Navy and set the foundation of the Turnbull government's continuous shipbuilding plan in Australia. These are ships which will provide the Navy with critical capability that will underpin the defence of Australia into the future. The CEP is on track for the government to make a decision on the successful tenderer before the middle of 2018, enabling steel to be cut on the future frigates in 2020, creating over 2,000 shipbuilding jobs and in conformity with the government's previous commitments on this matter.


In relation to the order that was agreed by the Senate on 6 February 2018, I would like to make some remarks and address some of the incorrect claims made in the preamble to the order. On 3 May 2017, then Senator Xenophon submitted a freedom of information request for documents which related to Australian industry content in the future frigate request for tender. At the time, Defence originally declined access to four documents identified as matching the scope of the FOI request on the grounds that, at the time, the procurement was at a very sensitive stage of the competitive evaluation process. At the time of the initial request, tenderers were in the tender preparation phase of the CEP. When the decision was considered again by the department, the department was evaluating the tenders.


In September 2017, the Senate agreed to an order for the production of documents relating to the future frigate request for tender, for which the government claimed public interest immunity on 7 and 13 September. Advice to the Minister for Defence Industry was that release of the information at that time was not in the public interest, as it may have compromised aspects of the future frigate request for tender evaluation and may have damaged Australia's national security and defence interests and our international relations. I spoke to the Senate in relation to those matters. At the request of the FOI applicant, the FOI decision was further reviewed. Given that the substantive tender evaluation for the Future Frigate Program is now complete and the project is in the offer definition phase, Defence no longer had any objection to the disclosure of unclassified sections of the request for tender concerning Australian industry content. The documents were sent to the applicant by Defence on 25 January 2018.


For the Senate's information, offer definition is a very significant opportunity for Defence to seek refinement of each tenderer's offer to increase certainty and value for money, but it doesn't permit tenderers to, for example, submit a new bid. As such, the release of the request for tender documents at that time is less sensitive. Given that the Future Frigate Program has moved into the offer definition phase, the government will now review the documents sought in the motion agreed to on 6 February 2018 and will table any documents that it is now able to. 


In relation to any other documentation which is also referred to in the order, I would note that the scope of the documents that were originally sought in order for production of documents numbered 449(2)(e) still requires:


(e) any other documentation held by the Future Frigate project that discusses Australian Industry Capability, the partnering or use of Australian shipyards, and how Techport and other Australian facilities might be used in the program.


As I stated previously in my statement to the Senate on 13 September 2017, this is a broad range of documents that, if the government were to comply with the breadth of the order, would require us to release parts of the tender responses themselves—that is, those parts of the tenderers' submitted responses that pertain to Australian industry capability and the partnering or use of Australian shipyards, all of which are held by the Future Frigate project, to use the words of the order. Clearly, the release of sensitive material of that nature could not only adversely affect the tenderers but undermine the integrity of the entire procurement process.


Moreover, the information that is requested—that is, any other documentation held by the Future Frigate project—would include documents that contain sensitive information with regard to Defence's negotiating position in relation to a variety of issues, including Australian industry capability and a negotiating position of the Commonwealth government in respect of any future contract. Frankly, it does stretch credulity that a sensible person in this place would support the government being required to table our negotiating strategy partway through a competitive evaluation process—unless, of course, the outcome they seek to achieve is actually to delay the project. So I remain to be persuaded.


Of course, Defence has already released large portions of the request for tender documents relating to Australian industry capabilities through the FOI process. These are available on the Defence website, and I am happy to table them here in the chamber as part of the return to order. Further, I am always happy to consider any requests, in consultation with my colleagues and in seeking advice from the department, from senators about specific documents that we may be able to release.


The government is committed to absolutely ensuring that the Future Frigate Program delivers the best capability possible for the Royal Australian Navy—that is its absolute priority—while maximising Australian industry content. The frigates will be built in Australia, by Australians, with Australian steel. I reject the notion that the public interest immunity claims on behalf of the government were mistaken or unsustainable. As I've set out, the CEP and tender process is progressing, and with the change from tender evaluation to offer definition phase, as I have indicated, the risk of damage to the process has changed and that allows some additional documents to be released. I do think that it is time that everybody in this chamber got onboard, so to speak, with this important project. It's important for Navy, important for our nation and important for thousands of jobs.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",NXT,2018-02-08,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (09:39):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


I thank the Minister for Defence for her response in relation to this matter, which is very important in terms of both the management of the $35 billion Future Frigate Program and the government's responsiveness or otherwise to Senate orders for production of documents—a key process that supports the Senate's scrutiny of public administration and expenditure.


The broad outline of the minister's explanation was unsurprising, given that Senator McGrath had defended the minister on Tuesday, reaffirming the claim that the release of the documents relating to the Future Frigate Program had been against the public interest last September but that as the tender process has advanced the government will review the documents and make some sections available if appropriate. That was the government's explanation on Tuesday, and the minister has added little of substance today.


Tuesday's Senate motion requiring the minister's explanation was prompted by the defence department's release last week of almost 300 pages of the future frigates tender documentation. Those documents had originally been sought through a freedom of information request application by former Senator Xenophon in May 2017. The defence department flatly refused the request. In August, portions of the future frigates tender documents were leaked to the media. Noting that the leaked documents contained nothing sensitive, the Senate made an order on 4 September for all unclassified portions of the tender documents to be released. Minister Payne refused the Senate's request, claiming public interest immunity. In a written statement to the President of the Senate on 7 December, the minister asserted that the release of any unclassified documents—any documents whatsoever—would damage Australia's national security and defence interests and also our international relations. This was a remarkable claim. Unclassified documents, by definition, do not contain information that if released could damage Australia's national interests. The implication: after just three days of deliberation, the minister effectively claimed that there were absolutely no unclassified documents in existence relating to the future frigates tender process.


Anyone with knowledge of defence procurement would find this a most unlikely state of affairs. Alternatively, one could reasonably conclude that all unclassified documents must have suddenly and arbitrarily been reclassified to justify the minister's refusal to provide information to the Senate—an unacceptable manipulation of protective security processes and procedures. Either way, the minister's claim for public interest immunity over the entirety of the documentation was extremely questionable. The Senate considered Minister Payne's response and, rightly, did not accept it, asking her to make a detailed explanation to the Senate. On 13 September the minister gave that explanation in a 20-minute speech that made claim that the documents could not be released because the tender process was still underway. The minister stood in the Senate and effectively suggested that the sky would fall if these documents were released. She claimed that the release of any information whatsoever would undermine the integrity of the entire process. The minister also spoke at length about national security implications, claiming that the release of any information whatsoever would 'have potential to damage our national security and the defence interests of our international relations'. With that, the Senate was presented with a blanket refusal to provide any relevant documentation—not a single scrap of paper—because the minister claimed that even a single page would destroy the tender process and jeopardise national security.


Successive governments have, of course, claimed public interest immunity in response to Senate orders for production, but this was unquestionably one of the most sweeping. It was also a particularly bold claim given that the documents in question were still subject to a separate FOI process initiated by former Senator Xenophon, a process that's significantly subject to independent review. Notwithstanding the many deficiencies in the current operation of our FOI laws, some 300 pages were eventually released by the defence department, thanks to pressure exerted by the information commissioner of the initial access refusal by Defence.


Confronted with the information of the commissioner's assessment that many of Defence's claims for exemption from release were quite unsustainable, the department folded its cards and surrendered the material. This release, despite the future frigates tender still being underway, shows folly in the minister's argument. That process has not finished yet, and the minister knows it. The fact that the tender process has moved from one phase to another is beside the point, and it was never a valid claim for either the initial blanket refusal of Senator Xenophon's FOI application or the minister's refusal to provide documents to the Senate. The minister's claim that circumstances have now changed since September is quite bogus, nor has the sky fallen in with Defence's release of the documents. What those documents do show is the real reason for the government's refusal to provide relevant information to the Senate.


The one upside of the minister's bogus claim is that it shows how easily a government can make a flawed claim of harm to national security or harm to international relations, threshold criteria for the criminal prosecution of journalists under the new secrecy laws that the government is attempting to have passed through this parliament. As mentioned, part of the tender documents were published by The Advertiser in August last year. Tory Shepherd wrote up the story. Under the proposed laws, Tory could have faced prosecution just for doing her job. Why? It is not because what she published was in any way damaging to national security or international relations but because she had exposed bad policy. The minister had determined for convenience only that the documents were of harm. There can be no starker example of why the proposed secrecy laws should not be passed in their current form.


I will now move to the substance of the documents denied to the Senate. The documents now reluctantly released by the department reveal the fact that, contrary to the claims of both the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Industry, Mr Pyne, Australia's defence industry has been given short shrift in the $35 billion Future Frigate shipbuilding program. The released documents reveal nothing short of a massive policy failure. Australian shipbuilders have been effectively barred from any lead role in the program and the defence department has set Australian industry participation at a measly 50 per cent minimum. It is no surprise that government wished to prevent or at least delay the release of this information.


The tender, read in its totality, makes it very clear that the three overseas tender respondents—BAE of the United Kingdom, Fincantieri of Italy and Navantia of Spain—need to demonstrate that they can come to Australia, carry out a build in a government supplied shipyard, control the workforce and take responsibility for the entire build process. The tender states this:


Tenderers should be aware that the Commonwealth has selected the Tenderers on the basis of their Reference Ship Designs and their ability to undertake the design and build of the Ships. As such, the Commonwealth’s expectation is that the core design work relating to the Ships and the management and supervision of build activities will be undertaken by the successful Tenderer (or its Related Bodies Corporate) and not subcontracted to a third party entity. In particular, while the successful Tenderer may decide to engage a Subcontractor to provide shipbuilding labour resources, the Commonwealth expects the successful Tenderer (or its Related Bodies Corporate) to personally and directly manage and supervise the workforce and, in particular, the shipbuilding activities.


This is nothing short of a stab in the back for Australian shipbuilders. In effect, ASC and Austal have been excluded from the role of shipbuilder in that program. Instead, the government has invited a foreign ship designer into the country and will provide them with a taxpayer funded shipyard to build the future frigates. ASC and Austal may be the subcontractors but they will not be the shipbuilders, and the successful foreign tenderer will eventually go on to compete with those Aussie companies.


Contrary to the government's announced intention to push defence exports, statements in the tender and the intellectual property terms also make it clear that building a shipbuilding export capability is not part of Defence's game plan. On evidence provided to a Senate committee on the future of Australia's naval shipbuilding industry last September, this approach will cost Australia many thousands of export related jobs. The approach revealed in the tender documents is consistent, however, with Defence's view in their export strategy paper that defines Australian business as 'a business with an ABN'. You can't define an Australian company as one that turned up and registered for an ABN. We need to recognise and support those Australian companies that have been here for years, companies that have invested locally, employed Australians and skilled those Australians, and that are developing their own products and intellectual property. ASC and Austal are both in that category.


The tender documents also reveal that the federal government has set Australian industry participation for the Future Frigate Program at a minimum of only 50 per cent. I quote from the tender. It says:


The Air Warfare Destroyer Program has achieved Australian contract expenditure in the order of 50% across the whole Program. While the Commonwealth acknowledges there are significant differences between the Air Warfare Destroyer Program and this Project, the Commonwealth expects that this Project will achieve the same or higher level of Australian contract expenditure.


Defence industry minister Pyne is certainly the 'Incredible Shrinking Man' when it comes to Australian industry participation in major Defence projects. First he was the '90 Per Cent Man', then he was the '60 Per Cent Man' and now he's down to the '50 Per Cent Man'. But what's more important than the defence industry minister's ever-diminishing credibility is the shrinking opportunity for Australian companies and jobs.


There is still opportunity to fix this mess. The contract contains clauses that allow for the tender to be amended. It says:


The Commonwealth may amend this RFT upon giving Tenderers timely written notice of an amendment. If the Commonwealth amends this RFT under this clause 1.4.1 after tenders have been submitted, it may seek amended tenders.


That is what the government should be doing right now. They should recognise their failure to maximise Australian industry participation and amend the tender to allow Australian shipbuilders ASC and Austal to take full responsibility for the build and for the minimum Australian industry participation percentage to be significantly increased. Such a decision is unlikely to come from the 'Minister of Diminishing Returns', Minister Pyne. What is required is a cabinet-level decision, led by the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, who waltzed into Adelaide a few days ago for a photo opportunity with the state Liberal opposition. It would be much more useful if he returned and spent some time at the ASC facility at Osborne and announced a major boost to the required levels of Australian participation in the Future Frigate Program.


Meanwhile, the government should not be playing games of political obstruction and attempting to withhold information from the Senate on bogus national security grounds. Senate orders for the production of documents are a vital part of the Senate's scrutiny of the administration and expenditure of taxpayers' money. In this case, the documents in question relate to a $35 billion project. It doesn't get much bigger than that. The minister's response to the original order for the production of documents and her dubious explanations, then and now, come close to a contempt of the Senate in its legitimate scrutiny function. I'm sure the minister knows better and I have no doubt she would complain bitterly if she encountered similar obstructions from another government.


Madam Deputy President, with your indulgence, I direct this to you. This is the second time a defence minister has denied access to documents the subject of a Senate order for production that went on to be released under FOI. In the 44th Parliament, the defence minister, not Minister Payne in this instance, refused access to a Macroeconomics report on the benefits of conducting the Future Submarine build in Australia rather than overseas. It was only released to the Senate after the Information Commissioner had determined that Defence's claims to exemptions under FOI were flawed. Madam Deputy President, I am simply flagging something that you might turn your mind to. In the meantime, as I foreshadowed in my first speech and on other occasions, the responsiveness of the government to Senate orders for the production of documents is one of the things that I and my NXT colleagues regard as demonstrating the government's preparedness to deal in good faith with the Senate crossbench. Openness and transparency are vital foundations for successful negotiations and mutually beneficial outcomes that advance the public good. Obstruction and obfuscation will do the government no good at all.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (09:54):  I too rise to take note of the minister's statement in response to the order this morning. I want to say at the outset that this is the work of the Senate at its best. Scrutiny of the government by the opposition and the crossbench parties is at the heart of good government, I would say, and Senator Carr, Senator Patrick and former Senator Xenophon have led what is actually an extraordinary pursuit of the production of documents which go to the heart of the integrity of this government and a $35 billion expenditure of taxpayers' money. And there should be scrutiny of that level of expenditure.


There is concern in South Australia, amongst small to medium enterprises and larger enterprises, about the government's bona fides as to Australian content, and rightly so. I mean, this is the government that walked away from motor vehicle manufacturing in our state and, basically, exhorted them to cease operation and shoot through. There was a proposition at one time to buy off the shelf—to not have, particularly in this area of submarines, any Australian content or any Australian involvement.


We have all seen, in estimates, that departments regularly use the public interest immunity argument to cloud or not clarify the most mundane questions; in fact, it seems to be a public service trait that's developing more and more under this government—that you simply claim public interest immunity, commercial-in-confidence, security or whatever just to avoid answering the most simple questions. Senator Carr said, in his contribution, in regard to the minister's proposition that the Senate asked for the disclosure of particular commercial-in-confidence details, that that was simply not true, and the minister has sought to assert that proposition, but what this return to order actually asked, if the government thinks that, is: how are you going to be able to produce capability documents later this year, which public servants have said they will be able to produce, when you can't tell us at the moment what 'sovereignty' actually means?


We know that there have been propositions of up to 90 per cent of Australian content, and, as Senator Patrick has said, that has diminished under Minister Pyne to 60 per cent, and now, though he has said 60 per cent, we see a document with 50 in it. We know that there are large, successful organisations. Austal certainly are—they actually compete and win, and build ships for the US Navy, and I think their CEO told me that they're the only one since the Civil War that has actually been able to do that. So they are a large, successful entity. They are Australian. But they're not at the forefront of this process; they're down the queue a bit.


We know that ASC, after years of hard work, has achieved—even under the government's assessment now—world's best practice in shipbuilding. I well remember, under Senator Johnston, the audit that came out that actually said the workforce at ASC could not be criticised for a lack of productivity. It was because Navantia and the designers had put up plans which meant that, in the words of the audit's authors, the workers had to do the job once, twice and sometimes three times. So to criticise the workers' productivity was absolutely disgraceful, because it was in the design and the foreign planning of all of that that the lack of productivity was evidenced.


So it appears as if there is a contest—and rightly so. There should be a contest. On our side we want clarity, transparency and maximum Australian involvement in all facets of this $35 billion spend—in all facets. Every small to medium enterprise in the country should get a guernsey in competing for this work. Every large enterprise that is competent and in this space that is Australian owned should get a guernsey in this $35 billion. But that's not what we have. What we have is the dry economic rationalists in this government, who didn't want to have Australian involvement at all, pushing parameters around so that, they figure, they might keep costs down. I'm not convinced about that. I'm not convinced that a sovereign capability, an indigenous capability, in Australia won't deliver the best outcome. I'm not convinced that we don't have the wherewithal in Australia to design, build and do great things in manufacturing. I'm certain that Senator Carr would be much more eloquent than me on this point. We actually do believe that we can make things well. We can use Australian products. We may have a design capability shortfall at the moment, but there's no shortage of intelligence and brains in our universities to go on and develop that space.


But what we have here is a minister who said the world would fall down if we knew what was in that document and who now says: 'Okay, we've moved a bit further down the path on tendering. It's okay to release that.' But, from the documentation, it looks like her own department didn't agree with her. On referral, they checked it and said, 'We should release this,' and 200-plus pages were released. So is there a contest on that side of the chamber between Minister Pyne and Minister Payne? Is there a willing, cooperative working relationship there or not? Yesterday in question time, my question to the minister was: 'Is it 60 per cent or 50 per cent? Which is right: the tender document or Minister Pyne?' And where are these percentages coming from? Is anybody able to sit down and put a factual, fiscal, evidentiary base under what will actually drive the Australian content argument?


I think every dollar in this $35 billion should be tested against a competitive process to maximise Australian dollar involvement. And, if it comes out that we can't do it for the achievable price, then that's an appropriate decision that a government would make. But there's no clarity on that. There's no process for testing it. How do small, medium or large enterprises actually know, when there is this arbitrary figure plucked out of the air and put into tender documents? Where is the evidentiary base for that?


There are people who say that the former secretary of Defence was all for outsourcing and buying off the shelf and that the ministers have been dragged into building locally for electoral reasons, particularly in South Australia—and it may be that Minister Pyne's own seat depended on the fact that we built submarines in South Australia. As the major factional leader, it may be that all of his flock in South Australia were under the pump electorally. He was able to convince the government to build locally, and we welcome that. It's a great decision to invest in manufacturing in every state in Australia, particularly in South Australia. We know, with the nature of exactly-on-time logistics and manufacturing chains, that there probably won't be an electorate in Australia that doesn't get a benefit out of this $35 billion.


But the average Australian voter understands maximising Australian content. They don't like or don't see how a government in a tender process can pick a figure out of the air—Minister Pyne will tell us 60 per cent, the tender says 50 per cent, and you've got industry professionals saying they put in at 90 per cent. Is this just a simple economic rationalist contest on that side of the chamber? Are Minister Pyne and Minister Payne fighting? Are the Treasurer, Minister Morrison, or the Prime Minister, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, putting some arbitrary criteria in here? Or are we simply going to do what we should be doing, which is building sovereign, indigenous capability and having manufacturing sustained into decades in places where we sorely need it? That's the objective that everybody talks about. But, when, through this process, you find the detail of the tender documents, it appears as if people are making interesting arbitrary decisions about Australian content.


I think that this is, as I started to say at the outset, exceptionally good work of the Senate. This is proper Senate work and proper scrutiny of a government and an extraordinarily large procurement decision into the next few decades. We all want, and I presume those on the other side want, maximum Australian involvement. It would be counterintuitive to believe otherwise. But they're not, in an evidentiary way, proving that. The simple fact is: this minister—as Senator Patrick has said and as Senator Xenophon has said—and, I will go as far as to say, the previous ministers have been obtuse, recalcitrant and not open and transparent with the Australian public or the Australian Senate, and that's not good government. That is not good government. If their argument stacks up financially, fiscally, then everybody with an ear or an eye will look at it, read it, absorb it, test it against common sense and/or the marketplace and they will probably win the argument. But they're not even mounting the argument; they're hiding behind public interest immunity, commercial-in-confidence, security issues. I have to say, as the Chair of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, that's an argument I've heard a hundred times at estimates. You hear it all the times in inquiries. Public servants are well skilled at hiding the true motivation of their ministers and, in a lot of cases, the department. That needs to change.


I do welcome Senator Patrick's call that the President or the Deputy President actually look at the performance of ministers who, in an evidentiary way, subsequently appear to have failed a public interest immunity test, because if their own department is saying it's okay to let this stuff go then we need actually to test why the minister didn't accept that at the first call.


So with those few words I would like to finish by saying: I can speak for South Australia; the maximum amount of Australian content is a burning issue given the treatment of the manufacturing industry in that state. You have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebuild out of the destruction you caused in motor vehicle manufacturing, the demise of that. So let us get this right. Let's get a really high bar on Australian content—not 50 per cent or some arbitrary figure; let's get our real industry capability assessed and let's get, if we can, 100 per cent Australian capability. If we can't, let's work out what we don't do well, what we can't do efficiently, and contract it out—fine; everybody accepts that. We do some things really well, but we've got a chance here to build, into the future, sovereign capability and indigenous capability in all facets of this project. We shouldn't, at the start of $35 billion worth of expense, say we're only going to do 50 per cent of that.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (10:07):  This morning I rise to share the concerns of Western Australian industry in relation to the complete lack of transparency provided by the government in relation to local content. We know that there are grave fears that Western Australia could be missing out on billions of dollars of work under this significant contract, and that is because foreign bidders have not been required to partner with Australian industry. We know that the tender documents for the $35 billion frigate program showed that short-listed foreign defence companies did not have to include Australian businesses in their proposals. We've heard significant concerns reported in TheWest Australian after conversations with Austal. Austal partnered with the ASC, which is, of course, the government's own defence shipbuilding contractor, to get a major share of the future frigate contracts. But these contracts—indeed, the nature of the tender process—is threatening the viability of this industry and export industries and thousands of jobs that Western Australia desperately needs.


We are very well skilled and ready to do this kind of work. We've had a major construction and mining boom, and the people of Western Australia have the skills. We also have high levels of unemployment in these regions. We are ready to do this work. We have significant infrastructure in Henderson, which means we're well placed, and the companies have the expertise, to do it. The simple fact is that the government are not even living up to their weasel words and rhetoric around local content. Austal's Chief Executive Officer, David Singleton, said, 'When the RFT—request for tender—came out, that was really the end of that engagement between us and those companies'—the companies bidding on the tender. He said at the time, 'There was something about the RFT that seemed to draw foreign shipbuilders away from continuing dialogue with ourselves.' 


So it strikes me that there is good reason for the Senate to be concerned about the failure to produce all of these documents. We know that there were three companies bidding in this process. The government needs to be focused on choosing homegrown, world-class, steel shipbuilding industries here in Australia. I contend that Western Australia, as well as South Australia, will get a raw deal if the federal government is not fair and transparent and does not make good on its local content provisions. 


Question agreed to.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2018-02-08,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (09:32):  The Future Frigate Program, which is the subject of this discussion, is currently undertaking a competitive evaluation process, a CEP, to select a designer/builder to deliver nine antisubmarine warfare frigates to the Royal Australian Navy and set the foundation of the Turnbull government's continuous shipbuilding plan in Australia. These are ships which will provide the Navy with critical capability that will underpin the defence of Australia into the future. The CEP is on track for the government to make a decision on the successful tenderer before the middle of 2018, enabling steel to be cut on the future frigates in 2020, creating over 2,000 shipbuilding jobs and in conformity with the government's previous commitments on this matter.


In relation to the order that was agreed by the Senate on 6 February 2018, I would like to make some remarks and address some of the incorrect claims made in the preamble to the order. On 3 May 2017, then Senator Xenophon submitted a freedom of information request for documents which related to Australian industry content in the future frigate request for tender. At the time, Defence originally declined access to four documents identified as matching the scope of the FOI request on the grounds that, at the time, the procurement was at a very sensitive stage of the competitive evaluation process. At the time of the initial request, tenderers were in the tender preparation phase of the CEP. When the decision was considered again by the department, the department was evaluating the tenders.


In September 2017, the Senate agreed to an order for the production of documents relating to the future frigate request for tender, for which the government claimed public interest immunity on 7 and 13 September. Advice to the Minister for Defence Industry was that release of the information at that time was not in the public interest, as it may have compromised aspects of the future frigate request for tender evaluation and may have damaged Australia's national security and defence interests and our international relations. I spoke to the Senate in relation to those matters. At the request of the FOI applicant, the FOI decision was further reviewed. Given that the substantive tender evaluation for the Future Frigate Program is now complete and the project is in the offer definition phase, Defence no longer had any objection to the disclosure of unclassified sections of the request for tender concerning Australian industry content. The documents were sent to the applicant by Defence on 25 January 2018.


For the Senate's information, offer definition is a very significant opportunity for Defence to seek refinement of each tenderer's offer to increase certainty and value for money, but it doesn't permit tenderers to, for example, submit a new bid. As such, the release of the request for tender documents at that time is less sensitive. Given that the Future Frigate Program has moved into the offer definition phase, the government will now review the documents sought in the motion agreed to on 6 February 2018 and will table any documents that it is now able to. 


In relation to any other documentation which is also referred to in the order, I would note that the scope of the documents that were originally sought in order for production of documents numbered 449(2)(e) still requires:


(e) any other documentation held by the Future Frigate project that discusses Australian Industry Capability, the partnering or use of Australian shipyards, and how Techport and other Australian facilities might be used in the program.


As I stated previously in my statement to the Senate on 13 September 2017, this is a broad range of documents that, if the government were to comply with the breadth of the order, would require us to release parts of the tender responses themselves—that is, those parts of the tenderers' submitted responses that pertain to Australian industry capability and the partnering or use of Australian shipyards, all of which are held by the Future Frigate project, to use the words of the order. Clearly, the release of sensitive material of that nature could not only adversely affect the tenderers but undermine the integrity of the entire procurement process.


Moreover, the information that is requested—that is, any other documentation held by the Future Frigate project—would include documents that contain sensitive information with regard to Defence's negotiating position in relation to a variety of issues, including Australian industry capability and a negotiating position of the Commonwealth government in respect of any future contract. Frankly, it does stretch credulity that a sensible person in this place would support the government being required to table our negotiating strategy partway through a competitive evaluation process—unless, of course, the outcome they seek to achieve is actually to delay the project. So I remain to be persuaded.


Of course, Defence has already released large portions of the request for tender documents relating to Australian industry capabilities through the FOI process. These are available on the Defence website, and I am happy to table them here in the chamber as part of the return to order. Further, I am always happy to consider any requests, in consultation with my colleagues and in seeking advice from the department, from senators about specific documents that we may be able to release.


The government is committed to absolutely ensuring that the Future Frigate Program delivers the best capability possible for the Royal Australian Navy—that is its absolute priority—while maximising Australian industry content. The frigates will be built in Australia, by Australians, with Australian steel. I reject the notion that the public interest immunity claims on behalf of the government were mistaken or unsustainable. As I've set out, the CEP and tender process is progressing, and with the change from tender evaluation to offer definition phase, as I have indicated, the risk of damage to the process has changed and that allows some additional documents to be released. I do think that it is time that everybody in this chamber got onboard, so to speak, with this important project. It's important for Navy, important for our nation and important for thousands of jobs.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (09:39):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


I thank the Minister for Defence for her response in relation to this matter, which is very important in terms of both the management of the $35 billion Future Frigate Program and the government's responsiveness or otherwise to Senate orders for production of documents—a key process that supports the Senate's scrutiny of public administration and expenditure.


The broad outline of the minister's explanation was unsurprising, given that Senator McGrath had defended the minister on Tuesday, reaffirming the claim that the release of the documents relating to the Future Frigate Program had been against the public interest last September but that as the tender process has advanced the government will review the documents and make some sections available if appropriate. That was the government's explanation on Tuesday, and the minister has added little of substance today.


Tuesday's Senate motion requiring the minister's explanation was prompted by the defence department's release last week of almost 300 pages of the future frigates tender documentation. Those documents had originally been sought through a freedom of information request application by former Senator Xenophon in May 2017. The defence department flatly refused the request. In August, portions of the future frigates tender documents were leaked to the media. Noting that the leaked documents contained nothing sensitive, the Senate made an order on 4 September for all unclassified portions of the tender documents to be released. Minister Payne refused the Senate's request, claiming public interest immunity. In a written statement to the President of the Senate on 7 December, the minister asserted that the release of any unclassified documents—any documents whatsoever—would damage Australia's national security and defence interests and also our international relations. This was a remarkable claim. Unclassified documents, by definition, do not contain information that if released could damage Australia's national interests. The implication: after just three days of deliberation, the minister effectively claimed that there were absolutely no unclassified documents in existence relating to the future frigates tender process.


Anyone with knowledge of defence procurement would find this a most unlikely state of affairs. Alternatively, one could reasonably conclude that all unclassified documents must have suddenly and arbitrarily been reclassified to justify the minister's refusal to provide information to the Senate—an unacceptable manipulation of protective security processes and procedures. Either way, the minister's claim for public interest immunity over the entirety of the documentation was extremely questionable. The Senate considered Minister Payne's response and, rightly, did not accept it, asking her to make a detailed explanation to the Senate. On 13 September the minister gave that explanation in a 20-minute speech that made claim that the documents could not be released because the tender process was still underway. The minister stood in the Senate and effectively suggested that the sky would fall if these documents were released. She claimed that the release of any information whatsoever would undermine the integrity of the entire process. The minister also spoke at length about national security implications, claiming that the release of any information whatsoever would 'have potential to damage our national security and the defence interests of our international relations'. With that, the Senate was presented with a blanket refusal to provide any relevant documentation—not a single scrap of paper—because the minister claimed that even a single page would destroy the tender process and jeopardise national security.


Successive governments have, of course, claimed public interest immunity in response to Senate orders for production, but this was unquestionably one of the most sweeping. It was also a particularly bold claim given that the documents in question were still subject to a separate FOI process initiated by former Senator Xenophon, a process that's significantly subject to independent review. Notwithstanding the many deficiencies in the current operation of our FOI laws, some 300 pages were eventually released by the defence department, thanks to pressure exerted by the information commissioner of the initial access refusal by Defence.


Confronted with the information of the commissioner's assessment that many of Defence's claims for exemption from release were quite unsustainable, the department folded its cards and surrendered the material. This release, despite the future frigates tender still being underway, shows folly in the minister's argument. That process has not finished yet, and the minister knows it. The fact that the tender process has moved from one phase to another is beside the point, and it was never a valid claim for either the initial blanket refusal of Senator Xenophon's FOI application or the minister's refusal to provide documents to the Senate. The minister's claim that circumstances have now changed since September is quite bogus, nor has the sky fallen in with Defence's release of the documents. What those documents do show is the real reason for the government's refusal to provide relevant information to the Senate.


The one upside of the minister's bogus claim is that it shows how easily a government can make a flawed claim of harm to national security or harm to international relations, threshold criteria for the criminal prosecution of journalists under the new secrecy laws that the government is attempting to have passed through this parliament. As mentioned, part of the tender documents were published by The Advertiser in August last year. Tory Shepherd wrote up the story. Under the proposed laws, Tory could have faced prosecution just for doing her job. Why? It is not because what she published was in any way damaging to national security or international relations but because she had exposed bad policy. The minister had determined for convenience only that the documents were of harm. There can be no starker example of why the proposed secrecy laws should not be passed in their current form.


I will now move to the substance of the documents denied to the Senate. The documents now reluctantly released by the department reveal the fact that, contrary to the claims of both the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Industry, Mr Pyne, Australia's defence industry has been given short shrift in the $35 billion Future Frigate shipbuilding program. The released documents reveal nothing short of a massive policy failure. Australian shipbuilders have been effectively barred from any lead role in the program and the defence department has set Australian industry participation at a measly 50 per cent minimum. It is no surprise that government wished to prevent or at least delay the release of this information.


The tender, read in its totality, makes it very clear that the three overseas tender respondents—BAE of the United Kingdom, Fincantieri of Italy and Navantia of Spain—need to demonstrate that they can come to Australia, carry out a build in a government supplied shipyard, control the workforce and take responsibility for the entire build process. The tender states this:


Tenderers should be aware that the Commonwealth has selected the Tenderers on the basis of their Reference Ship Designs and their ability to undertake the design and build of the Ships. As such, the Commonwealth’s expectation is that the core design work relating to the Ships and the management and supervision of build activities will be undertaken by the successful Tenderer (or its Related Bodies Corporate) and not subcontracted to a third party entity. In particular, while the successful Tenderer may decide to engage a Subcontractor to provide shipbuilding labour resources, the Commonwealth expects the successful Tenderer (or its Related Bodies Corporate) to personally and directly manage and supervise the workforce and, in particular, the shipbuilding activities.


This is nothing short of a stab in the back for Australian shipbuilders. In effect, ASC and Austal have been excluded from the role of shipbuilder in that program. Instead, the government has invited a foreign ship designer into the country and will provide them with a taxpayer funded shipyard to build the future frigates. ASC and Austal may be the subcontractors but they will not be the shipbuilders, and the successful foreign tenderer will eventually go on to compete with those Aussie companies.


Contrary to the government's announced intention to push defence exports, statements in the tender and the intellectual property terms also make it clear that building a shipbuilding export capability is not part of Defence's game plan. On evidence provided to a Senate committee on the future of Australia's naval shipbuilding industry last September, this approach will cost Australia many thousands of export related jobs. The approach revealed in the tender documents is consistent, however, with Defence's view in their export strategy paper that defines Australian business as 'a business with an ABN'. You can't define an Australian company as one that turned up and registered for an ABN. We need to recognise and support those Australian companies that have been here for years, companies that have invested locally, employed Australians and skilled those Australians, and that are developing their own products and intellectual property. ASC and Austal are both in that category.


The tender documents also reveal that the federal government has set Australian industry participation for the Future Frigate Program at a minimum of only 50 per cent. I quote from the tender. It says:


The Air Warfare Destroyer Program has achieved Australian contract expenditure in the order of 50% across the whole Program. While the Commonwealth acknowledges there are significant differences between the Air Warfare Destroyer Program and this Project, the Commonwealth expects that this Project will achieve the same or higher level of Australian contract expenditure.


Defence industry minister Pyne is certainly the 'Incredible Shrinking Man' when it comes to Australian industry participation in major Defence projects. First he was the '90 Per Cent Man', then he was the '60 Per Cent Man' and now he's down to the '50 Per Cent Man'. But what's more important than the defence industry minister's ever-diminishing credibility is the shrinking opportunity for Australian companies and jobs.


There is still opportunity to fix this mess. The contract contains clauses that allow for the tender to be amended. It says:


The Commonwealth may amend this RFT upon giving Tenderers timely written notice of an amendment. If the Commonwealth amends this RFT under this clause 1.4.1 after tenders have been submitted, it may seek amended tenders.


That is what the government should be doing right now. They should recognise their failure to maximise Australian industry participation and amend the tender to allow Australian shipbuilders ASC and Austal to take full responsibility for the build and for the minimum Australian industry participation percentage to be significantly increased. Such a decision is unlikely to come from the 'Minister of Diminishing Returns', Minister Pyne. What is required is a cabinet-level decision, led by the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, who waltzed into Adelaide a few days ago for a photo opportunity with the state Liberal opposition. It would be much more useful if he returned and spent some time at the ASC facility at Osborne and announced a major boost to the required levels of Australian participation in the Future Frigate Program.


Meanwhile, the government should not be playing games of political obstruction and attempting to withhold information from the Senate on bogus national security grounds. Senate orders for the production of documents are a vital part of the Senate's scrutiny of the administration and expenditure of taxpayers' money. In this case, the documents in question relate to a $35 billion project. It doesn't get much bigger than that. The minister's response to the original order for the production of documents and her dubious explanations, then and now, come close to a contempt of the Senate in its legitimate scrutiny function. I'm sure the minister knows better and I have no doubt she would complain bitterly if she encountered similar obstructions from another government.


Madam Deputy President, with your indulgence, I direct this to you. This is the second time a defence minister has denied access to documents the subject of a Senate order for production that went on to be released under FOI. In the 44th Parliament, the defence minister, not Minister Payne in this instance, refused access to a Macroeconomics report on the benefits of conducting the Future Submarine build in Australia rather than overseas. It was only released to the Senate after the Information Commissioner had determined that Defence's claims to exemptions under FOI were flawed. Madam Deputy President, I am simply flagging something that you might turn your mind to. In the meantime, as I foreshadowed in my first speech and on other occasions, the responsiveness of the government to Senate orders for the production of documents is one of the things that I and my NXT colleagues regard as demonstrating the government's preparedness to deal in good faith with the Senate crossbench. Openness and transparency are vital foundations for successful negotiations and mutually beneficial outcomes that advance the public good. Obstruction and obfuscation will do the government no good at all.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (09:54):  I too rise to take note of the minister's statement in response to the order this morning. I want to say at the outset that this is the work of the Senate at its best. Scrutiny of the government by the opposition and the crossbench parties is at the heart of good government, I would say, and Senator Carr, Senator Patrick and former Senator Xenophon have led what is actually an extraordinary pursuit of the production of documents which go to the heart of the integrity of this government and a $35 billion expenditure of taxpayers' money. And there should be scrutiny of that level of expenditure.


There is concern in South Australia, amongst small to medium enterprises and larger enterprises, about the government's bona fides as to Australian content, and rightly so. I mean, this is the government that walked away from motor vehicle manufacturing in our state and, basically, exhorted them to cease operation and shoot through. There was a proposition at one time to buy off the shelf—to not have, particularly in this area of submarines, any Australian content or any Australian involvement.


We have all seen, in estimates, that departments regularly use the public interest immunity argument to cloud or not clarify the most mundane questions; in fact, it seems to be a public service trait that's developing more and more under this government—that you simply claim public interest immunity, commercial-in-confidence, security or whatever just to avoid answering the most simple questions. Senator Carr said, in his contribution, in regard to the minister's proposition that the Senate asked for the disclosure of particular commercial-in-confidence details, that that was simply not true, and the minister has sought to assert that proposition, but what this return to order actually asked, if the government thinks that, is: how are you going to be able to produce capability documents later this year, which public servants have said they will be able to produce, when you can't tell us at the moment what 'sovereignty' actually means?


We know that there have been propositions of up to 90 per cent of Australian content, and, as Senator Patrick has said, that has diminished under Minister Pyne to 60 per cent, and now, though he has said 60 per cent, we see a document with 50 in it. We know that there are large, successful organisations. Austal certainly are—they actually compete and win, and build ships for the US Navy, and I think their CEO told me that they're the only one since the Civil War that has actually been able to do that. So they are a large, successful entity. They are Australian. But they're not at the forefront of this process; they're down the queue a bit.


We know that ASC, after years of hard work, has achieved—even under the government's assessment now—world's best practice in shipbuilding. I well remember, under Senator Johnston, the audit that came out that actually said the workforce at ASC could not be criticised for a lack of productivity. It was because Navantia and the designers had put up plans which meant that, in the words of the audit's authors, the workers had to do the job once, twice and sometimes three times. So to criticise the workers' productivity was absolutely disgraceful, because it was in the design and the foreign planning of all of that that the lack of productivity was evidenced.


So it appears as if there is a contest—and rightly so. There should be a contest. On our side we want clarity, transparency and maximum Australian involvement in all facets of this $35 billion spend—in all facets. Every small to medium enterprise in the country should get a guernsey in competing for this work. Every large enterprise that is competent and in this space that is Australian owned should get a guernsey in this $35 billion. But that's not what we have. What we have is the dry economic rationalists in this government, who didn't want to have Australian involvement at all, pushing parameters around so that, they figure, they might keep costs down. I'm not convinced about that. I'm not convinced that a sovereign capability, an indigenous capability, in Australia won't deliver the best outcome. I'm not convinced that we don't have the wherewithal in Australia to design, build and do great things in manufacturing. I'm certain that Senator Carr would be much more eloquent than me on this point. We actually do believe that we can make things well. We can use Australian products. We may have a design capability shortfall at the moment, but there's no shortage of intelligence and brains in our universities to go on and develop that space.


But what we have here is a minister who said the world would fall down if we knew what was in that document and who now says: 'Okay, we've moved a bit further down the path on tendering. It's okay to release that.' But, from the documentation, it looks like her own department didn't agree with her. On referral, they checked it and said, 'We should release this,' and 200-plus pages were released. So is there a contest on that side of the chamber between Minister Pyne and Minister Payne? Is there a willing, cooperative working relationship there or not? Yesterday in question time, my question to the minister was: 'Is it 60 per cent or 50 per cent? Which is right: the tender document or Minister Pyne?' And where are these percentages coming from? Is anybody able to sit down and put a factual, fiscal, evidentiary base under what will actually drive the Australian content argument?


I think every dollar in this $35 billion should be tested against a competitive process to maximise Australian dollar involvement. And, if it comes out that we can't do it for the achievable price, then that's an appropriate decision that a government would make. But there's no clarity on that. There's no process for testing it. How do small, medium or large enterprises actually know, when there is this arbitrary figure plucked out of the air and put into tender documents? Where is the evidentiary base for that?


There are people who say that the former secretary of Defence was all for outsourcing and buying off the shelf and that the ministers have been dragged into building locally for electoral reasons, particularly in South Australia—and it may be that Minister Pyne's own seat depended on the fact that we built submarines in South Australia. As the major factional leader, it may be that all of his flock in South Australia were under the pump electorally. He was able to convince the government to build locally, and we welcome that. It's a great decision to invest in manufacturing in every state in Australia, particularly in South Australia. We know, with the nature of exactly-on-time logistics and manufacturing chains, that there probably won't be an electorate in Australia that doesn't get a benefit out of this $35 billion.


But the average Australian voter understands maximising Australian content. They don't like or don't see how a government in a tender process can pick a figure out of the air—Minister Pyne will tell us 60 per cent, the tender says 50 per cent, and you've got industry professionals saying they put in at 90 per cent. Is this just a simple economic rationalist contest on that side of the chamber? Are Minister Pyne and Minister Payne fighting? Are the Treasurer, Minister Morrison, or the Prime Minister, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, putting some arbitrary criteria in here? Or are we simply going to do what we should be doing, which is building sovereign, indigenous capability and having manufacturing sustained into decades in places where we sorely need it? That's the objective that everybody talks about. But, when, through this process, you find the detail of the tender documents, it appears as if people are making interesting arbitrary decisions about Australian content.


I think that this is, as I started to say at the outset, exceptionally good work of the Senate. This is proper Senate work and proper scrutiny of a government and an extraordinarily large procurement decision into the next few decades. We all want, and I presume those on the other side want, maximum Australian involvement. It would be counterintuitive to believe otherwise. But they're not, in an evidentiary way, proving that. The simple fact is: this minister—as Senator Patrick has said and as Senator Xenophon has said—and, I will go as far as to say, the previous ministers have been obtuse, recalcitrant and not open and transparent with the Australian public or the Australian Senate, and that's not good government. That is not good government. If their argument stacks up financially, fiscally, then everybody with an ear or an eye will look at it, read it, absorb it, test it against common sense and/or the marketplace and they will probably win the argument. But they're not even mounting the argument; they're hiding behind public interest immunity, commercial-in-confidence, security issues. I have to say, as the Chair of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, that's an argument I've heard a hundred times at estimates. You hear it all the times in inquiries. Public servants are well skilled at hiding the true motivation of their ministers and, in a lot of cases, the department. That needs to change.


I do welcome Senator Patrick's call that the President or the Deputy President actually look at the performance of ministers who, in an evidentiary way, subsequently appear to have failed a public interest immunity test, because if their own department is saying it's okay to let this stuff go then we need actually to test why the minister didn't accept that at the first call.


So with those few words I would like to finish by saying: I can speak for South Australia; the maximum amount of Australian content is a burning issue given the treatment of the manufacturing industry in that state. You have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to rebuild out of the destruction you caused in motor vehicle manufacturing, the demise of that. So let us get this right. Let's get a really high bar on Australian content—not 50 per cent or some arbitrary figure; let's get our real industry capability assessed and let's get, if we can, 100 per cent Australian capability. If we can't, let's work out what we don't do well, what we can't do efficiently, and contract it out—fine; everybody accepts that. We do some things really well, but we've got a chance here to build, into the future, sovereign capability and indigenous capability in all facets of this project. We shouldn't, at the start of $35 billion worth of expense, say we're only going to do 50 per cent of that.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (10:07):  This morning I rise to share the concerns of Western Australian industry in relation to the complete lack of transparency provided by the government in relation to local content. We know that there are grave fears that Western Australia could be missing out on billions of dollars of work under this significant contract, and that is because foreign bidders have not been required to partner with Australian industry. We know that the tender documents for the $35 billion frigate program showed that short-listed foreign defence companies did not have to include Australian businesses in their proposals. We've heard significant concerns reported in TheWest Australian after conversations with Austal. Austal partnered with the ASC, which is, of course, the government's own defence shipbuilding contractor, to get a major share of the future frigate contracts. But these contracts—indeed, the nature of the tender process—is threatening the viability of this industry and export industries and thousands of jobs that Western Australia desperately needs.


We are very well skilled and ready to do this kind of work. We've had a major construction and mining boom, and the people of Western Australia have the skills. We also have high levels of unemployment in these regions. We are ready to do this work. We have significant infrastructure in Henderson, which means we're well placed, and the companies have the expertise, to do it. The simple fact is that the government are not even living up to their weasel words and rhetoric around local content. Austal's Chief Executive Officer, David Singleton, said, 'When the RFT—request for tender—came out, that was really the end of that engagement between us and those companies'—the companies bidding on the tender. He said at the time, 'There was something about the RFT that seemed to draw foreign shipbuilders away from continuing dialogue with ourselves.' 


So it strikes me that there is good reason for the Senate to be concerned about the failure to produce all of these documents. We know that there were three companies bidding in this process. The government needs to be focused on choosing homegrown, world-class, steel shipbuilding industries here in Australia. I contend that Western Australia, as well as South Australia, will get a raw deal if the federal government is not fair and transparent and does not make good on its local content provisions. 


Question agreed to.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:12):  I move:


That the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area) Amendment Determination (No. 2) 2017, made under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, be disallowed [F2017L01170].


I know some people in this place will think this is groundhog day, 'Here she is again, talking about trying to disallow these awful trials.' I make absolutely no apology for making you all debate this disallowance. I will continue to do so while this awful legislation exists and while these trials continue. I will bring this issue back again and again and again. 


So we're clear, this is to disallow the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area) Amendment Determination (No. 2) 2017. This determination amends the Ceduna and East Kimberley determinations to extend both of the cashless welfare card trials, in the East Kimberley, predominantly centred on Kununurra and Wyndham, and in Ceduna. It extends the Ceduna determination until 14 March this year and the East Kimberley determination until 25 April 2018. I will note that the next debate we enter into after this will be on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017 and the government's desire to continue to roll out the cashless welfare card. 


This instrument was made on 11 September 2017 and registered on 13 September 2017, one day before the Ceduna and surrounding region determination was in fact due to cease. So there are a lot of people on this card thinking, 'Finally, we're going to get off it,' and then, bang, the legislative instrument comes in and furthers the trial. 


As anticipated, the trials and the subsequent extensions—supported by both this government and the opposition—have turned out to be a rubber stamp on income support, based on reports and evaluations spruiked with premature evidence, anecdotes and ideology. That's what these are based on: anecdotes and ideology. Because if it wasn't, the government and the opposition would not have (a) initiated this program and (b), in the case of the opposition, supported it. The evidence from the Northern Territory is overwhelmingly clear: income management failed. It met none of its objectives. I bet most people in this chamber have not bothered ever to go and look at that final evaluation. It's a very thick report. If you're time-poor, as we all are, go and read the conclusion; go and read the key points. That will tell you the facts you need to know.


People in the trial areas were told that they would be subject to the card for one year only. But the government keeps sneakily extending the card through legislative instruments, and the opposition just keeps letting them, as does the crossbench. In fact, when they last extended the trials, last year, participants were given just one day's notice that the trials were continuing. This is no way to treat people, particularly those who feel traumatised and disadvantaged by the card. Despite the heartbreaking, spectacular failure of the 10 years of intervention and income management and then new income management, the government thought they'd give income management another shot. The ideology wins out again! Maybe 10 years worth of failure is just not definitive enough! And the continuing disadvantage in the Northern Territory: I don't know, it's just not definitive enough to say, 'Actually, income management doesn't work.'


Quite frankly, it is mind-boggling that the government's solution to helping communities who do have issues with drug and alcohol addiction, gambling and other major problems is a card that quarantines 80 per cent of income support recipients. Somehow this will magically solve the problems of addiction, of disadvantage and those underlying causes of disadvantage. Really and truly, if it were that simple—that you just bring in a card, you quarantine people's finances and you take control of their financial literacy, and that deals with addiction—wouldn't that put a whole lot of our medical professionals out of a job? Now, why didn't those medical professionals think, 'Why don't we just bring in a card where we control people's finances, we control their lives and that will magically fix addiction?' It'll magically fix the intergenerational trauma that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people feel and—as was pointed out at the Close the Gap breakfast this morning—deal with the history of disadvantage and of dispossession. The evidence of the impact of that is ongoing in people's lives today. All that will be magically fixed with this card! Although the government says they acknowledge that it's not a silver bullet, in fact they do think that. From their behaviours, it's quite obvious that they do, that they think this will magically fix it. And that's a belief—not based on evidence.


I'm growing so tired of the government just relying on anecdotal evidence and it being presented as fact—when the facts they ignore. They ignore the facts in the Northern Territory. They ignore the fact that 49 per cent of people said that their lives are made worse—and that's from a flawed survey. So, 49 per cent, when it is genuinely acknowledged across the board that the ORIMA valuations were flawed—particularly the push polling, the so-called surveys. Even in that process so many people said that it's made their lives worse. The so-called ORIMA evaluation reports rely very heavily on anecdotal evidence and are based on push poll surveys and skewed data. The reports simply don't stand up to scrutiny, and I can give you quite a significant stack of papers in which respected researchers have gone through and looked at the ORIMA reports and been quite scathing, in many cases, of those evaluations. We've had academics and data experts give evidence at the bills inquiry—we're going to be talking about that as the next item of business in this place—that the reports are flawed. They expressed concerns regarding the research and methodology being used to validate claims that the card is working and needs to be extended and expanded.


The list of concerns is long, but I'll note a few. Well-regarded academics—Dr Janet Hunt from the ANU, Professor Eva Cox from the UTS and Dr Elise Klein from the University of Melbourne—have concerns regarding research design, the sampling strategy, questionnaire design, recall bias, social desirability bias, the rising refusal rates of those surveyed, and the combination of longitudinal and intercept data, amongst other things. No baseline data was used and the ORIMA report's authors overlooked or dismissed important data that was not favourable to the trial. East Kimberley and Ceduna were weighted equally, despite the East Kimberley having a much higher rate of trial participants. Many survey participants deemed questions regarding changes in alcohol, drug or gambling behaviours as not applicable because they never engaged in those behaviours in the first place.


If you are a vulnerable person struggling with alcohol, drugs or gambling addictions and an authoritative figure starts questioning you about your drug use, it's highly likely that you are going to say, 'I've reduced my drug use' or 'I've stopped using.' Of course you're going to say that. It's a well-known and recognised survey risk. If I think you might take even more money away from me or you're going to take my kids away from me, I'm going to say on the survey, 'Yes, I've reduced my drug and alcohol intake.' If you're asking people if they've drunk less or are looking after their children better, what do you expect people to say? Of course they're going to say: 'I'm drinking less. Yes, I'm looking after my children.'


The evaluation claims that public perceptions of safety had increased. However, researchers at the University of Western Australia have demonstrated that public perception of crime is not reliable and rarely correct. But, if people say that to the researchers compiling the ORIMA reports, somehow it's fact, somehow it's correct, even though the research shows it's incorrect. In fact, the same was shown for the Northern Territory intervention. There were perceptions that things were better. However, when the researchers tested that in other regions not subjected to income management, they found the same levels. So, in other words, it wasn't safer. They just perceived it was safer because of income management, although it wasn't. It comes as no surprise that the trial areas didn't see an increase in employment. It's funny—it would be funny if it weren't tragic, I should say—how the government think that giving people a card is magically going to find them a job. There are simply so few jobs available in these communities. Where are people going to magically find these jobs?


The government are using a report that they know is flawed to justify the trial expansions. Government senators come into this place and parrot the government's lines with no understanding of the issues on the ground or of the flawed ORIMA report. They have no understanding of the impact of the card on people's lives. One senator claimed that it made no difference if people weren't spending their money on drugs or alcohol or gambling. That is utterly not true. I spoke to a number of participants on the card last week who, in fact, don't drink, don't take drugs and don't gamble, and they said the card has had a profound impact on their ability to manage their money. They gave an example of the shame they felt when they went into a restaurant and weren't able to pay to eat because the restaurant sold alcohol, as a lot of venues do. They couldn't pay. So it's absolute nonsense to say that it makes no difference if you were 'doing the right thing', as the government puts it. That brings me to the point that, apparently, if you're on income support, 'the right thing' is that you're not even allowed to buy a glass of wine. If you're on a DSP, you're not even allowed to have a glass of wine because that's 'the wrong thing'.


Senator Brandis, yesterday in his valedictory speech, made the point about the growing authoritarianism of the Left. That's from the party who are telling people how to spend their money and want to control people's daily lives. They take away people's financial independence—control of their finances and control of their life. I found that quite a significant point of interest—that we are the ones being accused of authoritarianism, when they are the ones seeking to control people's lives. 


Mr Tudge, while Minister for Human Services, kept saying that they will only roll out the card if the community wants it. Well, it's pretty clear from the Senate inquiry that, while some communities are divided on the issue and some are very strongly opposed, the one thing that is universally agreed upon is that they want to be listened to, they want wraparound services and they want to be consulted. If they're on income support, they want to be consulted, and the people in the Kimberley and Ceduna haven't been. People have many problems with the card, and they don't want to be on the card. 


Over the course of the Senate inquiry into the latest bill, we heard about the lack of consultation with people who are living on the card and with key community organisations. In fact, when I went to Hervey Bay, which is in the region where the government wants to roll out the welfare card, I held a public meeting, and more people attended that than had been turning up to the consultations the government had been running and inviting people to. At one of our Senate hearings, we heard from the Mayor of Ceduna, who said that the 'consultations' taking place in his town were people calling into the office. Apparently that was the process of consultation. The people actually living on the card had not been consulted, and that is just simply not good enough. 


I'm very glad that community members from the trial areas came to Canberra to talk to the committee. It's time the government listened to them. In November, I also tabled a petition with over 850 signatures from members of the Bundaberg community who do not want their area to be another trial site. And I think we need to stop using this term 'trial', because it's quite clear the government wants to keep rolling this out. You can wear the word 'trial' when they said it was for a year, but they just keep rolling it out in the East Kimberley and in Ceduna—and now they want to put it in other places too. 


People in those communities in Bundaberg don't want it in their area. They want to see real assistance from the government to tackle issues like substance abuse. Again, people want to deal with these issues of addiction, but they recognise addiction is a health issue. People want help dealing with the issues in their communities, but they want investment in wraparound services and they want to address the underlying causes; they don't want another trial of a card that doesn't work. 


Of course we all know the card overwhelmingly targets Aboriginal people. We know it was brought in in response to Andrew Forrest's report Creating parity, which was about creating parity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. He wanted this card for Aboriginal people. We know that there were people who moved away when they heard the trial might be coming to the area. This is particularly devastating for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and for the Aboriginal communities in remote communities. The first peoples should not have to choose between living on country and having proper access to income support. 


People in remote communities need access to cash. I've heard multiple examples of why that's important. It's just common sense. Banking and card facilities that we have in the city are just not available in rural and regional areas—and I outlined yesterday, in my contribution to the second reading debate on the new rollout of the card, some of the concerns that people have. People simply can't survive on 20 per cent of their income in cash in these communities. 


The survey data includes significant personal reports of increased hardship, and, in the wave 2 financial evaluation report, many of the surveyed participants said that they ran out of money to buy food or to pay for items for their children. There are a number of reasons why people are running out of cash on their card—and I articulated yesterday the problems with forcing people to use the credit facilities and the problems with the EFTPOS facilities. There is simply no evidence that blanket income management works, and it should be abandoned.


Some of the other issues that people have raised with me include, for example, the community panels, where the government has consistently refused to name the people on them. I have a form here that people are supposed to fill in if they want an exemption from the 80-20 rule. You can't get off the card, but you can apply to this faceless community panel, which may include your neighbour, to get the percentage quarantined—reduced from, say, 80 per cent; the lowest is 50-50. The person I was talking to, a person on DSP who does not spend money on drugs, alcohol or gambling, made an application to the panel in their region and asked for 50-50. With no explanation whatsoever, the panel said 60-40. There's absolutely no evidence that this person is suffering from any addiction or that she mismanages her money, yet an arbitrary decision was made of 60-40.


They have conditions like: 'I give my consent for the panel administrator collecting the personal information I've provided on this form. I give my consent'—this is from Western Australian, the Kununurra region—'for the Western Australia Police to provide information surrounding any convictions I have.' The Department of Housing, Community Housing Limited, Kununurra Hospital, Catholic Education WA, the Department of Education, the Department for Child Protection and East Kimberley Job Pathways—it says, 'I give my consent to the panel administration providing my personal information received from the above authorities to the community panel.' They're going around asking every single body they can think of about a person's personal life and personal finances. It is an outrageous invasion of privacy. People don't want this card. It doesn't work. This farce should end. I urge this chamber to support this disallowance to put an end to this farce once and for all.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:32):  I rise to speak on this disallowance motion proposed by the Greens. Based on our extensive consultations with Indigenous stakeholders and communities, we oppose the disallowance motion of the Greens. As I said in my remarks yesterday in the second reading debate on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, the cashless debit card is a complex issue. Issues of alcohol abuse, intergenerational poverty and social dysfunction, and the implications of those issues, are extremely complex. Their causes are extremely complex. Equally, the policy solutions that address these issues require careful deliberation and consultation, and that's exactly what Labor have done in determining our position. We need a calm and considered approach on this issue. Labor have consulted with many communities and many key stakeholders both in the trial site communities and around the country. We've received a wide range of opinions from both communities and individuals within those communities. We've heard from some communities and individuals who strongly oppose the cashless debit card. We've heard from some communities and some individuals who support it.


To be very clear, Labor does not support a national rollout of the cashless debit card. As I've said many times, Labor believes that the vast majority of income support recipients are more than capable of managing their own finances. I also want to make Labor's position very clear. Labor supports a limited continuation of the existing cashless debit card trial sites in Ceduna and East Kimberley. However, Labor will not support the rollout of the cashless debit card to the two new proposed sites of Bundaberg and the Goldfields. Labor understands that entrenched disadvantage cannot and will not be solved by income management alone. That's why we have always advocated for the government to provide additional wraparound support to the participating communities.


Labor believes that there still exists sufficient community support for a continuation of the trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. Labor knows that entrenched social issues cannot and will not be solved by income management alone. That's why we insisted that the government provide additional community supports for participating communities. We're calling on the government to support our amendment that funding for these critical wraparound services be guaranteed in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill. Labor will also move an amendment to ensure that no new trial sites can be introduced. In the future, Labor will only consider the introduction of a new trial site if the government can show that they have an agreed, formal consultation process with the community as well as an agreed definition of 'consent'.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:36):  The government is moving to block this disallowance motion, because it would jeopardise the cashless debit card program in Ceduna and East Kimberley. Without this legislative instrument, thousands of people who are currently benefiting from the cashless debit card will have their current payments thrown into chaos. 


The card has been shown to be helping the communities in Ceduna and East Kimberley fight gambling addiction, alcoholism and drug addiction. These communities want this card, and this disallowance motion would mean that the Senate would be ignoring the wishes of these communities. The government is committed to reducing the social harm caused by welfare-fuelled alcohol, drug abuse and gambling in areas with a high level of welfare dependency.


The debit card commenced in Ceduna, South Australia on 15 March 2016 and in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia on 26 April 2016. These sites were extended on 14 March 2017. The government announced in the 2017-18 budget that the card would be expanded to two new locations. The government announced the Goldfields region on 1 September 2017 and the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region on 21 September 2017. 


On 1 September 2017, the government released the independent Cashless debit card trial evaluation:final evaluation report, which assessed the impact of the introduction of the card in Ceduna and East Kimberley. The recently published independent evaluation states the card has shown considerable positive impact in communities, including 48 per cent of drug takers using fewer drugs, 41 per cent of drinkers drinking less and 48 per cent of gamblers gambling less.


While there have been up-front costs, the actual running costs of the card are a fraction of this. It is expected those costs will continue to reduce over time. Income management currently supports 25,044 vulnerable Australians. Over 21,000 of these people live in the Northern Territory and 82 per cent are Indigenous. Extending income management allows the government to continue supporting recipients while also testing approaches for the delivery of restricted welfare payments going forward. The extension will include streamlined servicing changes to reduce administrative costs. The Department of Social Services has undertaken extensive consultation across all four sites engaging a range of stakeholders, including local businesses, community organisations, service providers, state and local governments, community leaders and the general public. 


While the government appreciates the support provided by the opposition on the continuation of Ceduna and East Kimberley, we call on them to support the expansion of the card to the communities that are asking for it. As they know, we will see the best results from communities that want to participate, but more sites will mean that we can get a better evaluation for the card and its successors.


There is a large amount of community support for the debit card to be given to communities in the Goldfields in Western Australia and in Hervey Bay in Queensland—just ask the member for O'Connor and the member for Hinkler about what their communities are telling them. As the five shires in the Goldfields told the Prime Minister, they want to see how the card can improve their communities. As the community in Hinkler has told their representative, over 75 per cent of the community want to see how the card can help them. The government will be moving to block this disallowance motion.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-02-08,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:39):  One Nation will be voting against this disallowance motion. I actually went to a committee meeting in Kalgoorlie to listen to the concerns about the cashless debit card. It was overwhelming that the community there—businesses, community leaders, the mayor and councillors, and even the Aboriginal community themselves—have actually endorsed the card and are basically pleading with everyone to leave it in place. Yes, there are some objections to it and there were concerns about it, but we have to be responsible here. There are clearly problems in these communities. It's not just targeting, as Senator Siewert said, the Aboriginal community; it's right across the board for everyone.


They are still getting their entitlements; it's just being handed out in a different way—in a more responsible way, I believe. Minderoo have done some investigations into it and their findings are that 41 per cent of drinkers on the card said that they were drinking less, 48 per cent of drug users on the card said they were using drugs less, there has been an increase in children going to school and 48 per cent of gamblers on the card said they were gambling less. They still have use of the moneys; it's just that it is not in cash, ready to use. In a lot of ways, it's just saying, 'Take more responsibility and use the money wisely.' A lot of families are not spending the money on their children—to feed them and put food on the table—but the money is used for drink or it's used for gambling, or other family members come along and take the money off them. It's a custom of the Aboriginal people—what is yours belongs to everyone. So I think it's very good that way.


There is a huge problem in Kalgoorlie. There is lot of violence on the streets, there is abuse and there is drunkenness. It's going to affect the tourism industry. It has clearly been stated in reports put out by the police that crime is actually down due to the card. Mr Desmond Hill, from Kununurra in the East Kimberley, said:


I've actually seen more kids go to school with uniforms. I've had grandparents say that they're happy the cards are there because now their children have food in the fridge, the kids are clothed and they're all going to school. We're living with the changes, albeit it took 18 months to see the changes happening. They are actually happening.


Councillor Allan Suter, mayor of the District Council of Ceduna, informed the committee that the cashless debit card trial has been the most effective initiative to address excessive use of alcohol, drugs and gambling products in Ceduna and that it has resulted in significant improvements for families, particularly for children.


Yet the Greens stand here and say, 'You're taking away their rights; it's against human rights!' Let me go back to what the committee said:


The committee acknowledges concerns that the bill may limit a participant's human rights. However, the committee is satisfied that the bill only limits those rights to the extent required to realise the objective of the card to reduce the social harm caused by the excessive use of alcohol, drugs and gambling.


We are sick and tired of the Greens' bleeding-heart attitude because it's against people's rights. It's not against their rights. It's about time we started helping people. Clearly, the way our society is going now, it's not working. If they truly care about the kids and our societies, sometimes tough love is the best way to go with it. That's the best way to help these people. The best way to help the future generations is to take actually take control of it. This is taxpayers' money and it needs to be spent wisely to help these communities, because they are screaming out for it. They said to Senator Siewert at that meeting: 'If this is not the answer, then tell us what is, because you don't live here; you have no idea of what it's like on our streets and in our communities. If you think you know the answer then come here and live here. Don't tell us how to run our communities.' That's how they feel about it. 



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator HANSON:
  Oh yes, they did, because they were quite angry. I was at that meeting. I damn well know what happened there—through the chair. Anyway, I will oppose this disallowance motion. I think it is in the best interests. It has proven its worth. People who live in those communities have stated that it has helped, and it needs to be rolled out in other areas. That is what I'm saying. I do support the cashless debit card and I oppose the Greens disallowance motion.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-02-08,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:46):  I'm hardly surprised One Nation are opposing this. Why would they actually look at the evidence? Instead they choose to quote from the Minderoo Foundation, who have always supported this, because it was Andrew Forrest's idea in the first place. All they're doing is quoting—misquoting—the ORIMA evaluation, which has been torn to shreds by so many people who have the research qualifications to look at properly designed surveys rather than push polling. I spoke of that earlier. I don't know if Senator Hanson heard that before she came into the chamber. I spoke earlier of the fundamental flaws in the survey design and the ORIMA report. I will acknowledge that it is not just Senator Hanson who misuses those figures; it is also the government and Minderoo, of course, trying to promote their wunderkind answer to significant disadvantage in Aboriginal communities. 


I say again: it is not that we don't believe that these issues should be addressed. What we disagree with is the approach that's been taken, given that the overwhelming evidence shows that income management does not work. There are many people in the community—the participants, particularly—who do not support this card, both in the East Kimberley and in Ceduna. Allan Suter was quoted. Again, he's always been in favour of this card. He is the mayor. He is the one that refuses to consult with the people on the card. That's on the public record from the Senate inquiry, where he said, as I mentioned earlier, that people can call in, but, since the trial started and, particularly coming up to the rollover, he has not consulted members of the community. 


I'm deeply disappointed that Labor still refuse to give up their addiction to income management. We all know they had the chance to stop this when they came to power at the end of 2007, but they didn't. They let it roll on and, in fact, they renewed it to the new income management in 2012, a time I clearly remember. But the evaluation shows that it didn't work. That was a proper, independent evaluation. To call the ORIMA report a proper, independent evaluation is a misuse of the word 'independent'. 


In terms of some of the academic work that has been undertaken, let's look at the wraparound services—which are something that we all agree should have been given to these communities, but they should have been given to the communities right from the start. People shouldn't need the card to get access to better services. I will quote from the most recent evaluation of the cashless welfare card from CAEPR, the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research, at the ANU College of Arts and Social Sciences, by Elise Klein and Sarouche Razi. They found in their research on the wraparound services: 


Even aspects of the experiment that were meant to support people on the CDC were poorly applied. 


They said:


The types of services funded were limited in scope, focusing on treating assumed vices such as drug and alcohol addiction, and an inability to manage finances. This narrow focus overlooked funding for community development initiatives already on tight budgets, which may have more relevance to people on social benefits. The ORIMA final evaluation acknowledged the poor implementation of service funding …


Even that report said:


Overall, the evaluation found that the support services funded through the Trial had not been implemented in a timely manner.


They go on to say:


Most notable, however, is the limited reported use of these services by people on the CDC. The ORIMA (2017b) final evaluation found that only 12% of people they interviewed on the card reported using drug and alcohol services, and 10% used financial and family support services. This suggests that the assumption that people on welfare had vices to be serviced by drug and alcohol programs, and money management programs was not justified. As well, for people wanting to use the services, the services were not available in time.


They also talk about how it's made money management hard. I talked quite a bit yesterday about how people feel they have less control of their finances. They could be reducing their financial literacy, which is what the final evaluation of the Northern Territory new income management found it had an impact on. There was evidence that they think suggests that people in fact became more dependent on income support because of income management.


The report concludes:


The trial of the CDC in the East Kimberley is perverse contemporary Indigenous policy. Not only did the trial, by limiting the amount of cash, bring material hardship, it furthered the disempowerment of those marginalised by relational poverty. The terms 'community' and 'consultation' were used by government and advocates of the card as a tactic to give the impression that the diverse populations in Kununurra and Wyndham were unified in approval of the card. They do not reflect the substantive opposition to the card from many people living in the study site; indeed, the White Card—


for those that don't know, that's what the communities call the Indue card—


has become a symbol for disempowerment and neocolonial government control.


Use by the Australian Government of bespoke 'evidence' to tell only the story that the government wants to be heard is disturbing. It has two purposes: to continue the trial and expand the program in other regions—


it's quite obvious we're seeing that in the next debate we're about to have—


and to obfuscate the reality that the CDC's logic is deeply flawed and reliant on jobs that do not exist. The card cannot achieve the aims it seeks, as the framing is perverse and disconnected from the lives of those on the card.


I have to say that reflects what I've heard people say—most certainly in plainer words than that. Overwhelmingly, people who are actually trying to survive on the card have talked about the impact it's had on them, their difficulty in managing their money—and, again, there are many complicated reasons for that. They're reliant on cash and, when you're living on a low income, you do rely much more on cash because you can buy second-hand goods. You also need the cash to be able to send people to school. I spoke to people on the ground in Kununurra who felt shame when they had to get tokens instead of being able to use cash, for example, at the fair the year before last. They spoke again of the shame of not being able to have enough cash to buy things for their children at the school fete and in many other circumstances. They talk about the fact that everybody knows what the card looks like.


Again in the debate yesterday I heard from someone who was participating in the debate who obviously hasn't spoken to many people on the card, because that person—it was Senator Macdonald—said the card is just like any other card. That is absolute nonsense. It's not just any other card. On my credit card or on my bank card I can actually BPAY. I don't have to give everybody my credit card number so they can deduct the money for whatever I want to buy off my credit card. Or I can pay my power bill. I don't have to pay my power bill that way; I actually pay mine with BPAY. They can't; hence, it is not the same as for everybody else. It is just not true.


And everybody in communities knows what the Indue card looks like. They know what the white card looks like. That's what it's commonly called. They've probably seen a number of people whose card wouldn't work having to stand separately from the queues, because the refusal rate has been high. The government said they've dealt with that. Well, I can tell you right now that that's not true. Just last week I spoke to participants on the card who said they are still getting refusals for use of the card. It does make people's lives harder. 


The government consult with their hand-picked leaders, who aren't necessarily the people in the community that the community would say are their leaders. They don't listen to the leaders who don't support the card. In fact, some of those in the East Kimberley, who did support the card originally, don't support the card anymore. That is never spoken about in here. It has caused deep division in communities, and we shouldn't be causing deep divisions in communities. We should be looking at the services that work. We should be working cooperatively with and being led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. 


At the Close the Gap breakfast this morning, that was the clear message in the report they released today. There are a number of very important points in that report, and I urge people to go and read it. It is a damning report on the 10-year strategy. We haven't met the targets that were set in place to try and close the gap. In fact, they found, this year, the gap has widened. They said the plan was essentially abandoned halfway through the 10-year process. They talked about needing to make sure that from here on in we have a proper strategy; we need the infrastructure in place. But, really importantly, there need to be Aboriginal controlled and led processes. The word a lot of people are using is 'co-design'. We shouldn't be doing things to Aboriginal communities; we should be working with and being led by Aboriginal communities if we are going to close the gap and address issues around Aboriginal disadvantage. 


The current approach is a paternalistic, top-down approach where people feel disempowered. This is what the report says—that the card has become 'a symbol of disempowerment'. We undermine people's financial literacy and their ability to control their lives. The most personal part of somebody's life is controlling their finances and making those day-to-day decisions. What we've done is taken that away from people. We've made their lives harder. Also, there are innumerable ways that people are getting around the card in the first place. The results that everybody quotes in here are not real results. It is flawed methodology. Please support this. Please end this farce so we can invest the resources that have been wasted—over a billion dollars since 2007—on income management.


We still have the same levels of disadvantage in the Northern Territory. In fact, things in some areas have got worse. I keep hearing people talk about school attendance. There was a study released over January that looked at the impact of the Northern Territory intervention on school attendance. It showed that school attendance decreased when the intervention came in. It actually had an impact on birth weights. There are very complex issues here that also relate to the issues of intergenerational trauma, the impact that trauma has and the chaos that it can cause. It is not a simple issue. It is not a simple solution. It is not accepted by all the participants I've talked to—which is probably something you would expect in terms of the people who would contact me.


Yes, there are some people in the Kununurra and Ceduna communities who will tell you that things have improved in those communities. I've heard the story about how it is cleaner now. Well, for a start, they actually have rubbish cleaners who, when I went out there, were going around picking up the rubbish before most people got up in the morning. But, secondly, I've been told by people who actually live in Kununurra—as recently as last week—that there are still a lot of the same issues going on that were going on previously. And I heard some specific examples of some troubles, which I am in fact not going to repeat here, because I don't want people using them as stereotypical behaviour.


The fact is you don't change issues around addiction by taking over control of people's lives. The sort of evidence you hear about that sort of personal behaviour is the same when you're trying to bring in the drug trials—addiction expert after addiction expert told the committee that was looking into it that it won't work and that it's not the way you address addiction. It's a health issue. Drug and alcohol addiction are health issues, and that's the way we should be addressing them. We need to be providing the services that actually address people's needs.


Please: support this disallowance and get rid of this farce so we can move on to the issues that we all agree we need to be addressing. Focus on that. Focus on making sure that we get Closing the Gap right through the refresh process. Make sure that we are focused on the issues that will truly make a difference. This doesn't. It's a waste of resources and it takes attention away from what we should be doing. I urge this place to support this disallowance.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:12):  I move:


That the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area) Amendment Determination (No. 2) 2017, made under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, be disallowed [F2017L01170].


I know some people in this place will think this is groundhog day, 'Here she is again, talking about trying to disallow these awful trials.' I make absolutely no apology for making you all debate this disallowance. I will continue to do so while this awful legislation exists and while these trials continue. I will bring this issue back again and again and again. 


So we're clear, this is to disallow the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area) Amendment Determination (No. 2) 2017. This determination amends the Ceduna and East Kimberley determinations to extend both of the cashless welfare card trials, in the East Kimberley, predominantly centred on Kununurra and Wyndham, and in Ceduna. It extends the Ceduna determination until 14 March this year and the East Kimberley determination until 25 April 2018. I will note that the next debate we enter into after this will be on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017 and the government's desire to continue to roll out the cashless welfare card. 


This instrument was made on 11 September 2017 and registered on 13 September 2017, one day before the Ceduna and surrounding region determination was in fact due to cease. So there are a lot of people on this card thinking, 'Finally, we're going to get off it,' and then, bang, the legislative instrument comes in and furthers the trial. 


As anticipated, the trials and the subsequent extensions—supported by both this government and the opposition—have turned out to be a rubber stamp on income support, based on reports and evaluations spruiked with premature evidence, anecdotes and ideology. That's what these are based on: anecdotes and ideology. Because if it wasn't, the government and the opposition would not have (a) initiated this program and (b), in the case of the opposition, supported it. The evidence from the Northern Territory is overwhelmingly clear: income management failed. It met none of its objectives. I bet most people in this chamber have not bothered ever to go and look at that final evaluation. It's a very thick report. If you're time-poor, as we all are, go and read the conclusion; go and read the key points. That will tell you the facts you need to know.


People in the trial areas were told that they would be subject to the card for one year only. But the government keeps sneakily extending the card through legislative instruments, and the opposition just keeps letting them, as does the crossbench. In fact, when they last extended the trials, last year, participants were given just one day's notice that the trials were continuing. This is no way to treat people, particularly those who feel traumatised and disadvantaged by the card. Despite the heartbreaking, spectacular failure of the 10 years of intervention and income management and then new income management, the government thought they'd give income management another shot. The ideology wins out again! Maybe 10 years worth of failure is just not definitive enough! And the continuing disadvantage in the Northern Territory: I don't know, it's just not definitive enough to say, 'Actually, income management doesn't work.'


Quite frankly, it is mind-boggling that the government's solution to helping communities who do have issues with drug and alcohol addiction, gambling and other major problems is a card that quarantines 80 per cent of income support recipients. Somehow this will magically solve the problems of addiction, of disadvantage and those underlying causes of disadvantage. Really and truly, if it were that simple—that you just bring in a card, you quarantine people's finances and you take control of their financial literacy, and that deals with addiction—wouldn't that put a whole lot of our medical professionals out of a job? Now, why didn't those medical professionals think, 'Why don't we just bring in a card where we control people's finances, we control their lives and that will magically fix addiction?' It'll magically fix the intergenerational trauma that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people feel and—as was pointed out at the Close the Gap breakfast this morning—deal with the history of disadvantage and of dispossession. The evidence of the impact of that is ongoing in people's lives today. All that will be magically fixed with this card! Although the government says they acknowledge that it's not a silver bullet, in fact they do think that. From their behaviours, it's quite obvious that they do, that they think this will magically fix it. And that's a belief—not based on evidence.


I'm growing so tired of the government just relying on anecdotal evidence and it being presented as fact—when the facts they ignore. They ignore the facts in the Northern Territory. They ignore the fact that 49 per cent of people said that their lives are made worse—and that's from a flawed survey. So, 49 per cent, when it is genuinely acknowledged across the board that the ORIMA valuations were flawed—particularly the push polling, the so-called surveys. Even in that process so many people said that it's made their lives worse. The so-called ORIMA evaluation reports rely very heavily on anecdotal evidence and are based on push poll surveys and skewed data. The reports simply don't stand up to scrutiny, and I can give you quite a significant stack of papers in which respected researchers have gone through and looked at the ORIMA reports and been quite scathing, in many cases, of those evaluations. We've had academics and data experts give evidence at the bills inquiry—we're going to be talking about that as the next item of business in this place—that the reports are flawed. They expressed concerns regarding the research and methodology being used to validate claims that the card is working and needs to be extended and expanded.


The list of concerns is long, but I'll note a few. Well-regarded academics—Dr Janet Hunt from the ANU, Professor Eva Cox from the UTS and Dr Elise Klein from the University of Melbourne—have concerns regarding research design, the sampling strategy, questionnaire design, recall bias, social desirability bias, the rising refusal rates of those surveyed, and the combination of longitudinal and intercept data, amongst other things. No baseline data was used and the ORIMA report's authors overlooked or dismissed important data that was not favourable to the trial. East Kimberley and Ceduna were weighted equally, despite the East Kimberley having a much higher rate of trial participants. Many survey participants deemed questions regarding changes in alcohol, drug or gambling behaviours as not applicable because they never engaged in those behaviours in the first place.


If you are a vulnerable person struggling with alcohol, drugs or gambling addictions and an authoritative figure starts questioning you about your drug use, it's highly likely that you are going to say, 'I've reduced my drug use' or 'I've stopped using.' Of course you're going to say that. It's a well-known and recognised survey risk. If I think you might take even more money away from me or you're going to take my kids away from me, I'm going to say on the survey, 'Yes, I've reduced my drug and alcohol intake.' If you're asking people if they've drunk less or are looking after their children better, what do you expect people to say? Of course they're going to say: 'I'm drinking less. Yes, I'm looking after my children.'


The evaluation claims that public perceptions of safety had increased. However, researchers at the University of Western Australia have demonstrated that public perception of crime is not reliable and rarely correct. But, if people say that to the researchers compiling the ORIMA reports, somehow it's fact, somehow it's correct, even though the research shows it's incorrect. In fact, the same was shown for the Northern Territory intervention. There were perceptions that things were better. However, when the researchers tested that in other regions not subjected to income management, they found the same levels. So, in other words, it wasn't safer. They just perceived it was safer because of income management, although it wasn't. It comes as no surprise that the trial areas didn't see an increase in employment. It's funny—it would be funny if it weren't tragic, I should say—how the government think that giving people a card is magically going to find them a job. There are simply so few jobs available in these communities. Where are people going to magically find these jobs?


The government are using a report that they know is flawed to justify the trial expansions. Government senators come into this place and parrot the government's lines with no understanding of the issues on the ground or of the flawed ORIMA report. They have no understanding of the impact of the card on people's lives. One senator claimed that it made no difference if people weren't spending their money on drugs or alcohol or gambling. That is utterly not true. I spoke to a number of participants on the card last week who, in fact, don't drink, don't take drugs and don't gamble, and they said the card has had a profound impact on their ability to manage their money. They gave an example of the shame they felt when they went into a restaurant and weren't able to pay to eat because the restaurant sold alcohol, as a lot of venues do. They couldn't pay. So it's absolute nonsense to say that it makes no difference if you were 'doing the right thing', as the government puts it. That brings me to the point that, apparently, if you're on income support, 'the right thing' is that you're not even allowed to buy a glass of wine. If you're on a DSP, you're not even allowed to have a glass of wine because that's 'the wrong thing'.


Senator Brandis, yesterday in his valedictory speech, made the point about the growing authoritarianism of the Left. That's from the party who are telling people how to spend their money and want to control people's daily lives. They take away people's financial independence—control of their finances and control of their life. I found that quite a significant point of interest—that we are the ones being accused of authoritarianism, when they are the ones seeking to control people's lives. 


Mr Tudge, while Minister for Human Services, kept saying that they will only roll out the card if the community wants it. Well, it's pretty clear from the Senate inquiry that, while some communities are divided on the issue and some are very strongly opposed, the one thing that is universally agreed upon is that they want to be listened to, they want wraparound services and they want to be consulted. If they're on income support, they want to be consulted, and the people in the Kimberley and Ceduna haven't been. People have many problems with the card, and they don't want to be on the card. 


Over the course of the Senate inquiry into the latest bill, we heard about the lack of consultation with people who are living on the card and with key community organisations. In fact, when I went to Hervey Bay, which is in the region where the government wants to roll out the welfare card, I held a public meeting, and more people attended that than had been turning up to the consultations the government had been running and inviting people to. At one of our Senate hearings, we heard from the Mayor of Ceduna, who said that the 'consultations' taking place in his town were people calling into the office. Apparently that was the process of consultation. The people actually living on the card had not been consulted, and that is just simply not good enough. 


I'm very glad that community members from the trial areas came to Canberra to talk to the committee. It's time the government listened to them. In November, I also tabled a petition with over 850 signatures from members of the Bundaberg community who do not want their area to be another trial site. And I think we need to stop using this term 'trial', because it's quite clear the government wants to keep rolling this out. You can wear the word 'trial' when they said it was for a year, but they just keep rolling it out in the East Kimberley and in Ceduna—and now they want to put it in other places too. 


People in those communities in Bundaberg don't want it in their area. They want to see real assistance from the government to tackle issues like substance abuse. Again, people want to deal with these issues of addiction, but they recognise addiction is a health issue. People want help dealing with the issues in their communities, but they want investment in wraparound services and they want to address the underlying causes; they don't want another trial of a card that doesn't work. 


Of course we all know the card overwhelmingly targets Aboriginal people. We know it was brought in in response to Andrew Forrest's report Creating parity, which was about creating parity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. He wanted this card for Aboriginal people. We know that there were people who moved away when they heard the trial might be coming to the area. This is particularly devastating for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and for the Aboriginal communities in remote communities. The first peoples should not have to choose between living on country and having proper access to income support. 


People in remote communities need access to cash. I've heard multiple examples of why that's important. It's just common sense. Banking and card facilities that we have in the city are just not available in rural and regional areas—and I outlined yesterday, in my contribution to the second reading debate on the new rollout of the card, some of the concerns that people have. People simply can't survive on 20 per cent of their income in cash in these communities. 


The survey data includes significant personal reports of increased hardship, and, in the wave 2 financial evaluation report, many of the surveyed participants said that they ran out of money to buy food or to pay for items for their children. There are a number of reasons why people are running out of cash on their card—and I articulated yesterday the problems with forcing people to use the credit facilities and the problems with the EFTPOS facilities. There is simply no evidence that blanket income management works, and it should be abandoned.


Some of the other issues that people have raised with me include, for example, the community panels, where the government has consistently refused to name the people on them. I have a form here that people are supposed to fill in if they want an exemption from the 80-20 rule. You can't get off the card, but you can apply to this faceless community panel, which may include your neighbour, to get the percentage quarantined—reduced from, say, 80 per cent; the lowest is 50-50. The person I was talking to, a person on DSP who does not spend money on drugs, alcohol or gambling, made an application to the panel in their region and asked for 50-50. With no explanation whatsoever, the panel said 60-40. There's absolutely no evidence that this person is suffering from any addiction or that she mismanages her money, yet an arbitrary decision was made of 60-40.


They have conditions like: 'I give my consent for the panel administrator collecting the personal information I've provided on this form. I give my consent'—this is from Western Australian, the Kununurra region—'for the Western Australia Police to provide information surrounding any convictions I have.' The Department of Housing, Community Housing Limited, Kununurra Hospital, Catholic Education WA, the Department of Education, the Department for Child Protection and East Kimberley Job Pathways—it says, 'I give my consent to the panel administration providing my personal information received from the above authorities to the community panel.' They're going around asking every single body they can think of about a person's personal life and personal finances. It is an outrageous invasion of privacy. People don't want this card. It doesn't work. This farce should end. I urge this chamber to support this disallowance to put an end to this farce once and for all.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:32):  I rise to speak on this disallowance motion proposed by the Greens. Based on our extensive consultations with Indigenous stakeholders and communities, we oppose the disallowance motion of the Greens. As I said in my remarks yesterday in the second reading debate on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, the cashless debit card is a complex issue. Issues of alcohol abuse, intergenerational poverty and social dysfunction, and the implications of those issues, are extremely complex. Their causes are extremely complex. Equally, the policy solutions that address these issues require careful deliberation and consultation, and that's exactly what Labor have done in determining our position. We need a calm and considered approach on this issue. Labor have consulted with many communities and many key stakeholders both in the trial site communities and around the country. We've received a wide range of opinions from both communities and individuals within those communities. We've heard from some communities and individuals who strongly oppose the cashless debit card. We've heard from some communities and some individuals who support it.


To be very clear, Labor does not support a national rollout of the cashless debit card. As I've said many times, Labor believes that the vast majority of income support recipients are more than capable of managing their own finances. I also want to make Labor's position very clear. Labor supports a limited continuation of the existing cashless debit card trial sites in Ceduna and East Kimberley. However, Labor will not support the rollout of the cashless debit card to the two new proposed sites of Bundaberg and the Goldfields. Labor understands that entrenched disadvantage cannot and will not be solved by income management alone. That's why we have always advocated for the government to provide additional wraparound support to the participating communities.


Labor believes that there still exists sufficient community support for a continuation of the trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. Labor knows that entrenched social issues cannot and will not be solved by income management alone. That's why we insisted that the government provide additional community supports for participating communities. We're calling on the government to support our amendment that funding for these critical wraparound services be guaranteed in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill. Labor will also move an amendment to ensure that no new trial sites can be introduced. In the future, Labor will only consider the introduction of a new trial site if the government can show that they have an agreed, formal consultation process with the community as well as an agreed definition of 'consent'.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-02-08,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:36):  The government is moving to block this disallowance motion, because it would jeopardise the cashless debit card program in Ceduna and East Kimberley. Without this legislative instrument, thousands of people who are currently benefiting from the cashless debit card will have their current payments thrown into chaos. 


The card has been shown to be helping the communities in Ceduna and East Kimberley fight gambling addiction, alcoholism and drug addiction. These communities want this card, and this disallowance motion would mean that the Senate would be ignoring the wishes of these communities. The government is committed to reducing the social harm caused by welfare-fuelled alcohol, drug abuse and gambling in areas with a high level of welfare dependency.


The debit card commenced in Ceduna, South Australia on 15 March 2016 and in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia on 26 April 2016. These sites were extended on 14 March 2017. The government announced in the 2017-18 budget that the card would be expanded to two new locations. The government announced the Goldfields region on 1 September 2017 and the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region on 21 September 2017. 


On 1 September 2017, the government released the independent Cashless debit card trial evaluation:final evaluation report, which assessed the impact of the introduction of the card in Ceduna and East Kimberley. The recently published independent evaluation states the card has shown considerable positive impact in communities, including 48 per cent of drug takers using fewer drugs, 41 per cent of drinkers drinking less and 48 per cent of gamblers gambling less.


While there have been up-front costs, the actual running costs of the card are a fraction of this. It is expected those costs will continue to reduce over time. Income management currently supports 25,044 vulnerable Australians. Over 21,000 of these people live in the Northern Territory and 82 per cent are Indigenous. Extending income management allows the government to continue supporting recipients while also testing approaches for the delivery of restricted welfare payments going forward. The extension will include streamlined servicing changes to reduce administrative costs. The Department of Social Services has undertaken extensive consultation across all four sites engaging a range of stakeholders, including local businesses, community organisations, service providers, state and local governments, community leaders and the general public. 


While the government appreciates the support provided by the opposition on the continuation of Ceduna and East Kimberley, we call on them to support the expansion of the card to the communities that are asking for it. As they know, we will see the best results from communities that want to participate, but more sites will mean that we can get a better evaluation for the card and its successors.


There is a large amount of community support for the debit card to be given to communities in the Goldfields in Western Australia and in Hervey Bay in Queensland—just ask the member for O'Connor and the member for Hinkler about what their communities are telling them. As the five shires in the Goldfields told the Prime Minister, they want to see how the card can improve their communities. As the community in Hinkler has told their representative, over 75 per cent of the community want to see how the card can help them. The government will be moving to block this disallowance motion.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-02-08,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:39):  One Nation will be voting against this disallowance motion. I actually went to a committee meeting in Kalgoorlie to listen to the concerns about the cashless debit card. It was overwhelming that the community there—businesses, community leaders, the mayor and councillors, and even the Aboriginal community themselves—have actually endorsed the card and are basically pleading with everyone to leave it in place. Yes, there are some objections to it and there were concerns about it, but we have to be responsible here. There are clearly problems in these communities. It's not just targeting, as Senator Siewert said, the Aboriginal community; it's right across the board for everyone.


They are still getting their entitlements; it's just being handed out in a different way—in a more responsible way, I believe. Minderoo have done some investigations into it and their findings are that 41 per cent of drinkers on the card said that they were drinking less, 48 per cent of drug users on the card said they were using drugs less, there has been an increase in children going to school and 48 per cent of gamblers on the card said they were gambling less. They still have use of the moneys; it's just that it is not in cash, ready to use. In a lot of ways, it's just saying, 'Take more responsibility and use the money wisely.' A lot of families are not spending the money on their children—to feed them and put food on the table—but the money is used for drink or it's used for gambling, or other family members come along and take the money off them. It's a custom of the Aboriginal people—what is yours belongs to everyone. So I think it's very good that way.


There is a huge problem in Kalgoorlie. There is lot of violence on the streets, there is abuse and there is drunkenness. It's going to affect the tourism industry. It has clearly been stated in reports put out by the police that crime is actually down due to the card. Mr Desmond Hill, from Kununurra in the East Kimberley, said:


I've actually seen more kids go to school with uniforms. I've had grandparents say that they're happy the cards are there because now their children have food in the fridge, the kids are clothed and they're all going to school. We're living with the changes, albeit it took 18 months to see the changes happening. They are actually happening.


Councillor Allan Suter, mayor of the District Council of Ceduna, informed the committee that the cashless debit card trial has been the most effective initiative to address excessive use of alcohol, drugs and gambling products in Ceduna and that it has resulted in significant improvements for families, particularly for children.


Yet the Greens stand here and say, 'You're taking away their rights; it's against human rights!' Let me go back to what the committee said:


The committee acknowledges concerns that the bill may limit a participant's human rights. However, the committee is satisfied that the bill only limits those rights to the extent required to realise the objective of the card to reduce the social harm caused by the excessive use of alcohol, drugs and gambling.


We are sick and tired of the Greens' bleeding-heart attitude because it's against people's rights. It's not against their rights. It's about time we started helping people. Clearly, the way our society is going now, it's not working. If they truly care about the kids and our societies, sometimes tough love is the best way to go with it. That's the best way to help these people. The best way to help the future generations is to take actually take control of it. This is taxpayers' money and it needs to be spent wisely to help these communities, because they are screaming out for it. They said to Senator Siewert at that meeting: 'If this is not the answer, then tell us what is, because you don't live here; you have no idea of what it's like on our streets and in our communities. If you think you know the answer then come here and live here. Don't tell us how to run our communities.' That's how they feel about it. 



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator HANSON:
  Oh yes, they did, because they were quite angry. I was at that meeting. I damn well know what happened there—through the chair. Anyway, I will oppose this disallowance motion. I think it is in the best interests. It has proven its worth. People who live in those communities have stated that it has helped, and it needs to be rolled out in other areas. That is what I'm saying. I do support the cashless debit card and I oppose the Greens disallowance motion. 

",Senate,<title>REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS</title>,<title>Disallowance</title>,REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS,5,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-02-08,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:46):  I'm hardly surprised One Nation are opposing this. Why would they actually look at the evidence? Instead they choose to quote from the Minderoo Foundation, who have always supported this, because it was Andrew Forrest's idea in the first place. All they're doing is quoting—misquoting—the ORIMA evaluation, which has been torn to shreds by so many people who have the research qualifications to look at properly designed surveys rather than push polling. I spoke of that earlier. I don't know if Senator Hanson heard that before she came into the chamber. I spoke earlier of the fundamental flaws in the survey design and the ORIMA report. I will acknowledge that it is not just Senator Hanson who misuses those figures; it is also the government and Minderoo, of course, trying to promote their wunderkind answer to significant disadvantage in Aboriginal communities. 


I say again: it is not that we don't believe that these issues should be addressed. What we disagree with is the approach that's been taken, given that the overwhelming evidence shows that income management does not work. There are many people in the community—the participants, particularly—who do not support this card, both in the East Kimberley and in Ceduna. Allan Suter was quoted. Again, he's always been in favour of this card. He is the mayor. He is the one that refuses to consult with the people on the card. That's on the public record from the Senate inquiry, where he said, as I mentioned earlier, that people can call in, but, since the trial started and, particularly coming up to the rollover, he has not consulted members of the community. 


I'm deeply disappointed that Labor still refuse to give up their addiction to income management. We all know they had the chance to stop this when they came to power at the end of 2007, but they didn't. They let it roll on and, in fact, they renewed it to the new income management in 2012, a time I clearly remember. But the evaluation shows that it didn't work. That was a proper, independent evaluation. To call the ORIMA report a proper, independent evaluation is a misuse of the word 'independent'. 


In terms of some of the academic work that has been undertaken, let's look at the wraparound services—which are something that we all agree should have been given to these communities, but they should have been given to the communities right from the start. People shouldn't need the card to get access to better services. I will quote from the most recent evaluation of the cashless welfare card from CAEPR, the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research, at the ANU College of Arts and Social Sciences, by Elise Klein and Sarouche Razi. They found in their research on the wraparound services: 


Even aspects of the experiment that were meant to support people on the CDC were poorly applied. 


They said:


The types of services funded were limited in scope, focusing on treating assumed vices such as drug and alcohol addiction, and an inability to manage finances. This narrow focus overlooked funding for community development initiatives already on tight budgets, which may have more relevance to people on social benefits. The ORIMA final evaluation acknowledged the poor implementation of service funding …


Even that report said:


Overall, the evaluation found that the support services funded through the Trial had not been implemented in a timely manner.


They go on to say:


Most notable, however, is the limited reported use of these services by people on the CDC. The ORIMA (2017b) final evaluation found that only 12% of people they interviewed on the card reported using drug and alcohol services, and 10% used financial and family support services. This suggests that the assumption that people on welfare had vices to be serviced by drug and alcohol programs, and money management programs was not justified. As well, for people wanting to use the services, the services were not available in time.


They also talk about how it's made money management hard. I talked quite a bit yesterday about how people feel they have less control of their finances. They could be reducing their financial literacy, which is what the final evaluation of the Northern Territory new income management found it had an impact on. There was evidence that they think suggests that people in fact became more dependent on income support because of income management.


The report concludes:


The trial of the CDC in the East Kimberley is perverse contemporary Indigenous policy. Not only did the trial, by limiting the amount of cash, bring material hardship, it furthered the disempowerment of those marginalised by relational poverty. The terms 'community' and 'consultation' were used by government and advocates of the card as a tactic to give the impression that the diverse populations in Kununurra and Wyndham were unified in approval of the card. They do not reflect the substantive opposition to the card from many people living in the study site; indeed, the White Card—


for those that don't know, that's what the communities call the Indue card—


has become a symbol for disempowerment and neocolonial government control.


Use by the Australian Government of bespoke 'evidence' to tell only the story that the government wants to be heard is disturbing. It has two purposes: to continue the trial and expand the program in other regions—


it's quite obvious we're seeing that in the next debate we're about to have—


and to obfuscate the reality that the CDC's logic is deeply flawed and reliant on jobs that do not exist. The card cannot achieve the aims it seeks, as the framing is perverse and disconnected from the lives of those on the card.


I have to say that reflects what I've heard people say—most certainly in plainer words than that. Overwhelmingly, people who are actually trying to survive on the card have talked about the impact it's had on them, their difficulty in managing their money—and, again, there are many complicated reasons for that. They're reliant on cash and, when you're living on a low income, you do rely much more on cash because you can buy second-hand goods. You also need the cash to be able to send people to school. I spoke to people on the ground in Kununurra who felt shame when they had to get tokens instead of being able to use cash, for example, at the fair the year before last. They spoke again of the shame of not being able to have enough cash to buy things for their children at the school fete and in many other circumstances. They talk about the fact that everybody knows what the card looks like.


Again in the debate yesterday I heard from someone who was participating in the debate who obviously hasn't spoken to many people on the card, because that person—it was Senator Macdonald—said the card is just like any other card. That is absolute nonsense. It's not just any other card. On my credit card or on my bank card I can actually BPAY. I don't have to give everybody my credit card number so they can deduct the money for whatever I want to buy off my credit card. Or I can pay my power bill. I don't have to pay my power bill that way; I actually pay mine with BPAY. They can't; hence, it is not the same as for everybody else. It is just not true.


And everybody in communities knows what the Indue card looks like. They know what the white card looks like. That's what it's commonly called. They've probably seen a number of people whose card wouldn't work having to stand separately from the queues, because the refusal rate has been high. The government said they've dealt with that. Well, I can tell you right now that that's not true. Just last week I spoke to participants on the card who said they are still getting refusals for use of the card. It does make people's lives harder. 


The government consult with their hand-picked leaders, who aren't necessarily the people in the community that the community would say are their leaders. They don't listen to the leaders who don't support the card. In fact, some of those in the East Kimberley, who did support the card originally, don't support the card anymore. That is never spoken about in here. It has caused deep division in communities, and we shouldn't be causing deep divisions in communities. We should be looking at the services that work. We should be working cooperatively with and being led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. 


At the Close the Gap breakfast this morning, that was the clear message in the report they released today. There are a number of very important points in that report, and I urge people to go and read it. It is a damning report on the 10-year strategy. We haven't met the targets that were set in place to try and close the gap. In fact, they found, this year, the gap has widened. They said the plan was essentially abandoned halfway through the 10-year process. They talked about needing to make sure that from here on in we have a proper strategy; we need the infrastructure in place. But, really importantly, there need to be Aboriginal controlled and led processes. The word a lot of people are using is 'co-design'. We shouldn't be doing things to Aboriginal communities; we should be working with and being led by Aboriginal communities if we are going to close the gap and address issues around Aboriginal disadvantage. 


The current approach is a paternalistic, top-down approach where people feel disempowered. This is what the report says—that the card has become 'a symbol of disempowerment'. We undermine people's financial literacy and their ability to control their lives. The most personal part of somebody's life is controlling their finances and making those day-to-day decisions. What we've done is taken that away from people. We've made their lives harder. Also, there are innumerable ways that people are getting around the card in the first place. The results that everybody quotes in here are not real results. It is flawed methodology. Please support this. Please end this farce so we can invest the resources that have been wasted—over a billion dollars since 2007—on income management.


We still have the same levels of disadvantage in the Northern Territory. In fact, things in some areas have got worse. I keep hearing people talk about school attendance. There was a study released over January that looked at the impact of the Northern Territory intervention on school attendance. It showed that school attendance decreased when the intervention came in. It actually had an impact on birth weights. There are very complex issues here that also relate to the issues of intergenerational trauma, the impact that trauma has and the chaos that it can cause. It is not a simple issue. It is not a simple solution. It is not accepted by all the participants I've talked to—which is probably something you would expect in terms of the people who would contact me.


Yes, there are some people in the Kununurra and Ceduna communities who will tell you that things have improved in those communities. I've heard the story about how it is cleaner now. Well, for a start, they actually have rubbish cleaners who, when I went out there, were going around picking up the rubbish before most people got up in the morning. But, secondly, I've been told by people who actually live in Kununurra—as recently as last week—that there are still a lot of the same issues going on that were going on previously. And I heard some specific examples of some troubles, which I am in fact not going to repeat here, because I don't want people using them as stereotypical behaviour.


The fact is you don't change issues around addiction by taking over control of people's lives. The sort of evidence you hear about that sort of personal behaviour is the same when you're trying to bring in the drug trials—addiction expert after addiction expert told the committee that was looking into it that it won't work and that it's not the way you address addiction. It's a health issue. Drug and alcohol addiction are health issues, and that's the way we should be addressing them. We need to be providing the services that actually address people's needs.


Please: support this disallowance and get rid of this farce so we can move on to the issues that we all agree we need to be addressing. Focus on that. Focus on making sure that we get Closing the Gap right through the refresh process. Make sure that we are focused on the issues that will truly make a difference. This doesn't. It's a waste of resources and it takes attention away from what we should be doing. I urge this place to support this disallowance.


Question negatived.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (11:01):  As we debate today the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, I want to say at the outset that Labor's approach to this is to look to community-driven initiatives to tackle chronic alcohol abuse. The key word here should be 'community', not engaging in top-down approaches. Labor has significant concerns with regard to the existing rollout, notwithstanding the fact that we have agreed for the trials to continue.


As we heard this morning at the Close the Gap breakfast, what we need to do to be successful in engaging with the prevention of alcohol abuse and other forms of community disadvantage is to listen directly to affected communities. We have to empower them and resource their own solutions, particularly through Indigenous-controlled organisations. We should not be engaging in approaches that take the power away from local communities. We in this place mustn't fool ourselves into believing that income management is in and of itself the solution to entrenched disadvantage, and, most importantly, we mustn't forget that the vast majority of people on income support are perfectly capable of managing their own finances. I can't help but also reflect on the fact that, for many people on income support, their finances are manifestly inadequate, which is a significant driver behind poverty, not poor financial management or alcohol or drug abuse.


Labor is not supporting this bill in its current form. I want to take issue with some of the allegations put by the government in this debate yesterday—that somehow Labor had done a backflip because of the Batman by-election. Nothing could be further from the truth. Labor was very clear in its position last year, while parliament was still sitting—long before we looked to a by-election in Batman.


We support the continuation of the existing cashless debit card trial in both Ceduna and the Kimberley, and that's not without reservation. But we do understand that the existing trials need to be properly evaluated, so we've looked to amendments to extend the dates of the trial to ensure that proper evaluation can take place to judge the success or otherwise of the trial. On that note, we don't support the further rollout of the card to new sites in Bundaberg and the Goldfields. We certainly don't support the nationwide rollout of a cashless debit card. We also believe that it is of the utmost importance that wraparound services are in place to ensure that families receive the much needed support when participating in this trial. And, as highlighted already in this debate, these frankly are services that these communities should have a right to expect, irrespective of the existence of the card.


Our commitment in Labor is to consult with local communities about programs like this. We are committed to listening when they raise concerns. We're not interested in a top-down approach. We can see in the recommendations of the Senate inquiry, and indeed from our own consultations with local communities, that we simply cannot support the bill before us as it stands.


The recent Senate inquiry heard that there are huge gaps in the consultation process. For example, witnesses in Kalgoorlie expressed deep concern and dissatisfaction with the consultation process. I was very alarmed to see that consultation seemed to have taken place with local government only and not with people who work with those affected or people who are affected by this card. I was particularly alarmed during the course of the hearings in Kalgoorlie that first nations people were not adequately consulted in this process at all. Equally concerning was the feedback in Bundaberg. What we heard in Bundaberg was that the process was selective and secretive. It was difficult to access and not representative of the community.


It's not surprising to me that it was hard for people affected by this card to come forward and participate because, in many of the consultations, people felt stigmatised and unable to express their very real concerns about its rollout. My very dear friend and Labor colleague in the state parliament, Josie Farrer MP, the member for the Kimberley, has raised significant concerns about the trial based on the experience of her community. She has called for proper dialogue with her communities around implementation of the trial. I've spoken to Josie firsthand about how residents in her community have been adversely affected, particularly in the East Kimberley, and I've spoken to some of those residents myself.


It isn't worth the cost—some $25.5 million—nor is it worth the potential harm to the community to continue the rollout without being sure that it is delivering meaningful results. The best way to do this is, of course, to have a rigorous evaluation so we can be sure that, before proceeding with further rollouts, it is working. And I have to say, I have been very unsatisfied with the existing evaluations that have taken place. For one, the trials haven't been going long enough to enable a rigorous evaluation, and indeed they highlight the fact that the government is absolutely, doggedly, pursuing the implementation of this, irrespective of the outcomes for communities.


There is no evidence base to support their further rollout. The ORIMA evaluation, conducted in both Ceduna and East Kimberley, was flawed and inconclusive, and I support the concerns of the WA Council of Social Services, who raised significant concerns about the representativeness of the evaluations. In their submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, they point out that the extension of the trial has ignored the findings in wave 1 and wave 2 of the reports that the majority of participants indicated that their lives are worse since the implementation of the trials. 


If the government wants to continue with these trials, it needs to amend and change what's going on within them, because the simple fact is that many people have reported increased hardship as a result of being on the card. We know that 52 per cent reported running out of money to buy food and 26 per cent reported doing so fortnightly. Despite claims that crime has reduced, independent research by Monash shows the opposite. The Aboriginal Health Council of Western Australia also said:


Since the introduction of the cashless card in Kununurra there has been an increase in crime, an increase around elder abuse, an increase around soliciting and black market trades happening with service providers that can trade off the card for cash. So it hasn't dealt with the contentious issues that were identified; it has actually caused a major influx around other issues.


So, I am deeply concerned about the effectiveness of the existing trials and am increasingly concerned about the impact they are having in my home communities in Western Australia. We've seen problem after problem and criticism after criticism, which the government has simply glossed over. 


Only last week we saw residents of the Tiwi Islands off the coast of Darwin left without power for five days due to storms. This meant residents reliant on the cashless debit card were unable to pay for basics like food and fuel, and were left with no access to buy essential goods. This kind of situation is inevitable when you restrict access to cash. I could see on the television the obvious distress that people on the Tiwi Islands were feeling from not being able to feed their families or buy fuel and other essential items. And what was really apparent—and even worse, when you've restricted people's access to cash in this way—was that the minister and the department couldn't even agree on what to do about it at the time. 


The simple fact is cash is what gives communities and individuals flexibility. If you look out to the Goldfields, where you want to roll this trial out, you have to look at the microeconomies inside remote locations in places like the Ngaanyatjarra lands, where they have their own internal economies. I admit that I've seen gambling out there, but people also trade and use their cash for other essential items, be that bush tucker or anything else. The rollout is going to have a grave, grave impact on those economies that are very internal and inward-looking and have their own trade that goes on for the community's wellbeing. What we can see is terrible mismanagement, a lack of rigorous evaluation and a lack of understanding of the real situation of these communities from the current Liberal government. 


I have to say there are significant concerns about the impact of the cashless debit card on family violence. Police data in the East Kimberley shows that, far from being prevented, family and domestic violence rates have risen since the introduction of the debit card trial. There is similar data from Ceduna. This is police data from the state jurisdictions on the increase in domestic violence rates in those locations. Ideologically, the government might like to assume that this card is going to bring domestic violence rates down, but what we know is that financial control is used as a tool by perpetrators of domestic violence. We know that extra financial stress can lead to problems in the home and we know that women are most often the victims of domestic and family violence. We must be sure that no government contributes to this.


I'm very concerned that the social and economic harm of the debit card has not been given the consideration that it should have been. The trials have an impact on children. We know that some of our most vulnerable children are growing up in these regional and remote communities. Poverty and disadvantage make life far more challenging for children. I certainly know of situations where women with children were in danger of being evicted from their housing because of difficulties with the cashless debit card. Josie Farrer MLA spoke to me about those concerns.


We have a situation here where income support should be about ensuring that everyone, especially children, are able to live life with the basics that we all take for granted. All children, all people, have the right to food, shelter, medical care and education. We're not helping vulnerable families by simply giving them a card and taking away control of their finances. We don't fix disadvantage by stigmatising people who are on welfare. We know factors that contribute to disadvantage are complex. They are often intergenerational, deep and entrenched, so our approach should be about helping and supporting families, not about stigmatising them. It should be one of understanding, empowerment and building resilience in communities, such as we heard in the Closing the Gap approach this morning.


We want to see wraparound services and support for people on the trial, but currently they are inadequate to truly address the challenges that the people in these communities are feeling. The government must look to funding for rehabilitation and mental health services and support to accompany its agenda of rolling out this card further, but I sincerely hope that we can stop that from happening. I want to say that, if we are successful in stopping that from happening, the government should put its money where its mouth is and roll out those wraparound services anyway.


In addition, I want to see the government be more forward thinking in their approach to these trials. The government should find ways to transition people off using the cashless debit card. They should work with them proactively to lower the proportion of their payments that are on the card, rather than people having to apply to committees. We know that at the core of this we want financial literacy and independence. There should be a plan for people within these communities right now to transition off the trials.


There is a long and seemingly ever-growing list of concerns with the cashless debit card. Until these concerns are addressed, we cannot be sure that this very expensive trial is seeing results. We cannot solve entrenched social issues without taking a holistic approach to helping families, and that is manifestly missing from the government's approach.


We're moving amendments in the Senate to address some of these concerns. We want to create a new trial end date of 30 June 2019, limit it to two discrete trial areas and guarantee funding for the services in the trial sites. I call on the government and the crossbench to support these amendments. We will consider the introduction of new trials only if the government can demonstrate, in formal consultation with communities, robust and credible evaluation, and sound wraparound services to address the many factors that contribute to disadvantage. It's simply not possible for us to support the expansion of a program without the evidence that it works, and there has not been adequate evidence to show that. You talk about your support from communities but the simple fact is: this is selective; it is coming only from some voices within communities, and you need—




Senator Scullion:
  The elected leaders of the community in Ceduna!




Senator PRATT:
  Are you rejecting Josie Farrer as a leader of her community?




Senator Scullion:
  She doesn't live in Ceduna.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Leyonhjelm
):  Senator Scullion, order! Interjections are disorderly.




Senator PRATT:
  I take that interjection. Josie Farrer has many members of her own community and, indeed, her own family who have been affected by this trial. She lives in Halls Creek, very near the East Kimberley. She has children who live in the Kimberley and it is a day-to-day issue for her and her community. I've spoken to people who've been affected by the trial and I've seen examples of elder abuse that have taken place because of it.


It is inconceivable that this government would introduce further trials that could increase violence in remote communities, that could increase family and domestic violence, but currently that is what the evidence is showing. We must ensure that evaluation of these trials is robust enough— (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-02-08,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (11:21):  I would like to make very clear right from the start my absolute, total opposition to this piece of legislation and the opposition of the Australian Greens party as a whole. I think it is abhorrent, I think it is atrocious, I think it is demonising and I think it is very clear that it will not work. I accept that some, at least, who are promoting this are doing so with good intentions. I think it is very clear that some who are promoting it are doing so with the worst of intentions, to yet again put in place measures to try to blame people who are poor, to blame people who are carers, to blame people who are disabled, to blame people who are sole parents, to blame people who are unemployed, to try to make their lives even more difficult and to build political points around doing so. We can't pretend there is not a very long history of doing that in Australian politics and in this parliament. I am not saying that is the motivation of everybody that is putting this forward, but it is clearly part of what is happening here.


I know it's a very wise piece of advice, in regard to articles online in the Murdoch media outrage-generation machine, when people say, 'Don't read the comments,' but these things are specifically generated to create comment and to create outrage, and occasionally it is necessary to read the comments to see what is out there. And you don't need to spend very much time to see, whenever measures like this are put forward, the stream of abuse that comes forward from people vilifying people who are poor, who are receiving income support, who are on welfare—basically revelling in the idea of making life harder for them, of punishing them, of saying they deserve it.


If somehow or other we think it's a good measure, for anybody who might have issues to do with money management or issues to do with substance abuse or addiction, to compulsorily quarantine the vast majority of their income, continually, then let's do it to ourselves. Let's see how we like it, even with our oversized salaries, to have 80 per cent of them, 70 per cent of them or even 50 per cent of them quarantined and to be told, 'You can only spend this with a card that will identify you at these particular stores who've got the special contract that's making them lots of profit through the people who own the card, and you don't have discretion.' See how you like it. See how it would make you feel. For those of us who might have issues with money management, substance abuse or addiction: do you think that would actually help? Of course it wouldn't.


We've got the evidence. We've got the so-called experiment. We've seen, as my colleague Senator Siewert said. I don't need to have been here for the last 10 years to know she has been going on for the last 10 years about how this does not work and about how it causes more harm than good. Of course it assists some people to have their income managed. Of course it assists some people, whether it's their salary, social security payments or Centrelink payments—whatever it might be. Of course it can help some people. You provide that assistance where it's needed, where they want it, where they ask for it and where they've got support around them.


As some might know—I don't know which of you here would—once upon a time many years ago, I was a social worker in what was then called the Department of Social Security. The mechanism to be able to quarantine some aspects of people's unemployment payment or pension so that their rents were paid and so that other things were paid has always been there, and it's done with support specific to the individual on a case-by-case basis. To compulsorily put it across an entire community or, as is attempted through this bill most particularly, across the entire country—and that's where this will end up; let's not kid ourselves—and everybody who receives income support, with the very strong underlying implication that they can't be trusted with their money, or that it's not really their money, that it's somehow or other somebody else's money and they shouldn't really have a say in what happens with this money, because it's provided through government payments?


We all get paid through government payments. There's no shame in that. It's something people are entitled to. People are legally entitled to income support payments, whether it's sole parents; whether it's people with disability pensions; whether it's carers; whether it's people with family payments, some of which won't apply in this case but many others will. That's a legal entitlement. It's a lawful entitlement, something our community and parliament have agreed that people should get and for very good reasons. This inference sometimes very explicitly stated—'Well, it comes from a government payment; therefore, people shouldn't have a say on what they spend it on'—is appallingly authoritarian. We had a very eloquent speech from now ex-Senator Brandis—rather long, but eloquent—late yesterday noting the appalling shift towards authoritarianism on the Right. He was misrepresenting it on the Left, I might say, but nonetheless we will take that as a debating point. But what could be more authoritarian than a government saying: 'We're going to tell you how you can spend your money. We're going to tell you where you can spend your money'? This is extremely dangerous in all sorts of ways, but it's particularly dangerous right now for the individuals it will affect.


This is particularly relevant to my own state of Queensland because the next places that are being targeted for this include the communities of Hervey Bay and Bundaberg. I would like to really pay tribute to the many people in those communities in my state who are on income support themselves—people who by definition are already struggling; people, some of whom I have met, who in many cases are long-term carers or are on disability payments for the long term. If they couldn't manage their money, they would not be alive. They can manage their money way better, I would suggest, than pretty much any of us. I would like to see any of us in this place try to cope and survive on the amount of income those folks have for more than a month or two.


Of course there are individuals who can't do that, and they need support, but, if you want a group of people in the country who are good money managers, go to people who are on long-term income support payments, people who are carers, people who have disabilities. They'll tell you how to do it far better than a government can—particularly this government.


I went to Hervey Bay, probably about six months ago, before I was back in this place, with Senator Siewert. I'd like to thank her for her commitment to going to regional Queensland—it's a long way from Western Australia—to hear from the people directly in the community. These people from Hervey Bay and also from Bundaberg—I pay particular tribute to Anne Jackson and others; sorry if I've missed out other names—organised a group of people on a bus to travel all the way down from Bundaberg through Gin Gin to a public meeting in Hervey Bay about this very issue. These were all people directly affected. These were community campaigns by people who, by definition, are battlers, who organised and campaigned because they could see not only how it would affect them but the extreme dangers this measure would have, the damage it would do, the harm it would cause because of its compulsory nature. Let me reaffirm that: it's the compulsory nature of this.


It can work for some people in some circumstances with support and with proper analysis of each individual. But to just do this blanket authoritarian control, this delegitimisation of people's control over their own lives on such a monumental scale, honestly, how could anybody think that is actually going to help the majority of people? I would like to thank those people in Hervey Bay and Jenny Cameron, who drove Senator Siewert and me around that day, and Katherine Wilks—I know there are many other names I don't have. I can't remember the numbers, but it would have easily been over 100 people at that public meeting. You've just got to hear their stories of what it would mean, hear what their lives are like, what impacts this would have. People are already copping the crap of being abused, singled out, vilified, misrepresented, stereotyped and demonised because they're a carer, because they're on income support or they're unemployed. There's plenty of unemployment and underemployment in those regions, as we all know. The last thing they need is another volley of vitriol from the shock jocks, the corporate media and everybody else wanting to reinforce some myth that somehow they're a piece of crap when they're actually more resourceful than many.


To use another example, the City of Logan, just to the south of Brisbane, as those from South East Queensland would know, is a city and a region that's often unfairly stereotyped as being a high-welfare area and there's all the negativity that goes with that. I would like to mention an event that happened just a few weeks ago on 20 January. A group called the Anti-Poverty Network in collaboration with the 'say no to the cashless welfare card' team organised a day of support for people in the local community. This group has been sitting outside the local Centrelink offices in Logan once a week for many months now, just giving information. They're not handing out party-political information; they're giving information to people about their rights and how to engage with Centrelink. If this government wanted to properly help people who are on income support payments, how about it fix up the outrageous disgrace, the unbelievable disgrace, of the non-existent service for people trying to make a phone call through to Centrelink? And that's not a slur on the hardworking staff in Centrelink, who have to deal with very difficult circumstances, but come on. I've already mentioned this since coming back to this place. But 10 years ago I was in this place asking questions about how outrageous it was—the waiting times, the inability for people to get through. These are people who are already battlers on low incomes, and they can't get through to get information about their own income. I'd like to see any of us anytime we have a problem with our travel allowance, a flight or our salary payments or whatever, sit on the phone for an hour before somebody would talk to us. Let's see how long it would take before we decided to fix that. But, in 10 years, this problem has got a hundred times worse.


According to evidence from ACOSS provided to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry, this mechanism, this compulsory income management trial, costs about $10,000 per person for a 12-month period. The actual cost to the program over the forward estimates is unknown, because it's commercial-in-confidence. Let's not forget that—there's a bit of a commercial deal happening here as well. There's a valid line of inquiry on that, but I'll leave that because I want to talk about and focus on the people who are directly affected—the battlers, the powerless, who are being hit by this. So it's $10,000 per person per year. Newstart for a whole year is $14,000. Yet this government says we can't afford to increase that. It's been disgracefully declining in value for years. Maybe they don't want to put that $10,000 into increasing Newstart. How about putting it into providing proper, tailored support for people?


This information day, the community day in Logan on 20 January that I mentioned, simply provided opportunities for people from the community to get support. The event brought people experiencing hardship together with a whole lot of services in the area. There were agencies such as Multilink, whose key focus is on settlement of new people into the community; language support; help for aged and disability sectors; support for children, young people and families; and programs focusing on healthy lifestyles for people. Metro South HHS provided free dental checks to over 20 children and advice to adults and information about oral health. A number of people received professional legal advice. Social workers helped people who needed guidance relating to homelessness and housing. An Auslan interpreter assisted with interviews and general translation. The Life Without Barriers group discussed their foster care program. The Retail and Fast Food Workers Union was available to talk to anyone experiencing workplace difficulties—an area that many people who are underemployed or on casual work and who are on and off income support payments have to engage with. These services were complemented by the Anti-Poverty Network Qld booth, which was run off its feet for most of the day by people needing guidance relating to Centrelink and Job Network agency issues.


All of this was done by volunteers, most of them on income support payments themselves. If you've got people in a community like Logan, who are on income support payments themselves, who can organise all of these things in the community for people for free, and the best this government can do is come up with this punitive, controlling mechanism to take away people's control over their own lives and what they spend their money on compulsorily—no way off it—how about you put that money into providing services? Clearly, the need is there. It's left up to the people on welfare to organise it and provide it themselves, because it's not being provided by this government. If you want to try and get it from this government, you spend two hours on the phone to Centrelink, and then your call drops out and you've got to call again. That's about the best this lot can do.


This is the same tired old script: pick on the powerless, bash the battlers. We had lots of media coverage about a vehicle called the 'Battler Bus' driving through regional Queensland at the last state election. I'd like to see the folks who travelled on that bus. It will be interesting to see how they vote on this legislation, because it's the battlers in regional Queensland who are going to cop it from these measures.


This is a clear test. Do people actually care about the lived experience of the battlers, or is this going to be another huge, monumental Big Brother: 'We know what's best for you'? Even with the best will in the world—let's forget about what is pretty obvious political pointscoring being done here by some in the government. The old pick-on-the-stereotype-of-the-dole-bludger mechanism has been tried and true for many years. Let's put that to one side. Will you actually support the battlers in their community by helping them as individuals, rather than this monumental Big Brother sledgehammer dropping down over an entire region saying, 'This is what we're going to do to all of you'? If you don't support it, it means there's something wrong with you. It means you're part of the problem. Let's see how the crucial people on the crossbenches vote with regard to this.


Now, it is important to look at the evidence. I appreciate that some from the government, with good intentions, have pointed to people in individual communities who are supporting this measure. I can understand, on the surface, why people would think: 'Well, this might work. Other things aren't working; let's try this.' But the big thing is it's compulsory. It doesn't work. I'd hate to turn into an old social worker 30 years down the track, but the evidence for so long—so long—has been that, if you do this, it does not work; it does more harm than good.


We've got the evidence from the Northern Territory intervention, as Senator Siewert mentioned. You could call that an experiment, which, as usual, was inflicted on Aboriginal people. It didn't work. I'm sure there were some individuals it helped—I'm not disputing that—but, overall, community wise, it did not work. And it cost a fortune. It worked for some of the people who got paid big salaries, coming in from outside. It worked for them; it did not work for those communities as a whole. 


Talking about listening to the evidence, I will remind this chamber—and I will never forget this—in the period just before I finished in this chamber last time around, of the tabling of the Little children are sacred report and how, suddenly, overnight, we had to have this massive intervention on Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. We had to beg and kick to just get a Senate inquiry on the Friday before the legislation was heard the following week, debated and passed in this chamber. 


The Senate committee that I was part of—I think Senator Siewert was part of it as well—asked to hear from the authors of the Little children are sacred report, the report that was meant to be the trigger for all this, and the committee wouldn't allow us to hear from them. It blocked us hearing from the people who wrote that report. We had to have a special phone hook-up at lunchtime, outside of the committee, so that we could hear from them directly, and they told us all the things that were wrong with this approach. Sadly, they were proven right. Let's not repeat that mistake again.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2018-02-08,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (11:41):  I'm delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this very important debate. Before I get to the substance of the government's program and the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, I want to take the time to respond to two things that Senator Bartlett said in his contribution to this debate. The first I'll deal with very briefly, because I'm sure, and I hope, it was just a throwaway political line designed to appeal to the conspiracy theorists among the Greens membership. 


Senator Bartlett, while acknowledging there was some goodwill and some good reasons why people would support a policy like this, also said that he suspected that there was another reason why the government was proposing a policy like this—that it was because of the online comments on News Limited websites. It's a fairly extraordinary thing for a senator in this chamber to suggest that the federal government has a major policy for addressing disadvantage, substance abuse, domestic violence and other problems that is motivated or inspired by online comments on news websites. That is, seriously, just gutter politics. This serious issue requires a much greater and more serious engagement than that. 


But, moving to the more substantive, philosophical issues that Senator Bartlett raised, I noted with interest that, while Senator Bartlett was speaking, Senator Leyonhjelm was in the chair. I assume that Senator Leyonhjelm has just gone to his office to get a membership form to deliver to Senator Bartlett, because many of the sentiments expressed by Senator Bartlett in his speech were very libertarian in nature. He used phrases like 'Big Brother' and 'authoritarian'. He said that it is better for people, rather than government, to have control over their own lives and that people know how to spend their own money better than the government does. These are the kinds of things you expect to hear at a Liberal Democratic Party preselection or branch meeting, not usually from a Greens senator.


Of course, the challenge would be to see whether Senator Bartlett holds these views consistently and whether he'd apply them to other areas of policy. If Senator Bartlett really does believe that people know how to spend their money better than the government does, why does he, and his party, advocate higher taxes—taking more money from people so that the government can spend it on their behalf? Why wouldn't he instead argue that the government should cut taxes and return money to people and allow them to spend it in their own best interests, as he says they're better able to do?


   If he really believed that people are better at controlling their own lives than government is and that they should be allowed to run their own lives then why would he and his party support so many nanny-state, interventionist initiatives in the public health space? Whether it comes to smoking, drinking or eating fatty or sugary foods, the Greens party is a consistent source of more ideas to control people's lives more minutely. It seems the only area—

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,6,1
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (11:01):  As we debate today the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, I want to say at the outset that Labor's approach to this is to look to community-driven initiatives to tackle chronic alcohol abuse. The key word here should be 'community', not engaging in top-down approaches. Labor has significant concerns with regard to the existing rollout, notwithstanding the fact that we have agreed for the trials to continue.


As we heard this morning at the Close the Gap breakfast, what we need to do to be successful in engaging with the prevention of alcohol abuse and other forms of community disadvantage is to listen directly to affected communities. We have to empower them and resource their own solutions, particularly through Indigenous-controlled organisations. We should not be engaging in approaches that take the power away from local communities. We in this place mustn't fool ourselves into believing that income management is in and of itself the solution to entrenched disadvantage, and, most importantly, we mustn't forget that the vast majority of people on income support are perfectly capable of managing their own finances. I can't help but also reflect on the fact that, for many people on income support, their finances are manifestly inadequate, which is a significant driver behind poverty, not poor financial management or alcohol or drug abuse.


Labor is not supporting this bill in its current form. I want to take issue with some of the allegations put by the government in this debate yesterday—that somehow Labor had done a backflip because of the Batman by-election. Nothing could be further from the truth. Labor was very clear in its position last year, while parliament was still sitting—long before we looked to a by-election in Batman.


We support the continuation of the existing cashless debit card trial in both Ceduna and the Kimberley, and that's not without reservation. But we do understand that the existing trials need to be properly evaluated, so we've looked to amendments to extend the dates of the trial to ensure that proper evaluation can take place to judge the success or otherwise of the trial. On that note, we don't support the further rollout of the card to new sites in Bundaberg and the Goldfields. We certainly don't support the nationwide rollout of a cashless debit card. We also believe that it is of the utmost importance that wraparound services are in place to ensure that families receive the much needed support when participating in this trial. And, as highlighted already in this debate, these frankly are services that these communities should have a right to expect, irrespective of the existence of the card.


Our commitment in Labor is to consult with local communities about programs like this. We are committed to listening when they raise concerns. We're not interested in a top-down approach. We can see in the recommendations of the Senate inquiry, and indeed from our own consultations with local communities, that we simply cannot support the bill before us as it stands.


The recent Senate inquiry heard that there are huge gaps in the consultation process. For example, witnesses in Kalgoorlie expressed deep concern and dissatisfaction with the consultation process. I was very alarmed to see that consultation seemed to have taken place with local government only and not with people who work with those affected or people who are affected by this card. I was particularly alarmed during the course of the hearings in Kalgoorlie that first nations people were not adequately consulted in this process at all. Equally concerning was the feedback in Bundaberg. What we heard in Bundaberg was that the process was selective and secretive. It was difficult to access and not representative of the community.


It's not surprising to me that it was hard for people affected by this card to come forward and participate because, in many of the consultations, people felt stigmatised and unable to express their very real concerns about its rollout. My very dear friend and Labor colleague in the state parliament, Josie Farrer MP, the member for the Kimberley, has raised significant concerns about the trial based on the experience of her community. She has called for proper dialogue with her communities around implementation of the trial. I've spoken to Josie firsthand about how residents in her community have been adversely affected, particularly in the East Kimberley, and I've spoken to some of those residents myself.


It isn't worth the cost—some $25.5 million—nor is it worth the potential harm to the community to continue the rollout without being sure that it is delivering meaningful results. The best way to do this is, of course, to have a rigorous evaluation so we can be sure that, before proceeding with further rollouts, it is working. And I have to say, I have been very unsatisfied with the existing evaluations that have taken place. For one, the trials haven't been going long enough to enable a rigorous evaluation, and indeed they highlight the fact that the government is absolutely, doggedly, pursuing the implementation of this, irrespective of the outcomes for communities.


There is no evidence base to support their further rollout. The ORIMA evaluation, conducted in both Ceduna and East Kimberley, was flawed and inconclusive, and I support the concerns of the WA Council of Social Services, who raised significant concerns about the representativeness of the evaluations. In their submission to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, they point out that the extension of the trial has ignored the findings in wave 1 and wave 2 of the reports that the majority of participants indicated that their lives are worse since the implementation of the trials. 


If the government wants to continue with these trials, it needs to amend and change what's going on within them, because the simple fact is that many people have reported increased hardship as a result of being on the card. We know that 52 per cent reported running out of money to buy food and 26 per cent reported doing so fortnightly. Despite claims that crime has reduced, independent research by Monash shows the opposite. The Aboriginal Health Council of Western Australia also said:


Since the introduction of the cashless card in Kununurra there has been an increase in crime, an increase around elder abuse, an increase around soliciting and black market trades happening with service providers that can trade off the card for cash. So it hasn't dealt with the contentious issues that were identified; it has actually caused a major influx around other issues.


So, I am deeply concerned about the effectiveness of the existing trials and am increasingly concerned about the impact they are having in my home communities in Western Australia. We've seen problem after problem and criticism after criticism, which the government has simply glossed over. 


Only last week we saw residents of the Tiwi Islands off the coast of Darwin left without power for five days due to storms. This meant residents reliant on the cashless debit card were unable to pay for basics like food and fuel, and were left with no access to buy essential goods. This kind of situation is inevitable when you restrict access to cash. I could see on the television the obvious distress that people on the Tiwi Islands were feeling from not being able to feed their families or buy fuel and other essential items. And what was really apparent—and even worse, when you've restricted people's access to cash in this way—was that the minister and the department couldn't even agree on what to do about it at the time. 


The simple fact is cash is what gives communities and individuals flexibility. If you look out to the Goldfields, where you want to roll this trial out, you have to look at the microeconomies inside remote locations in places like the Ngaanyatjarra lands, where they have their own internal economies. I admit that I've seen gambling out there, but people also trade and use their cash for other essential items, be that bush tucker or anything else. The rollout is going to have a grave, grave impact on those economies that are very internal and inward-looking and have their own trade that goes on for the community's wellbeing. What we can see is terrible mismanagement, a lack of rigorous evaluation and a lack of understanding of the real situation of these communities from the current Liberal government. 


I have to say there are significant concerns about the impact of the cashless debit card on family violence. Police data in the East Kimberley shows that, far from being prevented, family and domestic violence rates have risen since the introduction of the debit card trial. There is similar data from Ceduna. This is police data from the state jurisdictions on the increase in domestic violence rates in those locations. Ideologically, the government might like to assume that this card is going to bring domestic violence rates down, but what we know is that financial control is used as a tool by perpetrators of domestic violence. We know that extra financial stress can lead to problems in the home and we know that women are most often the victims of domestic and family violence. We must be sure that no government contributes to this.


I'm very concerned that the social and economic harm of the debit card has not been given the consideration that it should have been. The trials have an impact on children. We know that some of our most vulnerable children are growing up in these regional and remote communities. Poverty and disadvantage make life far more challenging for children. I certainly know of situations where women with children were in danger of being evicted from their housing because of difficulties with the cashless debit card. Josie Farrer MLA spoke to me about those concerns.


We have a situation here where income support should be about ensuring that everyone, especially children, are able to live life with the basics that we all take for granted. All children, all people, have the right to food, shelter, medical care and education. We're not helping vulnerable families by simply giving them a card and taking away control of their finances. We don't fix disadvantage by stigmatising people who are on welfare. We know factors that contribute to disadvantage are complex. They are often intergenerational, deep and entrenched, so our approach should be about helping and supporting families, not about stigmatising them. It should be one of understanding, empowerment and building resilience in communities, such as we heard in the Closing the Gap approach this morning.


We want to see wraparound services and support for people on the trial, but currently they are inadequate to truly address the challenges that the people in these communities are feeling. The government must look to funding for rehabilitation and mental health services and support to accompany its agenda of rolling out this card further, but I sincerely hope that we can stop that from happening. I want to say that, if we are successful in stopping that from happening, the government should put its money where its mouth is and roll out those wraparound services anyway.


In addition, I want to see the government be more forward thinking in their approach to these trials. The government should find ways to transition people off using the cashless debit card. They should work with them proactively to lower the proportion of their payments that are on the card, rather than people having to apply to committees. We know that at the core of this we want financial literacy and independence. There should be a plan for people within these communities right now to transition off the trials.


There is a long and seemingly ever-growing list of concerns with the cashless debit card. Until these concerns are addressed, we cannot be sure that this very expensive trial is seeing results. We cannot solve entrenched social issues without taking a holistic approach to helping families, and that is manifestly missing from the government's approach.


We're moving amendments in the Senate to address some of these concerns. We want to create a new trial end date of 30 June 2019, limit it to two discrete trial areas and guarantee funding for the services in the trial sites. I call on the government and the crossbench to support these amendments. We will consider the introduction of new trials only if the government can demonstrate, in formal consultation with communities, robust and credible evaluation, and sound wraparound services to address the many factors that contribute to disadvantage. It's simply not possible for us to support the expansion of a program without the evidence that it works, and there has not been adequate evidence to show that. You talk about your support from communities but the simple fact is: this is selective; it is coming only from some voices within communities, and you need—




Senator Scullion:
  The elected leaders of the community in Ceduna!




Senator PRATT:
  Are you rejecting Josie Farrer as a leader of her community?




Senator Scullion:
  She doesn't live in Ceduna.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Leyonhjelm
):  Senator Scullion, order! Interjections are disorderly.




Senator PRATT:
  I take that interjection. Josie Farrer has many members of her own community and, indeed, her own family who have been affected by this trial. She lives in Halls Creek, very near the East Kimberley. She has children who live in the Kimberley and it is a day-to-day issue for her and her community. I've spoken to people who've been affected by the trial and I've seen examples of elder abuse that have taken place because of it.


It is inconceivable that this government would introduce further trials that could increase violence in remote communities, that could increase family and domestic violence, but currently that is what the evidence is showing. We must ensure that evaluation of these trials is robust enough— (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-02-08,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (11:21):  I would like to make very clear right from the start my absolute, total opposition to this piece of legislation and the opposition of the Australian Greens party as a whole. I think it is abhorrent, I think it is atrocious, I think it is demonising and I think it is very clear that it will not work. I accept that some, at least, who are promoting this are doing so with good intentions. I think it is very clear that some who are promoting it are doing so with the worst of intentions, to yet again put in place measures to try to blame people who are poor, to blame people who are carers, to blame people who are disabled, to blame people who are sole parents, to blame people who are unemployed, to try to make their lives even more difficult and to build political points around doing so. We can't pretend there is not a very long history of doing that in Australian politics and in this parliament. I am not saying that is the motivation of everybody that is putting this forward, but it is clearly part of what is happening here.


I know it's a very wise piece of advice, in regard to articles online in the Murdoch media outrage-generation machine, when people say, 'Don't read the comments,' but these things are specifically generated to create comment and to create outrage, and occasionally it is necessary to read the comments to see what is out there. And you don't need to spend very much time to see, whenever measures like this are put forward, the stream of abuse that comes forward from people vilifying people who are poor, who are receiving income support, who are on welfare—basically revelling in the idea of making life harder for them, of punishing them, of saying they deserve it.


If somehow or other we think it's a good measure, for anybody who might have issues to do with money management or issues to do with substance abuse or addiction, to compulsorily quarantine the vast majority of their income, continually, then let's do it to ourselves. Let's see how we like it, even with our oversized salaries, to have 80 per cent of them, 70 per cent of them or even 50 per cent of them quarantined and to be told, 'You can only spend this with a card that will identify you at these particular stores who've got the special contract that's making them lots of profit through the people who own the card, and you don't have discretion.' See how you like it. See how it would make you feel. For those of us who might have issues with money management, substance abuse or addiction: do you think that would actually help? Of course it wouldn't.


We've got the evidence. We've got the so-called experiment. We've seen, as my colleague Senator Siewert said. I don't need to have been here for the last 10 years to know she has been going on for the last 10 years about how this does not work and about how it causes more harm than good. Of course it assists some people to have their income managed. Of course it assists some people, whether it's their salary, social security payments or Centrelink payments—whatever it might be. Of course it can help some people. You provide that assistance where it's needed, where they want it, where they ask for it and where they've got support around them.


As some might know—I don't know which of you here would—once upon a time many years ago, I was a social worker in what was then called the Department of Social Security. The mechanism to be able to quarantine some aspects of people's unemployment payment or pension so that their rents were paid and so that other things were paid has always been there, and it's done with support specific to the individual on a case-by-case basis. To compulsorily put it across an entire community or, as is attempted through this bill most particularly, across the entire country—and that's where this will end up; let's not kid ourselves—and everybody who receives income support, with the very strong underlying implication that they can't be trusted with their money, or that it's not really their money, that it's somehow or other somebody else's money and they shouldn't really have a say in what happens with this money, because it's provided through government payments?


We all get paid through government payments. There's no shame in that. It's something people are entitled to. People are legally entitled to income support payments, whether it's sole parents; whether it's people with disability pensions; whether it's carers; whether it's people with family payments, some of which won't apply in this case but many others will. That's a legal entitlement. It's a lawful entitlement, something our community and parliament have agreed that people should get and for very good reasons. This inference sometimes very explicitly stated—'Well, it comes from a government payment; therefore, people shouldn't have a say on what they spend it on'—is appallingly authoritarian. We had a very eloquent speech from now ex-Senator Brandis—rather long, but eloquent—late yesterday noting the appalling shift towards authoritarianism on the Right. He was misrepresenting it on the Left, I might say, but nonetheless we will take that as a debating point. But what could be more authoritarian than a government saying: 'We're going to tell you how you can spend your money. We're going to tell you where you can spend your money'? This is extremely dangerous in all sorts of ways, but it's particularly dangerous right now for the individuals it will affect.


This is particularly relevant to my own state of Queensland because the next places that are being targeted for this include the communities of Hervey Bay and Bundaberg. I would like to really pay tribute to the many people in those communities in my state who are on income support themselves—people who by definition are already struggling; people, some of whom I have met, who in many cases are long-term carers or are on disability payments for the long term. If they couldn't manage their money, they would not be alive. They can manage their money way better, I would suggest, than pretty much any of us. I would like to see any of us in this place try to cope and survive on the amount of income those folks have for more than a month or two.


Of course there are individuals who can't do that, and they need support, but, if you want a group of people in the country who are good money managers, go to people who are on long-term income support payments, people who are carers, people who have disabilities. They'll tell you how to do it far better than a government can—particularly this government.


I went to Hervey Bay, probably about six months ago, before I was back in this place, with Senator Siewert. I'd like to thank her for her commitment to going to regional Queensland—it's a long way from Western Australia—to hear from the people directly in the community. These people from Hervey Bay and also from Bundaberg—I pay particular tribute to Anne Jackson and others; sorry if I've missed out other names—organised a group of people on a bus to travel all the way down from Bundaberg through Gin Gin to a public meeting in Hervey Bay about this very issue. These were all people directly affected. These were community campaigns by people who, by definition, are battlers, who organised and campaigned because they could see not only how it would affect them but the extreme dangers this measure would have, the damage it would do, the harm it would cause because of its compulsory nature. Let me reaffirm that: it's the compulsory nature of this.


It can work for some people in some circumstances with support and with proper analysis of each individual. But to just do this blanket authoritarian control, this delegitimisation of people's control over their own lives on such a monumental scale, honestly, how could anybody think that is actually going to help the majority of people? I would like to thank those people in Hervey Bay and Jenny Cameron, who drove Senator Siewert and me around that day, and Katherine Wilks—I know there are many other names I don't have. I can't remember the numbers, but it would have easily been over 100 people at that public meeting. You've just got to hear their stories of what it would mean, hear what their lives are like, what impacts this would have. People are already copping the crap of being abused, singled out, vilified, misrepresented, stereotyped and demonised because they're a carer, because they're on income support or they're unemployed. There's plenty of unemployment and underemployment in those regions, as we all know. The last thing they need is another volley of vitriol from the shock jocks, the corporate media and everybody else wanting to reinforce some myth that somehow they're a piece of crap when they're actually more resourceful than many.


To use another example, the City of Logan, just to the south of Brisbane, as those from South East Queensland would know, is a city and a region that's often unfairly stereotyped as being a high-welfare area and there's all the negativity that goes with that. I would like to mention an event that happened just a few weeks ago on 20 January. A group called the Anti-Poverty Network in collaboration with the 'say no to the cashless welfare card' team organised a day of support for people in the local community. This group has been sitting outside the local Centrelink offices in Logan once a week for many months now, just giving information. They're not handing out party-political information; they're giving information to people about their rights and how to engage with Centrelink. If this government wanted to properly help people who are on income support payments, how about it fix up the outrageous disgrace, the unbelievable disgrace, of the non-existent service for people trying to make a phone call through to Centrelink? And that's not a slur on the hardworking staff in Centrelink, who have to deal with very difficult circumstances, but come on. I've already mentioned this since coming back to this place. But 10 years ago I was in this place asking questions about how outrageous it was—the waiting times, the inability for people to get through. These are people who are already battlers on low incomes, and they can't get through to get information about their own income. I'd like to see any of us anytime we have a problem with our travel allowance, a flight or our salary payments or whatever, sit on the phone for an hour before somebody would talk to us. Let's see how long it would take before we decided to fix that. But, in 10 years, this problem has got a hundred times worse.


According to evidence from ACOSS provided to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry, this mechanism, this compulsory income management trial, costs about $10,000 per person for a 12-month period. The actual cost to the program over the forward estimates is unknown, because it's commercial-in-confidence. Let's not forget that—there's a bit of a commercial deal happening here as well. There's a valid line of inquiry on that, but I'll leave that because I want to talk about and focus on the people who are directly affected—the battlers, the powerless, who are being hit by this. So it's $10,000 per person per year. Newstart for a whole year is $14,000. Yet this government says we can't afford to increase that. It's been disgracefully declining in value for years. Maybe they don't want to put that $10,000 into increasing Newstart. How about putting it into providing proper, tailored support for people?


This information day, the community day in Logan on 20 January that I mentioned, simply provided opportunities for people from the community to get support. The event brought people experiencing hardship together with a whole lot of services in the area. There were agencies such as Multilink, whose key focus is on settlement of new people into the community; language support; help for aged and disability sectors; support for children, young people and families; and programs focusing on healthy lifestyles for people. Metro South HHS provided free dental checks to over 20 children and advice to adults and information about oral health. A number of people received professional legal advice. Social workers helped people who needed guidance relating to homelessness and housing. An Auslan interpreter assisted with interviews and general translation. The Life Without Barriers group discussed their foster care program. The Retail and Fast Food Workers Union was available to talk to anyone experiencing workplace difficulties—an area that many people who are underemployed or on casual work and who are on and off income support payments have to engage with. These services were complemented by the Anti-Poverty Network Qld booth, which was run off its feet for most of the day by people needing guidance relating to Centrelink and Job Network agency issues.


All of this was done by volunteers, most of them on income support payments themselves. If you've got people in a community like Logan, who are on income support payments themselves, who can organise all of these things in the community for people for free, and the best this government can do is come up with this punitive, controlling mechanism to take away people's control over their own lives and what they spend their money on compulsorily—no way off it—how about you put that money into providing services? Clearly, the need is there. It's left up to the people on welfare to organise it and provide it themselves, because it's not being provided by this government. If you want to try and get it from this government, you spend two hours on the phone to Centrelink, and then your call drops out and you've got to call again. That's about the best this lot can do.


This is the same tired old script: pick on the powerless, bash the battlers. We had lots of media coverage about a vehicle called the 'Battler Bus' driving through regional Queensland at the last state election. I'd like to see the folks who travelled on that bus. It will be interesting to see how they vote on this legislation, because it's the battlers in regional Queensland who are going to cop it from these measures.


This is a clear test. Do people actually care about the lived experience of the battlers, or is this going to be another huge, monumental Big Brother: 'We know what's best for you'? Even with the best will in the world—let's forget about what is pretty obvious political pointscoring being done here by some in the government. The old pick-on-the-stereotype-of-the-dole-bludger mechanism has been tried and true for many years. Let's put that to one side. Will you actually support the battlers in their community by helping them as individuals, rather than this monumental Big Brother sledgehammer dropping down over an entire region saying, 'This is what we're going to do to all of you'? If you don't support it, it means there's something wrong with you. It means you're part of the problem. Let's see how the crucial people on the crossbenches vote with regard to this.


Now, it is important to look at the evidence. I appreciate that some from the government, with good intentions, have pointed to people in individual communities who are supporting this measure. I can understand, on the surface, why people would think: 'Well, this might work. Other things aren't working; let's try this.' But the big thing is it's compulsory. It doesn't work. I'd hate to turn into an old social worker 30 years down the track, but the evidence for so long—so long—has been that, if you do this, it does not work; it does more harm than good.


We've got the evidence from the Northern Territory intervention, as Senator Siewert mentioned. You could call that an experiment, which, as usual, was inflicted on Aboriginal people. It didn't work. I'm sure there were some individuals it helped—I'm not disputing that—but, overall, community wise, it did not work. And it cost a fortune. It worked for some of the people who got paid big salaries, coming in from outside. It worked for them; it did not work for those communities as a whole. 


Talking about listening to the evidence, I will remind this chamber—and I will never forget this—in the period just before I finished in this chamber last time around, of the tabling of the Little children are sacred report and how, suddenly, overnight, we had to have this massive intervention on Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. We had to beg and kick to just get a Senate inquiry on the Friday before the legislation was heard the following week, debated and passed in this chamber. 


The Senate committee that I was part of—I think Senator Siewert was part of it as well—asked to hear from the authors of the Little children are sacred report, the report that was meant to be the trigger for all this, and the committee wouldn't allow us to hear from them. It blocked us hearing from the people who wrote that report. We had to have a special phone hook-up at lunchtime, outside of the committee, so that we could hear from them directly, and they told us all the things that were wrong with this approach. Sadly, they were proven right. Let's not repeat that mistake again.

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (11:41):  I'm delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to this very important debate. Before I get to the substance of the government's program and the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, I want to take the time to respond to two things that Senator Bartlett said in his contribution to this debate. The first I'll deal with very briefly, because I'm sure, and I hope, it was just a throwaway political line designed to appeal to the conspiracy theorists among the Greens membership. 


Senator Bartlett, while acknowledging there was some goodwill and some good reasons why people would support a policy like this, also said that he suspected that there was another reason why the government was proposing a policy like this—that it was because of the online comments on News Limited websites. It's a fairly extraordinary thing for a senator in this chamber to suggest that the federal government has a major policy for addressing disadvantage, substance abuse, domestic violence and other problems that is motivated or inspired by online comments on news websites. That is, seriously, just gutter politics. This serious issue requires a much greater and more serious engagement than that. 


But, moving to the more substantive, philosophical issues that Senator Bartlett raised, I noted with interest that, while Senator Bartlett was speaking, Senator Leyonhjelm was in the chair. I assume that Senator Leyonhjelm has just gone to his office to get a membership form to deliver to Senator Bartlett, because many of the sentiments expressed by Senator Bartlett in his speech were very libertarian in nature. He used phrases like 'Big Brother' and 'authoritarian'. He said that it is better for people, rather than government, to have control over their own lives and that people know how to spend their own money better than the government does. These are the kinds of things you expect to hear at a Liberal Democratic Party preselection or branch meeting, not usually from a Greens senator.


Of course, the challenge would be to see whether Senator Bartlett holds these views consistently and whether he'd apply them to other areas of policy. If Senator Bartlett really does believe that people know how to spend their money better than the government does, why does he, and his party, advocate higher taxes—taking more money from people so that the government can spend it on their behalf? Why wouldn't he instead argue that the government should cut taxes and return money to people and allow them to spend it in their own best interests, as he says they're better able to do?


   If he really believed that people are better at controlling their own lives than government is and that they should be allowed to run their own lives then why would he and his party support so many nanny-state, interventionist initiatives in the public health space?

At the end of the motion, add ""but in respect of the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2017, the bill be referred to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 27 April 2018"".


This is Senator Steele-John's portfolio area. He has had a number of concerns raised with him from constituents about some of the provisions in this bill and he wants to refer it to committee. We know it's on the red for today, and I understand that's one of the reasons why the government isn't keen for this to go to committee. But Senator Steele-John feels very strongly that this should have a relatively short inquiry, given the issues that are involved.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Acting Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:47):  I can appreciate Senator Siewert's concerns, but the opposition is concerned that there not be any further delay in relation to these measures. We had agreed with the government to facilitate as quickly as possible bringing in better arrangements to manage these issues. Unfortunately, this could have been referred back in December, and, had it occurred back then, we might've been in a position to address it in more detail. But I'm sure also, in relation to the Greens senator dealing with this matter, there have been many investigations addressing these very serious issues that have informed this legislation now. In the absence of any particular or specific new matters to justify anything that will cause further delay, the opposition is opposed to this motion being amended.

That the Senate—


(a) notes that:


   (i) on 30 October 2017, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) draft report for the Communications Sector Market Study recommended that 'the Government consider whether NBN Co should continue to be obliged to recover its full cost of investment through its prices', and that other options should be examined, including direct budget funding,


   (ii) the requirement on NBN Co to make a commercial return is compromising its ability to deliver a fast, reliable, affordable, and future-proof network to all Australians,


   (iii) the connectivity virtual circuit (CVC) charge, levied by NBN Co on Retail Service Providers (RSPs), is necessitating that RSPs choose between quality (reliability, speed and congestion) and affordability of available services, and


   (iv) on 16 January 2018, the Government released its response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, in which it reaffirmed its commitment to rollout the Multi Technology Mix with the existing business model; and


(b) calls on the Government to accept the ACCC's recommendations to:


   (i) reconsider whether NBN Co should be obliged to recover its full cost of investment through its prices, in light of the impact that this obligation is having on quality of internet services being delivered to Australians, and


   (ii) examine other options for funding the NBN, including direct budget funding.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (11:51):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  The Australian government recognises the importance of affordable access to telecommunications. By rolling out the NBN more quickly and at less cost, millions of Australians now have vastly approved access to high-speed broadband, but the economic reality of building a new generation network means that somebody does have to pay for it. The government has worked to ensure that Australians will pay less for the internet than would have been the case if the previous Labor government's model had been pursued. Through the government's incremental upgrade approach to the rollout, better broadband will be delivered across Australia six years sooner than would have been the case otherwise, at $30 billion less cost to taxpayers and without the need for home internet bills to climb by more than $500 a year.

That the Senate—


(a) notes that:


   (i) on 7 December 2017, the Senate passed a motion for an order for the production of documents (OPD) relating to correspondence between the Commonwealth and its Australian contractors on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, and


   (ii) the order related to parts of contracts, correspondence, reports, memos or photographs relating to accommodation and services being delivered at West Lorengau;


(b) further notes that:


   (i) the documents were sought following concerns expressed by advocates and eyewitnesses regarding the standards of accommodation at West Lorengau, including incomplete fencing and plumbing, intermittent power and water, and the sufficiency of the health and other services being delivered, particularly as compared to previous services delivered at the Manus Island regional processing centre,


   (ii) according to the UNHCR's fact sheet on Manus Island, updated on 21 January 2018, many of these concerns are ongoing,


   (iii) on 17 January 2018, the then-Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs (Senator Birmingham) released a two-page response from the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Dutton), but no documents were returned, and


   (iv) the response stated that the release of the documents would be contrary to the public interest, and 'should be done on the grounds that the disclosure could be reasonably expected to cause damage to Australia's international relations with PNG';


(c) acknowledges that the question of what constitutes a reasonable expectation of damage to international relations has been the subject of proceedings in the Federal Court, specifically in Secretary, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade v Paul Whittaker (2005), where the court stated that 'Damage to international relations might reasonably be expected where the disclosure of a document may disclose sensitive information so as to cause, or reasonably be expected to cause, actual and significant damage ... the test is not whether there is a risk of damage to international relations; the test requires a higher degree of certainty of damage';


(d) does not accept that the order for the production of documents made on 7 December 2017 has been adequately dealt with, insofar as the material requested would, by necessity, include a range of information that has no bearing on Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea;


(e) does not accept that public interest immunity has been appropriately advanced, and calls on the Minister to review the nature of the documents ordered on 7 December 2017, and apply a higher test of real risk rather than hypothesised risk; and


(f) orders that there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, by 9 am on 19 March 2018, any correspondence requested on 7 December 2017 which meets the proper test.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  The government does not support this motion. Unilateral disclosure by Australia of information pertaining to regional processing arrangements would undermine Papua New Guinea's confidence in Australia, jeopardising our good working relationship and the policies which operate under Operation Sovereign Borders. Sovereign governments do not expect other governments to unilaterally release information which pertains to important parts of their relationship. The coalition government's strong and consistent border protection policies have saved countless lives. Australia's strong relationship with Papua New Guinea is a critical part of this.

  The government does not support this inquiry, as it is unnecessary. Australia's offshore petroleum industry is one of the safest in the world, with some of the lowest injury rates. Australia's independent, expertise based regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, regulates health and safety in the industry. While broadly consistent with the national Work Health and Safety Act, this regime has additional specific requirements to address the high-hazard, high-risk nature of offshore activities and applies duties of care to a more specific set of persons in more detail.

IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL AMENDMENT BILL 2017


SECOND READING SPEECH


Australia has a world-class food safety management system. Our exported food is highly sought after internationally due to our world-class food safety reputation. This benefits our farmers, our economy, and our nation as a leading exporter of high quality safe food. It is essential that we ensure food being brought into Australia is safe. As globalisation changes how food is traded around the world, we need to strengthen our laws to meet the changing landscape.


Australia imports food for a variety of reasons. In 2015-16, we imported $16 billion worth of food. In the same period, Australia exported $40 billion worth of food. Some food is imported into Australia as ingredients to be used in manufacturing of food, some of which is consumed in Australia and some is exported, contributing to our prosperity. For both our economic prosperity through exports, and for the safety of Australians, ensuring all food brought into Australia is safe is a must.


The hepatitis A outbreak in 2015 linked to imported frozen berries highlighted the limitations in our imported food safety management system in identifying and responding to new food safety risks and ensuring importers are accountable for importing safe food across their supply chain. This Bill will address these limitations to modernise the system ensuring we continue to have a robust world-class food safety management system.


Food safety management systems are based on science. Some food risks you can't see. We know for some food, such as raw milk cheese, scientific testing alone of the final product does not guarantee the food is safe to eat. As our farmers know, ensuring every step of the production process, from the grass the cow eats, to the water the cow drinks, to the cleanliness of the dairy, the conditions the cheese is made in, to finally the way the cheese is packaged and transported are all critical. To address these concerns for food where at-border testing alone is insufficient to assure safety, this Bill will introduce a requirement that for certain ready to eat or minimally processed foods, importers will need an internationally recognised food safety management certificate that assures the food's production has been managed safely.


One or two times a year there are circumstances where we strongly suspect a problem with an imported food but the scientists are still working out what tests will best show if the problem exists in that particular batch. This was the case with the frozen berries, and we were able to work with the importer to voluntarily hold the food. However, this is reliant on the importer being cooperative. This Bill addresses that weakness by introducing new capacity to hold food at the border until the scientific testing approach is being finalised or the extent of the problem is understood. This capacity will only be utilised for a short period until the scientific testing approach is finalised, then we will use the existing provisions.


Under the current system, if we have some information about an emerging risk but the scientific evidence is incomplete, the system is unable to increase the surveillance of that food. This Bill introduces the ability to increase the level of surveillance to monitor the risk for a limited period and gather scientific evidence to conduct a reassessment of that food. This will enable us to better respond to emerging risks proactively before a food safety incident occurs.


Australia is a big exporter of food. Our agricultural exports contributed $38.3 billion to the Australian economy in 2015-16. This government has worked tirelessly to develop new markets for our exports. As part of this work we have identified foreign countries who have food safety management systems that are equivalent to our own. Where there are equivalent food safety management systems between Australia and another country, this Bill introduces the capacity to recognise the systems and to reduce intervention at the border. This will benefit both countries, enabling the easier flow of trade between Australia and that country.


We are serious about ensuring Australia continues to have a world-class food safety management system. Part of ensuring this is having the necessary tools in place for when somebody tries to break the rules. This Bill brings the enforcement tools available to the department up to modern standards and introduces new penalties to make sure when somebody breaks the law they are dealt with appropriately. That's why we're introducing a full range of penalties, ranging from strict liability offences to up to ten years in gaol and fines greater than $100,000.


The Australian Government only has regulatory responsibility for food as it comes over our border. We need to make sure the expectation we have on Australian Businesses is the same as expectations on importers. Australian food businesses have excellent systems in place to be able to trace food, which is essential if a recall is required. To make sure importers are able to do the same, this Bill introduces requirements for importers to be able to quickly identify who they bought food from and who they sold it to in Australia. This will strengthen our ability to respond to a food incident.


The food safety management system in Australia is a cooperative system where the states, territories, local governments and Australian Government have shared responsibilities. To enable information to be used easily within Australia for food regulation, we have improved our information sharing abilities with the states and territories. The states, territories and local governments play an essential part in Australia's domestic food safety management system, and the Australian Government will be able to share information to support jurisdictions to effectively perform their role in food safety management.


Another limitation with current imported food safety management practices is how foods can be specified. Despite the knowledge in 2015 that only berries from a specific location were of concern in relation to that incident, all frozen berries were required to be tested under current legislation. This Bill introduces the flexibility to specify food in a detailed way. For example, we will be able to narrow holding orders to specific foods from specific locations or even specific factories. This will reduce the burden on importers at the border as we will be able to target the specific food causing concern, and not all food of that type.


The changing global marketplace of food supply presents new challenges for managing the risks associated with imported food. As the world's population grows, ensuring a safe food supply is critical. This Bill introduces the ability of Australia to share information with our international trading partners about any food safety issues identified in food arriving at Australia's border. This will a enable safer food supply chain worldwide.


Australia enjoys a world-class food safety management system. Through these changes we will strengthen our system, enabling Australians to continue to enjoy a wide range of food from around the world. Our food manufacturers will be able to continue to produce high quality and safe food, which is highly sought after internationally. This benefits our farmers, our economy, and our nation as a leading exporter of high-quality safe food. 


A strong food safety management system at the border is essential for our nation.


MIGRATION AMENDMENT (PROHIBITING ITEMS IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION FACILITIES) BILL 2017


SECOND READING SPEECH


In 2013, 99 per cent of people in immigration detention were Illegal Maritime Arrivals. Our immigration detention facilities were flooded by the 50,000 people who arrived on 800 boats under Labor.


Since coming to Government, the Coalition has been able to get people out of detention, including every child, and we have been able to close 17 detention centres. 


At the same time we have strengthened section 501 of the Migration Act to better protect the Australian community from foreign nationals who commit serious crimes. These changes have allowed us to cancel the visas of more than 2,800 foreign nationals who thought they could flout our laws and commit crimes against Australians.


Since these changes were enacted, we have cancelled the visas of 54 murderers, 223 child sex offenders and 150 organised crime figures. This action has resulted in a significant increase in criminals in our immigration detention facilities.


Immigration detention is necessary for strong border control. Foreign nationals who present an unacceptable risk to the Australian community will have their visas cancelled and they will be detained while their status is resolved, or they are removed from the country. 


Today, around 50 per cent of the detention population are non-citizens who have had their visas cancelled. And while IMAs now only make up around 25 per cent of the detention population, this cohort is complex and includes people with criminal histories or other security concerns which present a risk to the Australian community. 


This means that more than half of the detainee population consists of high-risk cohorts. These cohorts have significant criminal histories, like child sex offences or links to criminal gangs, such as outlaw motorcycle gangs and other organised crime groups, or represent an unacceptable risk to the Australian community otherwise.


These criminals often have serious behavioural issues and pose a critical threat to the health, safety, security and order of the detention network.


I will not tolerate behaviour that is illegal, or that threatens the stability of detention facilities, placing my officers, visitors or detainees at risk.


At the moment, the existing arrangements are inadequate to manage the increasing risk of contraband in detention, such as narcotic drugs and the use of mobile phones for the commission of criminal activity.


Mobile phones in detention are enabling criminal behaviour. Examples of their use include:


drug distribution within detention facilities


maintenance of criminal enterprises in and out of detention facilities


commodity of exchange or currency – currently, Illegal Maritime Arrival detainees are not permitted mobile phones, but all other detainees are – so mobile phones are now being used as a type of currency in the facilities


owners of mobile phones are also being subjected to stand-over tactics (including theft of the phone)


facilitation of threats between detainees


accessing child pornography


The Australian Border Force Commissioner advised in Budget Estimates that one detainee arranged a contract killing on another detainee while in immigration detention. Thankfully, my officers prevented this heinous crime from occurring but I will not stand by and allow this behaviour to continue.


We have also seen the use of mobile phones to coordinate internal disturbances and escapes. Two coordinated disturbances, one on Christmas Island and one at Yongah Hill, resulted in riots. This synchronised effort of disruption is threatening the order of the detention facilities and is placing all those who work or reside there at risk.


The Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2017 enables the Department to provide a safe and secure environment for people accommodated at, visiting or working at an immigration detention facility.


The Bill will strengthen search and seizure powers, including the use of detector dogs, in order for authorised officers to restrict things from immigration detention facilities that might pose a risk. These things include mobile phones, SIM cards, narcotic drugs and child pornography. 


Specifically, the Bill amends the Act to insert new definitions under subsection 5(1), to define detention centres and alternative places of detention, collectively as 'immigration detention facilities', and to define a 'prohibited thing'.


A new section, 251A will be inserted to enable the Minister to determine, by legislative instrument, things to be prohibited, in relation to persons in detention and immigration detention facilities. 


These things will include illegal things, specifically narcotic drugs and child pornography, and things that might be a risk within immigration detention facilities, such as mobile phones and SIM cards.


The Government is also proposing amendments to the search and seizure provisions in the Act, specifically sections 252, 252AA, 252A, 252B, 252BA, 252BB, 252C, 252CA and 252G, in order to ensure that we are able to effectively deal with such items.


In addition, the Government is proposing to add the ability to use a detector dog to screen for some of these items under sections 252AA, 252BA and 252G of the Act.


Even with the removal of mobile phones from detention facilities, detainees will continue to have reasonable access to communication avenues. This includes landline phones, internet access and visitors, in order to maintain contact with their support networks. Migration Agents or legal representatives will also continue to be able to contact their clients. 


This Bill will ensure our officers can carry out their responsibilities properly, minimising unacceptable risks to the health, safety and security of persons in immigration detention facilities, and to the order of these facilities.


TREASURY LAWS AMENDMENT (BANKING MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2017


SECOND READING SPEECH


In this year's Budget, the Government announced a series of measures that will deliver a stronger, safer financial system, with better competition and consumer outcomes for Australians. 


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Measures No. 1) Bill 2017 continues the work of implementing these commitments by further strengthening our financial system.


Schedules 1 and 2 to the Bill provide APRA with a new reserve power to make rules in relation to non-bank lenders, called 'non-ADI lenders'. This will provide APRA the necessary flexibility to address risks to financial stability if they emerge. This measure also enhances APRA's ability to gather data to monitor non-ADI lenders.


Importantly, this new rule making power is not a new 'peacetime' regulation of non-ADI lenders. These lenders are a vital source of competition in the lending market, and they do not rely on ordinary Australian depositors for their funding. Given non-ADI lenders have no depositors to protect, it is appropriate that they continue to run their businesses without being subject to ongoing prudential supervision by APRA.


The Government supports this important sector and the competition it provides for customers.


However, international experience has demonstrated that risks can emerge from the non-ADI lender sector that threatens the stability of the financial system. It is appropriate for APRA to have the power to move decisively to curb these risks should they ever arise.


Having such rules in place should strengthen the non-ADI lender sector, by signalling to market that the sector is well regulated and stable. 


The Government has often spoken of the need to approach financial stability risks with a scalpel rather than a chainsaw – these powers will provide APRA a new scalpel to deal with risks to financial stability that are specific to non-ADI lenders.


Schedule 3 of the Bill lifts the prohibition on the use of the term 'bank', so that all banking businesses with an ADI licence can now use the term.


This will encourage competition in the sector by allowing all ADIs to enjoy the benefit of describing themselves as a bank when they offer banking services to Australian customers. 


This will prompt innovation in the sector by opening the door to new banking entrants who will no longer be subject to the systemic barrier to entry of not being able to call themselves a bank when offering banking services.


Schedule 4 of the Bill seeks to modernise the Banking Act by incorporating a reference to the importance of APRA considering 'geographic and sectoral' considerations where appropriate. Government is putting APRA's powers and responsibilities to take account of these considerations - in line with its prudential mandate - beyond doubt. 


Schedule 5 of the Bill implements a package of reforms to reduce the incidence of consumers building up unsustainable credit card debt and to improve competition in the credit card market. 


Too many Australians are burdened with excessive credit card debt and incur substantial credit card interest. More than 30 per cent of credit card holders in the lowest income quartile carry interest-bearing debt from period to period. For these consumers, inadequate competition on ongoing interest rates and insufficient protection in the current regulatory framework can contribute to real hardship. 


Schedule 5 of the Bill implements reforms to ensure consumers can afford credit card contracts, to reduce the barriers consumers face when switching credit cards, and to align the calculation of credit card interest with consumers' expectations.


I will now provide more detail on these measures.


Since December 2014, APRA has taken a series of steps to address emerging financial stability risks by reinforcing the lending practices of banks and other ADIs, particularly in relation to residential home loans.


While these measures are effective in mitigating financial stability risks, the tightening of credit from ADIs creates room for non-ADI lenders to fill in the gap.


Although their current share of lending is relatively small, these non-ADI lenders may expand rapidly and their lending activities could potentially pose material risks to financial stability – risks that ultimately fall on the broader Australian community. 


The global financial crisis showed us how costly these risks can be when left unaddressed.


However, APRA does not have power over these lending activities, even where they materially contribute to financial stability risks.


Schedule 1 to the Bill will provide APRA with these powers. 


APRA will be able to make rules relating to lending practices of non-ADI lenders, where it considers that their lending activities materially contribute to financial stability risks.


These new rules will be backed by appropriate enforcement mechanisms. If a non-ADI lender fails to comply with a rule, it can be compelled by APRA to comply. If it ignores an APRA direction, the non-ADI lender will face appropriate penalties.


Schedule 2 to the Bill enhances APRA's ability to collect data from non-ADI lenders, so it can better monitor the non-ADI lender sector and determine if and when to use its new rulemaking power.


In making this determination, APRA will use its independent judgement. However, it is likely APRA will consider a number of factors including: the size of the sector; the nature of activities of non-ADI lenders; and the impact of non-ADI lenders on ADIs.


Before it makes a rule, APRA must consult ASIC, and will also ordinarily consult with the other members of the Council of Financial Regulators.


The rulemaking power is a reserve power that would only be used when APRA considers that the lending activities of non-ADI lenders are materially contributing to risks of financial instability. In other words, the Government is providing APRA with a new 'tool on the shelf' – rather than requiring the day to day operations of these entities to be regulated by APRA.


The Government believes that non-ADI lenders are not currently materially contributing to financial stability risks and therefore the Government does not expect APRA to use these powers on day one.


Schedule 3 helps innovative new banking entrants bring new product offerings into the Australian banking system. New entrants to the Australian banking market currently face a significant obstacle – the prohibition on the use of the word 'bank'.


At present, only ADIs with at least $50 million in capital are permitted to use the term 'bank'.


This has two undesirable effects:


- it discourages innovative new players from entering the sector, because they are unable to benefit from the advantages of being able to use the term 'bank' in the critical early phase of their development; and


- it may lead the public to mistakenly believe that small ADIs differ from larger players in terms of regulatory protection.


In fact, all ADIs are subject to APRA's prudential framework.


And deposits at all ADIs are protected by the Government's Financial Claims Scheme guarantee.


By lifting the prohibition on the use of the word 'bank', Schedule 2 to this Bill will allow the advantages associated with the term 'bank' to flow to all banking businesses with an ADI licence, especially new Fintech entrants. 


It breaks the vicious cycle for new entrants, where currently they need $50m to describe themselves as a bank, but must describe themselves as a bank in order to grow.


Nothing improves the customer experience like robust competition in a market, particularly from innovative new entrants. 


Competition in banking drives down interest rates for borrowers, drives down fees, increases interest rates for savers, and leads to advancements in the overall customer experience. 


This measure will also ensure that there are no misconceptions about the regulatory safeguards that apply to all ADIs in Australia's financial system.


Schedule 3 will also reinforce APRA's discretion over whether or not to permit the use of 'bank' outside of the ADI sector, ensuring that this term is limited to APRA regulated entities except in very unusual cases. 


Schedule 4 modernises the Banking Act by inserting an 'objects' provision. This clarifies APRA's mandate under the Act, clearly setting out APRA's objectives to protect financial stability and depositors. It also makes clear that APRA can consider geographic and sectoral sources of system risks issues as appropriate and respond appropriately. 


Recent conditions have highlighted the fact that the Australian economy differs considerably from region to region. APRA has broad and flexible powers, but there is no clear statement in the Banking Act that APRA has a responsibility to take account of geographic or sectoral issues where appropriate. Government is putting APRA's powers and responsibilities to address these issues - in line with its prudential mandate - beyond doubt.


Schedule 5 of the Bill implements a number of reforms to the credit card market to improve competition in the credit card market and protect vulnerable consumers from building up unsustainable credit card debts. 


There are many benefits to the use of credit cards for consumers. However, for some consumers very high interest rates and a pattern of over-borrowing and under-repayment can cause them to incur persistently high credit card interest charges. These consumers are often in households with low levels of income, with the lowest income households having credit card debt equal to four per cent of their annual disposable income, compared to two per cent for those in the highest income category.


For these consumers, inadequate competition on ongoing interest rates and insufficient protection in the current regulatory framework can contribute to substantial hardship. 


Currently, credit card providers are only required to assess a credit card contract as unsuitable if the borrower cannot repay the loan without substantial hardship. This means that some credit card providers only assess whether a consumer can meet the minimum repayments when determining if a consumer can afford a credit limit. As a result, consumers can be granted excessive credit limits which can lead to cycles of debt.


In addition, the calculation of credit card interest can be overly complex and often does not match consumers' expectations or understanding. 


Consumers can also face substantial barriers to switching credit cards or lowering credit limits due to onerous processes imposed by banks. These barriers have a substantial impact on competition in the credit card market. 


Schedule 5 of this Bill addresses these problems by implementing a reform package to reduce the incidence of consumers building up unsustainable credit card debt and to improve competition in the credit card market. 


This is consistent with the Government's commitment to implementing the first phase of reforms outlined in the Government's response to the Senate Inquiry into the credit card market.


Firstly, Schedule 5 will tighten responsible lending obligations for credit card providers by requiring affordability assessments to be based on whether a consumer can repay the full credit limit within a reasonable period. The Bill will provide the Australian Securities and Investments Commission with the power to determine that reasonable period by legislative instrument. 


This reform is not intended to unduly reduce consumers' access to credit. As such, ASIC is required to balance the need to prevent consumers from being in unsuitable credit card contracts with the need to ensure that reasonable access to credit is maintained when determining the reasonable period. 


Secondly, Schedule 5 will prohibit all unsolicited credit limit increase invitations including where a consumer has previously opted in to receiving these invitations. 


The definition of a credit limit increase invitation has also been expanded to include all forms of communication (rather than only written communication) to prevent credit card providers from circumventing the law and making unsolicited offers by phone or over an online portal.


Schedule 5 will also put an end to the unfair and complex way that interest is calculated on credit cards and make it easier for consumers to understand and compare how credit card interest is calculated. 


Credit card providers will no longer be able to charge backdated interest or interest on the balance that has already been repaid if a consumer does not fully repay their outstanding balance. 


Finally, Schedule 5 will require credit card providers to have online options for consumers to initiate a credit card cancellation or lower a credit limit. Consumers can face substantial barriers when trying to cancel a credit card and this reduces competition and limits how consumers can manage their credit card debt. 


Schedule 5 requires credit card providers to facilitate any requests to cancel a credit card or lower a credit limit and prevents them from employing tactics to dissuade or impede consumers from cancelling a credit card or lowering a credit limit. 


These reforms are a necessary and important step in reducing the incidence of consumers building up unmanageable credit card debts and improving competition in the credit card market. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (12:30):  I indicate to the Senate that these bills are being introduced together. After debate on the motion for the second reading has been adjourned, I will be moving a motion to have the bills listed separately on the Notice Paper. I move:


That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (12:32):  At the request of Senators Brown, Hinch and Rice, I move:


That items 1, 3 to 8, 11 to 13, 16 to 19, 21 to 25, 28 to 30, and 33 to 36 of Schedule 1 of the Illegal Logging Prohibition Amendment (Due Diligence Improvements) Regulation 2017, made under the Illegal Logging Prohibition Act 2012, be disallowed [F2017L01338].


I wish to put on the record that Labor is moving this disallowance motion because illegal logging causes devastating social, environmental and economic damage in source countries and all around the world. I think it is a matter of concern for Australians that this is the case. Illegal logging also very unfairly undercuts jobs in the Australian forestry and forest products industry. This very much matters to Labor, but it matters to regional Australia in particular, which is why this disallowance motion is so important. It also matters where strong governance means that forestry activities occur consistent with stringent procedures. Australia imports a significant amount of logged material—roughly $8.1 billion worth of timber products per year come into this country. According to estimates from the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, up to $800 million comes from sources with some risk of being illegally logged. This is an issue that I think Australians who care about the social, environmental and economic damage that such a volume of movement of illegally logged materials could cause want proper action on.


Just to go back over some of the history, a review of the illegal logging prohibition regulation was initiated quite some time ago by Minister Frydenberg, when he was in the role of Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister. At that point in time he had specific responsibility for deregulation. In his 11 December 2014 article in the Australian Financial Review he stated that at that time he expected the regulation impact statement with regard to these regulations would be completed by March 2015. I'm sad to say we shouldn't necessarily be surprised that there was a delay in that timeline. It was not March 2015 but, in fact, as recently as 5 October 2017 that the Commonwealth finally announced its reform from the review and tabled its RIS. It's in that context that this disallowance—this partial disallowance, to be accurate—enters. The partial disallowance seeks to disallow items 1, 3 to 8, 11 to 13, 16 to 19, 21 to 25, 28 to 30 and 33 to 36 of schedule 1. It's in that context that this partial disallowance deals with parts of the government's reforms with which Labor does not agree.


This disallowance will mean that importers and processors who are using timber legality frameworks vital to the sustainability of this industry—such as the Forest Stewardship Council and the Program for the Endorsement of Forestry Certification—as part of their due diligence systems to satisfy their obligations as required by the Illegal Logging Prohibition Act 2012 will still need to do some core essential work to ensure the productivity and value of the materials they're putting into the distribution chain. In order to maintain the integrity of the supply, they will still need to consider any other information the importer knows, or ought reasonably to know, that may indicate whether the product is made from or includes illegally logged timber. So this is about making sure that that protection that came in is maintained. Why is it so important to maintain the integrity that was embedded in the Illegal Logging Prohibition Act 2012? Maintaining it is an important check and balance in the system, and it's vital to maintain the integrity of the prohibition on illegally logged timber and timber products.


Timber legality frameworks can be used, in large part, by importers of regulated timber and timber products and processors of raw logs domestically in order to satisfy themselves and the department that they are sourcing legally harvested product, as explained by the Labor government in 2012, when the original regulations were tabled, and again in 2013, after a long period of consultation with the illegal logging working group. That process was quite extensive. I'm very pleased to say that it included representation from all of those who were interested in the sustainability of the sector, such as experts on the logging chain and the identification of the goods at all points of contact and movement. Representatives of the industry were engaged. Clearly, as a vital part of the chain of the delivery of logs and timber products into this country, the importers were also engaged. I'm pleased to say that, of course, the unions were engaged. The impact of this on Australian jobs is something I will say more about a little later on. The unions were involved in the illegal logging working group. Civil society groups were engaged and, indeed, foreign governments were engaged. This carefully constructed set of protocols was widely consulted on and delivered fulsomely to give us the best possible outcome we could have with regard to ensuring the integrity of timber and timber products coming into the country.


The statement that they made was:


The intention is that an importer may not use a timber legality framework to assure themselves of the legality of a product if there is information known to them that would otherwise call into question the legality of that product.


So it puts the responsibility on the delivery chain to check and make sure that they don't just abrogate their responsibility: 'It's not my fault; it's not my responsibility.' This is a requirement that, if they know anything, they are actually responsible for assuring themselves of the legality of the product.


There are a number of downsides to junking this principle by removing the additional information gathering elements that were required under Labor's regulation and endorsing, under the regulations, an automatic, deemed-to-comply arrangement for timber legality frameworks. As outlined in the regulation impact statement, there are significant concerns with the government's proposal. One of the major concerns in the RIS was that what the government is proposing could:


… lead to situations where a business will import or process a 'certified' product, despite information or circumstances suggesting that it is likely to contain timber that has been illegally harvested.


That, in my view, is certainly not something that Australians would think is of benefit to our economy, our environment, our social networks or our work capacity.


The RIS outlined the concern that this risk:


… is heightened by several factors, including the propensity for corruption in some high-risk nations—


nations from which the timber products would flow, and—


the possibility of fraudulent documents being provided—


That is, it would be just a tick-and-flick process entirely inadequate for properly checking the distribution chain. Another concern was:


… misleading claims being made; and the inherent complexity of such systems, which can be confusing or prone to misunderstanding.


The RIS further said:


It is also worthwhile noting that while both third-party certification systems (FSC and PEFC) have comprehensive systems that are backed up by third-party audit, they have not deliberately been designed to provide guarantees of legality. There have also been reports suggesting that these systems are vulnerable to deliberate fraud.


Given that level of concern, it's clear to me that the partial disallowance motion we're putting forward this morning should be supported in this place. The core problems that I've just outlined are not the only ones, though. There are additional shortcomings in the government's approach outlined in the RIS. They include such significant concerns as the fact that neither the European Union Timber Regulation nor the United States' Lacey Act formally recognise third-party certification systems, such as the FSC or the PEFC, as means of ensuring timber legality.


Another problem with the government's approach—in addition to not following the best practice approach evidenced by the actions of the European Union and the United States—is that this proposal, which we seek to disallow, moves away from the principle that importers and processers need to understand their supply chain. It shouldn't just be a question of getting a piece of paper, checking it off and saying: 'Yeah, it looks like it's fine. Let it go.' We actually believe that, to ensure the integrity of logging products that come into Australia, we should make sure that our importers and those who are involved in processing are absolutely aware of the supply chain from which they are gathering their raw or partially developed materials.


The RIS concluded that another risk, if the government's approach were adopted, would be potential fraudulent activity by certified parties. Yet another concern was that the government's approach might incentivise the misuse or abuse of certification systems. Surely the government don't really want to do that? With this disallowance motion we're helping them to help themselves to a much better outcome. It's not that hard; they should just agree with the Labor Party on this matter of certification.


To be clear, the Australian Labor Party does value third-party certification as a means to help demonstrate sustainability and it supports its inclusion in Commonwealth procurement systems, in particular with products that are certified in Australia. But, despite this, we note that in recent times a number of examples of certified products that have proved to be from illegally logged forests have been uncovered. So the requirement to assess whether the information and evidence obtained by using the framework is accurate and reliable, the requirement to identify and assess, by using the framework and the gathered information, where there is a risk that the product is made from or includes illegally logged timber—

This is an issue that I think Australians who care about the social, environmental and economic damage that such a volume of movement of illegally logged materials could cause want proper action on.


Just to go back over some of the history, a review of the illegal logging prohibition regulation was initiated quite some time ago by Minister Frydenberg, when he was in the role of Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister. At that point in time he had specific responsibility for deregulation. In his 11 December 2014 article in the Australian Financial Review he stated that at that time he expected the regulation impact statement with regard to these regulations would be completed by March 2015. I'm sad to say we shouldn't necessarily be surprised that there was a delay in that timeline. It was not March 2015 but, in fact, as recently as 5 October 2017 that the Commonwealth finally announced its reform from the review and tabled its RIS. It's in that context that this disallowance—this partial disallowance, to be accurate—enters. The partial disallowance seeks to disallow items 1, 3 to 8, 11 to 13, 16 to 19, 21 to 25, 28 to 30 and 33 to 36 of schedule 1. It's in that context that this partial disallowance deals with parts of the government's reforms with which Labor does not agree.


This disallowance will mean that importers and processors who are using timber legality frameworks vital to the sustainability of this industry—such as the Forest Stewardship Council and the Program for the Endorsement of Forestry Certification—as part of their due diligence systems to satisfy their obligations as required by the Illegal Logging Prohibition Act 2012 will still need to do some core essential work to ensure the productivity and value of the materials they're putting into the distribution chain. In order to maintain the integrity of the supply, they will still need to consider any other information the importer knows, or ought reasonably to know, that may indicate whether the product is made from or includes illegally logged timber. So this is about making sure that that protection that came in is maintained. Why is it so important to maintain the integrity that was embedded in the Illegal Logging Prohibition Act 2012? Maintaining it is an important check and balance in the system, and it's vital to maintain the integrity of the prohibition on illegally logged timber and timber products.


Timber legality frameworks can be used, in large part, by importers of regulated timber and timber products and processors of raw logs domestically in order to satisfy themselves and the department that they are sourcing legally harvested product, as explained by the Labor government in 2012, when the original regulations were tabled, and again in 2013, after a long period of consultation with the illegal logging working group. That process was quite extensive. I'm very pleased to say that it included representation from all of those who were interested in the sustainability of the sector, such as experts on the logging chain and the identification of the goods at all points of contact and movement. Representatives of the industry were engaged. Clearly, as a vital part of the chain of the delivery of logs and timber products into this country, the importers were also engaged. I'm pleased to say that, of course, the unions were engaged. The impact of this on Australian jobs is something I will say more about a little later on. The unions were involved in the illegal logging working group. Civil society groups were engaged and, indeed, foreign governments were engaged. This carefully constructed set of protocols was widely consulted on and delivered fulsomely to give us the best possible outcome we could have with regard to ensuring the integrity of timber and timber products coming into the country.


The statement that they made was:


The intention is that an importer may not use a timber legality framework to assure themselves of the legality of a product if there is information known to them that would otherwise call into question the legality of that product.


So it puts the responsibility on the delivery chain to check and make sure that they don't just abrogate their responsibility: 'It's not my fault; it's not my responsibility.' This is a requirement that, if they know anything, they are actually responsible for assuring themselves of the legality of the product.


There are a number of downsides to junking this principle by removing the additional information gathering elements that were required under Labor's regulation and endorsing, under the regulations, an automatic, deemed-to-comply arrangement for timber legality frameworks. As outlined in the regulation impact statement, there are significant concerns with the government's proposal. One of the major concerns in the RIS was that what the government is proposing could:


… lead to situations where a business will import or process a 'certified' product, despite information or circumstances suggesting that it is likely to contain timber that has been illegally harvested.


That, in my view, is certainly not something that Australians would think is of benefit to our economy, our environment, our social networks or our work capacity.


The RIS outlined the concern that this risk:


… is heightened by several factors, including the propensity for corruption in some high-risk nations—


nations from which the timber products would flow, and—


the possibility of fraudulent documents being provided—


That is, it would be just a tick-and-flick process entirely inadequate for properly checking the distribution chain. Another concern was:


… misleading claims being made; and the inherent complexity of such systems, which can be confusing or prone to misunderstanding.


The RIS further said:


It is also worthwhile noting that while both third-party certification systems (FSC and PEFC) have comprehensive systems that are backed up by third-party audit, they have not deliberately been designed to provide guarantees of legality. There have also been reports suggesting that these systems are vulnerable to deliberate fraud.


Given that level of concern, it's clear to me that the partial disallowance motion we're putting forward this morning should be supported in this place. The core problems that I've just outlined are not the only ones, though. There are additional shortcomings in the government's approach outlined in the RIS. They include such significant concerns as the fact that neither the European Union Timber Regulation nor the United States' Lacey Act formally recognise third-party certification systems, such as the FSC or the PEFC, as means of ensuring timber legality.


Another problem with the government's approach—in addition to not following the best practice approach evidenced by the actions of the European Union and the United States—is that this proposal, which we seek to disallow, moves away from the principle that importers and processers need to understand their supply chain. It shouldn't just be a question of getting a piece of paper, checking it off and saying: 'Yeah, it looks like it's fine. Let it go.' We actually believe that, to ensure the integrity of logging products that come into Australia, we should make sure that our importers and those who are involved in processing are absolutely aware of the supply chain from which they are gathering their raw or partially developed materials.


The RIS concluded that another risk, if the government's approach were adopted, would be potential fraudulent activity by certified parties. Yet another concern was that the government's approach might incentivise the misuse or abuse of certification systems. Surely the government don't really want to do that? With this disallowance motion we're helping them to help themselves to a much better outcome. It's not that hard; they should just agree with the Labor Party on this matter of certification.


To be clear, the Australian Labor Party does value third-party certification as a means to help demonstrate sustainability and it supports its inclusion in Commonwealth procurement systems, in particular with products that are certified in Australia. But, despite this, we note that in recent times a number of examples of certified products that have proved to be from illegally logged forests have been uncovered. So the requirement to assess whether the information and evidence obtained by using the framework is accurate and reliable, the requirement to identify and assess, by using the framework and the gathered information, where there is a risk that the product is made from or includes illegally logged timber—

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (12:48):  This afternoon I rise to discuss the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment (Authority Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2017. Indeed, we support the amendments that are contained in this bill, but we do believe that we should be highlighting in the course of this debate the government's inaction on protection of the Great Barrier Reef. We know we established many decades ago now the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and I'm familiar with the governance issues that confront the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in the context of the flaws of that act. So we've had significant concern about the current governance structures and their inadequacy for meeting our reef's changing needs, including the response to the challenges of climate change, coastal development and land based run-off.


We know that back in March last year the government announced an independent review of governance. That was led by Dr Wendy Craik. We also understand that that report was given to the Minister for the Environment and Energy and it evaluated whether management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park under current arrangements was sufficient to support the performance of its statutory functions. There were a number of public submissions and 55 consultation meetings with stakeholders. 


The review found that the marine park authority enjoys strong stakeholder rapport, but there are problems within its current structures. It included a most concerning lack of strategic leadership and management, and an excessive workload for the chairperson. This was found to limit its capacity to fulfil its statutory obligations and responsibilities and impacts on its capacity to manage the impacts of climate change on the reef. It was suggested that refreshed governance arrangements would assist in this regard to allow the authority to better fulfil its role as the expert manager of our reef.


We were pleased to see that the government accepted all of the 24 recommendations for the new Great Barrier Reef Marine Park governance model. These changes will improve its strategic capability and capacity. The bill seeks to implement the recommendations through the numerous amendments to the act, including separating the existence of the full-time chairperson into a part-time chairperson role and full-time chief executive officer with an additional part-time member position. The capacity of the authority will be enhanced by the separation of and time available for those roles. The act will also be amended in order to strengthen requirements for the appointment and termination of members. Indeed, the bill includes minor technical amendments to clarify the marine park legislation's regulating functions.


Labor believes that the passage of this bill supports the transition to new structures without compromising the authority's continued ability to fulfil its statutory functions. We're pleased to see that it provides enough time for the recruitment and appointment of the new chairperson and the new chief executive officer before the expiration of the current term in October this year. We don't believe this bill is contentious but, in supporting this bill, I want to affirm and reiterate our long-term commitment to protecting the Great Barrier Reef and delivering law and policy that promote the reef's long-term health and resilience in the context of climate change.


While the government has been saying that the reef is in good health, we on the Labor side are significantly concerned about its health. We want to see more done on run-off. We want to see more global action and accountability on climate change, because we know that that is one of the major risks to the reef. Australia has played a significant role in dragging its feet in action on climate change, which in turn contributes to the global drag on action on climate change and puts our reef, day by day, at greater risk. We know that the window of time, in which we will be able to protect our reef if climate change continues the way that it is, is closing. If we can't make good on global commitments to rein in emissions and address climate change, then we know that there is a great risk to our reef. I know that people localise debates about the impact of the Adani coalmine. But, in fact, we know that the debate about the Adani coalmine and the concerns of the community also relate to the much wider global debates about climate change and how emissions from fossil fuels need to be managed and made accountable, both at a domestic and a global level. 


I'm proud of the role that Labor has played in protecting our reef. I'm proud to say it was the Whitlam government that implemented Australia's first ever marine reserve over our reef. More recently, it was the Labor Party that established Australia's marine reserve network, which is the largest network of marine protected areas in the world. The attempts of the coalition to undermine the integrity of that network—noting that it is not only the Great Barrier Reef that deserves protection—dismay me. I'm not happy with some of the changes that have been made to marine park boundaries. I believe they're being made without justification or scientific foundation. When the government make decisions like that it leaves me with great concern for their capacity to manage things like the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I'm heartened, somewhat, by the fact that, because of its significance, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park has independent management structures for its oversight. I can only hope for the same for other parts of our iconic and important marine networks. 


We know that our responsibility to care for our marine environment is becoming more and more important day by day, as the impacts of climate change and overfishing affect our marine networks. These threats must be taken seriously by our government, and we need to do all that we can to protect the health of our reef. Management plans are an important part of this work. We know that the Senate and the parliament—and, indeed, the government—have been active in recent times in bringing legislation forward in that regard. Late last year, we amended the act—the very same act that we're debating today—to improve the management plans for the parks as well. 


We need all the practical tools at our disposal to protect our reef, which means we need governance structures in relation to the management of the reef itself but also externally to that, with the concerns about climate change. How do the government and the Labor Party opposition respond to the issues of climate change that affect the long-term health not only of the Great Barrier Reef but of our environmental networks right around the nation? We don't want to see simple management plans that deal with very specific acreage of the reef. We are calling on the government to do more than this and protect the reef from all sides. We want to see the government protecting the Coral Sea, to ensure the rich biosecurity there, on the right side of the reef, is also given adequate protection. I hope that the new governance structures in this legislation mean that there greater capacity to do justice to those important issues.


In our view, the government is not adequately protecting the Coral Sea. Currently you're looking at winding back ocean protections in the Coral Sea, proposing to gut half of that area that was put into the marine national parks that I spoke of before. It's taking a significant step backwards. In fact, it's the largest step backwards that has ever been taken when it comes to conservation in the Coral Sea, and I want to put the Labor Party's concerns about that on the record today in the context of this debate.


Importantly, we need to make sure that we're protecting the reef on the other side. That is what the Queensland Labor government is doing, and that's by doing things like putting land-clearing rules to parliament and ensuring that run-off from land clearing doesn't negatively affect the reef. Those kinds of things can be done adequately only if the governance of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is adequately legislated for by this place. We are significantly concerned about the fact that the government have not acted on climate change and that they're not acting on the causes of climate change—and indeed that some of the MPs opposite us don't even believe it's real. So, while we've got good bureaucrats who can work on things like these governance structures, do good consultations with stakeholders, do good surveys and take submissions, we are vastly held back in our capacity to protect the Great Barrier Reef by the ideologically driven inaction on climate change that is driven by people in this place and the other place.


What it comes down to is that all the good management plans, all the good governance, cannot really do the job if you don't believe in taking strong action on climate change. It simply makes you unfit to protect our iconic Great Barrier Reef. I simply don't trust the government to protect this part of our unique environment. I urge the government to do more to protect one of our most prized environmental assets as a nation. I urge them to stop fighting against responsible land clearing protections and I urge them not to undo protections for the Coral Sea. It's time for them to act on climate change, to address the root causes that will keep our reef healthy.


I can say that we in the Labor Party can and will do these things, because our environmental policy commitments go much further in their protective efforts than these amendments that are before us today. We have a plan for the reef that involves more efficient and long-term management of the reef that is appropriately funded and resourced. We look forward to seeing that funding, that resourcing, that planning and that agenda of the Labor Party and a future Labor government coming within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's governance. For example, we have committed $100 million to review and improve the current management practices for the reef in consultation with relevant stakeholders. We also have a comprehensive climate change action plan that will deliver real action on climate change and, in doing so, address harmful effects of global warming and global emissions on the reef, including coral bleaching.


What we have here for our Great Barrier Reef is an amendment that helps with governance but doesn't really drive at the key risks to our Great Barrier Reef. This is of extreme concern to the Labor Party and it's something we look forward to addressing in government.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-02-08,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:04):  I thank Senator Pratt and the Labor Party for their support for this administration bill in relation to the management of the Great Barrier Reef—the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment (Authority Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2017. I appreciate that Senator Pratt and no doubt Senator Whish-Wilson, who will speak later on this, are correct in saying the Barrier Reef is our Barrier Reef—it's the Barrier Reef of all Australians. But I particularly like to think of the Barrier Reef as my Barrier Reef because I've lived all of my life on the shores of the Great Barrier Reef. I know well the people who operate on the Great Barrier Reef, be they tourist operators, fishermen or scientists out of Townsville, Cairns and Mackay, and over the years I've had a long, long interest in the Great Barrier Reef. 


I know the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority well. It's based in the city of Townsville, where I have my office, and of course the Australian Institute of Marine Science is based at Cape Cleveland, between Townsville and Ayr, to the south of where I live. I pass the AIMS turn-off every day I go to work. And I'm very conscious of some of the very good work that James Cook University does out of the campuses at Townsville and Cairns in relation to marine matters. Most of their work's good. Some is what I would class as questionable and a bit politically motivated, but that's up to individual researchers.


The Barrier Reef is going fine. Senator Whish-Wilson will get up after me and tell the world that the Barrier Reef's dying, it's dead or it shouldn't be visited by the European and North American tourists who flock to that area. The Greens political party seems to have undertaken a campaign to denigrate the Barrier Reef so that one of the great sources of revenue, export earning dollars and jobs in Queensland which come from the reef is decimated. That seems to be the Greens political campaign, because most of the rhetoric that they go on with about the health of the reef, which was unfortunately also mentioned by Senator Pratt, is simply not true. Senator Whish-Wilson will get up after me and tell you it's dead and that all these horrible things are happening, but the fact of the matter is quite different. There are challenges on the Great Barrier Reef. There always have been. But that is well recognised by the government.


I know Senator Pratt, who comes from Western Australia, the other side of the country, and Senator Whish-Wilson, who comes from Tasmania, at the bottom end of the country, love the Barrier Reef as much as I do, but they could hardly be said to have the practical involvement with the reef that I've had over most of my lifetime. Senator Pratt was carrying on about how good the Labor Party is with the Great Barrier Reef. I've done this before, but I refer Senator Pratt to a document put out by Save Our Marine Life, an alliance of leading conservation organisations—not normally friends of ours—which is entitled A big blue legacy: the Liberal National tradition of marine conservation. It goes through, in some detail, the work that Liberal-National governments have done over the years: the prohibition of oil and gas operations on the Barrier Reef by the Fraser government in 1975; the end of whaling in Australian waters and the creation of the first stage of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park by the Fraser government in 1979; the World Heritage listing of the Great Barrier Reef and the creation of the Cairns section of the marine park in 1981; the creation of the Lihou Reef National Nature Reserve in the Coral Sea by the Fraser government in 1982; and the creation of further marine parks by the Howard government 1998. Coalition governments have always been more active in protecting our marine environment right around Australia, as this booklet quite clearly points out.


I've had a lot of discussions with many directors and chairmen of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park over the years. Dr Wendy Craik has conducted a recent review of the authority, and Wendy is the appropriate person to do it because she was once in the position of chair of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, many, many years ago. The idea of splitting the chairmanship from the CEO is a good one; it's something the park authority itself and other stakeholders have wanted. Most of the amendments contained in this bill, as Senator Pratt pointed out, are issues that would have been determined after long consultation with all stakeholders, and I'm pleased to see these amendments are universally supported. 


The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is not a specific scientific research agency, although they do a lot of scientific research. I was particularly pleased in a Senate inquiry that Senator Whish-Wilson chaired—I don't think he ever made a lot of this particular point—when the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority gave evidence that the Coral Sea was actually cooling and that the waters around the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef were actually cooling. That puts the lie to what Senator Whish-Wilson will tell you: no, the waters are all getting warmer, and there's coral bleaching and all that. Yes, there is some coral bleaching; yes, there has been a crown-of-thorns problem. There have been crown-of-thorns starfish there for 60 years that I can remember. Ben Cropp and his wife were the first ones to try and do something about that. Coalition governments have funded very considerable work for the removal of the crown-of-thorns.


I'm delighted to say that just a couple of weeks ago the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, came to Townsville. We went out to AIMS where Mr Turnbull announced to academia, people involved in the reef, tourism operators and other stakeholders in the reef that $60 million for further research and remedial action on the Great Barrier Reef would go to a number of different agencies. We haven't heard a lot about that—and you won't hear about it from the Greens.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  You will hear about it!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Oh, we will. Well, that's good. Well, make sure it's truthful, Senator Whish-Wilson. So there will be an extra $60 million for research on the Great Barrier Reef. 


Importantly, scientists now understand that what they have to do is help with the resilience of the reef. These are my terms, not theirs, but I understand that what they're doing is looking at genetically modifying the reef to give it strength, to give it resilience, to help it progress and continue in the years ahead. They're looking at bringing embryos of warm-water corals into the Barrier Reef. Generally speaking, they are now doing what they should be doing in relation to climate change—that is, understanding that climate change is apparently real and, as I always point out, that, ever since the earth has been going, the climate has continued to change. Once upon a time, the world used to be covered in ice; it's not now. So, clearly, over the years, the climate continues to change. That's an accepted fact. 


What sensible scientists are now concluding is that we've got to see how we can help the reef resile from, deal with or cope with that climate change. I'm delighted that scientific work is now being directed more towards that area, rather than the philosophical political argument about whether climate change is real or true, or who's causing it. They're actually doing things, and that's how it should be. I'm delighted AIMS is heading that way and the CSIRO is heading that way, so that we can do something practical about changes that occur in our climate. 


Senator Pratt and Senator Whish-Wilson no doubt will go on about climate change. I keep saying to them: can someone tell me how Australia, which emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, can stop what Senator Pratt and Senator Whish-Wilson say is causing climate change? Carbon emissions? Well, if they are, it's not Australia that's doing it. Senator Pratt says, 'Labor has a plan to stop climate change.' Well, I don't know how Labor can do that, because Australia's contribution to emissions is less than 1.2 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon. So how Labor is going to deal with that, I'd be very, very interested to see.


I've digressed slightly from this bill and what's happening but I do want to say that I've spoken with administrators, managers, at the marine park authority for some time, and these reforms are what will suit them. I do want to mention there Dr Russell Reichelt, who is the current chairman and CEO. I think he is now retiring after long, dedicated, tremendous service to Australia's marine science, particularly to the Barrier Reef, to GBRMPA and to AIMS. He is a dedicated marine scientist, one of the most knowledgeable. He understands how the whole thing works, and I do want to pay tribute to Dr Reichelt for the research work he has done at GBRMPA and elsewhere.


I return to the issue of climate change and repeat: with Australia emitting less than 1.2 per cent of carbon emissions, if there are things happening, it is not Australia's fault. How the Labor Party are going to stop that, how the Greens would stop it, apart from rhetoric and a few demonstrations up and down the streets, I'm not sure. I want Senator Whish-Wilson to tell me how Australia, which emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, is causing the climate change which the Greens and some in the Labor Party would have you believe.


I refer anyone who is interested to a very good article by Julian Tomlinson in today's Cairns Post about the issue of the Barrier Reef and academic freedom, research and the quality of research. It brings to mind the unfortunate situation which has happened at James Cook University. Professor Peter Ridd, a very well qualified scientist in marine matters, had a different view on the Barrier Reef. He had the temerity to suggest that some of the researchers simply use research—these are my words, not his, but this was the theme, a theme I've had in the past—they know that their future depends upon getting research grants. It used to be under the Labor years that they had to mention climate change or they wouldn't get a research grant for anything. Nowadays that has moved on. They've got to mention the Barrier Reef or they don't get research funds for anything.


Professor Ridd had the temerity to inquire why a lot of the work that was being done by fellow scientists at JCU was not properly peer researched, and because of that he has been sacked by JCU. That's a shame, because I'm a great supporter of JCU. I wrote to the vice-chancellor about the issue when it first happened. I got a response from her, I might say, but I think it's unfortunate. Professor Ridd, as I understand, according to newspaper reports, is before the Federal Court now in relation to his sacking for what he says and what I think is an expression of opinion. I thought universities were there to encourage different views and different approaches and to challenge accepted norms. I thought that's what universities were about, but apparently not at JCU, and that distresses me because, as I say, I'm a great supporter, a great fan and great advocate for JCU.


An interesting thing that Julian Tomlinson mentioned was that Professor Ridd in this court case—and we all know that court cases are very, very expensive—wanted to take action but couldn't afford it. So they did one of these crowd-funding appeals and, within two days, raised $100,000 to help Professor Ridd with his court case. As Julian Tomlinson says, this just demonstrates that people around Australia are getting sick and tired of the Greens continual rhetoric—unsupported, I have to say, by any genuine scientific fact about climate change and its being caused by Australia.


Senator Pratt went on about Adani. Adani is 500, 600 kilometres west of the Great Dividing Range, nowhere near the Barrier Reef. How that mine is going to destroy the Barrier Reef, as Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Pratt have suggested, simply beggars belief and is beyond comprehension.


They then say that there'll be more ships going through the Barrier Reef. Well, that's been happening for 100 years and, with a couple of very minor exceptions, one of which was Bob Brown's boat, there has never been any problem with ships going through the Barrier Reef, because it's so well managed. The marine safety aspects there, the pilots that take everyone through the Barrier Reef—we've got that very well managed. So the arguments about Adani destroying the Barrier Reef just don't stack up. Any serious, sensible person could never make an argument for that, because the facts just don't support them. But it's an interesting article by Mr Tomlinson, and I'd recommend anyone who's interested in this to have a look at it in the Cairns Post today. 


I will leave it there, again emphasising what the marine conservation societies say in A big blue legacy about the legacy of the Liberal and National parties and their tradition in marine conservation over decades. That is demonstrated. One of the things I didn't mention which I perhaps should have is that the green zones were an initiative of David Kemp and Robert Hill as ministers in the Howard government. All of the practical, positive enhancements to the Great Barrier Reef have been done under Liberal and National Party governments, and that was even further demonstrated just a couple of weeks ago, by this allocation of some $60 million to do further research to help the resilience and the continued operations of the Great Barrier Reef—a Great Barrier Reef that all Australians love. Many, I have to say, from Melbourne, Tasmania and Western Australia read the rhetoric; they don't really understand it. But those of us who live there understand just what a special place it is, how it contributes so much to the Queensland and North Queensland economy and how it gives so much pleasure to tourists and locals alike to experience the Great Barrier Reef. Particularly these days it brings joy to northern Europeans and North Americans, as they flock, with others from all over the world, to see this wonderful example of a natural asset that Australia has. 


I will just say, before Senator Whish-Wilson speaks—and again he will try to denigrate the reef and try to turn tourists away, contrary to all the facts from people who actually work on, live near or research the Great Barrier Reef—that I believe the Great Barrier Reef has a great future. With the careful management being provided by the Turnbull government and previous Liberal-National Party governments, we will continue to have this wonderful natural asset which is a joy for the world. I encourage anyone who may be listening to this or who may have an interest in this to visit the Barrier Reef. It is an experience worth having. It is an experience that will be there forever, and it's an experience that is world-class. I urge people to take advantage of it.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (13:23):  I might start my contribution on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment (Authority Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2017 with a question to the Australian people: who would you rather believe? Would you rather believe a Liberal senator whom I think Senator Brandis labelled—correct me if I'm wrong—as the grandfather of the Senate, a Liberal senator who is a self-confessed climate change denier, who doesn't believe in man-made climate change? He is the best the Liberal Party could put in here today. The best they could do was put up Senator Macdonald to speak on behalf of the Great Barrier Reef. He is a self-confessed climate change denier.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ketter
):  Order! Sit down, Senator Whish-Wilson. I just remind the chamber that interjections are disorderly and senators are entitled to be heard in silence. 




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Especially, Acting Deputy President, as I sat through Senator Macdonald's contribution almost completely silently.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I can't even begin to say how many lies you told, Senator Macdonald. Who would you rather believe? Senator Macdonald, the grandfather of the Senate, who's been here way too long in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, who is a climate denier who says—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  That's a lie and you know it!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Here we go, Australia! Here's what he just said in here in the Australian Senate on behalf the Liberal Party: 'The Great Barrier Reef is going fine.' It's going fine! There was an article this week, because there is a meeting in Sydney this week of scientists from all around the world, the Global Climate Forum, that said very clearly that the reef is in 'deep trouble'. That quote came from one of the leading scientists at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Name him!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I'm very happy to name him. His name is David Wachenfeld. I will send the link to you, Senator Macdonald, so you can read it yourself. Get your head out of the sand, you and your government, and do something about climate change and the Great Barrier Reef.


As chair of the environment committee that went to the Great Barrier Reef, I pushed the committee to go diving on the reef. Senator Macdonald directly threatened me that he would get stories run in the Queensland press about me taking a joyride when all I wanted the committee to do was stick their head under the water and see the coral for themselves, which is exactly what I did. Do you know what Senator Macdonald said to me, Acting Deputy President? He said: 'If you want to see coral, go to the AIMS laboratory and have a look at it there. They are growing perfectly good corals in the laboratory.' That's what he said the committee should do.


This is the quality of the people that the LNP have in this parliament on one of the biggest issues of our time, an issue that will impact future generations of Australians. This is the quality of the people—the best they can do in a debate on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and how we need to enhance its effectiveness. He comes in here and attacks scientists, a coward punch, because those scientists don't agree with his climate-denying view of the world. An absolute bloody disgrace—that's what he is and it's about time someone called him out on it.


The reef is in deep trouble. Fifty per cent of the corals are now scientifically classified as having been bleached, and that excludes the damage to the corals done in the zone by Cyclone Debbie. I went to four different sites and saw it for myself. If you don't believe climate change and warming oceans are impacting the Great Barrier Reef, go and stick your head under the water and have a look for yourself. I challenge every politician in this parliament to do exactly that: go up there and have a look for yourself.


It's not just the Great Barrier Reef. In my home state of Tasmania, the south-eastern section of Tasmania and the Tasman Sea is the global hotspot for warming oceans on this planet. We have just lost our giant kelp forests, a 10,000-year-old ecosystem that stretched from the north-east tip of Tasmania to the south. They are gone. They were older than the Great Barrier Reef. They were nurseries to so much marine life and biodiversity. They are gone because of warming waters, storms and invasive species—very similar pressures and stressors that the Great Barrier Reef is facing.


For Senator Macdonald to come in here on behalf of the Liberal Party and claim—this could the biggest quote of the year, or the biggest I've ever seen in this place—that 'the Great Barrier Reef is going fine' is an absolute lie. It's a dangerous lie because it underlies the action that we need to take. I know this because I chaired the Senate committee that took significant evidence on this. The report is there for anyone who wants to read it. We need to do everything we can across the board to help the Great Barrier Reef. Senator Macdonald said the coral reef was cooling on the particular day we happened to be up in his hometown in Cairns.


The coral reef is cooling? We've had unprecedented back-to-back bleaching because of record water temperatures. February is the critical month for this year—fingers crossed that we don't get a third consecutive bleaching event. No-one thought it was even possible we could get two in a row. The models were predicting that that couldn't happen until 2045, yet it happened. These corals will not recover. It takes 15 years for them to recover. The dare that Senator Macdonald put to you in this chamber today is that I wouldn't talk about the $60 million—$60 million!—that this government is putting towards the Great Barrier Reef. I ask every senator in here and the Australian people: what is the Great Barrier Reef worth? What is it worth to you? Just in tangible economic measurements, it is in the billons of dollars. As an economist, I know too well that even though we try and price ecosystem services we can't possibly even begin to value the Great Barrier Reef for its biodiversity. Who can even put a price and value on what's important, the thousands of creatures that rely on the reef for their survival?


It's not just the reef. It's the rainforests and the mangroves. They're all part of the same ecosystem. If the reef dies, if those corals crumble—which they will after they've bleached—it removes cover for the thousands of species that are protected from predators. It will impact the rainfall over the rainforest, because the reef is actually what creates the rain, and the rain creates the mangroves. The mangroves are the nurseries for small fish and they are essential for crocodiles, which actually protect the small fish. That's why it is such a successful symbiotic relationship and one of the greatest ecosystems on this planet.


David Attenborough this year is going to be releasing in Australia Blue Planet II. It was the leading TV series in the UK last year. The rest of the world cares more about the Great Barrier Reef than most Australians—certainly more than Senator Macdonald. People are waking up to this, and they want us to do something about it. I'm sorry if I am so fired up and passionate about this, but I am sick to death of hearing the crap that I hear in here from climate change deniers like Senator Macdonald. I think that Australians are as well. I'm sick of scientists being attacked by people who are funding them. It's just not acceptable.


I digress. Let me get back to the bill. Senator Ruston, the minister at the table, will be pleased to know that the Greens will be supporting this bill. This bill will enhance the authority and functions of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. It will replace an existing full-time chair chairperson with a part-time chairperson position. It will establish an additional part-time member position, bringing the total membership of the authority to seven—that includes the chairperson and the CEO—and it will:


Strengthen requirements for the appointment and termination of members by: specifying the general skills required; limiting the number of consecutive terms served by an individual member; providing for termination of members by the Governor-General for underperformance—


I'll be interested to see what benchmarks are going to be put in place for that underperformance—



and reducing the potential for conflicts of interest.
If this wasn't in non-contro, Senator Ruston, I would take you into the committee stage to find out exactly what those performance benchmarks will be, but I will ask you instead outside the chamber.


Importantly, the parliamentary briefing that we've been given acknowledges the reason for this legislation. The authority's key functions are to:


… advise and make recommendations to the Minister in relation to the care and development of the Marine Park … zoning plans and plans of management …


It acknowledges that, while they're managing the marine park collaboratively with the Queensland government, the review into the governance of these arrangements has found that the scale and workload of the chairperson position has become 'too large for a single person' and:


The legislated size of the Authority and background requirements of the … members limited the capacity to provide local, national and international perspectives and diversity of expertise required …


This is what I'd like to finish my contribution on. I think this is what got Senator Macdonald so fired up in our Senate inquiry when he came up to Townsville and Cairns: we might only be 1.2 per cent of global emissions, but of course Senator Macdonald forgot to tell you that, if you include coal exports, we're up around nearly 5 per cent. We are the Great Barrier Reef's custodians. If we are going to get action on reducing emissions, if we're going to get countries around the world to meet their Paris targets, if we're going to show any leadership on the climate debate, it fascinates me when people like Senator Macdonald infer that we shouldn't do anything on cutting emissions because we're only 1.2 per cent. I believe in obligations, as I'm sure Senator Paterson in this chamber does. If I choose not to pay my tax because I contribute only 0.0000-something per cent of the tax taken in this country, that's not acceptable. How is it acceptable to be saying that because we're only a minor offender or because my offence is only minor it doesn't matter? It all matters. This is what got me fired up and Senator Macdonald fired up during the inquiry.


Last year the World Heritage in Danger committee looked at listing the Great Barrier Reef—and believe me, this is the main game from here on in. I understand, and it was confirmed through questioning through the Senate inquiry, that the tourism industry lobbied against an endangered listing because they felt it might turn away visitors to the Great Barrier Reef, although we had witnesses saying there was no evidence to support that at all—quite the opposite, in other cases. But I was told by someone very senior, whom I won't name in here, that the reason the Great Barrier Reef was not put on the World Heritage in Danger list was that if the Barrier Reef was put on the in-danger list then nearly every coral reef system on this planet would need to be included as well.


The Great Barrier Reef is so significant, but another 40 or so reefs are listed. And I've gone and done my homework on this. I've been to Japan and talked to them about their coral reef systems. They are all in significant trouble. They feed nearly half a billion people on this planet. They rely on these reefs for their livelihoods. No bigger signal could we send the whole world than to get our reefs put on the in-danger list. I can't think of a bigger thing we could do to actually get this world and governments around this world to take action on climate than to sound the loudest possible siren, ring the loudest possible bell on the fact that we are warming our oceans and destroying the ecosystems within these oceans. And ultimately that will backfire on us—and not just the tourism industry but also the fisheries industry.


We heard evidence that there are already impacts of coral bleaching and warming on commercial and recreational fishing industries on the Great Barrier Reef. I have seen this firsthand in my home state of Tasmania. Warming waters in Tasmania not only have caused enormous problems for the salmon industry, which Senator Ruston will be well aware of, but also have helped cause outbreaks of viruses that have been devastating for scallops, as well as Pacific oyster mortality syndrome. We've seen significant problems with the productivity of our abalone industries and our rock lobster industries. People who are ignorant, like Senator Macdonald, believe climate change is just a greenie thing. Well, I've been saying to people until I was black and blue that this is not just about ecosystems, biodiversity and greenie issues; this is about your livelihood and the livelihoods of people who fish the oceans, who depend on it. Oddly enough, if Senator Macdonald actually understood—and I do believe he actually does care about the fishers—he might get it and understand that if we don't take the strongest possible action we are letting these people down.


This is not just a political thing for me. I know that in my home state of Tasmania this is resonating. People are seeing it. I have been along the coastline in the last 12 months. Everyone knows I'm a surfer; they know I'm a diver. And I do a bit of fishing myself. Everyone I talk to is telling me about changes they see in the ocean. And this is happening all around the world. To me, it's the first real, tangible sign of a changing climate—and a negative one, at that. Then we can add the fact that the ocean dictates our weather patterns, such as extreme weather and drought. Warming oceans and changes in ocean temperatures are impacting on us right across this country. If you need a bigger signal that we need to take action, put our differences aside and actually get on with doing everything that we can, just look at what is going on in the oceans. 


This is very important context for this bill—I'm nearly finished, Senator Ruston. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority co-manages with the Queensland government many of these issues. It was involved in the List of World Heritage in Danger discussions and assessments, and there are more coming. We need good people who can make good decisions. I understand why some in the tourism industry don't like this. I've had tourism operators say to me that it's too late. They openly spoke at our Senate inquiry about what they call 'last-chance tourism.' 


It's better to make a fuss about this now and get some action than lose everything for future generations. I'm sorry it is a hard decision to make, but it is a really important one. The Greens and I fully support these changes, and I will say one more time that $60 million for what Senator Macdonald called 'remedial action' is nothing but a bandaid solution. We've had very good scientists say, 'Thanks for the money, we appreciate it, but it may save one area if it works, an area where there is a platform where divers or boats are coming.' It may help us, but this is the biggest ecosystem on the planet. You can see it from space. It stretches for thousands of kilometres. The only thing we can do is to continue to take action on climate, because the rest of it, getting rid of the starfish—




Senator Williams:
  It's the rest of the world, too, Peter.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  The rest of the world needs to take action, too. I totally agree with you, Senator Williams. Whatever happened to leadership in this place? We used to lead the world on climate action, until this government got in power. We used to lead the world. Senator Ruston is probably saying to Senator Williams: 'Don't provoke him. He was going to wind up.' I have a minute and 45 seconds left! 


We used to show leadership on climate. What are we showing leadership on now? Becoming a global arms dealer. That is this government's answer to showing leadership. That's not going to help the climate and it's not going the help the Great Barrier Reef. I'll get back to that another time. 


We need to take action. To anyone who is listening to this debate, I urge you to go to the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee report on the impacts of warming oceans on our fisheries and biodiversity. There is all of the evidence you need there from an excellent inquiry with a lot of good witnesses. Both sides of the story are in those transcripts. There is nothing more important we can do now than take action on climate to help the Great Barrier Reef.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:43):  I thank senators for their contribution and their support of this bill. It is a very important bill because it seeks to implement a new governance model for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority by replacing the full-time chairman with a part-time chairman and a full-time chief executive and establishing one additional part-time member position. It strengthens the requirements for appointment and termination of members. The bill also makes minor technical amendments to clarify the relationship between the suite of legislation underpinning the functions of the authority. 


The bill will strengthen the strategic capacity and capacity of the authority to respond to challenges that face the marine park. The Australian government is absolutely committed to protecting the Great Barrier Reef. We understand the importance of this World Heritage site now and for future generations, and we believe that the effective operation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is absolutely central to being able to deliver on that commitment. I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (12:48):  This afternoon I rise to discuss the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment (Authority Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2017. Indeed, we support the amendments that are contained in this bill, but we do believe that we should be highlighting in the course of this debate the government's inaction on protection of the Great Barrier Reef. We know we established many decades ago now the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and I'm familiar with the governance issues that confront the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in the context of the flaws of that act. So we've had significant concern about the current governance structures and their inadequacy for meeting our reef's changing needs, including the response to the challenges of climate change, coastal development and land based run-off.


We know that back in March last year the government announced an independent review of governance. That was led by Dr Wendy Craik. We also understand that that report was given to the Minister for the Environment and Energy and it evaluated whether management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park under current arrangements was sufficient to support the performance of its statutory functions. There were a number of public submissions and 55 consultation meetings with stakeholders. 


The review found that the marine park authority enjoys strong stakeholder rapport, but there are problems within its current structures. It included a most concerning lack of strategic leadership and management, and an excessive workload for the chairperson. This was found to limit its capacity to fulfil its statutory obligations and responsibilities and impacts on its capacity to manage the impacts of climate change on the reef. It was suggested that refreshed governance arrangements would assist in this regard to allow the authority to better fulfil its role as the expert manager of our reef.


We were pleased to see that the government accepted all of the 24 recommendations for the new Great Barrier Reef Marine Park governance model. These changes will improve its strategic capability and capacity. The bill seeks to implement the recommendations through the numerous amendments to the act, including separating the existence of the full-time chairperson into a part-time chairperson role and full-time chief executive officer with an additional part-time member position. The capacity of the authority will be enhanced by the separation of and time available for those roles. The act will also be amended in order to strengthen requirements for the appointment and termination of members. Indeed, the bill includes minor technical amendments to clarify the marine park legislation's regulating functions.


Labor believes that the passage of this bill supports the transition to new structures without compromising the authority's continued ability to fulfil its statutory functions. We're pleased to see that it provides enough time for the recruitment and appointment of the new chairperson and the new chief executive officer before the expiration of the current term in October this year. We don't believe this bill is contentious but, in supporting this bill, I want to affirm and reiterate our long-term commitment to protecting the Great Barrier Reef and delivering law and policy that promote the reef's long-term health and resilience in the context of climate change.


While the government has been saying that the reef is in good health, we on the Labor side are significantly concerned about its health. We want to see more done on run-off. We want to see more global action and accountability on climate change, because we know that that is one of the major risks to the reef. Australia has played a significant role in dragging its feet in action on climate change, which in turn contributes to the global drag on action on climate change and puts our reef, day by day, at greater risk. We know that the window of time, in which we will be able to protect our reef if climate change continues the way that it is, is closing. If we can't make good on global commitments to rein in emissions and address climate change, then we know that there is a great risk to our reef. I know that people localise debates about the impact of the Adani coalmine. But, in fact, we know that the debate about the Adani coalmine and the concerns of the community also relate to the much wider global debates about climate change and how emissions from fossil fuels need to be managed and made accountable, both at a domestic and a global level. 


I'm proud of the role that Labor has played in protecting our reef. I'm proud to say it was the Whitlam government that implemented Australia's first ever marine reserve over our reef. More recently, it was the Labor Party that established Australia's marine reserve network, which is the largest network of marine protected areas in the world. The attempts of the coalition to undermine the integrity of that network—noting that it is not only the Great Barrier Reef that deserves protection—dismay me. I'm not happy with some of the changes that have been made to marine park boundaries. I believe they're being made without justification or scientific foundation. When the government make decisions like that it leaves me with great concern for their capacity to manage things like the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I'm heartened, somewhat, by the fact that, because of its significance, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park has independent management structures for its oversight. I can only hope for the same for other parts of our iconic and important marine networks. 


We know that our responsibility to care for our marine environment is becoming more and more important day by day, as the impacts of climate change and overfishing affect our marine networks. These threats must be taken seriously by our government, and we need to do all that we can to protect the health of our reef. Management plans are an important part of this work. We know that the Senate and the parliament—and, indeed, the government—have been active in recent times in bringing legislation forward in that regard. Late last year, we amended the act—the very same act that we're debating today—to improve the management plans for the parks as well. 


We need all the practical tools at our disposal to protect our reef, which means we need governance structures in relation to the management of the reef itself but also externally to that, with the concerns about climate change. How do the government and the Labor Party opposition respond to the issues of climate change that affect the long-term health not only of the Great Barrier Reef but of our environmental networks right around the nation? We don't want to see simple management plans that deal with very specific acreage of the reef. We are calling on the government to do more than this and protect the reef from all sides. We want to see the government protecting the Coral Sea, to ensure the rich biosecurity there, on the right side of the reef, is also given adequate protection. I hope that the new governance structures in this legislation mean that there greater capacity to do justice to those important issues.


In our view, the government is not adequately protecting the Coral Sea. Currently you're looking at winding back ocean protections in the Coral Sea, proposing to gut half of that area that was put into the marine national parks that I spoke of before. It's taking a significant step backwards. In fact, it's the largest step backwards that has ever been taken when it comes to conservation in the Coral Sea, and I want to put the Labor Party's concerns about that on the record today in the context of this debate.


Importantly, we need to make sure that we're protecting the reef on the other side. That is what the Queensland Labor government is doing, and that's by doing things like putting land-clearing rules to parliament and ensuring that run-off from land clearing doesn't negatively affect the reef. Those kinds of things can be done adequately only if the governance of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is adequately legislated for by this place. We are significantly concerned about the fact that the government have not acted on climate change and that they're not acting on the causes of climate change—and indeed that some of the MPs opposite us don't even believe it's real. So, while we've got good bureaucrats who can work on things like these governance structures, do good consultations with stakeholders, do good surveys and take submissions, we are vastly held back in our capacity to protect the Great Barrier Reef by the ideologically driven inaction on climate change that is driven by people in this place and the other place.


What it comes down to is that all the good management plans, all the good governance, cannot really do the job if you don't believe in taking strong action on climate change. It simply makes you unfit to protect our iconic Great Barrier Reef. I simply don't trust the government to protect this part of our unique environment. I urge the government to do more to protect one of our most prized environmental assets as a nation. I urge them to stop fighting against responsible land clearing protections and I urge them not to undo protections for the Coral Sea. It's time for them to act on climate change, to address the root causes that will keep our reef healthy.


I can say that we in the Labor Party can and will do these things, because our environmental policy commitments go much further in their protective efforts than these amendments that are before us today. We have a plan for the reef that involves more efficient and long-term management of the reef that is appropriately funded and resourced. We look forward to seeing that funding, that resourcing, that planning and that agenda of the Labor Party and a future Labor government coming within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's governance. For example, we have committed $100 million to review and improve the current management practices for the reef in consultation with relevant stakeholders. We also have a comprehensive climate change action plan that will deliver real action on climate change and, in doing so, address harmful effects of global warming and global emissions on the reef, including coral bleaching.


What we have here for our Great Barrier Reef is an amendment that helps with governance but doesn't really drive at the key risks to our Great Barrier Reef. This is of extreme concern to the Labor Party and it's something we look forward to addressing in government.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-02-08,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:04):  I thank Senator Pratt and the Labor Party for their support for this administration bill in relation to the management of the Great Barrier Reef—the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment (Authority Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2017. I appreciate that Senator Pratt and no doubt Senator Whish-Wilson, who will speak later on this, are correct in saying the Barrier Reef is our Barrier Reef—it's the Barrier Reef of all Australians. But I particularly like to think of the Barrier Reef as my Barrier Reef because I've lived all of my life on the shores of the Great Barrier Reef. I know well the people who operate on the Great Barrier Reef, be they tourist operators, fishermen or scientists out of Townsville, Cairns and Mackay, and over the years I've had a long, long interest in the Great Barrier Reef. 


I know the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority well. It's based in the city of Townsville, where I have my office, and of course the Australian Institute of Marine Science is based at Cape Cleveland, between Townsville and Ayr, to the south of where I live. I pass the AIMS turn-off every day I go to work. And I'm very conscious of some of the very good work that James Cook University does out of the campuses at Townsville and Cairns in relation to marine matters. Most of their work's good. Some is what I would class as questionable and a bit politically motivated, but that's up to individual researchers.


The Barrier Reef is going fine. Senator Whish-Wilson will get up after me and tell the world that the Barrier Reef's dying, it's dead or it shouldn't be visited by the European and North American tourists who flock to that area. The Greens political party seems to have undertaken a campaign to denigrate the Barrier Reef so that one of the great sources of revenue, export earning dollars and jobs in Queensland which come from the reef is decimated. That seems to be the Greens political campaign, because most of the rhetoric that they go on with about the health of the reef, which was unfortunately also mentioned by Senator Pratt, is simply not true. Senator Whish-Wilson will get up after me and tell you it's dead and that all these horrible things are happening, but the fact of the matter is quite different. There are challenges on the Great Barrier Reef. There always have been. But that is well recognised by the government.


I know Senator Pratt, who comes from Western Australia, the other side of the country, and Senator Whish-Wilson, who comes from Tasmania, at the bottom end of the country, love the Barrier Reef as much as I do, but they could hardly be said to have the practical involvement with the reef that I've had over most of my lifetime. Senator Pratt was carrying on about how good the Labor Party is with the Great Barrier Reef. I've done this before, but I refer Senator Pratt to a document put out by Save Our Marine Life, an alliance of leading conservation organisations—not normally friends of ours—which is entitled A big blue legacy: the Liberal National tradition of marine conservation. It goes through, in some detail, the work that Liberal-National governments have done over the years: the prohibition of oil and gas operations on the Barrier Reef by the Fraser government in 1975; the end of whaling in Australian waters and the creation of the first stage of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park by the Fraser government in 1979; the World Heritage listing of the Great Barrier Reef and the creation of the Cairns section of the marine park in 1981; the creation of the Lihou Reef National Nature Reserve in the Coral Sea by the Fraser government in 1982; and the creation of further marine parks by the Howard government 1998. Coalition governments have always been more active in protecting our marine environment right around Australia, as this booklet quite clearly points out.


I've had a lot of discussions with many directors and chairmen of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park over the years. Dr Wendy Craik has conducted a recent review of the authority, and Wendy is the appropriate person to do it because she was once in the position of chair of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, many, many years ago. The idea of splitting the chairmanship from the CEO is a good one; it's something the park authority itself and other stakeholders have wanted. Most of the amendments contained in this bill, as Senator Pratt pointed out, are issues that would have been determined after long consultation with all stakeholders, and I'm pleased to see these amendments are universally supported. 


The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is not a specific scientific research agency, although they do a lot of scientific research. I was particularly pleased in a Senate inquiry that Senator Whish-Wilson chaired—I don't think he ever made a lot of this particular point—when the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority gave evidence that the Coral Sea was actually cooling and that the waters around the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef were actually cooling. That puts the lie to what Senator Whish-Wilson will tell you: no, the waters are all getting warmer, and there's coral bleaching and all that. Yes, there is some coral bleaching; yes, there has been a crown-of-thorns problem. There have been crown-of-thorns starfish there for 60 years that I can remember. Ben Cropp and his wife were the first ones to try and do something about that. Coalition governments have funded very considerable work for the removal of the crown-of-thorns.


I'm delighted to say that just a couple of weeks ago the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, came to Townsville. We went out to AIMS where Mr Turnbull announced to academia, people involved in the reef, tourism operators and other stakeholders in the reef that $60 million for further research and remedial action on the Great Barrier Reef would go to a number of different agencies. We haven't heard a lot about that—and you won't hear about it from the Greens.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  You will hear about it!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Oh, we will. Well, that's good. Well, make sure it's truthful, Senator Whish-Wilson. So there will be an extra $60 million for research on the Great Barrier Reef. 


Importantly, scientists now understand that what they have to do is help with the resilience of the reef. These are my terms, not theirs, but I understand that what they're doing is looking at genetically modifying the reef to give it strength, to give it resilience, to help it progress and continue in the years ahead. They're looking at bringing embryos of warm-water corals into the Barrier Reef. Generally speaking, they are now doing what they should be doing in relation to climate change—that is, understanding that climate change is apparently real and, as I always point out, that, ever since the earth has been going, the climate has continued to change. Once upon a time, the world used to be covered in ice; it's not now. So, clearly, over the years, the climate continues to change. That's an accepted fact. 


What sensible scientists are now concluding is that we've got to see how we can help the reef resile from, deal with or cope with that climate change. I'm delighted that scientific work is now being directed more towards that area, rather than the philosophical political argument about whether climate change is real or true, or who's causing it. They're actually doing things, and that's how it should be. I'm delighted AIMS is heading that way and the CSIRO is heading that way, so that we can do something practical about changes that occur in our climate. 


Senator Pratt and Senator Whish-Wilson no doubt will go on about climate change. I keep saying to them: can someone tell me how Australia, which emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, can stop what Senator Pratt and Senator Whish-Wilson say is causing climate change? Carbon emissions? Well, if they are, it's not Australia that's doing it. Senator Pratt says, 'Labor has a plan to stop climate change.' Well, I don't know how Labor can do that, because Australia's contribution to emissions is less than 1.2 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon. So how Labor is going to deal with that, I'd be very, very interested to see.


I've digressed slightly from this bill and what's happening but I do want to say that I've spoken with administrators, managers, at the marine park authority for some time, and these reforms are what will suit them. I do want to mention there Dr Russell Reichelt, who is the current chairman and CEO. I think he is now retiring after long, dedicated, tremendous service to Australia's marine science, particularly to the Barrier Reef, to GBRMPA and to AIMS. He is a dedicated marine scientist, one of the most knowledgeable. He understands how the whole thing works, and I do want to pay tribute to Dr Reichelt for the research work he has done at GBRMPA and elsewhere.


I return to the issue of climate change and repeat: with Australia emitting less than 1.2 per cent of carbon emissions, if there are things happening, it is not Australia's fault. How the Labor Party are going to stop that, how the Greens would stop it, apart from rhetoric and a few demonstrations up and down the streets, I'm not sure. I want Senator Whish-Wilson to tell me how Australia, which emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, is causing the climate change which the Greens and some in the Labor Party would have you believe.


I refer anyone who is interested to a very good article by Julian Tomlinson in today's Cairns Post about the issue of the Barrier Reef and academic freedom, research and the quality of research. It brings to mind the unfortunate situation which has happened at James Cook University. Professor Peter Ridd, a very well qualified scientist in marine matters, had a different view on the Barrier Reef. He had the temerity to suggest that some of the researchers simply use research—these are my words, not his, but this was the theme, a theme I've had in the past—they know that their future depends upon getting research grants. It used to be under the Labor years that they had to mention climate change or they wouldn't get a research grant for anything. Nowadays that has moved on. They've got to mention the Barrier Reef or they don't get research funds for anything.


Professor Ridd had the temerity to inquire why a lot of the work that was being done by fellow scientists at JCU was not properly peer researched, and because of that he has been sacked by JCU. That's a shame, because I'm a great supporter of JCU. I wrote to the vice-chancellor about the issue when it first happened. I got a response from her, I might say, but I think it's unfortunate. Professor Ridd, as I understand, according to newspaper reports, is before the Federal Court now in relation to his sacking for what he says and what I think is an expression of opinion. I thought universities were there to encourage different views and different approaches and to challenge accepted norms. I thought that's what universities were about, but apparently not at JCU, and that distresses me because, as I say, I'm a great supporter, a great fan and great advocate for JCU.


An interesting thing that Julian Tomlinson mentioned was that Professor Ridd in this court case—and we all know that court cases are very, very expensive—wanted to take action but couldn't afford it. So they did one of these crowd-funding appeals and, within two days, raised $100,000 to help Professor Ridd with his court case. As Julian Tomlinson says, this just demonstrates that people around Australia are getting sick and tired of the Greens continual rhetoric—unsupported, I have to say, by any genuine scientific fact about climate change and its being caused by Australia.


Senator Pratt went on about Adani. Adani is 500, 600 kilometres west of the Great Dividing Range, nowhere near the Barrier Reef. How that mine is going to destroy the Barrier Reef, as Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Pratt have suggested, simply beggars belief and is beyond comprehension.


They then say that there'll be more ships going through the Barrier Reef. Well, that's been happening for 100 years and, with a couple of very minor exceptions, one of which was Bob Brown's boat, there has never been any problem with ships going through the Barrier Reef, because it's so well managed. The marine safety aspects there, the pilots that take everyone through the Barrier Reef—we've got that very well managed. So the arguments about Adani destroying the Barrier Reef just don't stack up. Any serious, sensible person could never make an argument for that, because the facts just don't support them. But it's an interesting article by Mr Tomlinson, and I'd recommend anyone who's interested in this to have a look at it in the Cairns Post today. 


I will leave it there, again emphasising what the marine conservation societies say in A big blue legacy about the legacy of the Liberal and National parties and their tradition in marine conservation over decades. That is demonstrated. One of the things I didn't mention which I perhaps should have is that the green zones were an initiative of David Kemp and Robert Hill as ministers in the Howard government. All of the practical, positive enhancements to the Great Barrier Reef have been done under Liberal and National Party governments, and that was even further demonstrated just a couple of weeks ago, by this allocation of some $60 million to do further research to help the resilience and the continued operations of the Great Barrier Reef—a Great Barrier Reef that all Australians love. Many, I have to say, from Melbourne, Tasmania and Western Australia read the rhetoric; they don't really understand it. But those of us who live there understand just what a special place it is, how it contributes so much to the Queensland and North Queensland economy and how it gives so much pleasure to tourists and locals alike to experience the Great Barrier Reef. Particularly these days it brings joy to northern Europeans and North Americans, as they flock, with others from all over the world, to see this wonderful example of a natural asset that Australia has. 


I will just say, before Senator Whish-Wilson speaks—and again he will try to denigrate the reef and try to turn tourists away, contrary to all the facts from people who actually work on, live near or research the Great Barrier Reef—that I believe the Great Barrier Reef has a great future. With the careful management being provided by the Turnbull government and previous Liberal-National Party governments, we will continue to have this wonderful natural asset which is a joy for the world. I encourage anyone who may be listening to this or who may have an interest in this to visit the Barrier Reef. It is an experience worth having. It is an experience that will be there forever, and it's an experience that is world-class. I urge people to take advantage of it.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-02-08,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (13:23):  I might start my contribution on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment (Authority Governance and Other Matters) Bill 2017 with a question to the Australian people: who would you rather believe? Would you rather believe a Liberal senator whom I think Senator Brandis labelled—correct me if I'm wrong—as the grandfather of the Senate, a Liberal senator who is a self-confessed climate change denier, who doesn't believe in man-made climate change? He is the best the Liberal Party could put in here today. The best they could do was put up Senator Macdonald to speak on behalf of the Great Barrier Reef. He is a self-confessed climate change denier.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ketter
):  Order! Sit down, Senator Whish-Wilson. I just remind the chamber that interjections are disorderly and senators are entitled to be heard in silence. 




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Especially, Acting Deputy President, as I sat through Senator Macdonald's contribution almost completely silently.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I can't even begin to say how many lies you told, Senator Macdonald. Who would you rather believe? Senator Macdonald, the grandfather of the Senate, who's been here way too long in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, who is a climate denier who says—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  That's a lie and you know it!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Here we go, Australia! Here's what he just said in here in the Australian Senate on behalf the Liberal Party: 'The Great Barrier Reef is going fine.' It's going fine! There was an article this week, because there is a meeting in Sydney this week of scientists from all around the world, the Global Climate Forum, that said very clearly that the reef is in 'deep trouble'. That quote came from one of the leading scientists at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Name him!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I'm very happy to name him. His name is David Wachenfeld. I will send the link to you, Senator Macdonald, so you can read it yourself. Get your head out of the sand, you and your government, and do something about climate change and the Great Barrier Reef.


As chair of the environment committee that went to the Great Barrier Reef, I pushed the committee to go diving on the reef. Senator Macdonald directly threatened me that he would get stories run in the Queensland press about me taking a joyride when all I wanted the committee to do was stick their head under the water and see the coral for themselves, which is exactly what I did. Do you know what Senator Macdonald said to me, Acting Deputy President? He said: 'If you want to see coral, go to the AIMS laboratory and have a look at it there. They are growing perfectly good corals in the laboratory.' That's what he said the committee should do.


This is the quality of the people that the LNP have in this parliament on one of the biggest issues of our time, an issue that will impact future generations of Australians. This is the quality of the people—the best they can do in a debate on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and how we need to enhance its effectiveness. He comes in here and attacks scientists, a coward punch, because those scientists don't agree with his climate-denying view of the world. An absolute bloody disgrace—that's what he is and it's about time someone called him out on it.


The reef is in deep trouble. Fifty per cent of the corals are now scientifically classified as having been bleached, and that excludes the damage to the corals done in the zone by Cyclone Debbie. I went to four different sites and saw it for myself. If you don't believe climate change and warming oceans are impacting the Great Barrier Reef, go and stick your head under the water and have a look for yourself. I challenge every politician in this parliament to do exactly that: go up there and have a look for yourself.


It's not just the Great Barrier Reef. In my home state of Tasmania, the south-eastern section of Tasmania and the Tasman Sea is the global hotspot for warming oceans on this planet. We have just lost our giant kelp forests, a 10,000-year-old ecosystem that stretched from the north-east tip of Tasmania to the south. They are gone. They were older than the Great Barrier Reef. They were nurseries to so much marine life and biodiversity. They are gone because of warming waters, storms and invasive species—very similar pressures and stressors that the Great Barrier Reef is facing.


For Senator Macdonald to come in here on behalf of the Liberal Party and claim—this could the biggest quote of the year, or the biggest I've ever seen in this place—that 'the Great Barrier Reef is going fine' is an absolute lie. It's a dangerous lie because it underlies the action that we need to take. I know this because I chaired the Senate committee that took significant evidence on this. The report is there for anyone who wants to read it. We need to do everything we can across the board to help the Great Barrier Reef. Senator Macdonald said the coral reef was cooling on the particular day we happened to be up in his hometown in Cairns.


The coral reef is cooling? We've had unprecedented back-to-back bleaching because of record water temperatures. February is the critical month for this year—fingers crossed that we don't get a third consecutive bleaching event. No-one thought it was even possible we could get two in a row. The models were predicting that that couldn't happen until 2045, yet it happened. These corals will not recover. It takes 15 years for them to recover. The dare that Senator Macdonald put to you in this chamber today is that I wouldn't talk about the $60 million—$60 million!—that this government is putting towards the Great Barrier Reef. I ask every senator in here and the Australian people: what is the Great Barrier Reef worth? What is it worth to you? Just in tangible economic measurements, it is in the billons of dollars. As an economist, I know too well that even though we try and price ecosystem services we can't possibly even begin to value the Great Barrier Reef for its biodiversity. Who can even put a price and value on what's important, the thousands of creatures that rely on the reef for their survival?


It's not just the reef. It's the rainforests and the mangroves. They're all part of the same ecosystem. If the reef dies, if those corals crumble—which they will after they've bleached—it removes cover for the thousands of species that are protected from predators. It will impact the rainfall over the rainforest, because the reef is actually what creates the rain, and the rain creates the mangroves. The mangroves are the nurseries for small fish and they are essential for crocodiles, which actually protect the small fish. That's why it is such a successful symbiotic relationship and one of the greatest ecosystems on this planet.


David Attenborough this year is going to be releasing in Australia Blue Planet II. It was the leading TV series in the UK last year. The rest of the world cares more about the Great Barrier Reef than most Australians—certainly more than Senator Macdonald. People are waking up to this, and they want us to do something about it. I'm sorry if I am so fired up and passionate about this, but I am sick to death of hearing the crap that I hear in here from climate change deniers like Senator Macdonald. I think that Australians are as well. I'm sick of scientists being attacked by people who are funding them. It's just not acceptable.


I digress. Let me get back to the bill. Senator Ruston, the minister at the table, will be pleased to know that the Greens will be supporting this bill. This bill will enhance the authority and functions of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. It will replace an existing full-time chair chairperson with a part-time chairperson position. It will establish an additional part-time member position, bringing the total membership of the authority to seven—that includes the chairperson and the CEO—and it will:


Strengthen requirements for the appointment and termination of members by: specifying the general skills required; limiting the number of consecutive terms served by an individual member; providing for termination of members by the Governor-General for underperformance—


I'll be interested to see what benchmarks are going to be put in place for that underperformance—



and reducing the potential for conflicts of interest.
If this wasn't in non-contro, Senator Ruston, I would take you into the committee stage to find out exactly what those performance benchmarks will be, but I will ask you instead outside the chamber.


Importantly, the parliamentary briefing that we've been given acknowledges the reason for this legislation. The authority's key functions are to:


… advise and make recommendations to the Minister in relation to the care and development of the Marine Park … zoning plans and plans of management …


It acknowledges that, while they're managing the marine park collaboratively with the Queensland government, the review into the governance of these arrangements has found that the scale and workload of the chairperson position has become 'too large for a single person' and:


The legislated size of the Authority and background requirements of the … members limited the capacity to provide local, national and international perspectives and diversity of expertise required …


This is what I'd like to finish my contribution on. I think this is what got Senator Macdonald so fired up in our Senate inquiry when he came up to Townsville and Cairns: we might only be 1.2 per cent of global emissions, but of course Senator Macdonald forgot to tell you that, if you include coal exports, we're up around nearly 5 per cent. We are the Great Barrier Reef's custodians. If we are going to get action on reducing emissions, if we're going to get countries around the world to meet their Paris targets, if we're going to show any leadership on the climate debate, it fascinates me when people like Senator Macdonald infer that we shouldn't do anything on cutting emissions because we're only 1.2 per cent. I believe in obligations, as I'm sure Senator Paterson in this chamber does. If I choose not to pay my tax because I contribute only 0.0000-something per cent of the tax taken in this country, that's not acceptable. How is it acceptable to be saying that because we're only a minor offender or because my offence is only minor it doesn't matter? It all matters. This is what got me fired up and Senator Macdonald fired up during the inquiry.


Last year the World Heritage in Danger committee looked at listing the Great Barrier Reef—and believe me, this is the main game from here on in. I understand, and it was confirmed through questioning through the Senate inquiry, that the tourism industry lobbied against an endangered listing because they felt it might turn away visitors to the Great Barrier Reef, although we had witnesses saying there was no evidence to support that at all—quite the opposite, in other cases. But I was told by someone very senior, whom I won't name in here, that the reason the Great Barrier Reef was not put on the World Heritage in Danger list was that if the Barrier Reef was put on the in-danger list then nearly every coral reef system on this planet would need to be included as well.


The Great Barrier Reef is so significant, but another 40 or so reefs are listed. And I've gone and done my homework on this. I've been to Japan and talked to them about their coral reef systems. They are all in significant trouble. They feed nearly half a billion people on this planet. They rely on these reefs for their livelihoods. No bigger signal could we send the whole world than to get our reefs put on the in-danger list. I can't think of a bigger thing we could do to actually get this world and governments around this world to take action on climate than to sound the loudest possible siren, ring the loudest possible bell on the fact that we are warming our oceans and destroying the ecosystems within these oceans. And ultimately that will backfire on us—and not just the tourism industry but also the fisheries industry.


We heard evidence that there are already impacts of coral bleaching and warming on commercial and recreational fishing industries on the Great Barrier Reef. I have seen this firsthand in my home state of Tasmania. Warming waters in Tasmania not only have caused enormous problems for the salmon industry, which Senator Ruston will be well aware of, but also have helped cause outbreaks of viruses that have been devastating for scallops, as well as Pacific oyster mortality syndrome. We've seen significant problems with the productivity of our abalone industries and our rock lobster industries. People who are ignorant, like Senator Macdonald, believe climate change is just a greenie thing. Well, I've been saying to people until I was black and blue that this is not just about ecosystems, biodiversity and greenie issues; this is about your livelihood and the livelihoods of people who fish the oceans, who depend on it. Oddly enough, if Senator Macdonald actually understood—and I do believe he actually does care about the fishers—he might get it and understand that if we don't take the strongest possible action we are letting these people down.


This is not just a political thing for me. I know that in my home state of Tasmania this is resonating. People are seeing it. I have been along the coastline in the last 12 months. Everyone knows I'm a surfer; they know I'm a diver. And I do a bit of fishing myself. Everyone I talk to is telling me about changes they see in the ocean. And this is happening all around the world. To me, it's the first real, tangible sign of a changing climate—and a negative one, at that. Then we can add the fact that the ocean dictates our weather patterns, such as extreme weather and drought. Warming oceans and changes in ocean temperatures are impacting on us right across this country. If you need a bigger signal that we need to take action, put our differences aside and actually get on with doing everything that we can, just look at what is going on in the oceans. 


This is very important context for this bill—I'm nearly finished, Senator Ruston. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority co-manages with the Queensland government many of these issues. It was involved in the List of World Heritage in Danger discussions and assessments, and there are more coming. We need good people who can make good decisions. I understand why some in the tourism industry don't like this. I've had tourism operators say to me that it's too late. They openly spoke at our Senate inquiry about what they call 'last-chance tourism.' 


It's better to make a fuss about this now and get some action than lose everything for future generations. I'm sorry it is a hard decision to make, but it is a really important one. The Greens and I fully support these changes, and I will say one more time that $60 million for what Senator Macdonald called 'remedial action' is nothing but a bandaid solution. We've had very good scientists say, 'Thanks for the money, we appreciate it, but it may save one area if it works, an area where there is a platform where divers or boats are coming.' It may help us, but this is the biggest ecosystem on the planet. You can see it from space. It stretches for thousands of kilometres. The only thing we can do is to continue to take action on climate, because the rest of it, getting rid of the starfish—




Senator Williams:
  It's the rest of the world, too, Peter.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  The rest of the world needs to take action, too. I totally agree with you, Senator Williams. Whatever happened to leadership in this place? We used to lead the world on climate action, until this government got in power. We used to lead the world. Senator Ruston is probably saying to Senator Williams: 'Don't provoke him. He was going to wind up.' I have a minute and 45 seconds left! 


We used to show leadership on climate. What are we showing leadership on now? Becoming a global arms dealer. That is this government's answer to showing leadership. That's not going to help the climate and it's not going the help the Great Barrier Reef. I'll get back to that another time. 


We need to take action. To anyone who is listening to this debate, I urge you to go to the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee report on the impacts of warming oceans on our fisheries and biodiversity. There is all of the evidence you need there from an excellent inquiry with a lot of good witnesses. Both sides of the story are in those transcripts. There is nothing more important we can do now than take action on climate to help the Great Barrier Reef.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (13:43):  I thank senators for their contribution and their support of this bill. It is a very important bill because it seeks to implement a new governance model for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority by replacing the full-time chairman with a part-time chairman and a full-time chief executive and establishing one additional part-time member position. It strengthens the requirements for appointment and termination of members. The bill also makes minor technical amendments to clarify the relationship between the suite of legislation underpinning the functions of the authority. 


The bill will strengthen the strategic capacity and capacity of the authority to respond to challenges that face the marine park. The Australian government is absolutely committed to protecting the Great Barrier Reef. We understand the importance of this World Heritage site now and for future generations, and we believe that the effective operation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is absolutely central to being able to deliver on that commitment. I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Minister for Rural Health, Minister for Sport, Minister for Regional Communications and Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (15:01):  During question time on Tuesday, I agreed to seek advice from the Minister for Health on whether he'd held certain discussions with his state counterparts. I also agreed to seek advice in relation to Senator Brown's question with respect to South Australia and Tasmania, which I have done. I've been advised that there have been no formal discussions between the minister and his state counterparts in relation to the GST. Commonwealth payments to the states and territories through activity based funding for public hospitals are not affected by changes in the methodology adopted by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in making recommendations on the distribution of GST revenue. Further questions relating to the GST should actually be directed to the Treasurer or his representative in his place.


The Turnbull government is continuing to provide record funding to state and territory public hospitals under the national health agreement. The Commonwealth support for state and territory public hospitals has grown from $13.3 billion in 2012-13 under the former Labor government to $22.7 billion in 2020-21 under the Turnbull government. The Commonwealth funding for public hospital services in Tasmania has increased from $299 million to $441.6 million in 2021, a 47.7 per cent increase over that period. In South Australia, the Commonwealth funding for public hospital services has grown from $1 billion in 2013 to $1.5 billion in 2021, or a 47 per cent increase over this period. Any assertion that there were any cuts is an absolute fallacy.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) and the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia (Senator Canavan) to questions without notice asked by Senators Singh and Urquhart today relating to the distribution of GST revenue and to funding for biosecurity measures in Tasmania.


We've already given this government ample opportunities through the course of this week to rule out, once and for all, that Tasmania and South Australia have anything to fear when it comes to their contribution of the GST being cut. The question asked today by Senator Singh referred to the revised estimates report to the Tasmanian Liberal government Premier, Mr Will Hodgman, which stated that our great state of Tasmania's budget was at risk and is at risk if this federal government cuts any distribution of Tasmania's share of the GST whatsoever.


It's important that we put this into perspective. What does it really mean for the people of Tasmania? The report refers to $168 million—$168 million is what this government is planning to cut from Tasmania's budget. What that means is that more than 1,611 teachers would have to be sacked in Tasmania. Twelve primary schools would have to shut. The health and hospital system is already in crisis in Tasmania. There would have to be a cut of 1,507 nurses. That's what it would equate to. That would be the real impact on Tasmania. We know there are about 1,334 police officers on the front line that would go. These are the priorities that this government has when it comes to the people of Tasmania. We know that the Prime Minister is still hurting and that he still wants to punish Tasmanians because they didn't vote for his weak team.


But what is really so disappointing is that you have the two senators from Tasmania, Senator Abetz and Senator Bushby, who were sitting there with their heads bowed, sitting on their hands saying absolutely nothing. It's not good enough for you go back around the communities in Tasmania and say: 'No, no, we won't do this; we will cross the floor. We won't take this. It's not going to happen.' But in this place they have had the opportunity, as they do every day, to talk to the Prime Minister; to talk to the Treasurer; to talk to the finance minister, Senator Cormann; and ask them to rule out emphatically once and for all that there would be no cut to Tasmania or to South Australia. But, no, we haven't heard one word from the Tasmanian Liberals. Now we know they're weak. We know they have no influence, because neither of the two that were in the chamber supported the Prime Minister when he rolled the former Prime Minister, Mr Abbott. So Tasmania's not getting the support and certainly not getting the representation that it deserves from the Liberals.


The other important issue facing Tasmania at the moment is fruit fly. Biosecurity is so critically important to Tasmania's reputation. It's taken years and decades to build up our international and national reputation for having clean green fantastic food, fantastic wine, fantastic berries. These industries are so important to the state's economy. And what have we seen from the Liberal state government under Will Hodgman? A million dollars cut from Tasmania's biosecurity in his first budget. They have been slack. The minister's taken his eye off the ball when it comes to biosecurity in our state. As I said, this is not just about the dollars that are going to be lost to those producers and those farmers. The real impact will be on the reputation of Tasmania in markets such as Taiwan and China. They've already responded.


Only today we saw reports of how fruit fly has been found in Spreyton, another community in Tasmania that is a fruit-growing area. The impact will be devastating. I have to say the response from the state minister was pathetic. The response to the question that we asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries in the other place was terrible. This is a huge issue for Tasmania, and he wasn't briefed. He wasn't prepared to answer those questions. There's one thing the Tasmanian people can be very clear about—they cannot count on the Liberals at either a state or the federal level. (Time expired)

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:08):  It's quite encouraging that we're having this conversation in the Senate in particular today, because the Senate is where states are best represented. I note that Senator Polley is in here batting for Tasmania, and that's exactly what she should be doing as I should be in here batting for Victoria, because that's what I'm here to do. It's understandable. This is the appropriate forum to be having this discussion. However, that said, I do feel that the entire discussion about the Productivity Commission's draft report is only politically motivated. I do note that it is of course Tasmania and South Australia where we're having state elections—they are the noisy states in this particular debate.


I don't think it would come as any surprise to know that fiscal equalisation, as you well know, has been a feature of Commonwealth-state government relations since the early years of Federation. This is nothing new. Under Australia's current approach, the Commonwealth Grants Commission recommends a GST distribution to the states that provides each state with the capacity to provide its citizens with a comparable level of government services—that's what it's here to do. The current system was agreed by all states prior to the introduction to the GST in the year 2000.


In recent years, clearly, views have been put to the government that the current approach to horizontal fiscal equalisation potentially creates disincentives for reform, including reforms that enhance revenue-raising capabilities or that drive efficiencies in spending, and they argue that any gains from reform are effectively redistributed to the other states. So, in commissioning this inquiry by the Productivity Commission, the government has sought an examination of the issues that underlie those particular claims.


It's absolutely vital for Australia's future prosperity that the system that underpins the Commonwealth-state financial relations supports productivity, efficiency and economic growth across the entire country, not just in one or two specific states. Ultimately, it is all Australians that will benefit when the states actively pursue reforms that seek to improve productivity, efficiency and economic growth within their own jurisdictions. It is absolutely critical that all Australians are entirely confident that our GST-sharing arrangements are working. And the recent circumstances that have resulted in one particular state having an extremely low relativity and therefore a low share of the GST revenue have undermined faith in that GST system amongst some Australians, although, interestingly, not those that we heard from today.


That is why in April last year the Turnbull government commissioned the Productivity Commission to review Australia's system of horizontal fiscal equalisation. That particular inquiry was undertaken to find the impact on the national economy of Australia's system of horizontal fiscal equalisation, which underpins the distribution of GST.


Now the report has come back. It is a draft report only; I think that's been said at least two dozen times in the chamber in the last couple of days. The final report is due to be handed down to the government early this year. The Productivity Commission is currently consulting extensively on that particular report. The government is not ruling anything in and it's not ruling anything out. It would be foolish to do so, and the opposition knows exactly that. It would be foolish to do so. This is the normal process with any Productivity Commission report: we let the commission complete its processes and then we will discuss and consult with the relevant state and territory governments, engage with the Productivity Commission and let everyone have their say on the contents of that report.


The findings and recommendations in that report have found that the current system of GST distribution has served us very well indeed during periods when state situations are relatively similar, but it has not been able to deal with the extremes of outlier circumstances in one particular state—in particular those that have occurred recently in WA. We are the only federation in the world that takes equalisation this far and stretches the rubber band to these kinds of extremes. So the Productivity Commission has recommended revising the objective of the horizontal fiscal equalisation program from the same standard to a reasonable standard.


These recommendations are going to be considered before the government makes any recommendations whatsoever. The scare campaign that is coming from the other side of the chamber is entirely due to the upcoming state elections in both Tasmania and South Australia. I thank those opposite for their the advocacy for their states, but I find it disingenuous.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:13):  I also rise to take note of the answers by Minister Cormann and Minister Canavan—in particular, the appalling response from Minister Canavan in response to three simple questions about the fruit fly emergency that we're facing in Tasmania at the moment.


I note that in January, adult fruit flies were detected on Flinders Island, on one of the eastern islands of Tasmania and also in the north-west of Tasmania. We're getting daily reports of additional fruit flies being detected, both larvae and the adult flies.


People are still arriving in Tasmania by sea and air without biosecurity checks. There's a fruit fly emergency. We haven't had fruit flies in Tasmania until just recently, when they were found in January. This threatens the future of our state's relative pest- and disease-free status, which then affects the markets that we send our fruit and vegetables off to—particularly in Japan, China and a number of Asian countries, but all over the world.


This is a biosecurity emergency that the Tasmanian Liberal government has completely failed to provide any adequate resources for. This emergency is the latest in a chain of biosecurity disasters for Tasmania under the Liberals. We've had Norwegian salmon on supermarket shelves, blueberry rust, Pacific oyster mortality syndrome—and now a fruit fly emergency.


What was particularly appalling about Minister Canavan's response was the lack of simple information from the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. Minister Canavan responded to my first question by reading his brief word for word. My first question specifically asked about what information the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, who is responsible for biosecurity in this country, had sought about the fruit fly emergency, the consequences of the Tasmanian Liberal government cutting $1 million from that biosecurity budget and the consequences of people arriving from mainland Australia without biosecurity checks.


Minister Canavan did not dispute that the Tasmanian Liberals cut $1 million from the biosecurity budget. No, he didn't say anything about that. He didn't dispute that people are arriving in Tasmanian airports and seaports from mainland Australia without adequate security checks. He just read the lines. At one point I heard him say that there is well-established monitoring in Tasmania. I pay tribute to the hardworking men, women and dogs from Biosecurity Tasmania, but to say that there is well-established monitoring does not specifically answer the question about how the crisis is being handled in Tasmania.


As I explained to the chamber in my question, people are still arriving in Tasmania by sea and air without those biosecurity checks. Last week I attended a Senate inquiry in Melbourne. When I flew back into Devonport on Thursday afternoon there was no-one at Devonport airport undertaking any biosecurity checks—not one person, not a sniffer dog—in the middle of a fruit fly emergency and at the one airport that's actually within the control zone. How is that allowed to happen? How can that happen?


It's clear that the Tasmanian Liberal government are out of their depth in protecting Tasmania's interests. Again, the Tasmanian Liberals are not communicating with their colleagues, otherwise Minister Canavan would have been able to answer the questions that I asked. Labor, on the other hand, has a very strong relationship between federal and state branches of our party. I know that our Tasmanian shadow minister for primary industries, Mr Shane Broad, and the member for Braddon, Justine Keay, are working hard on consulting with industry and holding the weak Tasmanian Liberal government to account.


My second question to Minister Canavan requested information on whether the Tasmanian Liberal government had made any representations to the Australian government for additional support for the fruit fly biosecurity emergency. Just as he had read the brief, word for word, for the first question, his complete nonanswer to the second question demonstrated that the Tasmanian Liberals have not picked up the phone and not put pen to paper to get the Australian government involved. If they had have done then it would have been contained in the brief that he referred to.


The Tasmanian Liberals have failed business, failed the community and failed our farmers. Their budget cuts to vital biosecurity services, coupled with the ridiculously slow place of their response to this emergency and not ensuring we have biosecurity checks at our airports at the most vulnerable time, are incomprehensible.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:18):  Clearly there is an election in the air in both Tasmania and South Australia, because all we hear from the other side are scare campaigns to try and convince the voters in those states to vote for the Labor Party. Let's take the example of fruit fly. If you believe the senator opposite in the contribution that she just made, it is the presence of a Liberal government in Tasmania that has caused a fruit fly emergency. Heaven forbid she should look at South Australia where there's a Labor government!


At the moment, unfortunately, despite the best efforts of state and federal governments, Queensland fruit fly has been detected in the Riverland, in the pest-free area. That hasn't triggered an outbreak, but one of our trading partners—Indonesia—has expressed concerns, and that's resulted in new biosecurity measures being required before we can export there. So we're working to try and get that status, as a fruit-fly- pest-free area, restored.


There was also an outbreak of Mediterranean fruit fly in February in Adelaide, in the suburbs. We've implemented in South Australia the eradication in accordance with the codes of practice. But what I'm getting at is that they choose to ignore an outbreak in South Australia, where there's a Labor government, and they talk only about an outbreak in Tasmania, because there happens to be a Liberal government there, rather than accepting that this is a fact of agriculture in Australia and that we have a program at both federal and state level, regardless of who is in power, to empower our agencies to take measures to reduce the risk of fruit fly infection or the occurrence of an outbreak. 


We've already committed some $200 million extra to building a better biosecurity system, through the Agricultural competitiveness white paper. As a result, the total expenditure for biosecurity this financial year is $752.7 million. That's a 25 per cent increase in this area since the coalition came to power here in Canberra. I'd encourage people who are listening to this debate to realise that much of what they're hearing from the Labor Party is purely a scare campaign and it ignores the realities. 


When it comes to South Australia and GST, the Labor Party again is trying to launch a scare campaign that some change is coming to the GST and that South Australia is going to be worse off. In South Australia, ever since the scheme started in 2000, there has been a trend upwards in the amount of GST we have received. From 2013, when the coalition came to power, the amount of GST in South Australia has continued to increase. The state government is receiving more money through the GST than it's ever had. The question South Australians should be asking is: with this money coming from the GST rolling into the state, how well is the state government spending it? 


There are a few good examples that people should be looking at and asking questions of Premier Weatherill and his government as to whether he has made good use of that money. They should be asking why, in the middle of the blackout in South Australia, when all the lights went out, he didn't work with Alinta—who had highlighted the risk of blackouts, the risk of not investing in baseload power, and had asked for a contribution by the state government of just over $20 million to keep the Port Augusta power plant operating—and instead Premier Weatherill pursued what he calls his great big experiment of renewable energies. We ended up in a situation where the government came up, after that blackout, with a plan to spend $550 million, and hundreds of millions of dollars of that was on diesel generators—diesel generators! 


Look at Transforming Health. Transforming Health has resulted in a huge amount of expenditure in South Australia, including the world's most expensive hospital. And yet we are hearing from health professionals that the level of health care available to South Australians is decreasing both in quality and in scope. The very basis that was used by then Minister Snelling to justify that expenditure—mortalities in care—has been shown to be flawed and false. Here is a government that, driven by ideology rather than science, is wasting the GST that is going to South Australia. On 17 March the people of South Australia have a very clear choice. If you want a strong government for a strong future, vote for Steven Marshall and the Liberal Party.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:23):  I rise to take note of answers provided by Senator Cormann to my questions asking him to rule out any changes to the GST distribution to South Australia and Tasmania. Today he certainly refused to rule that out or answer the questions, even though this was yet another opportunity for him to do so. He's been given several opportunities this week by other South Australian and Tasmanian senators on this side of the chamber, and today he had yet another. 


We know that Treasurer Scott Morrison used the cover of the summer break to announce that the Turnbull government had extended the deadline—this is a very important point that some government senators seem to forget—for the Productivity Commission inquiry's report into the economic impact of horizontal fiscal equalisation from January to 15 May. That ensured that this really important report would be delayed until after both the South Australian and the Tasmanian elections. That was a decision made by the Turnbull Liberal government to clearly show that, between now and then, in both Tasmania and South Australia, we will not know the size of the intentions of the Turnbull government to change our horizontal fiscal equalisation distribution of the GST. They buried this report until after the elections because they cannot guarantee to the people of Tasmania whether we will be worse off.


What we know, though, is that with the Turnbull government's changes to the GST distribution scenario, Tasmanians will be worse off. I asked a question today and referred to the Tasmanian Treasury's Revised estimates report, which lists the Turnbull government's proposed changes to the GST formula as a major risk to the Tasmanian state budget. I quote: 'Tasmania's share of the GST could fall by $168 million.' On top of that, the Productivity Commission's interim report shows that GST revenue for South Australia could fall by $557 million.


To the senators opposite who think this is some kind of election ploy, it is all happening on your side. You're the ones keeping Tasmanians and South Australians in the dark. This report was supposed to be handed down in January. We would then go to the state election knowing full well what the Turnbull Liberal government had proposed for the bottom line in Tasmania's budget and, indeed, also in South Australia's budget. But, no, they have decided to instead help the Liberal Party in Tasmania win the election on a false promise. In doing so, they have avoided the necessary scrutiny. Tasmanian voters have the right to know before they go to the polls on 3 March.


We won't give up on this. We won't give up on the way that the Turnbull Liberal government is trying to hide, obfuscate and hoodwink the Tasmanian electorate on this. This is fundamentally important. We talk about horizontal fiscal equalisation. It's something that John Howard certainly supported. He didn't touch it in the way that the Turnbull Liberal government is doing. All week, my Tasmanian colleagues have been interrogating the Liberal leadership in both houses on their plans, but what we haven't heard is anything from the Tasmanian Liberal senators. They have been completely quiet on this issue. Where are they in standing up for Tasmania, Tasmania's revenue and a fair share of revenue from the federal government? Absolutely silent. Tasmania's Leader of the Opposition, Rebecca White, has been doing everything she can since the Treasurer first proposed these changes and will continue to do so, to fight for Tasmania's share of the GST and ensure that our schools and hospitals are funded adequately.

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (15:35):  On behalf of the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the report of the committee on the review of the listing of Islamic State Khorasan Province and the re-listing of al-Murabitun as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code, and I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I'm pleased to present the committee's report on the listing of Islamic State Khorasan Province and the re-listing of al-Murabitun as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code. The Criminal Code enables the committee to review the listing of terrorist organisations and report its findings to the parliament within the 15-day disallowance period. This is the first time Islamic State Khorasan Province has been listed as a terrorist organisation.


Islamic State Khorasan Province is a recognised partner of Islamic State, with an estimated membership of up to 11,000 members. The group's primary objective is to establish the province of Khorasan—a region encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia—as part of the global caliphate of Islamic State. Since 2015, the group has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks, including suicide bomb attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan.


Al-Murabitun is an al-Qaeda-aligned Sunni Islamic terrorist group that is committed to enforcing sharia law in West Africa and uniting Muslims and Islamic movements across Africa against non-Muslim and secular influences. The group was first declared a terrorist organisation by the Australian government in November 2014. Since then the group has reaffirmed its alliance to al-Qaeda and continues to conduct attacks in West Africa. The group funds its activities through smuggling, connections with other terrorist organisations and kidnappings for ransom. In 2016 the group kidnapped Australian citizens Jocelyn and Kenneth Elliot. The group claimed the primary motive for this kidnapping was to gain the release of their captives. Jocelyn Elliot was released, but Kenneth Elliot has not yet been recovered.


In conducting its review, the committee considered publicly available information and carefully reviewed the procedures followed by the government and the merits of the listings themselves. The committee was satisfied that appropriate processes had been followed and that both organisations should be listed as terrorist organisations. The committee therefore supports the listing of Islamic State Khorasan Province and the re-listing of al-Murabitun, and finds no reasons to disallow the legislative instruments. I commend the report to the Senate.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:39):  Just because of the hard marker in the Senate papers, I was making some remarks about Labor's reason for moving this partial disallowance motion, which relates particularly to our concerns about illegal logging and the devastation that it causes in the social and environmental contexts as well as the economic damage that it does. When my time this morning concluded, I was at a point where I was talking about Australian Labor Party values with regard to third-party certification as a means of helping demonstrate sustainability, and I was supporting its inclusion in Commonwealth procurement systems, particularly for products that are certified in Australia. But one of the concerns that we have with this particular construction from the government is that there are a number of examples of certified products that are proving to have been sourced from illegally logged forests in recent times. Having now been uncovered, this cannot be ignored, and that is why this partial disallowance is being put by Labor.


The requirements assess whether the information and evidence obtained by using the framework are accurate and reliable, and we are concerned that this should remain. We believe that we need the requirements to identify and assess, by using the framework and the gathered information, whether there is a risk that the product is made from or includes illegally logged timber. We also consider that the requirements should be used to consider any other information the importer knows, or ought reasonably know, that may indicate whether the product is made from or includes illegally logged timber. We also consider a written record should be kept of the process used to make the assessment.


These sorts of conditions are not unduly onerous. These are practical ways of preventing illegal logging and interrupting the trade in illegal logging. For the processing of domestically harvested logs, where there is a pretty strong understanding of local supply chains, we think that these provisions should remain.


These requirements are not worth removing when it entails a heightened risk of the penetration of illegally logged timber and timber products into the Australian market, which we know would undermine the Australian industry and Australian jobs. This is at the core of why Labor is making these partial disallowances today. Australian jobs matter to us. Making sure that we don't undermine the supply chain and that we support Australian industry is a critical business that we take very seriously in this place.


The matter of the make-up of the regulations is finally concluded, more than three years after Minister Frydenberg initiated the government review. It is slow, but Labor plans to focus on encouraging a greater emphasis on compliance with the law and regulations, and will explore options to enhance the department's capacity to ensure adherence to the law. I thank the chamber for its attention to these matters.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-02-08,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (15:42):  I rise to speak on this disallowance motion moved by me and by Senators Brown and Hinch. The Greens do not see amending these regulations of the Illegal Logging Prohibition Amendment as justified, and we have concerns that they weaken the provisions that we have in place. We have those provisions in place for a very good reason: to tackle the major global issue of illegally logged timbers circulating in the marketplace. Australia must maintain high standards in order to play our part. It is not okay for us to squib on our responsibility to address the scourge of illegally logged wood products. The environmental costs, not to mention the social and the economic costs, are too high.


I want to start by setting the scene as to why this is important. The work that has been done in recent years by this government and the previous government has made it clear that illegal logging is still a huge issue in forests around the world. It is estimated that almost 10 per cent of the timber being imported into Australia may have come from wood sources and forests that have been illegally logged. This is huge. Almost one piece in 10 of every piece of timber being imported is likely to have been illegally logged—which almost certainly involved trashing forests that are critical for animals and birds, destroying forests that should be kept to soak up carbon, destroying forests that would otherwise be providing clean water, and, in many cases, destroying forests that are home to and provide the livelihoods for indigenous peoples around the world. Just in our region, illegal logging in Papua New Guinea, West Papua and Indonesia is still a very significant issue, destroying the lives of people and forests and the animals that live in these forests.


There was a 2013 report of logging in PNG by the non-government organisation Global Witness, which looked at logging occurring in their special agricultural and business leases, which they found was the source for around one in every 10 tropical logs entering the Chinese market. Global Witness concluded that most logging in these special agricultural business leases had violated laws designed to protect land rights for indigenous people. According to the report, time after time villagers denied that they had given permission for their land to be included in the leases.


There is not only the impact of illegal logging on communities around the world but there is another reason right here at home why we need to tackle overseas illegal logging: that is because timber and paper from this illegal logging undercuts our own wood products industry at home. We shouldn't be in a situation where timber and paper that is coming from well-managed Australian plantations has to compete with artificially cheap forest and livelihood-destroying illegally logged timber. But here we have this government wanting to water down the regulations that have been established to ensure the best chance of reducing illegally logged timber coming into the country.


The change appears to be motivated by an overall ideology from this government to reduce red tape. It was back in 2014 that the environment minister, Mr Frydenberg, in his then role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, kicked off this push to deregulate our framework to address illegally logged products. Of course, we have seen many spheres where this government has hacked away at sensible, robust regulatory frameworks in the guise of cutting red tape. But in doing so in this instance, we risk becoming a global dumping ground for illegally logged timbers, weakening the overall global framework. Driven by this agenda, the government kicked off a regulatory impact statement process to review the regulations, aiming at finding ways to reduce unnecessary costs from the framework. That was then put in place to ensure due diligence was exercised by importers of timber products. This regulatory impact statement process examined six options to try and carve out savings and then recommended two of them.


The statement came out in October last year and it proposed to streamline the processes for businesses, subject to the regulations, but undertaking the regulatory amendments we are discussing today. What is being proposed via this regulation change is to allow importers and domestic processors to use third-party timber specification frameworks to assess the risk associated with a regulated timber product, specifically the FSC and PEFC certifications, the Forest Stewardship Council and the Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification. This change will create a new deemed-to-comply arrangement for products that are certified under FSC or PEFC. Any products imported that have either of those figures will automatically be deemed to be okay to be imported and not linked to illegal logging activities, and, in doing so, will remove the due diligence requirement which is in place in order to make sure that there is a robust examination of the supply chains for imported timber products.


As Greens, we don't support this is a good change because it is not justified when compared to its impact on the global and domestic timber trade. In taking this position, the Greens recognise the important role that certification schemes play in the timber and wood products markets and that as the most robust and credible certification, FSC certification in particular is a really important scheme that signals to importers and consumers that the product they are buying comes from well-managed sources.


Globally, FSC sets the bar very high for ecologically and socially responsible forest management. It is worth noting for reference that there is no logging of native forests on public land in Australia that meets the FSC certification standards. FSC recognises that logging that is putting birds and animals, like Leadbeater's possums and swift parrots in Australia, at risk of extinction because it doesn't meet their standards. I am going to talk more about this when we come to general business later this afternoon.


PEFC, on the other hand, is an industry-led certification scheme that's got much weaker standards, and it's been criticised for being a tick-box exercise that excludes social and environmental experts from its processes. There are a lot of complexities when it comes to talking about forest certification standards, but primarily I do want to make this distinction between FSC and PEFC. I also want to note that both standards, to different degrees, have come under scrutiny over time. For this reason, we need to maintain a safety net of a due diligence process for any importers sourcing timber products certified under these schemes.


The government gives two justifications for weakening the regulations. The first is the cost imposition on Australian timber importers. The second is that being certified under either FSC or PEFC effectively means all of the due diligence has already been done, so requiring extra work to be done is just doubling up. I'll deal with each of these justifications separately; firstly, the cost imposition on Australian timber importers. The government claims that this change would save the industry $4.2 million annually, but that is a tiny proportion of the overall value of the industry. The government's own regulatory impact statement tells us that we have an $8 billion timber import industry in Australia and, as I've already noted, a risk of up to nine per cent of the timber imported being illegally logged. Yet the government's own regulatory impact statement notes that keeping the status quo of continuing to require due diligence had an average compliance cost per importer of around $1,500 a year, and that it took about 23 hours each year to undertake that due diligence for each importer. So, to meet the current due diligence requirements, we're talking about a cost, as a percentage of the total value of regulated imports, of 0.0037 per cent, based on 2015 import values. And the regulatory impact statement tells us that these figures are potentially overstating the costs. The impact statement says:


… these estimates may overstate the overall cost of compliance for importers. In practice, a sizable number of product lines, once their initial due diligence process has been completed and they have been determined to be low risk, are likely to require only minimal intervention by an importer.


This is the government's own regulatory impact statement. So, in the context of this industry, we cannot see that this very, very small cost burden, when spread across all the businesses in the industry, is significant enough to warrant the risks of removing a safety net that guards against illegal products entering our market.


The government's second justification is essentially that the due diligence has been done with FSC- and PEFC-certified wood products, so it's just doubling up. Firstly, it's worth noting that this would be a novel approach from Australia in a global environment where other countries are facing the same issues. It was highlighted in several submissions to the regulatory impact statement process that neither the European Union nor the United States formally recognises third-party certification systems as a means of ensuring timber legality, although notably both do allow them to be used as part of a system of due diligence or due care. So, if we loosen our requirements in comparison to those markets, we're going to risk becoming a dumping ground for illegally logged timbers.


The reason that the US and the EU don't accept these certification schemes is that these certification schemes are not fail-safe. There have been two recently publicised examples of the failure of these schemes. One was illegal logging in Romania. Despite the products being sourced by an Austrian company with FSC chain-of-custody certificates, FSC took a long time to revoke the certificates and rectify the situation, despite being presented with the evidence of illegal logging. There is also a current example in Peru, where one of Peru's largest exporters was blocked from US exports under their prohibition despite having two valid FSC certificates. A month later, the US government banned all imports from this company because they found massive amounts of illegal timber in their shipment. So if we had changed our regulations now, that company would be free to send all of that timber to Australia instead under the new deemed-to-comply provision. That's two examples of where the FSC certification has failed.


The FSC is extremely robust compared to the PEFC. Many PEFC schemes have much lower standards and hardly any independent controls. I certainly don't think that, overall, PEFC certification is worth the paper that the certificates are printed on. The Australian version of PEFC is the Australian Forestry Standard, which certifies as legal and attempts to greenwash clear-fell logging in Australia, which has been challenged time and time again in the courts and been found to not be legal. You only need to look at the court successes of Environment East Gippsland over illegal rainforest logging and logging which is destroying the habitats of threatened species and the lack of proper surveys in previously unlogged forests—such as in the Kuark forests of East Gippsland—to see that PEFC certification, even based on the Australian version of it here, cannot reliably be used for due diligence.


The other thing to bear in mind with certification and whether it's good enough for due diligence is that where you've got strong certification, such as FSC certification, it actually makes the required due diligence much easier. Where there is a robust certification scheme with robust chains of custody, then it is actually easy to check the certificates. It will streamline and considerably reduce the cost of undertaking due diligence. If a company is importing FSC-certified timber, the cost of that due diligence, I'm sure, will be far, far less than what was estimated in the regulation impact statement.


As such, I expect that maintaining due diligence, even on certified products, will in fact encourage the use and the import of FSC-certified timber as opposed to PEFC-certified timber and, indeed, uncertified timber. That is a good thing. If supporting and reinforcing the Forest Stewardship Council brand then flows on to increasing the use of Australian FSC-certified timber, which is almost all sustainable plantation-sourced timber in Australia, then that will be an absolutely welcome bonus of maintaining these regulations as they stand.


I want to conclude by emphasising that our role in these global supply chains is crucial. Illegal logging is a global problem, and Australia must do its bit to uphold a robust framework to address it. The Greens cannot see any good reason to allow these regulation changes to be implemented. For this reason, we have co-sponsored this disallowance motion, and we are seeking the Senate's support for the maintenance of a sensible and robust approach to keep illegally logged timber out of the Australian market.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (15:58):  Before I make some comments about why the government believes that the regulation amendments that we are seeking to put before this place are sensible and balanced, can I just make a few comments about some of the comments that have been made about this disallowance motion by those who have spoken before me. It comes as no great surprise that it is of great concern to me that Senator Rice would actually suggest that the federal government's position of having a desire to reduce red tape for Australian businesses is somehow a bad thing. I would have thought it was eminently sensible for us to be constantly looking at ways and means by which we can reduce the financial and cost burden on Australian businesses if there is demonstrated fact that the cost of the regulation far outweighs the benefits of anything that it's trying to achieve.


It's also interesting that Senator Rice makes many comments about the Greens not being satisfied—that she's not satisfied. I absolutely assure this chamber that the very extensive review that assessed the need for and impact of the regulations that were brought in in conjunction with the illegal logging legislation that was brought in by this government at the start of our term was undertaken by a number of independent assessors. It was a very robust process. It sought to speak to people across the entire supply chain: importers, domestic operators and unions. So to suggest that somehow what the Greens say or what Senator Rice thinks is a more robust way to assess the efficacy of a particular regulation—I'm sorry, I'm going to have to say that I would rather take the word of and outcomes that have been delivered to us by an independent, transparent, robust and scientifically based process than what she may think.


I'd also draw to the attention of this place to the fact that it is incumbent on every government, no matter of what persuasion, and everybody in this place to understand that nothing is ever going to be perfect. What we're entrusted to do is make sure that we strike a balance so that we are not, as in the old saying, smashing a walnut with a sledgehammer. If, as legislators, we believe that the burden of the regulation far outweighs any benefit that the regulation puts into place, then it's incumbent on us to assess that and make a decision that you cannot possibly regulate the Australian economy out of existence just because you want to deliver an absolutely perfect environment, where absolutely nothing ever has any risk. You cannot triage by legislation all risk out of existence in Australia.


First of all, I congratulate the Australian forestry industry for their response to the introduction of illegal-logging regulations. They have worked extremely hard to make sure they've got their businesses and their importing businesses up to speed so that they can address the very serious issue of illegally logged timber, seeing that Australia is doing everything that's reasonably possible to make sure that we're not a country where illegally logged timber is imported.


The coalition government, by its very actions, has demonstrated that it is absolutely committed to combatting illegal harvesting of timber. But we recognise that the importance of preventing illegally logged timber being imported into Australia has to be balanced by making sure that the regulatory burden we place on importers is at a relevant and an appropriate level so that we combat the illegal logging but don't destroy our businesses in the process.


I'd also draw to the chamber's attention that when Senator O'Neill was making her contribution to this particular disallowance motion, she made a comment about $800 million of timber that's being imported into Australia and that there was some risk of it being logged illegally. Again, Senator Rice drew attention to the estimate that up to nine per cent of timber that's logged internationally has some risk of having been sourced illegally. I'd like to point out to the chamber that just because something is averaged across the whole of the world doesn't necessarily mean that Australia has to accept its proportion of that particular issue. In many instances, Australia is a world leader in how we go about things, whether it be in our forestry sector, our fisheries sector, our water management sector or our agricultural sector. We have some of the most robust regulations in place to ensure that we hit well above the average in making sure that we are very compliant in many of the things that we do. So to pluck a sum out of the air and say that because the world has up to nine per cent illegally logged timber—it's in our report and I admit it's in our report—is not a direct correlation to saying that nine per cent of wood that's imported into Australia being illegally logged.


I think this probably highlights very clearly one of the most insidious things that are seeping into our country at the moment, and that is that you can twist and distort facts. You can twist and distort the science, and in many instances you can actually tell untruths to try to argue your point. And we see time and time and time again from the Greens where the inconvenient truth is completely disregarded because it makes a much better argument for us to come in here and twist the facts so it looks like a much worse situation than really exists on the ground.


All we serve to do by this false information, this misrepresentation of the facts, is to damage our industries—our industries that are recognised, if you look at peer group review of the science, as some of the best and most effective, efficient and sustainable in the world in just about everything we do in Australia. And yet we seem to think that it's okay to come in here and spread misinformation to the rest of the world so they actually think that Australian industries are not the fantastic industries they are. I can assure you I will, day in, day out, never fail to stand up in this place and defend the amazing environmental credentials of all of our agricultural industries and sectors, because they are the best in the world. They deserve to be supported and they deserve to be protected against the misinformation that's often thrown our way by those that sit opposite.


But I move on to the actual disallowance. I'm disappointed that those opposite are choosing to move to disallow this. I would question particularly the Labor Party and their support of this disallowance. Does their hypocrisy know no bounds? I can assure you that I've been working on this particular issue with industry, with importers in the Australian domestic timber industry, for a number of years. In fact, it was one of the first chores and tasks that I undertook when I was appointed to this particular position. The Labor Party had been out amongst industry up until the last week of 2017, spruiking their support for these particular amendments and changes to the regulations. And then, lo and behold, somehow over the Christmas period we found that someone, whether it's the CFMEU or whoever, had somehow got into their heads, and now they don't support these regulations.


I generally thought, from the comments that I had been hearing and receiving as I had been travelling around the country, talking to our timber industry and consulting on this particular issue, that those opposite actually also understood that, if you go through the rigorous process of getting yourself certified by an independent certification standard, particularly FSC in the case of the Greens—FSC is auspiced by the World Wildlife Fund, about whose credentials they seem quite happy to crow at every other instance, particularly when there's money at the other end of it. They then come into this place and say that it's not good enough anymore.


I don't know what went on, but all I can say is that this just seems to me to smack once again of the 'no' politics we see from those opposite. All we're doing is, in effect, stopping the release back to industry of nearly $5 million that's been independently assessed as being an unnecessary regulatory burden on the Australian forest-products-importing industry. So it is with great disappointment that I find that the Labor Party, the Greens and Senator Hinch have chosen not to recognise that there is very, very little risk of any further imported timber into this country having been illegally sourced after the addition of a deem-to-comply condition on the two internationally recognised standards, FSC and PEFC. The benefits of this arrangement would be simply to reduce an unnecessary cost on industry and, in the process of doing so, make very little difference to the outcome.


So it is with great regret that it appears to me as if these particular very small changes to regulation that we have before us will not pass this place. All I can say is: shame on those opposite for the hypocrisy that they have shown in not supporting these amendments.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2, the disallowance motion standing in the names of Senators Brown, Hinch and Rice, be agreed to.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:39):  Just because of the hard marker in the Senate papers, I was making some remarks about Labor's reason for moving this partial disallowance motion, which relates particularly to our concerns about illegal logging and the devastation that it causes in the social and environmental contexts as well as the economic damage that it does. When my time this morning concluded, I was at a point where I was talking about Australian Labor Party values with regard to third-party certification as a means of helping demonstrate sustainability, and I was supporting its inclusion in Commonwealth procurement systems, particularly for products that are certified in Australia. But one of the concerns that we have with this particular construction from the government is that there are a number of examples of certified products that are proving to have been sourced from illegally logged forests in recent times. Having now been uncovered, this cannot be ignored, and that is why this partial disallowance is being put by Labor.


The requirements assess whether the information and evidence obtained by using the framework are accurate and reliable, and we are concerned that this should remain. We believe that we need the requirements to identify and assess, by using the framework and the gathered information, whether there is a risk that the product is made from or includes illegally logged timber. We also consider that the requirements should be used to consider any other information the importer knows, or ought reasonably know, that may indicate whether the product is made from or includes illegally logged timber. We also consider a written record should be kept of the process used to make the assessment.


These sorts of conditions are not unduly onerous. These are practical ways of preventing illegal logging and interrupting the trade in illegal logging. For the processing of domestically harvested logs, where there is a pretty strong understanding of local supply chains, we think that these provisions should remain.


These requirements are not worth removing when it entails a heightened risk of the penetration of illegally logged timber and timber products into the Australian market, which we know would undermine the Australian industry and Australian jobs. This is at the core of why Labor is making these partial disallowances today. Australian jobs matter to us. Making sure that we don't undermine the supply chain and that we support Australian industry is a critical business that we take very seriously in this place.


The matter of the make-up of the regulations is finally concluded, more than three years after Minister Frydenberg initiated the government review. It is slow, but Labor plans to focus on encouraging a greater emphasis on compliance with the law and regulations, and will explore options to enhance the department's capacity to ensure adherence to the law. I thank the chamber for its attention to these matters.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-02-08,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (15:42):  I rise to speak on this disallowance motion moved by me and by Senators Brown and Hinch. The Greens do not see amending these regulations of the Illegal Logging Prohibition Amendment as justified, and we have concerns that they weaken the provisions that we have in place. We have those provisions in place for a very good reason: to tackle the major global issue of illegally logged timbers circulating in the marketplace. Australia must maintain high standards in order to play our part. It is not okay for us to squib on our responsibility to address the scourge of illegally logged wood products. The environmental costs, not to mention the social and the economic costs, are too high.


I want to start by setting the scene as to why this is important. The work that has been done in recent years by this government and the previous government has made it clear that illegal logging is still a huge issue in forests around the world. It is estimated that almost 10 per cent of the timber being imported into Australia may have come from wood sources and forests that have been illegally logged. This is huge. Almost one piece in 10 of every piece of timber being imported is likely to have been illegally logged—which almost certainly involved trashing forests that are critical for animals and birds, destroying forests that should be kept to soak up carbon, destroying forests that would otherwise be providing clean water, and, in many cases, destroying forests that are home to and provide the livelihoods for indigenous peoples around the world. Just in our region, illegal logging in Papua New Guinea, West Papua and Indonesia is still a very significant issue, destroying the lives of people and forests and the animals that live in these forests.


There was a 2013 report of logging in PNG by the non-government organisation Global Witness, which looked at logging occurring in their special agricultural and business leases, which they found was the source for around one in every 10 tropical logs entering the Chinese market. Global Witness concluded that most logging in these special agricultural business leases had violated laws designed to protect land rights for indigenous people. According to the report, time after time villagers denied that they had given permission for their land to be included in the leases.


There is not only the impact of illegal logging on communities around the world but there is another reason right here at home why we need to tackle overseas illegal logging: that is because timber and paper from this illegal logging undercuts our own wood products industry at home. We shouldn't be in a situation where timber and paper that is coming from well-managed Australian plantations has to compete with artificially cheap forest and livelihood-destroying illegally logged timber. But here we have this government wanting to water down the regulations that have been established to ensure the best chance of reducing illegally logged timber coming into the country.


The change appears to be motivated by an overall ideology from this government to reduce red tape. It was back in 2014 that the environment minister, Mr Frydenberg, in his then role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, kicked off this push to deregulate our framework to address illegally logged products. Of course, we have seen many spheres where this government has hacked away at sensible, robust regulatory frameworks in the guise of cutting red tape. But in doing so in this instance, we risk becoming a global dumping ground for illegally logged timbers, weakening the overall global framework. Driven by this agenda, the government kicked off a regulatory impact statement process to review the regulations, aiming at finding ways to reduce unnecessary costs from the framework. That was then put in place to ensure due diligence was exercised by importers of timber products. This regulatory impact statement process examined six options to try and carve out savings and then recommended two of them.


The statement came out in October last year and it proposed to streamline the processes for businesses, subject to the regulations, but undertaking the regulatory amendments we are discussing today. What is being proposed via this regulation change is to allow importers and domestic processors to use third-party timber specification frameworks to assess the risk associated with a regulated timber product, specifically the FSC and PEFC certifications, the Forest Stewardship Council and the Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification. This change will create a new deemed-to-comply arrangement for products that are certified under FSC or PEFC. Any products imported that have either of those figures will automatically be deemed to be okay to be imported and not linked to illegal logging activities, and, in doing so, will remove the due diligence requirement which is in place in order to make sure that there is a robust examination of the supply chains for imported timber products.


As Greens, we don't support this is a good change because it is not justified when compared to its impact on the global and domestic timber trade. In taking this position, the Greens recognise the important role that certification schemes play in the timber and wood products markets and that as the most robust and credible certification, FSC certification in particular is a really important scheme that signals to importers and consumers that the product they are buying comes from well-managed sources.


Globally, FSC sets the bar very high for ecologically and socially responsible forest management. It is worth noting for reference that there is no logging of native forests on public land in Australia that meets the FSC certification standards. FSC recognises that logging that is putting birds and animals, like Leadbeater's possums and swift parrots in Australia, at risk of extinction because it doesn't meet their standards. I am going to talk more about this when we come to general business later this afternoon.


PEFC, on the other hand, is an industry-led certification scheme that's got much weaker standards, and it's been criticised for being a tick-box exercise that excludes social and environmental experts from its processes. There are a lot of complexities when it comes to talking about forest certification standards, but primarily I do want to make this distinction between FSC and PEFC. I also want to note that both standards, to different degrees, have come under scrutiny over time. For this reason, we need to maintain a safety net of a due diligence process for any importers sourcing timber products certified under these schemes.


The government gives two justifications for weakening the regulations. The first is the cost imposition on Australian timber importers. The second is that being certified under either FSC or PEFC effectively means all of the due diligence has already been done, so requiring extra work to be done is just doubling up. I'll deal with each of these justifications separately; firstly, the cost imposition on Australian timber importers. The government claims that this change would save the industry $4.2 million annually, but that is a tiny proportion of the overall value of the industry. The government's own regulatory impact statement tells us that we have an $8 billion timber import industry in Australia and, as I've already noted, a risk of up to nine per cent of the timber imported being illegally logged. Yet the government's own regulatory impact statement notes that keeping the status quo of continuing to require due diligence had an average compliance cost per importer of around $1,500 a year, and that it took about 23 hours each year to undertake that due diligence for each importer. So, to meet the current due diligence requirements, we're talking about a cost, as a percentage of the total value of regulated imports, of 0.0037 per cent, based on 2015 import values. And the regulatory impact statement tells us that these figures are potentially overstating the costs. The impact statement says:


… these estimates may overstate the overall cost of compliance for importers. In practice, a sizable number of product lines, once their initial due diligence process has been completed and they have been determined to be low risk, are likely to require only minimal intervention by an importer.


This is the government's own regulatory impact statement. So, in the context of this industry, we cannot see that this very, very small cost burden, when spread across all the businesses in the industry, is significant enough to warrant the risks of removing a safety net that guards against illegal products entering our market.


The government's second justification is essentially that the due diligence has been done with FSC- and PEFC-certified wood products, so it's just doubling up. Firstly, it's worth noting that this would be a novel approach from Australia in a global environment where other countries are facing the same issues. It was highlighted in several submissions to the regulatory impact statement process that neither the European Union nor the United States formally recognises third-party certification systems as a means of ensuring timber legality, although notably both do allow them to be used as part of a system of due diligence or due care. So, if we loosen our requirements in comparison to those markets, we're going to risk becoming a dumping ground for illegally logged timbers.


The reason that the US and the EU don't accept these certification schemes is that these certification schemes are not fail-safe. There have been two recently publicised examples of the failure of these schemes. One was illegal logging in Romania. Despite the products being sourced by an Austrian company with FSC chain-of-custody certificates, FSC took a long time to revoke the certificates and rectify the situation, despite being presented with the evidence of illegal logging. There is also a current example in Peru, where one of Peru's largest exporters was blocked from US exports under their prohibition despite having two valid FSC certificates. A month later, the US government banned all imports from this company because they found massive amounts of illegal timber in their shipment. So if we had changed our regulations now, that company would be free to send all of that timber to Australia instead under the new deemed-to-comply provision. That's two examples of where the FSC certification has failed.


The FSC is extremely robust compared to the PEFC. Many PEFC schemes have much lower standards and hardly any independent controls. I certainly don't think that, overall, PEFC certification is worth the paper that the certificates are printed on. The Australian version of PEFC is the Australian Forestry Standard, which certifies as legal and attempts to greenwash clear-fell logging in Australia, which has been challenged time and time again in the courts and been found to not be legal. You only need to look at the court successes of Environment East Gippsland over illegal rainforest logging and logging which is destroying the habitats of threatened species and the lack of proper surveys in previously unlogged forests—such as in the Kuark forests of East Gippsland—to see that PEFC certification, even based on the Australian version of it here, cannot reliably be used for due diligence.


The other thing to bear in mind with certification and whether it's good enough for due diligence is that where you've got strong certification, such as FSC certification, it actually makes the required due diligence much easier. Where there is a robust certification scheme with robust chains of custody, then it is actually easy to check the certificates. It will streamline and considerably reduce the cost of undertaking due diligence. If a company is importing FSC-certified timber, the cost of that due diligence, I'm sure, will be far, far less than what was estimated in the regulation impact statement.


As such, I expect that maintaining due diligence, even on certified products, will in fact encourage the use and the import of FSC-certified timber as opposed to PEFC-certified timber and, indeed, uncertified timber. That is a good thing. If supporting and reinforcing the Forest Stewardship Council brand then flows on to increasing the use of Australian FSC-certified timber, which is almost all sustainable plantation-sourced timber in Australia, then that will be an absolutely welcome bonus of maintaining these regulations as they stand.


I want to conclude by emphasising that our role in these global supply chains is crucial. Illegal logging is a global problem, and Australia must do its bit to uphold a robust framework to address it. The Greens cannot see any good reason to allow these regulation changes to be implemented. For this reason, we have co-sponsored this disallowance motion, and we are seeking the Senate's support for the maintenance of a sensible and robust approach to keep illegally logged timber out of the Australian market.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (15:58):  Before I make some comments about why the government believes that the regulation amendments that we are seeking to put before this place are sensible and balanced, can I just make a few comments about some of the comments that have been made about this disallowance motion by those who have spoken before me. It comes as no great surprise that it is of great concern to me that Senator Rice would actually suggest that the federal government's position of having a desire to reduce red tape for Australian businesses is somehow a bad thing. I would have thought it was eminently sensible for us to be constantly looking at ways and means by which we can reduce the financial and cost burden on Australian businesses if there is demonstrated fact that the cost of the regulation far outweighs the benefits of anything that it's trying to achieve.


It's also interesting that Senator Rice makes many comments about the Greens not being satisfied—that she's not satisfied. I absolutely assure this chamber that the very extensive review that assessed the need for and impact of the regulations that were brought in in conjunction with the illegal logging legislation that was brought in by this government at the start of our term was undertaken by a number of independent assessors. It was a very robust process. It sought to speak to people across the entire supply chain: importers, domestic operators and unions. So to suggest that somehow what the Greens say or what Senator Rice thinks is a more robust way to assess the efficacy of a particular regulation—I'm sorry, I'm going to have to say that I would rather take the word of and outcomes that have been delivered to us by an independent, transparent, robust and scientifically based process than what she may think.


I'd also draw to the attention of this place to the fact that it is incumbent on every government, no matter of what persuasion, and everybody in this place to understand that nothing is ever going to be perfect. What we're entrusted to do is make sure that we strike a balance so that we are not, as in the old saying, smashing a walnut with a sledgehammer. If, as legislators, we believe that the burden of the regulation far outweighs any benefit that the regulation puts into place, then it's incumbent on us to assess that and make a decision that you cannot possibly regulate the Australian economy out of existence just because you want to deliver an absolutely perfect environment, where absolutely nothing ever has any risk. You cannot triage by legislation all risk out of existence in Australia.


First of all, I congratulate the Australian forestry industry for their response to the introduction of illegal-logging regulations. They have worked extremely hard to make sure they've got their businesses and their importing businesses up to speed so that they can address the very serious issue of illegally logged timber, seeing that Australia is doing everything that's reasonably possible to make sure that we're not a country where illegally logged timber is imported.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:16):  I rise today to speak to the bill which I introduced into this place, the Regional Forest Agreements Legislation (Repeal) Bill 2017. This bill seeks to end the destruction of Australia's native forests by repealing the act which enables logging to continue with exemptions from, and without the oversight of, our country's environmental protection laws. These logging laws, the regional forest agreements, are outdated, they are destructive and they are not achieving the environmental or economic purposes for which they were intended. 


For me, this is a question of justice across generations. I challenge all of us in this place to consider how we would feel if we couldn't offer our children and our grandchildren the same experiences in the natural world that we have experienced. What if they couldn't enjoy camping by a crystal-clear river, fringed by magnificent forest, camping at night around a campfire, listening to the sounds of the night, listening to the owls—the boobooks, the mopokes—listening to the screeching of gliding possums?


What if our children and grandchildren couldn't marvel at birds like swift parrots and be amazed by creatures like the giant freshwater lobster of north-west Tasmania? What if our children and grandchildren couldn't be inspired by gorgeous creatures like the Leadbeater's possum? What if our children and grandchildren don't have those experiences? What if they don't know those animals as precious animals and birds, because their homes, nesting sites and food supplies have been destroyed? Beyond experiencing magnificent forests, what if they couldn't ski on our alpine slopes deprived of snow? What if they couldn't snorkel a reef filled with colourful coral off the Queensland coast? 


Logging has wide-reaching impacts, contributing to the further warming of our planet. It's not just the immediate destruction of areas of forest—and destruction it is; intensive, industrial-scale clear-fell logging—and it's not just the destruction that that wreaks on our forests but the impact of those forests no longer being there to soak up carbon, no longer playing their bit in the critical role of tackling dangerous climate change that is the issue.


I remember very well the first time I saw a clear felled forest. I was 23 years old. I had just finished university and was working out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I visited some forests in East Gippsland which had been clear felled and then had been burnt. They were totally destroyed. For me, it was this awareness: why was this happening? So I did a bit more research and discovered the justification for it was to be producing timber that was largely, even then, only going to very low value purposes. It was being used for housing construction timber for which even then, 30 years ago, we had plantation pine that was going to take up that market. It was being used for tomato stakes; it was being used for pallets. I asked myself: why are we are causing all of this destruction for such little ends? As a rational person, I said: 'But we need timber. We need wood. Surely we must need to be doing this?' I did a bit more research and found out that, no, we didn't. I found out that virtually all of the wood that was coming from this incredible natural heritage, this precious natural heritage that we have here in Australia, we could be getting from other, much less precious places—certainly not the old growth forest that was being logged then and that is still being logged now.


I did the research then, and the research continued for the last 30 years to show that the forest destruction that's occurring isn't occurring because we need the timber. It's not occurring because we need the jobs. It's occurring just because we this attitude: 'Well, we've got forests there, so we've got to do something with them.' We are increasingly getting a much greater proportion of our timber and wood product supplies from sustainable plantations. That's the direction of the industry for the future. And yet with the regional forest agreements that this government is rolling over, we are pretending we are right back where we were last century, not acknowledging that we can be protecting our forests and maintaining a viable wood products industry.


Let me lay out what this bill seeks to achieve, with the principle in mind that our precious places should be properly managed for all of the values they hold, including their value to our future generations. For the past two decades our native forests have been managed under the banner of these 10 regional forest agreements that were established between the federal government and the states. These agreements cover significant tracts, all of potentially economic, so-called productive, forests in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and New South Wales. This bill would wind up each of the 10 regional forest agreements at the time of their expiry dates. I note the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement has been subject to a variation which was signed last year by the Prime Minister and the Tasmanian Premier, and this was presented to the public as a variation. But the actual outcome is a substantial rewriting of the RFA, which was undertaken without any engagement of this parliament, despite the significance of the extension of this RFA to 2037. In effect, it makes future extensions automatic into perpetuity. That is staggering.


When the RFAs were introduced 20 years ago, they were meant to provide long-term sustainable forest management to protect these complex ecosystems and to ensure the viability of threatened species living in the forests as well as govern production of timber from these forests and maintain jobs. They have failed in every regard. And the government have indicated that, like they've done with the Tasmanian agreement, they intend to just roll over the existing 20-year regional forest agreements when they come up for expiry. The lack of rigour and reflection in this position is astounding, and it demonstrates that the government do not have any commitment to safeguarding our carbon stores, our clean water, our water supplies, our tourism hot spots or our wildlife habitat or the current and future jobs of locals who rely on all of these.


Across Australia, the evidence of the last 20 years is that the Regional Forest Agreements have failed and continue to fail in their goals of providing security to industry and workers and securing a reserve system to protect species. When then Prime Minister John Howard and the Victorian Premier signed the Victorian Central Highlands Regional Forest Agreement in 1998, the Howard government environment minister stated that the RFA would ensure that 'the whole forest will be sustainably managed for future generations'. And yet under the Regional Forest Agreements these forests are logged, pulped and burnt. The story is exactly the same across the other nine areas subject to RFAs. Yes, under the Regional Forest Agreements there were some areas of forest that were reserved, but there were vast areas of forests of equal value and of equal significance that have not been protected and have been subject to ongoing, intensive logging in the 20 years since.


The Regional Forest Agreements are outdated, impotent and costing us irrecoverable species, taxpayer dollars and extensive forgone opportunities. We need to scrap them. As I've already said, over 80 per cent of the wood products that are being produced in Australia are now being produced from plantations. The remaining native forest timber industry is just the rump of the timber industry. It's not the direction that the industry is headed in. It's not where all of the excitement of, say, having timber for multistorey buildings is coming from; that's timber coming from plantations. When you look at the latest announcement of a new sawmill, Hermal mill, in north-west Tasmania, that is going to be a hardwood plantation based sawmill. This is the direction that we need to be continuing in, transitioning all of the industry out of our native forest so we can have that sustainable plantation based industry, protecting our precious native forests for so many values that they also hold.


One of the most appalling parts of the Regional Forest Agreements and of our current logging laws is that they exempt logging from our national environment protection laws. When an area is logged under an RFA it's deemed to be occurring in an ecologically sustainable way even where there is ample evidence this is not the case. There are no grounds for our environment protection laws in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to apply. Think of that. These complex native forest ecosystems are not protected through our national environment protection laws from the destruction of logging. This means that even if a critically endangered species is found in a forest valley or ridge, under an RFA it's still okay to go ahead with the logging. All that needs to happen with regard to any endangered species is that there needs to be a recovery plan in place—or not even in place, but being planned. It doesn't matter whether this recovery plan, at the end of the day, is shown to have been totally inadequate to protect the species. All that's required is to get a recovery plan in place, and then logging can continue to occur under the rules that are set out in the recovery plan. In fact, they're not even rules but only guidelines for how logging could occur. So there is no rigour and no ability for the EPBC Act to overrule the logging operations occurring under an RFA even where the evidence is there. As it is, you have threatened species that are being driven towards extinction by those logging operations. How can it be possible that native forests get such special treatment? Other extractive industries such as mining are required to justify their impact on the environment, but not the native forest industry. They get to carve out sections of precious forests to destroy them. They're given carte blanche to destroy animals, plants and vital habitat.


Let me remind the chamber that the Commonwealth has a duty to protect our environment for all Australians. Yet, in continuing the regional forest agreements and their exemption from the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, this government is shirking that responsibility and is allowing an extractive industry—because that's what it is—to carry out its business with no regard for the long-term damage this does to our forests. For all the talk of 'Oh, the forest will regrow,' when you are logging a forest that has got trees in it that are hundreds of years old, such as with the logging that is currently occurring in East Gippsland and in Tasmania, you cannot say that you are replacing this forest, because you cannot replace an old-growth, unlogged forest—a complex, ancient forest—with essentially just a plantation of young species. It will not provide the habitat for those plants and animals for hundreds and hundreds of years, and certainly won't provide the nesting hollows in those trees for the species that rely on them and need hollows in old trees in order to survive. It is an extractive industry. It is destroying that forest's value for those precious and threatened animals.


As a nation we have the worst rate of mammal extinctions in the world over the last 200 years since colonisation. We have forest-dependent species that are headed to add to those extinctions: the critically endangered Leadbeater's possum, the critically endangered swift parrots, the giant freshwater crayfish and Carnaby's cockatoo. These animals are threatened and are becoming more threatened, and yet logging is allowed to continue to occur in places where they live. It's a shameful position to be in, particularly as a wealthy, developed nation, particularly as a nation with so many unique species that are found nowhere else in the world and particularly as a nation that has only seen just over 200 years of this atrocious use of our land—just over 200 years.


In the forests such as at Granite Mountain in East Gippsland, with trees hundreds of years old, those trees were old when Captain Cook sailed past just over 200 years ago. These extinctions are not a trend we want to continue, particularly with our unique plants and animals serving as a backbone for our incredibly valuable tourism industry and the many communities whose livelihoods rely on the protection of these precious places. The sheer enormity of past extinction rates and the tiny amount of pristine native habitats remaining in Australia means we need to fight to conserve every remaining piece.


I have already mentioned the Leadbeater's possum in my home state of Victoria,. It's critically endangered. Its primary habitat, the beautiful mountain ash forests, are in such dire condition that the animals and the whole ecosystem are listed as critically endangered. We have a government that is saying, 'Oh, the Leadbeater's possum is having a massive population increase,' which is based on absolutely farcical data. If you look at the most thorough review of the science with Leadbeater's possums, you see that it shows that they are in dire straits. Yes, we may have observed more Leadbeater's possums over the past year, but that is because there have been more people out looking for them. It does not mean that those populations have increased.


The forests of the planned Great Koala National Park in New South Wales, the Great Forest National Park in Victoria, the Tarkine in Tasmania, Western Australia's South-West Forest and the incredibly biodiverse and beautiful East Gippsland are hugely valuable parts of our natural heritage and must remain so for future generations.


A recent assessment of Victoria's Central Highlands forest using ecosystem accounting methodology and which was published in the prestigious journal Nature Ecology and Evolution clearly demonstrated that there are considerably greater benefits in soaking up and storing carbon, water, habitat provision and recreational amenity if logging ceased compared with the economic value of logging these forests. And this work also clearly shows that the economic benefits of native forest logging are small compared to other industries in the region and that the economic impact of ceasing native forest logging could be more than offset by increases in other industries such as tourism and by entering the carbon market. Native forest areas have got enormous tourism potential, which is undermined by destructive and unsightly logging practices. The people and small businesses of regional Australia would stand to benefit hugely from increasing the amount of forest being protected and stronger government plans promoting tourism and recreation over logging.


Jobs are vital in the regional communities living near and in our forest areas, and we need to face up to the reality that direct employment in the forestry industry is already drying up. It has been drying up for the last 20 years, due to its economic and environmental unsustainability. Many mills are just scraping through on direct and indirect taxpayer subsidies. We've had the Victorian government paying $50 million to buy the Heyfield mill. We know that logging in East Gippsland costs us, the taxpayers, $5 million a year. So it costs us for the logging of our forests. Just think about what else that money could be spent on. Think about: what if you spent $5 million a year, or more than that, on improving the tourism infrastructure, the recreation infrastructure—upgrading walking tracks, forest drives and bicycle touring tracks? There are many, many more jobs in really valuing the forests as a tourism resource than in their ongoing logging.


Industrial logging in our public native forests has had its day. It has failed to protect our environment and it has failed to protect jobs. The future for the Australian wood-products industry is in a sustainably-managed plantation industry. So, in order to achieve this vision for long-term sustainability for the Australian wood-products industry, and to protect our native forests, with all their unparalleled values, we must scrap the Regional Forest Agreements. This bill to repeal the RFAs does what the government has failed to do. This bill would protect our forests in a way that all Australians, now and into the future, would value and really appreciate, well into the future.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Forest Agreements Legislation (Repeal) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,27,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-02-08,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (16:36):  I'm sure it will be no surprise to those who are in the chamber or listening to this contribution to know that the Australian government will not be supporting Senator Rice's, on behalf of the Greens, Regional Forest Agreements Legislation (Repeal) Bill 2017. The coalition government does not subscribe to the theory that we just lock up our forests and throw the key away and wait for a fire to come through and burn them down. We don't subscribe to the theory that you do nothing in your forests and wait for the feral animals to come in and eat our endangered species. We subscribe to the theory that you can actually manage all of our forestry estates in such a way as to strike a balance between making sure you keep a certain amount of it in a pristine state—we are absolutely committed to that—and having a place in the Australian landscape for a forestry sector, and that that forestry sector also includes an amount of native regrowth harvest. And we believe that's sustainable into the future.


Just to give a shout-out for our friends the trees, I'd like to put on the record that trees are renewable and they are recyclable. We believe that we will manage them in a sustainable way. They are carbon-positive and they are a resource that belongs to all Australians. If you were going to go out and invent the absolutely perfect product—as the big man who invented trees in the first place did—you would invent a tree.


I'm sure that trees were put on this earth in the very first instance because they were able to be cut down, because they would grow again and because they would provide a resource for myriad different things—not just for possums and for people to go and look at for a tourism adventure, which, Senator Rice would have you believe, is the only purpose for a tree to be in existence. There is actually a place on earth for trees to be cut down and used for myriad different purposes, because they will grow again. Also the suggestion, for some reason, that forestry and ensuring a sustainable environment and sustainability of our native animals are somehow mutually exclusive is just ridiculous. They can coexist side by side.


It is also extraordinary hypocrisy to suggest that we can't use native timber. So much of our magnificent appearance-grade timber that we, as Australians, are absolutely delighted to have as part of our lives—the beautiful furniture; the beautiful floorboards; the things that you can't actually get from plantation timber—we value. But I would also say that I believe Australians value sustainability in the harvesting of our forests, just as we believe in sustainability in everything we do, whether it be our marine environment, our beautiful Murray-Darling Basin or the sustainability of how we manage our agricultural sector in Australia. To suggest that somehow we can completely replace this beautiful appearance-grade timber, which many, many people in Australia are able to enjoy every day, by using plantation timbers is just a stretch too far. They aren't the same thing.


Senator Rice, on behalf of the Greens, says that she believes the RFAs have failed, that they haven't protected endangered species. I would say that I absolutely dispute that. I believe the RFAs have stood us in good stead and I also believe that they have acted, and assisted us, in the protection of our endangered species. But that's not to say that, as part of an iterative process of the rollover and renewal of these RFAs, we can't make them fit for purpose for 2018 and into the 21st century. As Senator Rice rightly points out, these agreements were first brought into place 20 years ago. We've learnt a lot in the last 20 years, so what we are seeking to do, as part of an iterative process of the rollover of these RFAs, is to make sure that the lessons of the last 20 years have been learned. At the same time, we want to enable a sustainable forestry industry to go forward in a practical, sensible and realistic way without destroying the livelihoods of many communities that rely on the timber industry or taking away the delight that many Australians have in the beautiful appearance-grade Australian timber they have in their homes and their lives.


It seems somewhat ironic that we were talking just a minute ago in relation to illegal logging. We know that in Australia we have such strict regulations and rules that demand Australian timber is harvested in a very sustainable way. So we're making it as difficult as we possibly can to import timber into Australia, while at the same time we're going to stop the Australian timber industry from being able to progress—it does seem a little hypocritical. There does seem to be an overall theme going on with the Greens when it comes to Australian agriculture—that is, they actually don't want us to have any.


The coalition government believes that Australian forestry industries are absolutely vital to this country and they are an absolutely integral part of our regional communities. The forest industry directly employs over 67,000 people Australia-wide and it contributes nearly $24 billion to the Australian economy. This is no lightweight industry. And the benefits of this competitive, sustainable, renewable forestry industry in our regional communities cannot be underestimated. For this reason, the Turnbull government believes that it's absolutely important that we put the right tools in place to ensure the sustainable management of these forests but at the same time make sure that we don't place an unreasonable burden on them—this balance in making sure that our regulation and our legislative burden is commensurate with what we are trying to achieve. We are not a government that smashes walnuts with sledgehammers; we are a government that makes sure the tools we put in place are appropriate for the job we're trying to do. So we believe that the RFAs are undoubtedly the best mechanism by which we can manage our native forests in a sustainable way, and we believe this is an effective framework for achieving the balance between the economic outcomes that we want for our regional communities, the environmental outcomes that we all seek for sustainability—because we all love our beautiful environment—and making sure that we deliver a socially appropriate outcome for all Australians, in particular the Australian communities that rely on our forestry sector.


We have 10 RFAs in Australia. They were signed progressively between 1997 and 2001. Over $1 million was invested in ensuring that our native forestry management was balanced across the environment and making sure that the environmental, social and economic outcomes were achieved. To quote you, Senator Rice, in your explanatory memorandum:


The intention of the RFAs was to provide long-term forest management to protect these complex ecosystems.


Well, Senator Rice, I believe that's exactly what has happened here. More than 3.3 million hectares of native forests have been transferred back into Australia's reserve estate over the time the RFAs have been in practice. That is an increase in the reserve estate of 46 per cent in the last 20 years. If you look at a state-by-state breakdown: the area in New South Wales increased by 1.334 million hectares; in Victoria, nearly a million hectares; in Tasmania, 684,000 hectares; in Western Australia, 338,000 hectares. That is 3,320,000 hectares, or a 46 per cent increase in our forest estate that is under reserve. That is a fantastic outcome for the environment, but have I ever heard you, Senator Rice, come in here and talk about the positive result of the increase in the amount of the forest reserve as a result of the actions that have been generated by the RFAs? Not a word. I assure you that the reason you do not do that is that it does not suit your argument—your argument of scaremongering.


In the first 20 years of operation, the RFAs have delivered long-term certainty to regional communities and the forest resource and the timber industry. They have improved the regulatory processes for businesses that operate in this industry. They have increased the identification and protection of old-growth forest values and the protection of 100 per cent of old-growth forests that are rare or depleted, and there have been significant advances in our approach to ecological, sustainable forest management.


With RFAs, we have a timber industry that operates with some of the highest levels of biodiversity protection in the world. The EPBC Act continues to provide a level of assistance in ensuring that we have world's best practice and we can put our hand on our heart and say that we are appropriately managing our forest system. Logging activities in Australia's native forests are not exempt from environmental protection laws—although you would believe they were if you listened to some of the things that come from the other end of the chamber. The act recognises that, in each RFA region, a comprehensive regional assessment was undertaken to address the environmental, economic and social objectives of the EPBC Act. So the establishment of RFAs actually constitutes a form of assessment and approval under the EPBC Act.



Senator Rice interjecting—




Senator RUSTON:
  It absolutely is a recognition that the RFAs have established comprehensive reserve networks. This is another feature of the RFAs that you wilfully continue to ignore, another inconvenient truth for the Greens.


Another inconvenient truth for the Greens is in relation to threatened species. We do have a series of obligations and requirements that are set forth in the state based legislation that we have to adhere to. The RFAs do not exempt forest operators from obligations in state based legislation for the protection of threatened species and communities. This includes the application of forest management strategies to protect rare and endangered species. The management of threatened species within the RFA regions is consistent with the objectives of the EPBC Act. According to the Australia's state of the forests report 2013, the most significant threats to forest-dwelling animal species listed as threatened under the EPBC Act are historical land use changes and forest loss caused by clearing, predation from introduced predators, illegal collection and genetic or breeding issues. It doesn't say anything in there about forestry.


Just last year in a Senate estimates hearing the Threatened Species Commissioner stated that no Australian mammal has become extinct due to forestry operations. That's another inconvenient truth for you, isn't it, Senator Rice? I know that you love the Leadbeater's possum, and I have to say I don't know any Australian who wouldn't love the Leadbeater's possum if they saw that cute little thing. But, despite the continued dire warnings by those who are paid to research these things, in fact it would appear that the Leadbeater's possum is a rather adaptable little critter, and it seems that, the more we look for them, the more we find. We are able to come in here and say that the recovery plan that's been put in place for the Leadbeater's possum is working, and we're really pleased that it is working. There's nothing that gives me more pleasure than when I get a report sent to me saying that we've had another sighting of a Leadbeater's possum in any of our forests. Everyone rejoices in the fact that this little critter is being seen in greater and greater numbers. Contrary to the doom and gloom that you hear from the other end of the chamber, this is a positive story and one from which we can learn. We should all be looking at what's happening when we're seeing increased populations of any of these species and looking at what we're doing right. We should be working together so that we can make sure that we continue to be able to get positive outcomes for all of our species. Sitting at the other end of the chamber and complaining and whingeing and twisting the thing is not going to save one more possum.




Senator Rice:
  Listen to the science! Read the science!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Order on my left!




Senator RUSTON:
  I do read the science, Senator Rice. The problem we have here in Australia is that we have an industry of scientists who have made a fortune trying to come up with inconveniently ill-informed and unfactually based misinformation because it suits their purposes. It's about time somebody started calling out some members of our environmental scientific community for the rubbish that they put out in the marketplace, believing that the word 'professor' or 'doctor' before their name somehow gives them some sort of legitimacy to say things. But that is another story, and I won't waste the chamber's time with it now. 


When you look at this, this is a really good story about the success of adaptive management work. For instance, when it comes to the swift parrot, researchers have shown that it actually isn't forestry that is causing the threat to the swift parrot; it's predation from sugar gliders. We need to make sure when we come in here and make these statements that we use the facts behind the reasons for these things happening—for it to be the truth. It is just convenient for you to say it's forestry. It's not forestry that is causing these problems; it's myriad other things that are much more difficult to deal with. So, once again, the inconvenient truth of the situation seems to be lost—or not provided—by those at the other end of the chamber. 


It is the belief of the government that the creation of RFAs has made considerable advances in the identification and protection of old-growth forests. We believe that they are working extremely well in setting specific protection targets for particular ecosystems. We believe this is a great result for the Australian forestry sector, the environment and the people who depend on it. 


We also believe that the timber industry is a hugely important source of wood products in Australia, and Australian native forest remains a primary source for durable, high-strength, appearance-grade timber. This is not the kind of stuff you can get from growing a pine tree. It includes solid wood flooring, panelling, furniture and fine crafts. Some magnificent products are coming out of Tasmania; you have only got to go down to the Launceston wood products display centre to see the magnificent artworks that are being achieved by using this magnificent timber in a sustainable way. Australia's plantations are not able to replace the type and quality of wood that comes from using native timbers. This is, once again, something you refuse to accept. To stand in here and say, 'We'll move to plantations and we won't use native timber anymore,' is absolutely ridiculous. You know it is, but it's not convenient for your argument. 


You also ignore the fact that our downstream forest industries are fully integrated; they use every single piece of wood from both plantations and native forests. Wood from our native forests complements that sourced from our plantation industry. I know you want to get rid of the RFAs, claiming they are preventing Australia from moving out of forest logging, but why would we want to move out of forest logging when we've already demonstrated it's renewable, recyclable and carbon positive, and we are managing it in a sustainable way? Why would we want to wilfully cripple our forest industries? I don't understand it; maybe you can explain it to me. Why would we want to destroy jobs in regional communities? Why would we want to shut regional communities down? Why would we want to decimate regional communities? You only have to look at the disallowance motion that Sarah Hanson-Young moved in here in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin plan to see that you don't care about our regional communities. You only care about your own ideology. There is not a care in the world for the fact that people like me live in regional communities, and those communities would be shut down by the actions of the legislation and regulations that you constantly come in here and try to have passed. 


The Tasmanian RFA is a fantastic example of what 20 years of learning has done for us. We were delighted to sign the new RFA recently. There was an 80 per cent increase, or 800,000 hectares, in the reserve estate. Fifty-eight per cent, or 1.778 million hectares, of Tasmania's forest is now protected in reserves, including the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. More than a million hectares of old-growth forest are now permanently reserved, and world-benchmark, ecologically sustainable forest management has been implemented. At the same time, significant business savings have been enabled for industry. These are significant achievements, and we were delighted in 2017 to sign an extension for a further 20 years rolling.


In conclusion, we believe the management of Australia's native forests is being undertaken sustainably. What's more, far from an industry in decline, we believe our forestry industry is a sunrise industry. The RFAs set the framework for that sustainable management and the conservation of our native forests. So what's at stake? If the RFAs were repealed, jobs would be lost and communities would be destroyed, and for what environmental gain? Do we really want to put Australian Paper's Maryvale Mill out of work—is that really what you Greens want to do? Do you really want to make sure all those people who work in the Gippsland no longer have a job? I don't think it's what the Australian public wants, and it's time we called you out for the scaremongering and, often in cases, the lies that are put out into the marketplace to try and make people think that Australia's native timber industry is not a sustainable industry—it is. You have absolutely no regard for the tens of thousands of families whose livelihoods you actively seek to destroy or the hundreds of regional communities that would cease to exist if you had your own way. This is deliberate ignorance, and it is absolutely reprehensible.


The coalition government does not support the repeal of the RFA Act. The repeal will not help the environment. It will not help business. It will not create jobs. It will not help our regional communities. This coalition government stands for every single one of those things. We believe the environment must be sustainable, and our actions, legislation and regulations support that. We believe that we should be helping business, and our legislation and regulations support that. We believe in creating jobs. We created 400,000 of them last year and we are committed to making sure it's another 400,000 this year—over a thousand jobs a day. We will not destroy our regional communities with ridiculous Green ideology with absolutely no basis. It is absolutely our longstanding position that the RFAs are the best mechanism to balance the economic, social and— (Time expired)

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (16:57):  I often remember the times before I came to parliament. My encounters with the Senate and the House of Representatives, before I got the key to my office when I became the member for Robertson in 2010, were through the radio soundwaves across this country, particularly Radio National. You'd hear all sorts of conversations and your life, as you're driving your kids from one activity to another, would be informed by the conversations we are having here. This conversation is about a very important industry—the forestry industry. It is also a very important conversation about how we manage our environment and that precious resource that we have: the trees that Australians enjoy throughout the country.


Why is this such an important discussion that we're having this afternoon in the Senate? The forestry industry provides not only jobs for 67,000 people, but also a range of absolutely essential products that integrate themselves into people's lives. We know Australia generates a very significant export outcome from our produce in this sector, from sales to international markets. But the sorts of products that this reaches out to extend to sawn wood and wood based panels for constructing our homes. That's often what people in the cities think of wood: it's simply the timber that comes in the frames they see of the houses that spring up on the edges of our cities.


But this debate touches on so many more uses for sustainable forestry industry in our country, including furniture, printing and writing paper for our homes and our offices, sanitary paper products for everyday use, and paper and paperboard for packaging many of the products we consume. We even have wood derived products such as cellophane, rayon and ethanol involved in this industry. If I can, I want to make some remarks about the capacity for innovation in the way that we might be able to use this amazing renewable resource to create new types of technologies and new applications that will improve lives not just here in our country but around the world.


We know that carbon fibres that are derived from wood are used to make lightweight parts for things as diverse as motor vehicles and packaging for food and beverages—another wood product that comes into our lives. Solvents made from wood fibre are used instead of petroleum, and that's got to be a good thing. Wood also has the potential to generate renewable energy through the combustion of wood pellets, liquid biofuels and any other adaptation modern technology can make of this very precious resource. As esoteric as a discussion about the Regional Forest Agreements Legislation (Repeal) Bill 2017 might sound, its intersection with the lives of Australians goes right into the cabinets in our bathrooms and the cupboards in our kitchens.


The current private member's bill that's before the Senate, on this occasion put forward by Senator Rice, seeks to repeal the Regional Forest Agreements Act 2002. The agreements are known as RFAs. I know that Senator Ruston has made some significant comments about this and celebrated the recent signing of another agreement in 2017 to provide some stability to the sector. But this bill is trying to do something entirely different. The bill itself, in its explanatory memorandum, acknowledges that for the past two decades, our native forests have been managed under the banner of 10 regional forest agreements that were established—and, I'm sure, not easily at the time—between the federal government and the states.


I am one of the Australians who's been very lucky to have travelled through every single state of the country. In fact, my husband and I took a year off, before we were grey—we were certainly nomadic—and spent it travelling around Australia. The great forests of Australia that we saw were covered by these 10 agreements in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and New South Wales. As a New South Wales senator I am all too aware of how critical the management of the forests of our native timbers, and also our plantation timbers, is to regional economies right across this state.


I note and agree with the statistics that were put forward by Senator Ruston, that in the course of the previous RFA there was a 46 per cent increase in the forest estate under reserve. This is an important measure of the success of what the RFA achieved. To have 46 per cent more forest in reserve is a great outcome that I think Australians would be proud of. Being a legislator for the period of time that I've been here, I'm aware of the many failures of legislation, but surely that has to be applauded as a great outcome.


As a senator for New South Wales, it is with great pride that I stand here on the back of work that's been done by previous governments and celebrate as a New South Welshwoman that there are 1.334 million hectares of New South Wales land under reserve in forest estate. That's a great outcome. We need to be mindful that, despite its imperfections, the Regional Forest Agreements Act 2002 is not an entirely failed piece of legislation, and it should only be an entirely failed piece of legislation that should be repealed. That is not the case with this piece of legislation.


The intention of these RFAs, which were established between the federal government and the governments of Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and New South Wales, was to provide long-term forest management to protect these very complex ecosystems, to ensure the viability of threatened species in the forests and to govern the production of timber from these forests. They also have that very worthy aim of maintaining jobs to maintain the economy and the viability of communities across the country, especially those in regional areas where these forests exist.


The bill that's before us from the Greens party claims that the RFAs have failed to meet the intended goals. Well, much legislation, sadly, doesn't always meet its goals, but I don't think we should be discarding this piece of legislation. The Greens' EM argues that the environmental and industrial context of the RFAs has substantially changed since they were commenced in the late 20th century. A lot's changed since that time, but I don't believe that in this case that provides sufficient argument for the repealing of this forest management framework.


The fact is RFAs have had exemptions from the EPBC Act, and this bill would see the application of the EPBC Act to forestry operations and ensure the same level of environmental approvals and protections are applied to any other extractive industry. But, to be clear, I want to put it on the record that Labor will not be supporting this bill, and we believe that the Greens position with regard to the RFA doesn't make sense in the context of the current situation of this particular industry. The RFAs, in addition to delivering that 46 per cent increase in reserves in estate, are in fact the important current and legal framework that we use to manage our forests. To repeal such a framework without another framework adequately formed, considered and in place to replace it would in my view be an irresponsible act. In common parlance, it would be akin to throwing the baby out with the bathwater.


These regional forest agreements, which are 20-year plans for sustainable management and conservation of Australian forests, across the four states cover large native forestry regions. Five of those forestry regions are in Victoria. Three are native forestry regions in New South Wales, and there is one in each of Western Australia and Tasmania. In a sensitive way, the RFAs seek to—and in many, many instances have delivered—a balance between the competing industries of the economy, the society and the environment.


Balancing economic, social and environmental demands on forests by settling obligations and commitments for forest management delivers great outcomes. One of the things that the RFAs have delivered, and need to continue to deliver, is certainty of resource access and supply to industry, building investment confidence, which matters to all of us everywhere, including in the cities, not just where these forests are. The RFAs seek to balance ecologically sustainable forest management issues, ensuring forests are appropriately managed and that they are regenerated to benefit young Australians and those who come after us. 


The RFAs also seek to make sure that we expand the permanent forest conservation estate, and on that measure, given the statistics that there's been a 46 per cent expansion, you'd have to say that the RFA has most certainly achieved the outcome that was set. We know that the RFAs, in their formulation, are informed by scientific study, that they were the product of significant consultation and negotiation and that they cover a diverse range of interests. Labor is prepared to work responsibly with regard to the management of our forests. However, in our view, this bill before the Senate does not take a sensible approach.


I want to restate the love that Australians have for wood. My father loved wood, and the smell of him working with wood in our garage in suburban Sydney is a beautiful olfactory memory for me. As a former teacher, I know that students who didn't necessarily enjoy my English classes absolutely delighted in their capacity to work with their hands and their talents in woodwork classes on the Central Coast. We need to make sure that that passion and love for wood is not just translated into the joy of small enterprise but continues to be a vital and growing part of our economy. To do that we need to find a sustainable and balanced way of going forward to make sure that we create jobs that are innovation-based jobs, backed up by adequate research, and make sure that there are technologies that we can discover through proper investment in innovation policy.


In closing, I simply indicate—and I am citing a very useful document from the Forest Industry Advisory Council—that internationally significant research and technological advancements have resulted in the development of innovative applications for wood fibre and are enabling producers of emerging products to gain scale and improve cost-effectiveness in overseas markets. And let's be clear that timber is a renewable resource that can meet with innovative capacity.


However, while we're not supporting the proposals as they're put before the Senate today by the Greens in their private members' bill, I cannot indicate that I think the government is adequately responding to this sector. In fact, in terms of innovation right across every sector, we've had a lot of noise from this government but very, very little careful and considered investment in a way that is actually delivering jobs growth and economic growth for this country.


So in some ways I guess I've tried to walk the Buddhist path, somewhere down the middle between the Greens and the conservative representatives on the other side of the chamber. The Labor Party is truly the centrist party of this nation, and we have the sensible policy that balances all the things that we need to balance carefully. It balances the things that are at the heart of the regional forest agreements. It balances the need to make sure not only that we have sustainability and look after our economy but also that we look after our community in all its forms, in terms of its needs for resources, and that we look after the people in those communities, so they have jobs with decent wages and decent and fair working conditions, in such a way that this becomes a sustainable and long-term contributor to our local economy and our international participation.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Forest Agreements Legislation (Repeal) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,27,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-02-08,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:16):  I rise today to speak to the bill which I introduced into this place, the Regional Forest Agreements Legislation (Repeal) Bill 2017. This bill seeks to end the destruction of Australia's native forests by repealing the act which enables logging to continue with exemptions from, and without the oversight of, our country's environmental protection laws. These logging laws, the regional forest agreements, are outdated, they are destructive and they are not achieving the environmental or economic purposes for which they were intended. 


For me, this is a question of justice across generations. I challenge all of us in this place to consider how we would feel if we couldn't offer our children and our grandchildren the same experiences in the natural world that we have experienced. What if they couldn't enjoy camping by a crystal-clear river, fringed by magnificent forest, camping at night around a campfire, listening to the sounds of the night, listening to the owls—the boobooks, the mopokes—listening to the screeching of gliding possums?


What if our children and grandchildren couldn't marvel at birds like swift parrots and be amazed by creatures like the giant freshwater lobster of north-west Tasmania? What if our children and grandchildren couldn't be inspired by gorgeous creatures like the Leadbeater's possum? What if our children and grandchildren don't have those experiences? What if they don't know those animals as precious animals and birds, because their homes, nesting sites and food supplies have been destroyed? Beyond experiencing magnificent forests, what if they couldn't ski on our alpine slopes deprived of snow? What if they couldn't snorkel a reef filled with colourful coral off the Queensland coast? 


Logging has wide-reaching impacts, contributing to the further warming of our planet. It's not just the immediate destruction of areas of forest—and destruction it is; intensive, industrial-scale clear-fell logging—and it's not just the destruction that that wreaks on our forests but the impact of those forests no longer being there to soak up carbon, no longer playing their bit in the critical role of tackling dangerous climate change that is the issue.


I remember very well the first time I saw a clear felled forest. I was 23 years old. I had just finished university and was working out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I visited some forests in East Gippsland which had been clear felled and then had been burnt. They were totally destroyed. For me, it was this awareness: why was this happening? So I did a bit more research and discovered the justification for it was to be producing timber that was largely, even then, only going to very low value purposes. It was being used for housing construction timber for which even then, 30 years ago, we had plantation pine that was going to take up that market. It was being used for tomato stakes; it was being used for pallets. I asked myself: why are we are causing all of this destruction for such little ends? As a rational person, I said: 'But we need timber. We need wood. Surely we must need to be doing this?' I did a bit more research and found out that, no, we didn't. I found out that virtually all of the wood that was coming from this incredible natural heritage, this precious natural heritage that we have here in Australia, we could be getting from other, much less precious places—certainly not the old growth forest that was being logged then and that is still being logged now.


I did the research then, and the research continued for the last 30 years to show that the forest destruction that's occurring isn't occurring because we need the timber. It's not occurring because we need the jobs. It's occurring just because we this attitude: 'Well, we've got forests there, so we've got to do something with them.' We are increasingly getting a much greater proportion of our timber and wood product supplies from sustainable plantations. That's the direction of the industry for the future. And yet with the regional forest agreements that this government is rolling over, we are pretending we are right back where we were last century, not acknowledging that we can be protecting our forests and maintaining a viable wood products industry.


Let me lay out what this bill seeks to achieve, with the principle in mind that our precious places should be properly managed for all of the values they hold, including their value to our future generations. For the past two decades our native forests have been managed under the banner of these 10 regional forest agreements that were established between the federal government and the states. These agreements cover significant tracts, all of potentially economic, so-called productive, forests in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and New South Wales. This bill would wind up each of the 10 regional forest agreements at the time of their expiry dates. I note the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement has been subject to a variation which was signed last year by the Prime Minister and the Tasmanian Premier, and this was presented to the public as a variation. But the actual outcome is a substantial rewriting of the RFA, which was undertaken without any engagement of this parliament, despite the significance of the extension of this RFA to 2037. In effect, it makes future extensions automatic into perpetuity. That is staggering.


When the RFAs were introduced 20 years ago, they were meant to provide long-term sustainable forest management to protect these complex ecosystems and to ensure the viability of threatened species living in the forests as well as govern production of timber from these forests and maintain jobs. They have failed in every regard. And the government have indicated that, like they've done with the Tasmanian agreement, they intend to just roll over the existing 20-year regional forest agreements when they come up for expiry. The lack of rigour and reflection in this position is astounding, and it demonstrates that the government do not have any commitment to safeguarding our carbon stores, our clean water, our water supplies, our tourism hot spots or our wildlife habitat or the current and future jobs of locals who rely on all of these.


Across Australia, the evidence of the last 20 years is that the Regional Forest Agreements have failed and continue to fail in their goals of providing security to industry and workers and securing a reserve system to protect species. When then Prime Minister John Howard and the Victorian Premier signed the Victorian Central Highlands Regional Forest Agreement in 1998, the Howard government environment minister stated that the RFA would ensure that 'the whole forest will be sustainably managed for future generations'. And yet under the Regional Forest Agreements these forests are logged, pulped and burnt. The story is exactly the same across the other nine areas subject to RFAs. Yes, under the Regional Forest Agreements there were some areas of forest that were reserved, but there were vast areas of forests of equal value and of equal significance that have not been protected and have been subject to ongoing, intensive logging in the 20 years since.


The Regional Forest Agreements are outdated, impotent and costing us irrecoverable species, taxpayer dollars and extensive forgone opportunities. We need to scrap them. As I've already said, over 80 per cent of the wood products that are being produced in Australia are now being produced from plantations. The remaining native forest timber industry is just the rump of the timber industry. It's not the direction that the industry is headed in. It's not where all of the excitement of, say, having timber for multistorey buildings is coming from; that's timber coming from plantations. When you look at the latest announcement of a new sawmill, Hermal mill, in north-west Tasmania, that is going to be a hardwood plantation based sawmill. This is the direction that we need to be continuing in, transitioning all of the industry out of our native forest so we can have that sustainable plantation based industry, protecting our precious native forests for so many values that they also hold.


One of the most appalling parts of the Regional Forest Agreements and of our current logging laws is that they exempt logging from our national environment protection laws. When an area is logged under an RFA it's deemed to be occurring in an ecologically sustainable way even where there is ample evidence this is not the case. There are no grounds for our environment protection laws in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to apply. Think of that. These complex native forest ecosystems are not protected through our national environment protection laws from the destruction of logging. This means that even if a critically endangered species is found in a forest valley or ridge, under an RFA it's still okay to go ahead with the logging. All that needs to happen with regard to any endangered species is that there needs to be a recovery plan in place—or not even in place, but being planned. It doesn't matter whether this recovery plan, at the end of the day, is shown to have been totally inadequate to protect the species. All that's required is to get a recovery plan in place, and then logging can continue to occur under the rules that are set out in the recovery plan. In fact, they're not even rules but only guidelines for how logging could occur. So there is no rigour and no ability for the EPBC Act to overrule the logging operations occurring under an RFA even where the evidence is there. As it is, you have threatened species that are being driven towards extinction by those logging operations. How can it be possible that native forests get such special treatment? Other extractive industries such as mining are required to justify their impact on the environment, but not the native forest industry. They get to carve out sections of precious forests to destroy them. They're given carte blanche to destroy animals, plants and vital habitat.


Let me remind the chamber that the Commonwealth has a duty to protect our environment for all Australians. Yet, in continuing the regional forest agreements and their exemption from the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, this government is shirking that responsibility and is allowing an extractive industry—because that's what it is—to carry out its business with no regard for the long-term damage this does to our forests. For all the talk of 'Oh, the forest will regrow,' when you are logging a forest that has got trees in it that are hundreds of years old, such as with the logging that is currently occurring in East Gippsland and in Tasmania, you cannot say that you are replacing this forest, because you cannot replace an old-growth, unlogged forest—a complex, ancient forest—with essentially just a plantation of young species. It will not provide the habitat for those plants and animals for hundreds and hundreds of years, and certainly won't provide the nesting hollows in those trees for the species that rely on them and need hollows in old trees in order to survive. It is an extractive industry. It is destroying that forest's value for those precious and threatened animals.


As a nation we have the worst rate of mammal extinctions in the world over the last 200 years since colonisation. We have forest-dependent species that are headed to add to those extinctions: the critically endangered Leadbeater's possum, the critically endangered swift parrots, the giant freshwater crayfish and Carnaby's cockatoo. These animals are threatened and are becoming more threatened, and yet logging is allowed to continue to occur in places where they live. It's a shameful position to be in, particularly as a wealthy, developed nation, particularly as a nation with so many unique species that are found nowhere else in the world and particularly as a nation that has only seen just over 200 years of this atrocious use of our land—just over 200 years.


In the forests such as at Granite Mountain in East Gippsland, with trees hundreds of years old, those trees were old when Captain Cook sailed past just over 200 years ago. These extinctions are not a trend we want to continue, particularly with our unique plants and animals serving as a backbone for our incredibly valuable tourism industry and the many communities whose livelihoods rely on the protection of these precious places. The sheer enormity of past extinction rates and the tiny amount of pristine native habitats remaining in Australia means we need to fight to conserve every remaining piece.


I have already mentioned the Leadbeater's possum in my home state of Victoria,. It's critically endangered. Its primary habitat, the beautiful mountain ash forests, are in such dire condition that the animals and the whole ecosystem are listed as critically endangered. We have a government that is saying, 'Oh, the Leadbeater's possum is having a massive population increase,' which is based on absolutely farcical data. If you look at the most thorough review of the science with Leadbeater's possums, you see that it shows that they are in dire straits. Yes, we may have observed more Leadbeater's possums over the past year, but that is because there have been more people out looking for them. It does not mean that those populations have increased.


The forests of the planned Great Koala National Park in New South Wales, the Great Forest National Park in Victoria, the Tarkine in Tasmania, Western Australia's South-West Forest and the incredibly biodiverse and beautiful East Gippsland are hugely valuable parts of our natural heritage and must remain so for future generations.


A recent assessment of Victoria's Central Highlands forest using ecosystem accounting methodology and which was published in the prestigious journal Nature Ecology and Evolution clearly demonstrated that there are considerably greater benefits in soaking up and storing carbon, water, habitat provision and recreational amenity if logging ceased compared with the economic value of logging these forests. And this work also clearly shows that the economic benefits of native forest logging are small compared to other industries in the region and that the economic impact of ceasing native forest logging could be more than offset by increases in other industries such as tourism and by entering the carbon market. Native forest areas have got enormous tourism potential, which is undermined by destructive and unsightly logging practices. The people and small businesses of regional Australia would stand to benefit hugely from increasing the amount of forest being protected and stronger government plans promoting tourism and recreation over logging.


Jobs are vital in the regional communities living near and in our forest areas, and we need to face up to the reality that direct employment in the forestry industry is already drying up. It has been drying up for the last 20 years, due to its economic and environmental unsustainability. Many mills are just scraping through on direct and indirect taxpayer subsidies. We've had the Victorian government paying $50 million to buy the Heyfield mill. We know that logging in East Gippsland costs us, the taxpayers, $5 million a year. So it costs us for the logging of our forests. Just think about what else that money could be spent on. Think about: what if you spent $5 million a year, or more than that, on improving the tourism infrastructure, the recreation infrastructure—upgrading walking tracks, forest drives and bicycle touring tracks? There are many, many more jobs in really valuing the forests as a tourism resource than in their ongoing logging.


Industrial logging in our public native forests has had its day. It has failed to protect our environment and it has failed to protect jobs. The future for the Australian wood-products industry is in a sustainably-managed plantation industry. So, in order to achieve this vision for long-term sustainability for the Australian wood-products industry, and to protect our native forests, with all their unparalleled values, we must scrap the Regional Forest Agreements. This bill to repeal the RFAs does what the government has failed to do. This bill would protect our forests in a way that all Australians, now and into the future, would value and really appreciate, well into the future.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-02-08,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (16:36):  I'm sure it will be no surprise to those who are in the chamber or listening to this contribution to know that the Australian government will not be supporting Senator Rice's, on behalf of the Greens, Regional Forest Agreements Legislation (Repeal) Bill 2017. The coalition government does not subscribe to the theory that we just lock up our forests and throw the key away and wait for a fire to come through and burn them down. We don't subscribe to the theory that you do nothing in your forests and wait for the feral animals to come in and eat our endangered species. We subscribe to the theory that you can actually manage all of our forestry estates in such a way as to strike a balance between making sure you keep a certain amount of it in a pristine state—we are absolutely committed to that—and having a place in the Australian landscape for a forestry sector, and that that forestry sector also includes an amount of native regrowth harvest. And we believe that's sustainable into the future.


Just to give a shout-out for our friends the trees, I'd like to put on the record that trees are renewable and they are recyclable. We believe that we will manage them in a sustainable way. They are carbon-positive and they are a resource that belongs to all Australians. If you were going to go out and invent the absolutely perfect product—as the big man who invented trees in the first place did—you would invent a tree.


I'm sure that trees were put on this earth in the very first instance because they were able to be cut down, because they would grow again and because they would provide a resource for myriad different things—not just for possums and for people to go and look at for a tourism adventure, which, Senator Rice would have you believe, is the only purpose for a tree to be in existence. There is actually a place on earth for trees to be cut down and used for myriad different purposes, because they will grow again. Also the suggestion, for some reason, that forestry and ensuring a sustainable environment and sustainability of our native animals are somehow mutually exclusive is just ridiculous. They can coexist side by side.


It is also extraordinary hypocrisy to suggest that we can't use native timber. So much of our magnificent appearance-grade timber that we, as Australians, are absolutely delighted to have as part of our lives—the beautiful furniture; the beautiful floorboards; the things that you can't actually get from plantation timber—we value. But I would also say that I believe Australians value sustainability in the harvesting of our forests, just as we believe in sustainability in everything we do, whether it be our marine environment, our beautiful Murray-Darling Basin or the sustainability of how we manage our agricultural sector in Australia. To suggest that somehow we can completely replace this beautiful appearance-grade timber, which many, many people in Australia are able to enjoy every day, by using plantation timbers is just a stretch too far. They aren't the same thing.


Senator Rice, on behalf of the Greens, says that she believes the RFAs have failed, that they haven't protected endangered species. I would say that I absolutely dispute that. I believe the RFAs have stood us in good stead and I also believe that they have acted, and assisted us, in the protection of our endangered species. But that's not to say that, as part of an iterative process of the rollover and renewal of these RFAs, we can't make them fit for purpose for 2018 and into the 21st century. As Senator Rice rightly points out, these agreements were first brought into place 20 years ago. We've learnt a lot in the last 20 years, so what we are seeking to do, as part of an iterative process of the rollover of these RFAs, is to make sure that the lessons of the last 20 years have been learned. At the same time, we want to enable a sustainable forestry industry to go forward in a practical, sensible and realistic way without destroying the livelihoods of many communities that rely on the timber industry or taking away the delight that many Australians have in the beautiful appearance-grade Australian timber they have in their homes and their lives.


It seems somewhat ironic that we were talking just a minute ago in relation to illegal logging. We know that in Australia we have such strict regulations and rules that demand Australian timber is harvested in a very sustainable way. So we're making it as difficult as we possibly can to import timber into Australia, while at the same time we're going to stop the Australian timber industry from being able to progress—it does seem a little hypocritical. There does seem to be an overall theme going on with the Greens when it comes to Australian agriculture—that is, they actually don't want us to have any.


The coalition government believes that Australian forestry industries are absolutely vital to this country and they are an absolutely integral part of our regional communities. The forest industry directly employs over 67,000 people Australia-wide and it contributes nearly $24 billion to the Australian economy. This is no lightweight industry. And the benefits of this competitive, sustainable, renewable forestry industry in our regional communities cannot be underestimated. For this reason, the Turnbull government believes that it's absolutely important that we put the right tools in place to ensure the sustainable management of these forests but at the same time make sure that we don't place an unreasonable burden on them—this balance in making sure that our regulation and our legislative burden is commensurate with what we are trying to achieve. We are not a government that smashes walnuts with sledgehammers; we are a government that makes sure the tools we put in place are appropriate for the job we're trying to do. So we believe that the RFAs are undoubtedly the best mechanism by which we can manage our native forests in a sustainable way, and we believe this is an effective framework for achieving the balance between the economic outcomes that we want for our regional communities, the environmental outcomes that we all seek for sustainability—because we all love our beautiful environment—and making sure that we deliver a socially appropriate outcome for all Australians, in particular the Australian communities that rely on our forestry sector.


We have 10 RFAs in Australia. They were signed progressively between 1997 and 2001. Over $1 million was invested in ensuring that our native forestry management was balanced across the environment and making sure that the environmental, social and economic outcomes were achieved. To quote you, Senator Rice, in your explanatory memorandum:


The intention of the RFAs was to provide long-term forest management to protect these complex ecosystems.


Well, Senator Rice, I believe that's exactly what has happened here. More than 3.3 million hectares of native forests have been transferred back into Australia's reserve estate over the time the RFAs have been in practice. That is an increase in the reserve estate of 46 per cent in the last 20 years. If you look at a state-by-state breakdown: the area in New South Wales increased by 1.334 million hectares; in Victoria, nearly a million hectares; in Tasmania, 684,000 hectares; in Western Australia, 338,000 hectares. That is 3,320,000 hectares, or a 46 per cent increase in our forest estate that is under reserve. That is a fantastic outcome for the environment, but have I ever heard you, Senator Rice, come in here and talk about the positive result of the increase in the amount of the forest reserve as a result of the actions that have been generated by the RFAs? Not a word. I assure you that the reason you do not do that is that it does not suit your argument—your argument of scaremongering.


In the first 20 years of operation, the RFAs have delivered long-term certainty to regional communities and the forest resource and the timber industry. They have improved the regulatory processes for businesses that operate in this industry. They have increased the identification and protection of old-growth forest values and the protection of 100 per cent of old-growth forests that are rare or depleted, and there have been significant advances in our approach to ecological, sustainable forest management.


With RFAs, we have a timber industry that operates with some of the highest levels of biodiversity protection in the world. The EPBC Act continues to provide a level of assistance in ensuring that we have world's best practice and we can put our hand on our heart and say that we are appropriately managing our forest system. Logging activities in Australia's native forests are not exempt from environmental protection laws—although you would believe they were if you listened to some of the things that come from the other end of the chamber. The act recognises that, in each RFA region, a comprehensive regional assessment was undertaken to address the environmental, economic and social objectives of the EPBC Act. So the establishment of RFAs actually constitutes a form of assessment and approval under the EPBC Act.



Senator Rice interjecting—




Senator RUSTON:
  It absolutely is a recognition that the RFAs have established comprehensive reserve networks. This is another feature of the RFAs that you wilfully continue to ignore, another inconvenient truth for the Greens.


Another inconvenient truth for the Greens is in relation to threatened species. We do have a series of obligations and requirements that are set forth in the state based legislation that we have to adhere to. The RFAs do not exempt forest operators from obligations in state based legislation for the protection of threatened species and communities. This includes the application of forest management strategies to protect rare and endangered species. The management of threatened species within the RFA regions is consistent with the objectives of the EPBC Act. According to the Australia's state of the forests report 2013, the most significant threats to forest-dwelling animal species listed as threatened under the EPBC Act are historical land use changes and forest loss caused by clearing, predation from introduced predators, illegal collection and genetic or breeding issues. It doesn't say anything in there about forestry.


Just last year in a Senate estimates hearing the Threatened Species Commissioner stated that no Australian mammal has become extinct due to forestry operations. That's another inconvenient truth for you, isn't it, Senator Rice? I know that you love the Leadbeater's possum, and I have to say I don't know any Australian who wouldn't love the Leadbeater's possum if they saw that cute little thing. But, despite the continued dire warnings by those who are paid to research these things, in fact it would appear that the Leadbeater's possum is a rather adaptable little critter, and it seems that, the more we look for them, the more we find. We are able to come in here and say that the recovery plan that's been put in place for the Leadbeater's possum is working, and we're really pleased that it is working. There's nothing that gives me more pleasure than when I get a report sent to me saying that we've had another sighting of a Leadbeater's possum in any of our forests. Everyone rejoices in the fact that this little critter is being seen in greater and greater numbers. Contrary to the doom and gloom that you hear from the other end of the chamber, this is a positive story and one from which we can learn. We should all be looking at what's happening when we're seeing increased populations of any of these species and looking at what we're doing right. We should be working together so that we can make sure that we continue to be able to get positive outcomes for all of our species. Sitting at the other end of the chamber and complaining and whingeing and twisting the thing is not going to save one more possum.




Senator Rice:
  Listen to the science! Read the science!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Order on my left!




Senator RUSTON:
  I do read the science, Senator Rice. The problem we have here in Australia is that we have an industry of scientists who have made a fortune trying to come up with inconveniently ill-informed and unfactually based misinformation because it suits their purposes. It's about time somebody started calling out some members of our environmental scientific community for the rubbish that they put out in the marketplace, believing that the word 'professor' or 'doctor' before their name somehow gives them some sort of legitimacy to say things. But that is another story, and I won't waste the chamber's time with it now. 


When you look at this, this is a really good story about the success of adaptive management work. For instance, when it comes to the swift parrot, researchers have shown that it actually isn't forestry that is causing the threat to the swift parrot; it's predation from sugar gliders. We need to make sure when we come in here and make these statements that we use the facts behind the reasons for these things happening—for it to be the truth. It is just convenient for you to say it's forestry. It's not forestry that is causing these problems; it's myriad other things that are much more difficult to deal with. So, once again, the inconvenient truth of the situation seems to be lost—or not provided—by those at the other end of the chamber. 


It is the belief of the government that the creation of RFAs has made considerable advances in the identification and protection of old-growth forests. We believe that they are working extremely well in setting specific protection targets for particular ecosystems. We believe this is a great result for the Australian forestry sector, the environment and the people who depend on it. 


We also believe that the timber industry is a hugely important source of wood products in Australia, and Australian native forest remains a primary source for durable, high-strength, appearance-grade timber. This is not the kind of stuff you can get from growing a pine tree. It includes solid wood flooring, panelling, furniture and fine crafts. Some magnificent products are coming out of Tasmania; you have only got to go down to the Launceston wood products display centre to see the magnificent artworks that are being achieved by using this magnificent timber in a sustainable way. Australia's plantations are not able to replace the type and quality of wood that comes from using native timbers. This is, once again, something you refuse to accept. To stand in here and say, 'We'll move to plantations and we won't use native timber anymore,' is absolutely ridiculous. You know it is, but it's not convenient for your argument. 


You also ignore the fact that our downstream forest industries are fully integrated; they use every single piece of wood from both plantations and native forests. Wood from our native forests complements that sourced from our plantation industry. I know you want to get rid of the RFAs, claiming they are preventing Australia from moving out of forest logging, but why would we want to move out of forest logging when we've already demonstrated it's renewable, recyclable and carbon positive, and we are managing it in a sustainable way? Why would we want to wilfully cripple our forest industries? I don't understand it; maybe you can explain it to me. Why would we want to destroy jobs in regional communities? Why would we want to shut regional communities down? Why would we want to decimate regional communities? You only have to look at the disallowance motion that Sarah Hanson-Young moved in here in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin plan to see that you don't care about our regional communities. You only care about your own ideology. There is not a care in the world for the fact that people like me live in regional communities, and those communities would be shut down by the actions of the legislation and regulations that you constantly come in here and try to have passed. 


The Tasmanian RFA is a fantastic example of what 20 years of learning has done for us. We were delighted to sign the new RFA recently. There was an 80 per cent increase, or 800,000 hectares, in the reserve estate. Fifty-eight per cent, or 1.778 million hectares, of Tasmania's forest is now protected in reserves, including the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. More than a million hectares of old-growth forest are now permanently reserved, and world-benchmark, ecologically sustainable forest management has been implemented. At the same time, significant business savings have been enabled for industry. These are significant achievements, and we were delighted in 2017 to sign an extension for a further 20 years rolling.


In conclusion, we believe the management of Australia's native forests is being undertaken sustainably. What's more, far from an industry in decline, we believe our forestry industry is a sunrise industry. The RFAs set the framework for that sustainable management and the conservation of our native forests. So what's at stake? If the RFAs were repealed, jobs would be lost and communities would be destroyed, and for what environmental gain? Do we really want to put Australian Paper's Maryvale Mill out of work—is that really what you Greens want to do? Do you really want to make sure all those people who work in the Gippsland no longer have a job? I don't think it's what the Australian public wants, and it's time we called you out for the scaremongering and, often in cases, the lies that are put out into the marketplace to try and make people think that Australia's native timber industry is not a sustainable industry—it is. You have absolutely no regard for the tens of thousands of families whose livelihoods you actively seek to destroy or the hundreds of regional communities that would cease to exist if you had your own way. This is deliberate ignorance, and it is absolutely reprehensible.


The coalition government does not support the repeal of the RFA Act. The repeal will not help the environment. It will not help business. It will not create jobs. It will not help our regional communities. This coalition government stands for every single one of those things. We believe the environment must be sustainable, and our actions, legislation and regulations support that. We believe that we should be helping business, and our legislation and regulations support that. We believe in creating jobs. We created 400,000 of them last year and we are committed to making sure it's another 400,000 this year—over a thousand jobs a day. We will not destroy our regional communities with ridiculous Green ideology with absolutely no basis. It is absolutely our longstanding position that the RFAs are the best mechanism to balance the economic, social and— (Time expired)

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-02-08,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (16:57):  I often remember the times before I came to parliament. My encounters with the Senate and the House of Representatives, before I got the key to my office when I became the member for Robertson in 2010, were through the radio soundwaves across this country, particularly Radio National. You'd hear all sorts of conversations and your life, as you're driving your kids from one activity to another, would be informed by the conversations we are having here. This conversation is about a very important industry—the forestry industry. It is also a very important conversation about how we manage our environment and that precious resource that we have: the trees that Australians enjoy throughout the country.


Why is this such an important discussion that we're having this afternoon in the Senate? The forestry industry provides not only jobs for 67,000 people, but also a range of absolutely essential products that integrate themselves into people's lives. We know Australia generates a very significant export outcome from our produce in this sector, from sales to international markets. But the sorts of products that this reaches out to extend to sawn wood and wood based panels for constructing our homes. That's often what people in the cities think of wood: it's simply the timber that comes in the frames they see of the houses that spring up on the edges of our cities.


But this debate touches on so many more uses for sustainable forestry industry in our country, including furniture, printing and writing paper for our homes and our offices, sanitary paper products for everyday use, and paper and paperboard for packaging many of the products we consume. We even have wood derived products such as cellophane, rayon and ethanol involved in this industry. If I can, I want to make some remarks about the capacity for innovation in the way that we might be able to use this amazing renewable resource to create new types of technologies and new applications that will improve lives not just here in our country but around the world.


We know that carbon fibres that are derived from wood are used to make lightweight parts for things as diverse as motor vehicles and packaging for food and beverages—another wood product that comes into our lives. Solvents made from wood fibre are used instead of petroleum, and that's got to be a good thing. Wood also has the potential to generate renewable energy through the combustion of wood pellets, liquid biofuels and any other adaptation modern technology can make of this very precious resource. As esoteric as a discussion about the Regional Forest Agreements Legislation (Repeal) Bill 2017 might sound, its intersection with the lives of Australians goes right into the cabinets in our bathrooms and the cupboards in our kitchens.


The current private member's bill that's before the Senate, on this occasion put forward by Senator Rice, seeks to repeal the Regional Forest Agreements Act 2002. The agreements are known as RFAs. I know that Senator Ruston has made some significant comments about this and celebrated the recent signing of another agreement in 2017 to provide some stability to the sector. But this bill is trying to do something entirely different. The bill itself, in its explanatory memorandum, acknowledges that for the past two decades, our native forests have been managed under the banner of 10 regional forest agreements that were established—and, I'm sure, not easily at the time—between the federal government and the states.


I am one of the Australians who's been very lucky to have travelled through every single state of the country. In fact, my husband and I took a year off, before we were grey—we were certainly nomadic—and spent it travelling around Australia. The great forests of Australia that we saw were covered by these 10 agreements in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and New South Wales. As a New South Wales senator I am all too aware of how critical the management of the forests of our native timbers, and also our plantation timbers, is to regional economies right across this state.


I note and agree with the statistics that were put forward by Senator Ruston, that in the course of the previous RFA there was a 46 per cent increase in the forest estate under reserve. This is an important measure of the success of what the RFA achieved. To have 46 per cent more forest in reserve is a great outcome that I think Australians would be proud of. Being a legislator for the period of time that I've been here, I'm aware of the many failures of legislation, but surely that has to be applauded as a great outcome.


As a senator for New South Wales, it is with great pride that I stand here on the back of work that's been done by previous governments and celebrate as a New South Welshwoman that there are 1.334 million hectares of New South Wales land under reserve in forest estate. That's a great outcome. We need to be mindful that, despite its imperfections, the Regional Forest Agreements Act 2002 is not an entirely failed piece of legislation, and it should only be an entirely failed piece of legislation that should be repealed. That is not the case with this piece of legislation.


The intention of these RFAs, which were established between the federal government and the governments of Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and New South Wales, was to provide long-term forest management to protect these very complex ecosystems, to ensure the viability of threatened species in the forests and to govern the production of timber from these forests. They also have that very worthy aim of maintaining jobs to maintain the economy and the viability of communities across the country, especially those in regional areas where these forests exist.


The bill that's before us from the Greens party claims that the RFAs have failed to meet the intended goals. Well, much legislation, sadly, doesn't always meet its goals, but I don't think we should be discarding this piece of legislation. The Greens' EM argues that the environmental and industrial context of the RFAs has substantially changed since they were commenced in the late 20th century. A lot's changed since that time, but I don't believe that in this case that provides sufficient argument for the repealing of this forest management framework.


The fact is RFAs have had exemptions from the EPBC Act, and this bill would see the application of the EPBC Act to forestry operations and ensure the same level of environmental approvals and protections are applied to any other extractive industry. But, to be clear, I want to put it on the record that Labor will not be supporting this bill, and we believe that the Greens position with regard to the RFA doesn't make sense in the context of the current situation of this particular industry. The RFAs, in addition to delivering that 46 per cent increase in reserves in estate, are in fact the important current and legal framework that we use to manage our forests. To repeal such a framework without another framework adequately formed, considered and in place to replace it would in my view be an irresponsible act. In common parlance, it would be akin to throwing the baby out with the bathwater.


These regional forest agreements, which are 20-year plans for sustainable management and conservation of Australian forests, across the four states cover large native forestry regions. Five of those forestry regions are in Victoria. Three are native forestry regions in New South Wales, and there is one in each of Western Australia and Tasmania. In a sensitive way, the RFAs seek to—and in many, many instances have delivered—a balance between the competing industries of the economy, the society and the environment.


Balancing economic, social and environmental demands on forests by settling obligations and commitments for forest management delivers great outcomes. One of the things that the RFAs have delivered, and need to continue to deliver, is certainty of resource access and supply to industry, building investment confidence, which matters to all of us everywhere, including in the cities, not just where these forests are. The RFAs seek to balance ecologically sustainable forest management issues, ensuring forests are appropriately managed and that they are regenerated to benefit young Australians and those who come after us. 


The RFAs also seek to make sure that we expand the permanent forest conservation estate, and on that measure, given the statistics that there's been a 46 per cent expansion, you'd have to say that the RFA has most certainly achieved the outcome that was set. We know that the RFAs, in their formulation, are informed by scientific study, that they were the product of significant consultation and negotiation and that they cover a diverse range of interests. Labor is prepared to work responsibly with regard to the management of our forests. However, in our view, this bill before the Senate does not take a sensible approach.


I want to restate the love that Australians have for wood. My father loved wood, and the smell of him working with wood in our garage in suburban Sydney is a beautiful olfactory memory for me. As a former teacher, I know that students who didn't necessarily enjoy my English classes absolutely delighted in their capacity to work with their hands and their talents in woodwork classes on the Central Coast. We need to make sure that that passion and love for wood is not just translated into the joy of small enterprise but continues to be a vital and growing part of our economy. To do that we need to find a sustainable and balanced way of going forward to make sure that we create jobs that are innovation-based jobs, backed up by adequate research, and make sure that there are technologies that we can discover through proper investment in innovation policy.


In closing, I simply indicate—and I am citing a very useful document from the Forest Industry Advisory Council—that internationally significant research and technological advancements have resulted in the development of innovative applications for wood fibre and are enabling producers of emerging products to gain scale and improve cost-effectiveness in overseas markets. And let's be clear that timber is a renewable resource that can meet with innovative capacity.


However, while we're not supporting the proposals as they're put before the Senate today by the Greens in their private members' bill, I cannot indicate that I think the government is adequately responding to this sector. In fact, in terms of innovation right across every sector, we've had a lot of noise from this government but very, very little careful and considered investment in a way that is actually delivering jobs growth and economic growth for this country.


So in some ways I guess I've tried to walk the Buddhist path, somewhere down the middle between the Greens and the conservative representatives on the other side of the chamber. The Labor Party is truly the centrist party of this nation, and we have the sensible policy that balances all the things that we need to balance carefully. It balances the things that are at the heart of the regional forest agreements. It balances the need to make sure not only that we have sustainability and look after our economy but also that we look after our community in all its forms, in terms of its needs for resources, and that we look after the people in those communities, so they have jobs with decent wages and decent and fair working conditions, in such a way that this becomes a sustainable and long-term contributor to our local economy and our international participation.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (18:04):  This is the President's report to the Senate on the status of government responses to parliamentary committee reports. It is something that's provided twice yearly. It's one of those documents that would seem to be fairly dry and that often become routine and pass rapidly into the dusty places wherever these reports get filed away. 


But, since returning to this place, I have had a regular need to look at what things have changed in the 10 years since I was last year and what things are the same. I actually encourage people to have a look at this report. It's not particularly long. It's 17 pages. It simply lists all of the outstanding Senate committee reports and joint committee reports where the government has yet to respond to the recommendations. It's not the sole purpose of a Senate committee inquiry to produce recommendations for a government to decide whether or not then to act on, but it's a pretty important part of it. All of us here know that we get great value out of hearing from the community, of going to places and seeing what's happening on the ground, and of looking at all those submissions and considering things in more depth. But the end result is often but not always a report which makes recommendations—often unanimous, sometimes not—proposing that the government do things to address the problem that the committee has identified and the solutions they've identified based on the public feedback. 


It's one of the best mechanisms for the public to have an input into the issues that affect them and for people in the community who have expertise—whether academic, theoretical, practical or lived expertise—to have a say on important policy issues that affect them or that they have an interest in. I'm sure all of us here would recognise that we are not the experts on everything, and often are not experts at all on some matters. 


So it is very concerning to see just how many reports have not been responded to. The Senate has a convention, I guess, that the government should respond within three months. I think the House of Representatives convention is six months. This report lists—in a 16- or 17-page-long table—all of those Senate committee reports where the government has yet to respond. Most of them are well over six months. There was a very significant report, for example, on certain aspects of the Queensland government administration related to Commonwealth government affairs. A special Senate special select committee reported nearly three years ago now. No response has been received. I'm just picking a few of these at random: The effectiveness of special arrangements for the supply of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medicines to remote area Aboriginal Health Services. That one was tabled in 2011. There has been no response, over six years later. That doesn't mean nothing's happened in that area; I am not saying that. But I am saying that a fundamental and very basic part of accountability to the community—not just for government but for all of us; we all get paid to conduct these Senate inquiries, and there is public money spent on them—is that there be a response, even if the response is, 'Yeah, we're already doing that, thanks.' It's not that hard. Well, apparently it is that hard, because we have reports like that that haven't been responded to in over six years. There are many here in the community affairs area: another one from 2012, one from 2013, three from 2014 and two from 2015. It's not good enough. 


It might seem like a really dry and tedious thing to be talking about government responses to committee reports, but when a Senate committee brings down a report that's usually what we all talk about. We'll talk about plenty of other things, but the one thing we will almost always talk about is what the recommendations are for action. I have spoken a number of times since I've been back here about housing affordability. There was a report from the economics committee inquiry into the Australian housing affordability challenge tabled in May 2015—still no response. A report on the exploitation of temporary work visa holders, a major issue in my state of Queensland, was tabled nearly two years ago-no response. The impacts of mining in the Murray Darling Basin, a topic we're talking about now, was tabled in 2009–no response. 


This is across the life of the Labor government as well, of course. It's a joke. The fact that it happens every six months shouldn't be a reason to ignore it. I really would like the government to do better, and all of us to do better at insisting that we get better responses. (Time expired)

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:16):  I seek leave to reinstate two government responses that were on item 16 on yesterday's red: responses to the Education and Employment References Committee reports, Getting our money's worth: the operation, regulation and funding of private vocational education and training (VET) providers in Australia and Technical and further education in Australia.


Leave granted.




Senator CAMERON:
  In recognition of the hour and the long week that it's been for most senators, I'll just briefly speak to both of these reports and then I'll seek to continue my remarks. I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


The inquiry into the operation, regulation and funding of private vocational providers was an inquiry that was referred to the committee on the 24 November 2014. The report was finished on 10 August 2015, and the government responded in February 2018. This report and the response by the government maintains the government's position that competition, contestability and choice are fundamental to the future of the VET system in this country. It also dealt with the regulator, ASQA, and it briefly dealt with the VET-FEE HELP fiasco that built up to a crescendo under the coalition government. We had four ministers in a period of 12 months in this area under the coalition, and we've had huge problems in the for-profit sector of the training providers.


This is a terrible situation that we find ourselves in in this area. We've had significant funding go to the for-profit sector, we've seen the for-profit sector gouge the Australian government and the public of Australia, and we've seen some of the most egregious rip-offs take place in this sector, and yet the government wants to continue with competition, contestability and choice—a mantra that even ACCI, the Business Council of Australia and academics and experts across Australia who have researched this for years have said has left the system in a mess. If the Productivity Commission, an organisation that I'm not a great fan of, is saying the system is in a mess, then we really do have a mess that needs to be fixed. The government's response is inadequate.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later because I would like to deal with this in more detail at another time.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.




Senator CAMERON:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


The second government response is on technical and further education in Australia, similar to the government response on the VET inquiry and providers. The government talks about competition again in this area, along with contestability and choice. It simply wipes its hands of the TAFE system in this country by saying it's fundamentally the states' responsibility. Here we have the government, regardless of the ethics of the issues that arise from it, saying that they're going to set up this defence export industry. In relation to that, the OECD recently has said that we don't have the skills to access the global value chains across the world in either that area or any area. So the TAFE system is absolutely important. The TAFE system is fundamental. The TAFE system is where working-class Australians go to advance their training, go to advance their skills and go to advance their careers, yet this government has reduced funding in the TAFE sector to an extent where the TAFE sector is trying to compete in this flawed competition and contestability sector. We've seen problems across the TAFE sector but still huge problems in the for-profit sector in this area.


The government's response to this was the Skilling Australians Fund. The Skilling Australians Fund says, 'We will fund totally our training system in Australia through a charge on visas in this country.' Again experts, again business, again the BCA and ACCI are saying this is a flawed approach and we need guaranteed funding. So this government under Minister Birmingham and Minister Andrews do not have a clue how to deal with the skill acquisition in this country. And with those few remarks, I would seek to continue my remarks later.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (18:58):  Tonight I wanted to put on record some of the great work that is being done by some of our scientists and some of our institutions within government, within some of our universities and, indeed, working with the private sector. I've had the opportunity in my new portfolio in science, jobs and innovation to get to know some of these great areas. This is something the government really wants to build on. I want to pay tribute to some of the great work that is being done.


At the University of Sydney I had the opportunity to visit their Nano Institute, one of our most state-of-the-art scientific research facilities. The Nano Institute is on the University of Sydney campus in Camperdown and was built to the most strenuous engineering standards so it could house labs that do the most precise quantum measurements possible. Dr Gunther Schmidt and Professor Ben Eggleton first showed us their labs at the Centre for Ultrahigh bandwidth Devices for Optical Systems, which is research into the possibilities of optical computer chips. We then met with Professor Saleh Sukkarieh, who leads a team of very industry focused researchers in robotics. His work is helping agriculture and mining industries to be more efficient in their work, not just in terms of productivity but also in terms of the effect on the environment.


Finally at that facility, I met with Professor David Riley, who leads the partnership between Microsoft and the University of Sydney to work on the development of a quantum computer. This visit was particularly auspicious in light of the announcement a few days later of Professor Michelle Simmons as Australian of the Year, and I again congratulate her on that achievement. David's work is similar to hers. That we have such a wealth of expertise here in Australia in the cutting edge of computer science is a testament to the government's investment in science and research.


Quantum computing is absolutely critical to our future, and the science of that is something that so many Australians are leading the way in. Supercomputers, which we are also investing in—we recently announced a $70 million investment in a supercomputer here at the ANU in Canberra—are so critical because of the amount of data that we have these days. Making sense of that data takes amazing computer capacity. At the moment, we do that with supercomputers. Of course there will be similar, though different, uses once we really crack the code when it comes to quantum computing.


In Sydney I was also able to visit one of Australia's best kept secrets—that is, the National Measurement Institute. The concept of measurement might seem a bit plain and boring but the fact is that measurement is at the foundation of so many parts of our lives, and measurements have to have standards and tests to be effective. At their main facility in West Lindfield, the CEO of the NMI, Jane Coram, showed me around some of the labs that housed some of the most important measurement instruments in the country. Dr Jan Herrmann showed me the atomic clock, which is the clock against which every clock in the country needs to be set to be accurate. Dr Lindsey Mackay took me around the North Ryde NMI facility, which houses the chemical testing labs. This is where our official sports drug testing takes place, as well as where much of the criminal testing is done.


A real highlight was to tour the headquarters of the Australian Astronomical Observatory, also in North Ryde. Professor Andrew Hopkins showed me some of the amazingly precise astronomical measurement instruments that make Australia a world leader in space research. That visit to the AAO was a great help for my visit last week to the Siding Spring Observatory near Coonabarabran. Professor Hopkins was once again on hand as we launched the TAIPAN spectroscopic instrument, an instrument designed by the AAO and purpose-built for the UK Schmidt Telescope.


The TAIPAN uses a technology called Starbugs, which was developed here in Australia. It's an extraordinary innovation, with tremendous opportunities for research and discovery here and overseas. Starbugs are minirobots that rapidly and accurately align the optical fibres of a telescope to target stars and galaxies. This world-first technology makes astronomical surveys much faster and much more efficient by using hundreds of optical fibres to cut down a telescope's configuration time from an hour or two to two or three minutes. So the TAIPAN will provide the most complete survey of Southern Hemisphere stars and galaxies ever undertaken. It will measure up to two million galaxies and two million stars to make new discoveries about dark energy, dark matter and how galaxies and stars form and evolve. The TAIPAN will serve as a prototype for similar positioning systems being developed in Australia for other international telescopes, like the Giant Magellan telescope under construction at Las Campanas Observatory in the Chilean Andes.


Massive credit needs to go to Professor Matthew Colless of the ANU Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics for his efforts in initiating this great project. I really do want to emphasise how important that technology is in astronomy and in so much science that hangs off that, because it will enable us to get much more detailed analysis of the stars that we can see. The scientific potential of that is great. This is technology that is cutting edge, but it's being done in Australia and it's another great example of some of the great innovation that we have in some of our institutions. It is something I think we should be very proud of.


Closer to home, I had the wonderful opportunity again to visit perhaps our most famous national scientific institution, Questacon, just down by the lake here in Canberra. As a local, I've been to Questacon many times. My children go there often, but it was a new experience to visit there as the assistant minister with responsibility in the area.


I met with Professor Graham Durant, who ably leads a team of enthusiastic and bright science experts, tour guides and volunteers at a place that really is something of a theme park for science. Questacon is one of Canberra's great success stories. In the 2016-17 financial year Questacon welcomed over half a million people through their doors—511,000. It's estimated they make a contribution to the ACT economy of between $59 million and $98 million every year. 2017 was a particularly significant year for Questacon, as they welcomed their 11 millionth visitor in March 2017 and they won gold at the Australian Tourism Awards in Darwin, something that I know all of the staff and supporters of Questacon are very, very proud of, and rightly so.


Questacon of course is not just a Canberra success story, as they do a number of outreach activities to rural and regional areas, such as their Shell Questacon Science Circus, which ran from July 2016 to September 2017. It visited 447 schools and held over 30 community events to reach 108,000 participants. Questacon also present their travelling exhibitions, which reach some 1.7 million people around the world, and their Smart Skills Initiative, which had 25,000 participants.


But what Questacon is most known for, of course, is their fun exhibits and educational displays here at their main building in Canberra. I got to experience their creativity and had to trust their scientific knowledge when they let me hold fire in my hands in a fun display of how water and fire interact.


I want to commend and congratulate Questacon for their ongoing contribution to the city, to our nation, to science and to discovery, particularly for our young people—inspiring young people to consider science, to engage in science and hopefully to pursue educational and career opportunities in science. I certainly commend the work Questacon does not just to my parliamentary colleagues but indeed to all Australians.
