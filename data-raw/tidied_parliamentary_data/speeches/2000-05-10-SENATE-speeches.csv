"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-05-10,"—Last night, before we adjourned, I was discussing particular parts of the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 that relate to the placing of Cocos (Keeling) workers under the Western Australian Industrial Relations Act. I was expressing concern because the people of Cocos (Keeling) and Christmas islands do vote in federal elections, do elect members of parliament to represent them here, but they elect members of parliament from the Northern Territory. They do not have representation at any state level, yet they will be placed under legislation that is under the jurisdiction of the Western Australian government. This seems to me like another variation of no taxation without representation. These people certainly will not have any representation on that particular legislation, and it is not even federal legislation.
—Did you say this when the Labor Party put through the Territory Law Reform Bill?
—This is an issue of concern. The previous work that had been done on this particular area was done in close consultation with the Western Australian government, with the people of Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) and with the various organisations. But the changes that have been wrought upon the people of these islands now have not been done with the approval of anybody or with consultation. This is a very important issue for people to remember. These people are having this foisted upon them with no consultation, and it would appear that some of it is actually contrary to what they previously had sought.
I also now want to turn to issues relating to the Madrid protocol. We do support that particular part of the legislation. It is important. The Madrid protocol was adopted in 1991 in response to proposals that a wide range of provisions relating to the protection of the Antarctic environment should be harmonised in a comprehensive and totally binding form, and it draws on and updates the agreed measures as well as subsequent treaty meeting recommendations relating to the protection of the environment. It designates the Antarctic as a `natural reserve, devoted to peace and science'. It establishes environmental principles for the conduct of all activities and prohibits mining. It subjects all activities to prior assessment of their environmental impacts. It provides for the establishment of a Committee for Environmental Protection to advise. It requires the development of contingency plans to respond to environmental emergencies and provides for the elaboration of rules relating to liability for environmental damage.
It is a very important piece of legislation. It is very important that we actual ratify it, and I understand that we thought we were right but this legislation has never been passed and, when another country signed up to the protocol, we suddenly found that we were lagging behind. But it is important. This is a wilderness area, but it is an area where people have been working, living and visiting for close to a century. As communications and technology improve, we find more and more people are actually going to visit the area, and this certainly places quite significant constraints and imposts upon the area. It is a very fragile place in terms of the ecology and the environment. Whilst the climate is harsh, things stay for a long time. The huts of Mawson and of the early explorers are still quite intact or the way they left them, unless the roofs have caved in. 
We are also able to see the impact of the failure of previous expeditions and bases to appropriately or adequately dispose of their waste and their refuse. That is now one of the big issues facing the people in the Antarctic and the people dealing with the Antarctic—that is, how do they undertake the reclamation work that relates to the tips and the dumps that were associated, or are still associated, with the bases? In some areas there is quite a decent cocktail of chemicals. Some of these are leaching into the sea, and it is quite interesting how they do leach and travel under the ice cap, or under the snow layer, into the sea.
You have in that area a major habitat for whales and other small animals who feed on the plankton and krill that grow there. These are fairly primitive life forms, meaning that heavy metals and other dangerous chemicals could be entering the food chain at a very early stage and so when people go fishing there, maybe illegally, for various fish or mammals they could be picking up quite heavily contaminated carcasses. The fact that they could be spreading across the world some of this contaminant is a major concern and it is a shame that this can happen. 
A lot of work is being done to outline and determine how best to ensure that the overflow from these tips can be contained and how best they can be removed or whether they should be sealed. Important work is being done by the Australian Antarctic Division on that issue, and I think they are to be highly commended for the work they are doing. They are undertaking it in a very cautious and responsible manner because they realise that there is a need to ensure that whatever method is undertaken to dispose of the waste it does not cause more harm than would be caused by leaving it as it is. The work that has been done on this is not just going to benefit the Australian bases, but it is very much a cooperative effort and it will be picked up and used in conjunction with other work being done by other countries who have bases there as well. 
It is a pristine area and it has significant beauty, but we have to be very conscious, careful and aware of what the impact of increasing tourism and issues like that could be on such an area. The recognition of the Madrid protocol is certainly going to help scientists and help the Antarctic to be preserved and to continue to be a very important source of landmass in the world with a number of very unique animals and unique flora that we cannot afford to lose.",SENATE,<title>TRANSPORT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-05-10,"—I thank all senators who have contributed to the debate on the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, particularly Senator West for her valuable contribution while I was dealing with something else. First of all, I indicate that I rarely agree with Senator Mackay on anything, but I do agree with her on this occasion and with Senator Greig that the timing of our providing amendments in relation to rail in particular was very tardy. I am concerned that we were remiss in not making the other parties aware of those amendments in relation to rail, particularly because the rail amendments really do have to be passed now if they are going to be passed at all. They have to be passed because, although these amendments are relatively minor in their own right, they do affect the implementation of the AN sale arrangements. They have to be passed before the end of the financial year and now is the last opportunity. I apologise to the other parties for the late advice of those rail amendments. I certainly hope that in the time since the amendments were made known to the other parties, which was about 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, the department has been able to provide sufficient briefings to enable them to understand the import of them. It is a matter for me to try to convince them to agree or for them to point out where I am wrong. But I do hope at least that they understand and appreciate what the rail amendments are about and that they will have accepted that the amendments are relatively uncontentious and are needed to put the arrangements into operation. 
In relation to the industrial relations elements of the bill insofar as they relate to Christmas and Cocos islands, I again apologise for the late advising of the amendments that the government intends to move, amendments which arose out of debate in the House of Representatives and some unintended consequences of the way they were drafted. I am not sure of the Labor Party's position on the industrial relations elements. No doubt at some stage we will be made aware, although I understand that perhaps they have been looking more closely at them and perhaps my colleague Mr Reith, who deals with industrial relations matters on behalf of the government, has been speaking with the opposition spokesman for those areas. I hope that those issues are now clarified.  
I did not hear all of the speeches from all of the Labor Party senators. I did hear Senator Greig's speech, and I was just talking to him as the debate finished. I was emphasising to Senator Greig that, although he did not make a significant reference to these industrial relations matters in his speech, he did by implication indicate that he adopted some of the Labor Party senators' arguments—that is, he was not going to allow Christmas and Cocos island workers to be forced into becoming subject to Western Australian industrial relations laws, which Senator Greig described as terrible and draconian, I believe?
 (Senator Crowley)—For the benefit of Hansard, Senator Greig, you would have to speak. But I can tell Hansard that you nodded affirmation. 
—He was concerned—as I think some of the Labor Party senators were—that the import of our amendments made it mandatory for all employees on Christmas and Cocos islands to become subject to federal awards. That is definitely not the case. We are simple saying, at the request of the Western Australian government, that employees on Christmas and Cocos islands who are currently employed by Western Australia employers—principally by the Western Australian state government—have the right to remain under the Western Australian industrial legislation. They will be able to stay where they are. Perhaps, in the committee stage, I will be clearer in my explanation of that.
The situation as it currently applies on Cocos and Christmas islands is that the Commonwealth engages the Western Australian government to supply services to those islands, mainly because the Commonwealth does not have teachers, appropriate police officers, other allied health professionals and a lot of the other service providers. We simply engage someone else to do these jobs and, in this instance, it is the Western Australian state government—under specific agreements we have made with various Western Australia state agencies—which provides services on Christmas and Cocos islands. Those people who provide those services are Western Australian government employees. They have worked in Perth, or somewhere else in Western Australia, for the Western Australian government. They have been subject to Western Australian industrial relations legislation. There was a thought that perhaps, when they went to Christmas and Cocos islands, they would have to change to federal awards. This legislation, at the request of the Western Australian government, makes it quite clear that the situation which I think actually applies now—that is, they continue to be under Western Australian industrial relations laws—is the position that remains.
That is really what the industrial relations section of the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 is all about. Whether or not you think the Western Australian laws are draconian or whatever other adjective you might like to give them—of course I would disagree with you, for the record—really, in this instance, is not relevant. We are not saying to workers in the Indian Ocean territories that they must now go under Western Australian law. We are saying, `You can stay under the federal law; if you want to change over to the Western Australian law, you can; if you have a WA based employer, you can if you want to.' We are certainly not saying that they have to, but it allows those Western Australian government employees who are currently under the Western Australian award to legitimately stay there.
I again accept, Senator Greig, from your point of view particularly, that you and I are not experts on industrial relations law at all and we struggle to understand some of the complexities of things that we are not normally comfortable with. I would not expect you to know those, as I hope people would not expect me to be an expert on those particular things. We have been trying to say to you, Senator Greig—and, as I indicated, we have been trying to get in touch with you since yesterday evening—that we can send along departmental people—not me—to brief you. Although I am a very honest and trustworthy person, I can accept that, at times, you may think I am giving a political spin, so I would not send me or my officers. But, if you would like to understand exactly what the provisions provide, please accept a briefing from departmental officials. Having got the briefing and having then understood exactly what is intended, it is then a matter for you and your party to determine what you are going to do. I would hate to think that you are making a decision on this bill on the basis of a misunderstanding of what the bill actually says—a misunderstanding that I say, certainly in my own instance, would be very understandable because it is a complex matter in an area that I am not usually involved in. 
I am assured, if I can repeat, that territory residents who choose to undertake employment with a Western Australian employer will, under the government's amendments, have the choice to enter an Australian workplace agreement or a federal agreement by agreement with their employer. Where the employment with an AWA employer would be covered by an AWA award, there would be a normal conservancy of the employment. The territory resident would still be able to seek their employer's agreement to a federal agreement provided the Western Australian employer is a corporation.
We do not accept, I might say for the record, the opposition's 1994 agreement with the Union of Christmas Island Workers that in fact dictated that private sector workers on Christmas Island could only be represented by the Union of Christmas Island Workers and could only be covered by federal awards or agreements. The same choices should apply for Western Australian employers and their employees when working in the IOTs as apply on the mainland. Again I say, in answer to Senator Greig, that the government is not seeking to impose Western Australian industrial legislation on anyone. Territories residents not employed by Western Australian employers will not be affected by these amendments and will retain their special access to the federal workplace relations system. Territory based employers will still work solely under the federal workplace relations system.
I hope that the issue of just what these amendments do is clarified. I accept and I repeat that I do empathise with the opposition parties because they have not had as much time as they would have liked to have a look at some of these things but I hope that the import is now clear and that both the Democrats and the Australian Labor Party senators would now be able to support that particular position.
To briefly recap on the import of the whole of this legislative package before the parliament, the purpose of the bill is to amend a number of acts to help rectify some operational and technical anomalies. The bill also allows for changes to gender specific language and for the correction of some typographical and drafting errors. Schedule 1 amends the commencement provisions of the Transport and Communications Legislation Act to overcome a technical difficulty which prevented a proclamation being made for the commencement of the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act. Those amendments relate to the discharge of sewage and the disposal of garbage from ships in Antarctic areas. As I heard the debate, I understand that all senators support that legislation and I thank them for that support so that we can deal with and implement the legislation in relation to the disposal of sewage and garbage in the Antarctic area.
Of schedules 2 and 3, one relates to the Christmas Island Act and one to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act. Those amendments remove the reference to a court of Western Australia which has been abolished; make some changes in the industrial relations area, which I have already spoken about; and repeal some obsolete provisions relating to the removal and return to the territories of accused persons and prisoners. 
Schedule 4 relates to the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act, allowing for there to be a quorum even though a full-time executive member has disclosed a pecuniary interest in a particular issue and absents himself or herself from the meeting. I understand that all parties are supporting that very practical and sensible amendment.
Schedule 5 relates to the Northern Territory state government. I will very briefly enter into the political debate which happened yesterday. I am sure Senator Crossin would be disappointed if I did not take up some of her political points. I will briefly also mention a couple of points that Senator Greig made. I have already apologised for wrongly informing the Senate that the act had nothing to do with the Norfolk Island Act. It did, in fact: we are changing a full stop to a colon and including one word, `or'; so I was wrong. But really it will not in any way impact upon the Norfolk Island areas.
I appreciate what Senator Greig said about Norfolk Island, but he was really repeating what he said in the debate a few weeks ago on the attempt by the government to provide democratic reforms for those people living on Norfolk Island. I still cannot overcome my surprise that the Democrats particularly—although I am surprised at the Labor Party—would object to a reform that made the Norfolk Island Assembly much more democratic than it now is. Senator Greig said that we do not consult enough with the territories, but I consult very regularly with the Norfolk Island government and the Chief Minister. I go across for formal intergovernmental meetings and I am going across on one again very shortly and taking some of my ministerial colleagues. We go out of our way to consult very closely with the Norfolk Island government and the parliament, and I reject any suggestion that we do not consult with them. I get across to the Christmas and Cocos islands as much as I can—which is not very often, I regret to say. I try to be there and consult with the locals on the ground as often as I am able. Of course, as I think Senator Greig mentioned, we do have an administrator there who is in constant contact with the people of Christmas and Cocos islands and understands their views.
Senator Crossin, Senator Greig and Senator Hutchins then had the very curious argument which, I think, with respect, smacks of the hypocrisy that sometimes is displayed by the Australian Labor Party and, to a degree, by the Democrats. First of all, they are saying that we should consult more with the territories, that we should do what they say and not try to impose the Commonwealth's will on Norfolk Island or Christmas Island, but that we should listen to what they say. But when it comes to the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, the people of those territories, who elect their own governments and whose governments then determine what things need to be done and we have to pass some legislation to enable those people to have their own say, suddenly the Democrats and the Labor Party say, `Oh no, we don't want to allow the Northern Territory's democratically elected assembly to have any say in this; we don't want the Australian Capital Territory's democratically elected assembly to have a say in this. We want the Commonwealth government to go over the top and to impose our will on them.'
In relation to parliamentary secretaries, as we indicated during the debate, it was a request from the former Chief Minister to introduce that, to allow that to happen if the democratically elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly so determined to appoint parliamentary secretaries. We are not appointing any parliamentary secretaries. That is up to the democratically elected government in the Northern Territory. We had a lot of humour and a bit of cynicism from the opposition senators yesterday about the Northern Territory assembly, but that is all because for 26 years—
—For 25 years.
—For 25 years—thank you, Senator Mackay—the Liberal Country parties in the Northern Territory have been returned, election after election after election, because they do what the local people want. The Labor Party cannot win on the ground in the Northern Territory and so they come down here and seek the assistance of the Democrats to thwart the will of the Northern Territory people by having this parliament override the wishes of the Northern Territory people. Do you call that democracy? 
What a hypocritical argument in the two territories! Here, for 25 years, the Labor Party have been trying to win that argument in the Northern Territory and the Northern Territorians will not have a bar of the Labor Party and all the rubbish they go on with. They keep rejecting them time after time. The Labor Party cannot get their way there, so they come down here and, with the help of the Democrats, try to thwart the will of a properly and democratically elected government in the Northern Territory. (Time expired)
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"CHAIRMAN, The",N/A,2000-05-10,"—The A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000 is not regarded by the government's advisers as a bill imposing taxation within the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution. The bill however results in taxpayers paying significantly more taxation, and the government amendments to the bill have been circulated as requests. 
The only basis for the amendments being requests would be that the bill imposes taxation. In the past government advisers have framed amendments as requests where they increase the amount of taxation payable under a bill on the basis of the third paragraph of section 53. That paragraph refers to Senate amendments not increasing any proposed charge or burden on the people, but for amendments to fall within that paragraph there must be a proposed charge or burden on the people to be increased. In other words, in the case of a tax bill it must be imposing higher taxation on taxpayers. It would probably best reflect the past decisions of the Senate in relation to the tax legislation if the bill was regarded as a bill imposing taxation and therefore the amendments treated as requests. Any other amendments moved to the bill will be treated as requests on that basis.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-05-10,"—I seek your indulgence, Madam Chairman, and just ask whether there is going to be a statement by the government. I do not know whether Senator Macdonald is handling this bill or if he is just filling in while the minister responsible enters the chamber. I guess if I speak for a couple of minutes it might allow him to find that out as well. As I understand it from reading the press release, these amendments reflect an agreement reached between the government and the Democrats regarding changes to the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000. I assumed that first the government and/or the Democrats would want to speak and explain the package to the parliament. I was intending to respond to those comments in terms of the debate about quite substantial amendments to the bill. I am not sure whether Senator Macdonald was aware that he was going to be providing that sort of explanation or not, but obviously it is important legislation. It is legislation that has been subject to a number of changes in policy and a great deal of public debate. So I am just a little surprised. I understand that there may be a minister other than Senator Macdonald handling it, but I suspect that Senator Murray might want to say something, and I do not know whether Senator Woodley would. It was my intention to respond to those contributions. I would like some guidance from Senator Macdonald as to who is handling the bill and whether there is any explanation to be provided.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-05-10,"—My expertise on this is great, and I would have looked forward to look explaining it and entering into the debate, but I see my colleague Senator Kemp is here. He being larger than me, I would not want to stand in his way. So, Senator Evans, Senator Kemp obviously will be taking this through, much as I would have liked to. ",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-05-10,"—Senator Macdonald, with your outstanding performance in the Senate this morning it struck me that you may well have been the person to take this through, but I know that you have been busy, and I will therefore assume the reins. The explanation for these requested amendments—(1), (2), (4), (5), (7) and (8)—which I think was requested by the shadow minister at the table, provide for the consistent FBT treatment of public and non-profit hospitals by replacing the rebate which is currently available to non-government public hospitals and non-profit hospitals with the FBT exemption which is available to public hospitals which are public benevolent institutions.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-05-10,"—I was interested in whether the minister was going to give us a more general explanation of the package, rather than particularly these amendments. You missed the introduction of the bill, Senator Kemp. It would be important for this to be put on the public record. I will not be opposing the package—I will have a few comments to make—but I just think it is necessary that the debate occur and that we actually put on the record what has occurred and what is proposed by the package. That has not happened. I am happy to put my spin on it as the first point, if you like, but I doubt that that is the preferred government option. So I suspect the government had better do that.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-05-10,"—Thank you. I thought that in fact the debate had moved on. Perhaps my rapid praise for my colleague was too fulsome too early. I had been tied up elsewhere. But let me, first of all, make some general comments, as requested by the shadow minister. The A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000 implements the second phase of the government's tax reform package for fringe benefits. The bill will provide consistent FBT treatment between public and non-profit hospitals. Those hospitals which are currently eligible for 48 per cent rebate will have the rebate replaced by the exemption provided to public hospitals that are public benevolent institutions.
With effect from 1 April 2000 the bill will cap certain fringe benefits eligible for concessional treatment to $17,000 grossed up taxable value for employees of public and private not-for-profit hospitals. With effect from 1 April 2001 the bill will cap certain fringe benefits eligible for concessional treatment to $30,000 grossed up taxable value for employees of all public benevolent institutions that are not hospitals or where the employer is a rebatable employer. These caps do not place a limit on the use of other FBT exempt benefits, such as superannuation minor benefits less than $100, laptop computers, work related mobile phones and other miscellaneous benefits. Further, the concessional methods of valuing certain benefits will also increase the total value of benefits that can be provided without breaching the cap.
The bill will also extend the application of the current FBT exemption for remote area housing benefits for primary producers to all employers. In addition, the bill gives an exemption from FBT for housing benefits provided by public and non-profit hospitals, charities and police services in a place which is at least 100 kilometres from a town of 130,000 or more people. This enhances the delivery of health, charitable and police services to communities in regional Australia. The bill will also allow an FBT exemption to primary producers in remote areas for most meals provided to their employees.
Finally, the bill introduces a new FBT gross-up formula to help neutralise the tax treatment between fringe benefits and cash salary following the introduction of the GST, ensuring that the GST law interacts properly with the FBT law. The A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Amendment Bill 2000 will make minor technical corrections to the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Act 1999 to ensure consistency between the Medicare levy surcharge imposed under that act and the additional Medicare levy imposed under the Medicare Levy Act 1986. 
Of all senators on the opposition benches, I think Senator Evans has had a long interest in this issue. I well remember being pressed by Senator Evans at Senate estimates and other hearings about the concessional treatment that was available, particularly in the hospital area. I give credit to Senator Evans. It is very rare for me to give credit to anybody in this chamber on the other side—
—Particularly me.
—particularly Senator Evans, but I think it is fair to say that he took a longstanding interest in this particular issue and urged the government to take some action. I could make a cheap political point and wonder why, in 13 years in office, Labor did not take action, but I am not the sort of senator to make that point, Senator Evans.
—I urged the Labor Treasurer, too.
—I note that interjection. You will have that recorded in the Hansard. This issue has, I think, been very extensively debated in this chamber. I think the Labor Party went to an election with a policy and, given the political pressures, it was not possible in the end for Labor to sustain that policy. We of course had negotiations with the Democrats, who, I might say, put some views to us. In the end I think Senator Woodley and Senator Murray will probably be happy to say that their particular concerns have been accommodated by the changes that are in this bill and by the further amendments that have been brought forward. I do think, if I may say so, it is now time—and I very much welcome Senator Evans's comments that the Labor Party will not be opposing these amendments—to pass this bill. I think it is important that we get this bill through the parliament now to give certainty to people. I urge senators to allow the speedy passage of this important bill, a bill which I might say has had a very difficult birth but is now here before the chamber.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-05-10,"—I will make a reasonably lengthy contribution now rather than speaking at every point because I think that will hopefully cover the rest of the debate. Let me begin by also placing on record my appreciation of the contribution of Senator Evans. Although the discussions were held between the government and us, he was aware of those and, as much as I could tell him—which was not much—I did try to keep him informed of what was happening.
—We thought the discussions were confidential, Senator.
—They were confidential in terms of any detail, Senator Kemp, but, in terms of the broad scope of what was happening, I kept Senator Evans informed, simply because he has been very responsible in all of the debates on this issue. I also want to commend him for keeping on the record the idea of a Senate inquiry into this issue, because I think that was one of the things that prompted the government to finally agree to an independent inquiry. That might have been a catalyst along the way, so that was helpful. Let me also say that on the part of the government I believe they have acted responsibly in agreeing to the propositions we put to them. Let me outline in brief some of the agreements that we reached with the government.
I suppose I am only reiterating what Senator Kemp said, but I did want to underline the fact that we convinced the government that the cap of $17,000 on charities should be increased to $30,000 and that they should extend the start-up date for that cap to 1 April 2001. As I have said, one of the most critical things in all of this was that the government agreed to institute an independent inquiry into the whole definition and tax treatment of charities. We have yet to agree on the terms of reference and on the people for that inquiry, but I can inform the government that we have been working on this and I believe we will have some words ready for them this week. I also add that, as part of that, there is a particular problem with indigenous communities and indigenous service bodies. This problem is to do with the fact that, because of the cuts in government funding over a period of time to indigenous organisations, they have used the fringe benefits tax concession more than anyone else—they have been forced to do so. For example, Aboriginal medical services are able to fund the provision of doctors up to about $70,000—which I think this chamber would understand is way below what a doctor would expect, particularly in a remote area—so they have often doubled that in terms of using the fringe benefits tax concession. 
We need, as part of an inquiry, a particular emphasis on the needs of indigenous communities and indigenous organisations. The government has agreed that Dr Wooldridge and ATSIC will monitor that. I am not sure how that will be done, but I am also writing to Dr Wooldridge about some suggested terms of reference for that particular aspect of the inquiry. I have suggested to him that the Hall Chadwick study of Aboriginal medical services in the Northern Territory, which I believe was funded by the government, was a very good model that the government might be prepared to endorse for a wider overview of all indigenous organisations and that that would fulfil the agreement we have. In terms of the charity not-for-profit sector, the Democrats are very pleased that the government has agreed to the measures we brought before it and that these amendments will proceed to enable those measures to be put in place. My leader is going to cover the medical aspects, so I thank the chamber.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-05-10,"—I want to specifically address the section of the bill that relates to the hospital system. My colleague Senator Woodley has done an outstanding job in his negotiations with the charitable sector, making sure that their needs are met. This area falls within my portfolio. We have been concerned for some time about the way in which packaging was basically spiralling out of control. Obviously, something had to be done. It had been accepted by successive governments as a legitimate way of states meeting the needs of their hospital systems. I want to stress here that I believe the Commonwealth did not help by not funding hospitals adequately. The level of funding for our hospitals now is almost to the level where they cannot even upgrade essential equipment, and basic maintenance cannot be done. You can understand the states finding a mechanism and using it quite widely, but now it has got to the point where we are not talking just about doctors being packaged; we are also talking about nursing staff, and I understand that in some hospitals it is down to the groundsmen.
We had to look at this issue. However, we could not have looked at the issue and with just one stroke of the pen made the changes that the Commonwealth wanted to make. The Commonwealth, as I said, has to carry some responsibility for the fact that salary packaging has gone on year after year without any intervention. Yes, we had to look at the issue, and once we looked at what the states were doing the end result was a compensation package of $240.5 million over three years. We are now looking to government to give us some further undertakings on the process and the mechanism of how that division will be made.
The aim of the compensation is to ensure that salaries do not fall. Obviously, there will be some adjustments made by hospitals under the new arrangements with the lower cap. In some instances, hospitals, particularly the hospitals that are not yet using it fully, will probably decide to extend packaging out. That will help to balance, for example, the impact of their top surgeons being heavily packaged. That packaging now has to be brought back to a more reasonable level, with the money to compensate the doctor so she or he does not lose any real income. Over time, the states will obviously have to pick up the bill. This package is designed to soften that process so that there is no loss of income by the doctors.
As of this financial year, group certificates are required to include data on the value of fringe benefits being provided. Hospitals are required to provide group certificates to the ATO by 14 August this year. The total value of reported fringe benefits from group certificates will be representative of the total future FBT costs faced by hospitals. We actually have a mechanism already in place where we can track where FBT is being used and how extensively it is being used. This data could be used to distribute the compensation funding on a pro rata basis to the hospitals that are actually using it. 
Our main concern with the mechanism is that it should get the money through to the people who are now being packaged and it should be transparent so that all of us can see how it is working and where the money is going. As you can imagine, there are some real concerns in the medical community that state governments will somehow manage to absorb parts of it, that it will go back into that great black hole of state budgets and not be seen in full. I think it is essential that the government today put down more details of its processes and what it believes should be done so that the people affected by the FBT changes can be confident that the package of money will be equitably distributed and that they will not be losing any income at all and their salaries will stay at the current level. I am calling on the government now to give an explicit commitment that the mechanism for compensation will reassure us and the medical community that the stakeholders will receive their fair share and that we will not see any adverse impact on our public hospital system.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-05-10,"—I want to make a few remarks to respond to the comments of the minister and the Democrats and to put the Labor Party position on the record. I think it was important that we had that more general debate because of the history of this legislation and the changes that have occurred since its original introduction. Otherwise, I think people reading the second reading speeches might get completely the wrong impression of what we are passing here today. A lot has changed between then and now.
First of all, I would like to thank the minister and Senator Woodley for their kind remarks. I feel a bit out of sorts. I am much more used to being abused, and it is much more comfortable because you know where you stand. This is very unnerving. I knew when Senator Woodley made reference to me in his press release that it would cause me no end of grief with my colleagues. Thank you for that, Senator Woodley. I am not sure whether or not it was a calculated move to try to ensure Labor's support for the agreement, but I appreciate the remarks. Seriously, Senator Woodley and I have both had a long interest in this issue since we entered the parliament, and we both remarked on the old Productivity Commission report when it came down in 1995. I was one of those then urging the Labor government to do something about what was a potential explosion in these things. I have said that before. From that period on, we saw rapid growth in the use of the FBT concession. I think it is fair to say that it was a fairly small problem at that stage and it became a much bigger problem. That is why we have supported the government's attempt to put some accountability and transparency into the system, to put a cap on and to have proper reporting. The major flaw in what has occurred is the way it has been done. People got a wink and a nod from the tax office and thought that, provided they did not package more than 30 per cent, the tax office would not go through their books with too fine a toothcomb and that, if they went over that, they were fair game.
That is not a proper way to implement public policy. We needed transparency in the regulations and guidelines for not-for-profit and charitable organisations and anybody else eligible for concession. We did not have that. The key issue in this debate was that proper regulation. A whole range of people did not take advantage of some of the measures they could have taken advantage of, because it was not clear to them that it was legal or appropriate. Others quite frankly abused the opportunity by going through at a million miles an hour with all guns blazing to take full advantage of what was seen as a bit of a loophole. We had, therefore, an inconsistent application across the industry and a lot of concern from many people about whether they were doing something that was legally and morally appropriate. Organisations had real debates about that and, because of the squeeze on funding from both Commonwealth and state sources and because of the difficulties of fundraising, those were very difficult debates for a lot of organisations. 
The key thing to come out of this is that we get some accountability and transparency, a cap and a proper regulation in the system. What has been lacking is proper information about what the appropriate cap is. While I accept that the Labor Party have moved from this position, since about August last year we argued for a full public inquiry. We are not able to get good hard information about the extent of the use of the FBT concession and the impact of the FBT concession's capping or removal on those organisations. There is not a lot of hard data around. There is not a lot of evidence to support the argument as to the various proposed caps. For instance, the government has moved from a $17,000 cap to a $30,000 cap on not-for-profit organisations. What is the justification for $17,000 versus $30,000? The point is that no-one really knows. I do not even think we are sure about what the impact of the Commonwealth's revenue will be as a result of these changes.
We always argued from the first principle of having an inquiry, which would establish the costs, the benefits, the current practice and the impact of various measures. That has not happened, and we are now dealing with the legislation without that proper information. That is just the way it has evolved. That is politics. We would have preferred that way; we argued for that approach. That has not occurred. We accept that the Democrats and the government came to an arrangement based on the need for the government to get on with the legislation, their need to progress, and the Democrats and others—like the Labor Party—were looking to protect the not-for-profit sector from what would have been quite adverse effects from the original proposition. We accepted that, after some evidence during the GST inquiry, there would be serious adverse effects for the not-for-profit and charitable sector as a result of the original proposition, and we accepted that we did need to move and that the Labor Party needed to change their policy and look at ways of protecting those organisations from adverse impacts.
It is not our preferred route, and we were not party to the final arrangement between the government and the Democrats. But I have, as Senator Woodley would acknowledge, tried to work with Senator Woodley to get a better outcome. I appreciate his cooperation, although I do want to put on the record that he did not breach any government confidentiality, despite my working hard on him. One of the key things that comes out of this is the delay until next year. That is important, because the not-for-profit sector were in a position of not knowing what was going to occur, and it would have been a complete shambles. A whole range of people who were salary packaged in both the public system and the not-for-profit system were going to have to have their whole salary arrangements renegotiated in a very short time and without proper information. It would have been very stressful for a lot of people, stressful on organisations and very poor industrial relations. So the delay is important. The one good argument against the inquiry, given the lateness of the debate, is that this now at least gives people almost a full year to plan for the changes. We would have preferred the inquiry route. We argued for it. We accept that is not going to occur.
I do acknowledge that the amendments moved today and the arrangement between the government and the Democrats have produced a better outcome for the not-for-profit sector. Whether it is the best public policy is the key issue, and I am not trying to be overcritical or make a political point. But, because we did not have the inquiry and because we did not have the full information, no-one knows the full public policy implications of this. That is, therefore, a bad public policy outcome. It would have been better to do it the other way around, but I do accept that this deal provides a much better outcome for charities and the not-for-profit sector. That is obvious. It takes the pressure off and gives them transparent and accountable guidelines for dealing with the concession.
I want to note that, with the arrangements for public hospitals, I share some of the concerns that Senator Lees just raised. I was a bit concerned when she raised them, because she signed up to the deal, and she seemed to be raising the very questions that I had about how it is all going to work. Given that the arrangements for the FBT concession's use in public hospitals has varied from state to state and hospital to hospital, we do need to understand—I am not clear in my own mind—how this compensation package is to be administered. I, like her, want to ensure that it does get through to the intended recipients and that it is used for the purposes identified—that is, to allow them to continue to employ good quality staff and to compete with other providers. I note that none of this money is for new services. This is purely a compensation package, partial compensation for the effect that the FBT concession proposal has on public hospitals. In no way can it be seen as adding to the provision of public health services in the country. It will go a long way towards alleviating the impact that otherwise would have occurred in reducing their capacity to provide services. I do think it is incumbent upon the government to provide some detail today as to how that is to work or at least some indication of what arrangements are in place to negotiate with the states about implementation. I look forward to the Assistant Treasurer's contribution on that. 
Senator Woodley has mentioned that, as part of the arrangements between the government and the Democrats, there are two inquiries to be held. The first is dealing with the question of indigenous health organisations and the impact on them. I am very pleased that that issue has been identified. I have had a lot of representations from indigenous health organisations. I have recently visited the Kimberley since the announcement and again those organisations spoke to me about the particular problems they have in that regard. So I look forward to that being a positive inquiry. I also hope that we get some progress on that front well before 1 April next year when implementation commences, otherwise it will mean nothing. I am sure Senator Woodley's experience in making such arrangements will ensure that these arrangements are watertight in terms of the impact of the inquiry.
The second proposed inquiry will be into the definition of charities. I just make the point that we wanted a much broader inquiry and we wanted to look at the impact of the FBT on the charitable sector as part of that inquiry. That clearly now will not happen. In effect, what we are doing now is offering our solution to that problem in this legislation. Nevertheless, the definitions of charities and not-for-profit organisations and the taxation treatment of those are important issues. This government has gradually drawn the charitable and not-for-profit sector into the taxation net. I think that has had a range of adverse consequences for them. We need to examine how we treat charitable and not-for-profit organisations in terms of taxation and other arrangements. 
It is a debate we need to have, particularly with the expansion of schemes like Job Network and the increasing role of not-for-profit organisations in providing what were formerly government and company provided services. There is a real question about what the appropriate roles of charitable and not-for-profit services in this country are, how they are funded and how they are taxed. Those issues go quite a way beyond what is proposed by the inquiry into the definition of charities and not-for-profit organisations. Nevertheless, I hope that makes a contribution to that debate and is a first step in that debate. 
I know there is some anxiety on the part of some in the charitable and not-for-profit sector about opening up those issues, but they do need to be opened up. We have seen quite a change in the way the charitable and not-for-profit sector operate in this country, the services they provide and how they fund themselves. We need to have a public policy debate on what their appropriate role is, what their relationship to government is, and how we fund and tax those organisations. I for one constantly question some of the charitable and not-for-profit organisations about what they do differently from the for-profit sector in some of the service areas, because it is often claimed that they provide a qualitative difference. It is important that we examine what those differences are, how we value them and therefore how we structure regimes that encourage or promote their participation in servicing the needs of our community.  
I am not opposed to that inquiry although I am a bit concerned that the detail is yet to come and, a few weeks on, we still have not had an announcement. I hope it is not something that drops off the agenda as the government basically gets its legislation through today. Maybe its commitment to, or enthusiasm for, the inquiry might wane if it is not held up to the mark, but I am sure Senator Woodley will keep the pressure on and make sure that the inquiry occurs. As I say, I would have preferred a broader scope but, as far as it goes, it is important that the inquiry does occur. I hope that adds to the debate.
I do not intend to oppose any of the amendments or the arrangements entered into between the government and the Democrats for changes to the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000. We accept the arrangement entered into, we accept it is a better package than was originally proposed, so we will not be opposing any of the measures. I do agree with the Treasurer in the sense that it is time for this matter to be brought to a head and it is time to allow the sector to have some certainty about where we go from here. ",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-05-10,"—From the Democrats' perspective, three senators with specific responsibilities have been involved in this debate on the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits) Bill 2000: the first is Senator Woodley, who has a broad remit for the churches and charitable sector; the next is Senator Lees as leader and health spokesperson; and I am the third, and I have responsibility for tax policy in the broadest sense. But this issue captured the attention of the entire Democrat party room. That happened because the churches, charities, not-for-profit and community sector is so broad and has such a wide range of organisations; huge numbers of employees, hundreds of thousands; and billions of dollars in assets—most of which are undervalued—that, very frequently, we forget just how large that sector is in Australian social and economic life. I suspect that the Labor Party had the same broad interest in it as a result. The very breadth and depth of that sector is now attracting increased policy attention because of its size and nature.
I want to deal with the inquiries issue first. We have been lobbying the government—at times, barracking the government—for two inquiries: one into definitions and one into the sector as a whole. At the time we first discussed and raised that idea with senior representatives of the sector—churches, charities and not-for-profit organisations—they reacted very favourably. They subsequently advised the Labor Party of our views and the sector's views, and the Labor Party came on board. The Labor Party's interest in this matter, as expressed very effectively by Senator Evans, has been very helpful because the need for such an inquiry is a very important one in terms of broad public policy needs.
The government have now come on board with the first stage of the inquiry, not yet with the detail, but they have not come on board with the second stage. Let me tell you what I mean by that. The first stage, as we heard earlier today, refers to the need to review the definitions. The definitions in tax law affect who falls inside and outside various tax concessions and exemptions. Therefore, it is a matter of acute self-interest by those affected to have those matters properly assessed and properly understood. The public benevolent institutions, charities, churches and so on very much rely on English historical law and case law which is several centuries old. Those definitions no longer fit modern society and the scope of non-government organisations—NGOs—such as community organisations, charitable organisations and church organisations.
—Too narrow or too broad? 
—That is why we want it to be reviewed by an independent body. I take the interjection: the minister said, `Too narrow and too broad.' 
—Or too broad.
—That is the concern. There are those who fall outside right now who want to get inside for obvious reasons—that is, because tax concessions and benefits will be to their advantage—and there are those who are inside who are afraid that a definitional inquiry would end up with them being put outside. The fact is that some deserve to be in and some certainly deserve to be out, but we want the principles which allow a large number of organisations and a large number of people to get tax concessions and incentives to be clearly established, because it is a cost to the taxpayer and it is a cost to the economy. It is not just a benefit in terms of the services they provide.  
The Democrats, the senior representatives of those sectors, the Labor Party and now the government all accept that that definitional inquiry should be adopted. However, there is a broader need. Only recently—in fact, I think it was last year—the government, as a result of negotiations with us over the tax reform program, commissioned a Charities Consultative Committee in the tax office. That committee has opened up a great deal more understanding in the tax office as to the specific needs, the specific problems and the specific prospects for a separate view that should be taken for not-for-profits, church, charitable and community organisations as a whole.
Members of this chamber know—but it is probably not necessarily widely understood in the community—that the tax office run certain lines, certain organisational structures, whereby they examine the taxpayers within those sectors. For example, there is small business and large business, those sorts of sectors. Our instinct is that it will be necessary in due course to establish such a line or such a specialisation for the not-for-profit sector. Therefore, we argue that it is necessary to have a Ralph type review for that sector which would encompass the whole range of interaction with the tax system—how they interact with the indirect tax system, the income tax system, FBT and PAYE; the whole basis of the evaluation and the throughput of moneys within that sector; and what view should be taken in public policy terms of how they should be managed.
We have argued very strongly with the Treasurer to pursue that second broader in-quiry. Senator Evans indicated that he, too, on behalf of the Labor Party, has that view. The government have not yet committed themselves to that view. However, the Treasurer has not expressed opposition; he has merely said that he needs more time to think it through. Watching his sometimes weary face, I think he probably has enough on his plate right now without that longer term prospect. I am deliberately putting these points to you, Assistant Treasurer, because I think it should be a longer term objective of the government; it is not something that needs to be resolved tomorrow. It could take a year or more, as did the Ralph review, but it is certainly something that needs to be addressed. The definitional inquiry, however, does need to be resolved and dealt with urgently. That is enough from me on the inquiries side.
I will move on to the tax policy that we are faced with here. Some of this FBT discussion makes people's eyes glaze over, but it really is about the fact that members of the church, charitable and not-for-profit sector have for some time been accorded tax concessions and benefits which are not available to the private sector and the community as a whole. If you decide in those circumstances to discriminate in favour of a sector, it needs to be for good and sound public policy reasons. Those good and sound public policy reasons have, frankly, been the recognition that tax benefits such as an FBT concession will allow those organisations to deliver far better services at a lower cost than they otherwise could. But we should clearly understand that it does result in an inequality between ordinary private sector workers and workers in this sector. Over some time, in the discussion on policy and in the development of a view on this, I pulled out an indicative view as to what this means in terms of the tax rate which somebody in the private sector might have to carry and the tax rate which somebody in the charitable sector might have to carry when their gross salary is the same.
However, before doing so, I should emphasise that the FBT cap deals with those elements of salary packaging which have to be taken into account; there are many exempt items which fall outside of that. In salary packaging, you might, for instance, want to give somebody the advantage of using a computer. That would be worth $2,000 a year. In my money, I always talk about that being after tax; you would have to earn $4,000 to deliver that. You might have a mobile telephone, which would be worth $2,000 a year; newspapers, which would be worth $500 a year; professional journals, $500 a year; office support systems, $500 a year; frequent flier possibilities of $200 a year; an electronic diary of $300 a year. You can bang that very quickly up to $6,000. I think, by and large, our FBT system is quite generous. 
At the outset, when the Democrats heard the government's public policy intention, we said, `That's right, there shouldn't be an open-ended FBT exemption; any tax concession should be appropriately capped or limited.' I think that is the very remark Senator Evans was making on behalf of the Labor Party—that, in public policy terms, there need to be boundaries and limits on these things. But I will give you an idea of what I worked out as a broad indication. On a $70,000 salary, the effective tax rate of somebody in the private sector could work out at 26.3 per cent, and in the charitable sector it could work out at 16.7 per cent—in other words, a 10 per cent advantage. We say, for good public policy reasons, that kind of advantage can be justified. But we should recognise that it does mean that a private sector person does not enjoy the same tax concessions, the same tax benefits, as somebody working in the charitable sector.
I think the cap of $17,000 for the hospitals sector and the $30,000 cap for the charitable sector end up as being generous. That is my personal opinion. I think the addition of the extra elements negotiated by the Democrats with the government, such as the remote housing concession, do contribute materially to making sure that needs are looked after where they need to be applied.
Having said that, we must therefore recognise that, for an ordinary worker in charities, churches or hospitals, at an ordinary worker's salary, a cap of $17,000 grossed up value or $30,000 grossed up value is a great deal of money. For people on much higher salaries it will result in a tightening up of the tax system. With the exception of those who are needed particularly in rural and remote areas of Australia, who need to be of a very high standard and, therefore, to be well paid, by and large, our belief is that the package we have negotiated with the government will deliver the appropriate policy outcomes whilst still taking into account the very real need for a high standard of service from those organisations. As a result, most of the sector has been fully supportive of what has been negotiated by the government. In closing, I would like to indicate that Democrats sheet 1777 is being withdrawn and therefore should be disregarded on the running sheet.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-05-10,"—Quite a wide range of issues has been raised. I listened very carefully to what was said by Senator Woodley, Senator Murray, Senator Evans and Senator Lees. Very briefly, in relation to one of the matters raised by Senator Lees and noted by Senator Evans, to assist with the transition of the new FBT arrangements, the government will provide grants to public and not-for-profit hospitals of $88 million in 2000-01, some $80.5 million in 2001-02 and $72 million in 2002-03.
There were some issues raised as to how these grants would be allocated. Let me just state clearly that it is the intention of the government that these grants will get through to those hospitals which are affected by the cap. While the implementation details are still to be worked through, transitional assistance will be pro rataed on the basis of the financial impact of the FBT arrangements on public and not-for-profit hospitals. I think the intention of us all is at one here, if I have read the debate correctly. As I have said, the transitional arrangements and the implementation details are being worked out, but I hope that the comments I have made have given some comfort to those who raised this issue in the debate.
There were some discussions on the inquiry from Senator Evans, Senator Woodley and, indeed, Senator Murray—who, again, has had a longstanding interest in this issue and, I might say, along with his colleague, has made a constructive contribution to the debate. We may have had our differences on this bill but, of course, at the end of the day we have to settle arrangements. That is what has been done. I do not propose to go over those debates. But the issue of the nature of the inquiry was raised. I think that probably the best thing I can do is just to read into the Hansard the comments from the Treasurer's press release on this. It states: 
The Government has also agreed to the establishment of an independent inquiry into definitional issues relating to charities, churches and not-for-profit organisations. The intention will be for the inquiry to be completed by the end of this year. The Government will consult further with the Australian Democrats on the terms of reference for the inquiry.
That is a direct quote from the Treasurer's press release, and I think that probably gives a high degree of comfort to the Democrats.
We note Senator Murray's comments that the Treasurer has been working hard. I can only say that that is absolutely correct. Nonetheless, the Treasurer has great capacity for work, and I am sure that he will turn his mind to some of those other issues as soon as he is able. That probably covers the substance of the issues that were raised. This has been a constructive debate. My understanding is that the Democrats are now withdrawing all their amendments. Am I correct in saying that?
—That is correct.
—I think the only amendments now before the parliament are those which are being moved by the government. We have to deal with these current amendments which are before the chair, but it seems to me that we may be able to speed the journey if I move all the other government proposals for amendments at the one time. If people are agreeable to that, I will proceed on that course. Perhaps we can deal with those amendments before the chair and then decide the future course of the debate.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-05-10,"—I have one quick question before we move to the vote on that. Minister, thank you for your explanatory comments about the mechanism to deliver the $240 million compensation. One of the concerns we had was that that money would hopefully flow through to the people whose salary packages are being affected by the cap that we are imposing and the other arrangements we are making rather than simply pocketed either by the state or the hospital concerned. Can you give us some comment on that?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-05-10,"—Correct me if I am wrong, but the general argument was that the hospital was being affected. I think your argument is that the savings have been appropriated by the hospital. We will look at all the issues, but the intention is to make sure that it gets through to the hospitals. The hospitals, as the employer, will then have to make a decision as to what in fact then occurs. This is a debate which I have entered into briefly, left and come back to, but my understanding is that the primary concern of the Democrats was that the original proposals meant that the hospitals who had appropriated the savings, by your argument, would lose them. I do not know if that gives you total comfort, but I am aware of this issue. In fact, I raised this with my advisers, and it is something which has clearly turned your mind as well. We will note your comments but, without further study, I am a bit loath to go further in this debate than I have already.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-05-10,"—I have one question I want to ask the minister, and I thought I might as well do it now, with your indulgence, Mr Temporary Chairman. Minister, can you place on the record the impact of the final arrangements in terms of police officer remote housing? As you know, that has been one of the issues of concern in terms of the FBT treatment of police officer remote housing, particularly in states like my own of Western Australia where officers are required to live in police premises in remote communities and are obviously on call 24 hours a day—it is pretty much a round the clock job. There has been a great deal of concern about their treatment.
I think I understand the outcome of the arrangements in terms of that, but it has been an issue of concern for a number of people. Because of the arrangements made in terms of remote housing, I just want to be clear on the impact on police officers required to reside in police quarters in remote communities, whether this 100 kilometres from a city or town of 130,000 people is the requirement in terms of being exempt or not. So I would appreciate your putting on the record the government's understanding of the FBT treatment of police officer remote housing accommodation.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-05-10,"—Thank you, Senator, for your remarks. I have had that discussion with the relevant police associations that have been very active around Parliament House, and I would not be breaching any confidence if I suggested that I was one of a great number of senators who were visited. I gave them a proposal, which they said they accepted but wanted to look very closely at the detail. The bill gives an exemption if a housing benefit is provided by police services in a place at least 100 kilometres from a town of 130,000 or more people. This, we believe, enhances the delivery of police services to communities in regional Australia.
It is actually a provision which applies on the same basis as the exemption for FBT housing that this bill provides for public and not-for-profit hospitals and charities. So it is the same test for the police which applies to those other bodies. We have listened to the concerns which they have raised. They raised with us a number of other issues, but I think this is the fairest way to deal with them. One could always argue that you should go further—and I am sure that the relevant associations may well argue that—but this was the proposal that the government decided to move forward on and discussed with the relevant police associations. I think it is a good outcome. I think it should be welcomed by the police. It deals with a problem which we all became aware of. I welcome the support which my colleague Senator Evans has given.
With the permission of the chamber, I propose to move all the remaining government requests—that is, requests (3), (6) and (9) on sheet DT215, requests (1) to (9) on sheet DG216 and request (1) on sheet DT212. My understanding is that this covers all the requests that the government is moving. Perhaps we can now ensure that these are passed through the Senate and that the certainty which we all hope to deliver to the relevant associations can now be delivered.
 (Senator Chapman)—Is leave granted for those requests to be moved together?
Leave granted.

(3)	Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (lines 8 to 14), omit step 3, substitute:
Step 3 If step 2 does not apply in respect of one or more employees of the employer:
(a)	reduce the individual grossed-up non-exempt amount for each such employee for the year of tax beginning on 1 April 2000 to zero; and
(b)	reduce the individual grossed-up non-exempt amount for each such employee for a later year of tax by $30,000, but not below zero.
(6)	Schedule 1, item 16, page 16 (lines 9 to 27), omit steps 2, 3, 4 and 5, substitute:
Step 2. Reduce the individual grossed-up non-rebatable amount for each employee of the employer:
(a)	to zero for the year of tax beginning on 1 April 2000; and
(b)	by $30,000, but not below zero, for a later year of tax.
Note: Paragraph (a) means the employer's aggregate non-rebatable amount for the year of tax beginning on 1 April 2000 will be nil.
Step 3. Add up the results of step 2 for all the employer's employees.
Step 4. Multiply the sum from step 3 by the FBT rate. The result is the employer's aggregate non-rebatable amount for the year of tax.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-05-10,"—There was one question I meant to ask the minister. The FBT changes for charities and churches will commence from 1 April 2001. But the FBT changes for hospitals, both public and not for profit, commenced on 1 April 2000. My office and probably other senators' offices, and perhaps your office, have been receiving inquiries from people affected by the legislation as to exactly how the new system will work. Minister, is there any form of information campaign or release of material, particularly to the state bureaucracies, to ensure that the actual message as to how this will work will get out to the affected people in a form which is complete and very clear? Obviously when there is any change the people affected do get concerned.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-05-10,"—I have been advised that a campaign is being run by the ATO about changes to the FBT, and seminars will be run throughout Australia to assist people to become aware of what these changes mean. From the government's point of view, it is clearly important that people understand what we have done. It is clearly important to the tax office that people can comply in a way which minimises their work but meets the terms of the law. So I think it is in everybody's interests that people are properly informed. Clearly the ATO will monitor this carefully to ensure that the information is getting out. If it becomes apparent that people are still not sure, we would obviously look at further steps which could be taken. You raise a valid point. I think there will be a lot of requests for the EM and the Hansards in which we have debated this legislation. I think we can all help to ensure that people are appropriately informed. I think this is an outcome which people will generally welcome. You and Senator Evans and I knew that concerns were being expressed about the original proposal. I think we are all aware of those. We may differ on how we all react to that, but, as I said earlier in this debate, in the end you have to reach a compromise and I think this has been reached. I hope that gives you the assurances you are seeking. ",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

"Senator TIERNEY,",LP,2000-05-10,"—Today I rise to speak on matters relating to regional Australia and the Hunter Valley in particular. Senator Calvert, who is present in the chamber, actually gave me the whips' Blue Hills award at the end of last year for speaking so frequently on this issue, but it is certainly a story that needs to be told because there are quite a lot of misconceptions out there in regional Australia about what is happening in the Hunter Valley and, in particular, what has happened since the downsizing of BHP. For example, people think there is no steel industry in Newcastle anymore, and I want to correct that impression.
The main thing I want to talk about is the economic miracle that is occurring in the Hunter Valley. Since the downsizing of BHP, there has been considerable growth in employment. Each month since BHP shut its steel making division, employment in the Hunter Valley has continued to rise and unemployment has continued to fall. One of the reasons for that is that the whole nature of the Hunter Valley economy is changing quite dramatically. Newcastle has had the image of a smokestack town for a very long period of time, and that is actually embedded in the national psyche to the point that some people cannot think of it as anything else. As a matter of fact, my mother-in-law, who has been coming to Newcastle for many years—she used to spend her holidays in Mayfield in the 1930s—still has this image of a smokestack town because that is how it was and that is what is embedded in her mind. A lot of people who have travelled over the years through Newcastle have the same view, but there is a huge change.
As I drive into Newcastle to my office each day, I pass BHP. The first thing I notice is the clear skies over Newcastle because steel smelting, which is the filthy end of the steel making business, has gone. We still bring steel billets up from South Australia and we continue to roll steel. BHP has had a long history in Newcastle; it has had a great history. It also has, through its spin-off steel divisions, a great future. Often people do not understand the amount of steel that is still produced, rolled and goes out the gate in Newcastle. For example, a lot of people are unaware that Smorgon, the old Comsteel, has an arc furnace in Newcastle. It still produces 400,000 tonnes of steel a year from raw material, and at the BHP site 1½ million tonnes of steel is still rolled from those billets that come up from South Australia into rod, bar, wire and tube, and they still go out the gate, serving all the downstream steel industries in the region. 
Over at BHP, and at its new associated company that it is spinning off, they are still employing 1,800 people in the production of steel. I want to make that point very clear because it is still a city that produces steel. What is happening is an expansion of a vast array of other industries. Even at the point where BHP were about to shut down, they were only employing one per cent of the Hunter Valley economy. BHP were employing 2,600 people, and the work force in the Hunter Valley is now up to 246,000. So let us get that in the scale which it deserves: BHP, in their final days in Newcastle, were only a very small part of the economy. They are still a part of the economy and are still producing steel, but they are only a part of a very diverse and wide-ranging economy, and those things are continuing.
Let us have a look at the big employers in the Hunter Valley at the moment. First prize goes to the Hunter area health service—it is the biggest employer; the second biggest employer is the University of Newcastle; and a huge industry in that area is the aerospace industry based at Williamtown. It not only employs thousands of people to support the biggest fighter base in Australia—with the FA18s located there—but also employs a range of spin-off surrounding industries that support the aerospace industry. For example, we are creating up there the lead-in fighters—they are actually being built at Williamtown. There are plans to attract a whole range of other aerospace industries. Of course, beyond that, there are magnificent tourist facilities in the Hunter Valley, which are creating a larger and larger throughput of people who come to that beautiful region for their holidays. We have the Barrington Tops, the Blue Water Wonderland at Port Stephens, Lake Macquarie, Historic Newcastle, Historic Maitland and the surrounding areas. That industry is absolutely booming.
There is a lot of confidence in the town. That confidence was not shaken a great deal even when BHP shut. When BHP announced its downsizing, that created a drop in confidence for a few months, but that confidence came back incredibly quickly. The event that brought that back was Newcastle's great win in 1997 in the football when the Knights took out the premiership for the first time. This had an amazing effect on the whole city. People there support the Knights and they really showed that on the day of the premiership when the team was leaving: tens of thousands of fans lined the streets and roads leading out of Newcastle to cheer them on. When the team came back, of course, there were even more people there. There was a civic parade. There was enormous pride in the city at that time. We had been tracking consumer and business confidence when BHP announced its downsizing, and for three months it fell and kept dropping until we won that football game. The interesting thing that happened economically was that, as soon as we won the game, confidence jumped right back to where it had been before BHP announced its downsizing, and it has stayed above that level and continued to climb ever since.
We now have a place with enormous confidence. It has record high employment. We have a drop in unemployment month by month. The figures for the March quarter show that there is a 13.1 per cent increase in the work force over the previous period last year. There are 262,000 people working in the Hunter Valley in a wide variety of industries. Job growth is very strong. The new jobs are concentrated not in the manufacturing area but in the service sector. There has been a growth in both full-time and part-time jobs. There are rising rates of female employment, and people who were not previously looking for work are now entering the work force.
Newcastle and the Hunter are on the cutting edge of what is happening to change employment in this country. It is an excellent case study of how we are moving from the smokestack age to the information and service age, and the Newcastle and Hunter economy is at the forefront and is reflecting that. The federal government has given a lot of assistance in the transition process that is taking place at this time. The Prime Minister came to Newcastle in 1997 and it showed the maturity of the city that, during his time there, there was not one protest, not one banner. He was welcomed to the city with a major civic reception. He stayed for two days, listened to what the region wanted and then provided for it through the Hunter Structural Adjustment Package. He also set up a Prime Minister's task force to specifically advise him on the needs of the Hunter. Over the 2½ years since that visit, we have been rolling out quite a number of projects which are aiming to build up the infrastructure of the Hunter Valley.  
Unlike the state Labor government, what we are doing federally is actually creating, through the public sector, basic infrastructure which private businesses can then leverage off and create new businesses and new jobs. That is happening quite dramatically. We have set up projects like the Maitland Transport Hub. We put $1½ million into that transport hub, and what we have seen happen since then is that companies like Daimler Chrysler, the old Mercedes-Benz, have set up their trucking operation in the area and that Blue Ribbon Coaches have set up their centralised operations there. We are seeing around that research park, since we delivered that money two years ago, a whole lot of related industries attracted there.
We also funded the Hunter water pipeline. With half a million dollars of investment from the federal government, they were able to get a loan of $10 million. Within six months they had actually constructed that pipeline that links in to every vineyard in the Hunter Valley. What this will now do for the Hunter, which produces some of the best wines in Australia, is to give it a secure water supply into every vineyard. That will increase grape yield and increase production by an expansion of the vineyards. This will then kick on to an expansion in the wineries, the restaurants, the resorts and other economic activity—including, increasingly, residential activity in the beautiful Pokolbin area near Cessnock. That sort of growth, with just a small amount of public money, leverages an enormous amount of economic activity.
We have done that through the whole program. We had Joe Hockey, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, come up two weeks ago to relaunch the Newcastle Stock Exchange. This was created in the 1930s and shut in the early 1980s. What we have now done, with the new type of information economy that we have developing in Australia, is to reopen a regional stock exchange which will actually aggregate very small amounts of money into investment pools which will then be spent in regional Australia. This is a landmark stock exchange. It is much cheaper to list there than it is through Sydney, and we think this will attract regional funds from right around Australia and will create regional investment right around Australia as a result.
Small businesses have been part of this operation as well. It is not just big business. Small businesses are the hope of the future and, through these projects, we have stimulated quite a lot of small business. Another amount of funding we gave was $500,000 to the business incubator in Lake Macquarie. As people come in, they operate a very small business in its early stages and they get the support of having an office, fax, phone and such facilities. They get mentoring advice from experienced business people for the first year. The research shows that, instead of 70 per cent of new businesses failing, when you have business incubators supporting them 70 per cent of them succeed. The research also shows that those people who do start in those businesses each go on to employ six other people.
We have an enormous amount of economic activity developing in the Hunter Valley, and that is growing and expanding, particularly through new big businesses which are actually expanding within the Hunter region and particularly in the services area. One of the best examples of that is Impulse Airlines, run by local businessman Jerry McGowan, who has now moved through to creating a national network of airlines in competition with Qantas and Ansett. You all remember the case of Compass, which tried to take on Qantas and Ansett and failed. Impulse is trying the same thing but in a very different way. It is an existing airline that is expanding, and that is one very good reason why it will succeed. The second reason is that we are in a very different regulatory climate under this government. We have a situation now where, through the ACCC, we are very confident that they will have a much better show of developing. Ansett and Qantas are responding by dropping fares. They are increasing their services, and jets are coming into the area. This is great for regional Australia. 
What I have outlined today is quite a lot of developing economic activities. We have moved from the smokestack age through to an information service economy. The federal government has put enormous resources into supporting this. I urge this parliament, given the great kick-off we have had over the last three years, that this continue. With strategic, targeted, public investment we can leverage an enormous amount of private investment, particularly in regional and rural Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Regional Australia: Hunter Valley</title>,Matters of Public Interest,3,1

"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-05-10,"—Madam President, I have a supplementary answer to the question asked of me by Senator Brown yesterday, and I seek leave to have that incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Questions on notice asked by Senator Brown of Senator Herron yesterday
Why has the Government turned down the Tasmanian Government's request for an opt-out clause in the gene technology bill?
There are a range of legal risks associated with an explicit opt-out in the Commonwealth legislation. These include constitutional risks, risks in terms of Australia's international obligations and risks regarding national consistency. Recognising these legal risks, the Commonwealth has not adopted a policy of an explicit opt-out in the Commonwealth legislation.
Why has the Government not responded to requests from the Tasmanian Minister for Agriculture, Mr Llewellyn, that there be no further field trials in Tasmania in the near future?
There is currently no legislation in Australia that prohibits the growing of genetically modified field trials: neither Tasmanian State legislation (which the Tasmanian Government could have developed at any time over the past 10 years if it wished) or Commonwealth legislation. 
I note that this is why Mr Llewellyn's own Department is able to auspice field trials of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in Tasmania, in collaboration with Glaxo Wellcome Australia Ltd.
The Commonwealth is, however, actively engaged in the development of a national regulatory system for GMOs, which would prohibit all GMOs unless a license has been issued by an independent regulator, based on an assessment of the risk.
If Tasmania is concerned about the risks with GMOs, I would urge the Tasmanian Government to be a party to this rigorous regulation, which will be fully operational by 3 January 2001.
Thirdly, why is the location of the genetically engineered crops in Tasmania and elsewhere not made available?
The location of field trials in Tasmania and elsewhere, down to the level of identifying the local government area, is information that is made available to local and State Governments and to any interested member of the Australian community on two separate occasions for each and every field trial. In fact this information is made available on two separate occasions during the approval process.
There are issues of commercial confidentiality which precludes further information beyond this. We are, however, addressing this under the new regulatory system, which is based on a policy of the release of all information unless a case, based on strict criteria, can be made for withholding it. This highlights the need to have the new regulatory system introduced as soon as possible.
Finally, will the Government emulate New Zealand in establishing a Royal Commission to look into this matter?
No. The focus of the Commonwealth Government's efforts is on the introduction of the new GMO regulatory system. This has been developed through extensive consultation, and with the highest level of input and cooperation with all State and Territory Government representatives.
We believe that this regulation represents international best practice in the regulation of GMOs.
Supplementary questions
I ask further specifically about the failure of the Minister to respond to his Tasmanian counterpart's request that there be no further field trials at this stage - a moratorium on field trials.
The Government as a whole has taken the decision that a moratorium on GMOs is not warranted. Genetically modified products in Australia are extensively controlled by existing regulators including the National Registration Authority (for agricultural and veterinary chemicals), the Therapeutic Goods Administration (for medicines), the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (for food) and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (for imports).
All of these systems draw on the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC) for advice on biosafety matters. In the light of the effectiveness and rigour of these bodies, a moratorium is not supported by this Government. Rather, what we need is the strong new regulatory system the Government will introduce shortly
Is the Government going to consider the New Zealand option - that is, while their royal commission takes place, there is a 12 month voluntary moratorium on further crops and experimentation?
My earlier responses on moratoriums in this country refer.
Finally, in view of the fact that there is not a Royal Commission in Australia, would the Government facilitate by mutual convenience, if it is so, the Royal Commission in New Zealand, headed by former Chief Justice Sir Thomas Eichelbaum, to sit in Australia and take evidence?
The purpose of the New Zealand Royal Commission is to recommend changes to New Zealand's current legislative, regulatory, policy or institutional arrangements for addressing genetic modification technologies and products in New Zealand.
The New Zealand Government has not asked for Australian assistance in the conduct of their inquiry and I have no reason to anticipate such a request.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Genetically Modified Crops: Tasmanian Legislation</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1

REPORT 375 ANNUAL REPORT 1998-1999
Madam President, on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the Committee's Report No. 375—Annual Report 1998-1999.
Madam President, under the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 (PAAC Act), the JCPAA is required to prepare a report on the performance of its duties during the year. I will briefly discuss the Committee's highlights of the year. 
This financial year saw the consolidation of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit's role as the Audit Committee of the Parliament with its new responsibilities under the Auditor-General Act, 1997 coming into effect on 1 January 1998.
The Committee has long supported the concept of the Auditor-General being an independent officer of the Parliament. In 1996 it tabled a report entitled Guarding the Independence of the Auditor-General which recommended legislative guarantees of audit independence for the Auditor-General and an extension of the Auditor's mandate to include performance audits of Government Business Enterprises. The report also recommended an enhanced role for the Committee in the appointment of the Auditor-General and Independent Auditor and in determining the level of appropriations for the Australian National Audit Office. The Committee's recommendations were incorporated into the present legislation.
On 4 February 1999 the Committee exercised its review power to approve the appointment of an Independent Auditor for the Commonwealth by holding a public hearing to consider the suitability of the Government's nominee for the position. By means of this approval process the Committee sought assurances that the nominee was suitably qualified for the position, whether there was any existing or potential conflict of interest, the extent of the nominee's experience with audits of Commonwealth agencies, and of the resources available to undertake such audits. After examining the nominee, Mr Michael Coleman of the accounting firm KPMG, the Committee affirmed its approval of the appointment.
The Committee also considered the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office by means of a slightly revised process. The Committee sought and obtained the agreement of the Minister for Finance and Administration to table its Report on the draft estimates before the Budget was brought down on 11 May 1999.
Inquiry Highlights
Committee reports tabled during the 1998-99 financial year included those on the New Submarines Project of the Department of Defence, on Asset Management by Commonwealth Agencies and on Australian Government Procurement. In addition two review reports of hearings on Auditor-General Reports for the second and third Quarters of 1997-98 were tabled.
The Committee was invited to carry out an inspection of one of the Collins Class Submarines by the Managing Director of the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC) Mr Hans Ohff. The inspection took place on 28 April 1999. 
In its review of the management of Commonwealth assets the Committee found that a cultural change was needed in order for public servants to better appreciate the value of the assets they manage. Such change should, in the Committee's view, be actively promoted by agency chief executives, as well as by the Department of Finance and Administration through an asset management forum for the sharing of expertise.
The issue of the management of Commonwealth Government purchasing is the subject of another of the Committee's inquiries for the year. Like asset management, procurement is another function which has been devolved to agencies. The Committee found that the rate of devolution in recent years had resulted in inconsistent service delivery, and in a loss of oversight and coordination of purchasing at the whole of government level. 
Recent Committee inquiries into public service agencies have demonstrated shortcomings with respect to contract management. Such findings are significant in an environment where many government services have been subject to commercial contestability and contracting out and in which responsibility for successful risk management has been devolved to agency heads. The Committee has embarked on an inquiry into contract management in the Australian Public Service in an attempt to identify systemic problems in contract administration and to develop better practice standards which can be applied across agencies.
The biennial conference of the Australasian Council of Public Accounts Committees (ACPAC) held in Fremantle during 22-23 February 1999 provided the JCPAA with the opportunity to brief members of public accounts committees from the States, Territories, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, on the range of its new responsibilities under the amended Public Accounts and Audit Act. The JCPAA Chairman, Mr Bob Charles MP, was elected Chairman of ACPAC for the years 2000-01.
May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking the secretariat for its support throughout the year.
Madam President, I commend the Report to the Senate.
REPORT 366: Review of Auditor-General's Reports 1997-98, Second Quarter
As part of this review, the Committee examined two performance audits of the Auditor-General which focused on equity in employment in the Australian Public Service, and matters relating to a contract between the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETYA) and South Pacific Cruise Lines Limited (SPCL). 
The JCPAA made four recommendations which were agreed to by the Government.
REPORT 367: Review Of Auditor-General's Reports 1997-98, Third Quarter
This quarterly report examined three performance audits of the Auditor-General which focused on DEETYA International Services, the sale of Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth Airports, and selected functions of the Child Support Agency. The Committee made four recommendations which Government has supported.
REPORT 368: Review Of Audit Report No. 34 1997-98, New Submarine Project, Department Of Defence
Madam President, the Committee gave top priority to its review of the New Submarine Project. The review examined findings raised by the Auditor-General in Audit Report No. 34. Of the Committee's seven recommendations, six dealt with administrative matters and one with policy issues. The Government has supported the six recommendations relating to administrative matters.
The Committee's policy recommendation number five is currently under consideration by the Minister for Finance and Administration. As part of this recommendation, the Committee requested that legislative provision be provided for, either through amendment of the Auditor-General Act or the Finance Minister's Orders, to enable the Auditor-General to access the premises of a contractor for the purpose of inspecting and copying documentation and records directly relating to a Commonwealth contract. The Committee considers access powers proposed in this recommendation are an essential part of enhancing Parliamentary scrutiny of Executive Government and, accordingly, will monitor progress with this recommendation.
REPORT 369: 	Australian Government Procurement
The Committee made 12 recommendations of which 11 were responded to as part of a Government response in November 1999. The Executive Minute responded to Recommendation 9 which was supported by the Government.
REPORT 371: 	Review Of Auditor-General's Reports 1998-99, First Half
This quarterly report examined three performance audits of the Auditor-General which focused on aviation security in Australia, the planning of aged care, and the costing of services. The Government supported, supported with qualification, and noted the three recommendations made by the Committee.
Madam President, in conclusion I am pleased with the high rate of support for the Committee's recommendations as indicated in these Executive Minutes. However, in addition to noting Executive minutes in this way, the Committee will at various times seek to monitor the extent to which recommendations have been implemented.

That the Senate take note of this document and of the report tabled earlier today.
This Auditor-General's report is the most damning indictment of a minister that you could possibly expect to receive from an Auditor-General. It proves the case that the ALP has prosecuted in this place and at estimates committee inquiries for the last two years. It establishes that, as a result of a meeting almost two years ago to this day, the minister leaked to a group of radiologists details of a supply-side budget measure dealing with MRI machines. As a result of him providing information to those radiologists at that meeting on 6 May, they went out and purchased machines. A number of the machines were purchased by members of the committee present at that meeting, but the rest of the industry got to hear of this decision as well. We have evidence that 33 new MRI machines were purchased in the four days following that meeting in the lead-up to the budget, at a cost of about $3 million each. You do not go out and buy an MRI machine off the rack and you do not go out and commit $3 million of your own money unless you are pretty sure you are going to get a return on that money.
As a result of the meeting on 6 May, those radiologists, and other radiologists who were informed of the decision, knew that they would get a return on their money. How would they get a return on their money? Because the taxpayers of Australia would pay for it through Medicare rebates. The minister leaked information which resulted in every Australian taxpayer in this country having to pay more taxes—he leaked what was in the budget. The Auditor-General draws the links and makes the case that, as a result of the minister raising that issue in the meeting, the radiologists knew what was in the budget. The minister had got the tick the day before and when he went along to meet with the radiologists to finalise the agreement they were seeking to make on control of radiology measures he gave them this information.
The Auditor-General found that all of the radiologists at that meeting said that the minister or someone from the government raised this issue. There was a discussion that the budget might include a measure meaning that machines on order at the date of the budget—on 12 May—would receive Medicare rebates. Only 50 or so machines were currently in operation in Australia at the time, but 33 more machines were ordered in a matter of four days. You do not go out and spend $3 million on a whim or on the basis of a rumour; you go out and spend that if you know something. The radiologists at that meeting knew about this because Dr Wooldridge had told them. He told them, so they were in the know about the budget decision. This is insider trading at its worst and it has cost every taxpayer in this country money.
The minister has to resign. He has failed all standards required of a minister. He leaked a commercially sensitive decision that cost the taxpayers of Australia millions of dollars. The Auditor-General has established that case. The Labor Party has pursued this for two years. The minister at every stage has sought to delay the inquiries and has refused to provide answers to avoid a proper investigation, but after three investigations we finally got there. The Auditor-General sets it out chapter and verse. People ought to read this report because it is a stunning indictment of the minister—it proves that he leaked budget information. In trying to curry favour with the radiologists and in trying to get a deal on longer-term measures, he told them what was in the budget. 
One of the reasons we know that is that the people at the meeting told us, and they gave affidavits to the Auditor-General to establish that. But a whole range of other facts are now being revealed that establish the case that there was a budget leak and that the leak came from the minister. I could never understand, when pursuing this matter, why there was not an investigation. I kept asking the department at estimates: why did you not have the normal budget leak inquiry—call in the investigators, check telephone records and do all those sorts of things? Do you know why there was no budget leak inquiry? Because they knew who had leaked it. They knew it came from the highest placed person possible in the whole operation: the minister. As a departmental secretary you cannot order an inquiry into a leak when you know that the culprit is the minister. That is why there was never an investigation. In two years there was never a proper investigation into the leak. The best that happened is that a couple of senior officers had a chat. They all agreed that it was not them and they dropped the matter. No-one worried about the millions of dollars it cost taxpayers and no-one bothered to pursue it. Why? Because they knew where the leak had to come from.
There were only three people present at the meeting where the critical information was passed to the radiologists: the minister, his adviser and one departmental bureaucrat. That bureaucrat, after one round of estimates, was transferred to the blood bank and has not been seen since. We have not been able to question her about what happened. But the key person at that meeting—the lead negotiator for the government—was the minister. The Auditor-General nails him, and nails him good and proper. He says that, because of that meeting, the radiologists knew and therefore went out and acted. As I say, you do not spend $3 million of yours or anybody else's money unless you know something. They knew that they needed Medicare rebates to make those purchases profitable—to get a return on their money. So they went out and purchased 33 machines. Talk about a Christmas spree!
That means that they purchased eight machines per day. They were out there buying machines hand over fist. Why would you do that, when there had been only 50 or so machines in Australia in the 20 years before that? They did it because they knew that they were going to get a return. Minister Wooldridge said to them, `You will get a return for your buck because the rebates are in the budget. The Prime Minister signed off on it yesterday, so you are okay.' We also know that the radiologists, as a result of that meeting, signed up to the deal. This was a two-way process: they gave something, so they got something back. The minister's and the department's defence would have us believe that the radiologists signed up to the deal not knowing what was going to happen in terms of the supply of machines—that they were somehow that naive that they were going to agree to an arrangement which would cap their income while not knowing how many MRI machines they were going to be able to access to generate that income. You have to accept that they were either very naive or complete fools if they were going to sign up not knowing what his side of the bargain was.
What we do know is that the minister knew on 6 May because the Prime Minister and cabinet had ticked off on his side of the bargain, and he told them, `The deal can be finalised today because I know what is in the budget. It's all fixed. You blokes will be happy. You can sign the deal.' That is what happened. His actions caused a significant drain on the Commonwealth purse. Millions of dollars were spent on funding MRI rebates on machines that should never have been approved and would never have been purchased without the leak. We know all that. We know that since then they have had to rescind that decision, but again it took almost two years for them to rescind that decision. The minister has tried for the last two years to hide the facts and to deny that the leak occurred. There was no investigation. Only through the opposition pursuing this has this matter come to light. Otherwise, he was hoping that it would blow over, that he would get away with it and that no-one would hold him accountable. Well, he is accountable. He must be held accountable by the parliament, he must be held accountable by the Prime Minister and he must resign. This is one of the most serious offences a minister could be accused of, and the Auditor-General has proved the case. The Auditor-General has established the case that the minister leaked budget information as part of his negotiations with radiologists and that as a result there was a blow-out in the order of machines—a commercial advantage to many and a huge cost to the taxpayer. 
Despite all the denials that there are any problems and the minister continuing to defend his actions and deny that there has been a problem over the last two years, we have gradually learnt the extent of the problem. We have learnt the fact that there were 50-odd machines ordered over and above what was expected and the fact that many people were in the know because the word got out. But he has denied all this. It has taken three inquiries to finally establish it. I note in the document today that, when questioned by the Auditor-General with some fairly strong legal powers at his control, the minister on this occasion, despite giving very strident denials in the parliament, said, `I can't say I didn't make a comment, but I didn't disclose the mechanisms of supply.' The minister gave a much weaker response when faced with the Auditor-General pressuring him under oath about what might have happened. This is the minister who has denied that there has been a problem for the last two years and has refused to acknowledge the legitimate public policy concerns here.
We have had three reports into this matter, all providing further evidence of the minister's bungling and complicity in this leak. One was released on Christmas Eve, one was released on the evening before Good Friday and this one has been released the day after the budget. What a trifecta! And this is a minister who is open and accountable! It just so happens that the return to order documents we have been seeking for a year have been tabled this afternoon as well. It is just too damn convenient. This minister is trying to survive what is a damning indictment of his own performance. He is responsible for costing the taxpayers of Australia millions of dollars. He must go. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,20,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-05-10,"—I am absolutely astounded at this ongoing assault on the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge. I would like to see every member of the opposition party go under oath to give evidence in the way the minister did to the Auditor-General. The fact of the matter is that the allegations constantly being made by Senator Evans, Senator Crowley, Senator Faulkner and anyone else who wants to buy into the system are not being made under oath; they are just wild allegations being made under parliamentary privilege. Go outside these doors and make the same allegations against Minister Wooldridge that you have made in here. The answer to that is that you are not game to do so. As part of the 1998 budget, the minister announced that an important new technology named magnetic resonance imaging would be funded under the MBS.
—The Labor Party might like to listen for five seconds. They might actually want to know the truth. This announcement was part of a bigger diagnostic imaging package which the Labor Party had completely overlooked for the people of Australia. The people of Australia wanted access to MRI at a reasonable cost. What Minister Wooldridge was trying to do with this policy and what he has actually achieved with this policy is to make that facility available to more Australians at a reasonable cost. That has covered up for a Labor Party failure of 13 years in government when they refused to make such a tool available for imaging. Now there are 17 units accessing public funding in non-metropolitan areas.
—Here we have Senator Crowley interjecting again. She does not listen, she did not hear what I said, she has not read the report and still she is trying to correct something that is wrong. It would be lovely if Senator Crowley would go under oath just to wake up in the morning. I want to make sure that the Senate knows the facts surrounding this. Dr Wooldridge was the one who asked the Auditor-General to inquire into the processes surrounding the development of the 1998 budget measure on MRI and the diagnostic imaging package. It was Minister Wooldridge who set the inquiry in train. The Auditor-General has now released the report of the inquiry into the probity and effectiveness of the arrangements to improve access to MRI. Minister Wooldridge has recognised and thanked the Auditor-General for undertaking such a comprehensive process in a relatively short time frame. 
I would like to remind the Senate that this report was requested by the minister, not by anybody else. According to the report, the minister wrote to the Auditor-General on 18 October requesting `an audit inquiry into, and reporting on, the probity of the processes surrounding the negotiation of the agreement between the government and the diagnostic imaging profession'. The minister specifically asked the Auditor-General to focus on accusations that people had inappropriate access to budget information that would have given them commercial advantage. The report says that the minister also indicated that `he would welcome any observations the Auditor-General may have about how similar processes might best be handled in the future'. The minister also agreed to a request by the Auditor-General to extend the scope of the audit to `put beyond doubt the Auditor-General's authority to cover the role of the minister and that of his staff' in the process. In short, the minister has nothing to hide. It is in the interests of good government that there be an open and transparent process. That is what the Labor Party do not like. That is not the way they operate. In this regard, the Auditor-General has undertaken a very thorough inquiry.
As the Auditor-General's inquiry was operating under sections 18 and 20 of the act, he was able to review all relevant documents in the department, the HIC and the minister's office—including retrieved electronic communications—and to undertake over 75 personal interviews with the minister, his staff, government officials and radiologists. Where the Auditor-General felt it necessary, evidence was taken under oath. The minister gave evidence under oath, yet the Labor Party—who have not shut up for one second since I stood up—still will not say why they will not commit any evidence to oath.
—Is there any chance that Senator Ray might be shut up in this debate so that I can make some comments? I did not interrupt Senator Evans's contribution.
Opposition senators interjecting—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Order!
—The inquiry's conclusions and findings are important. I note the Auditor-General makes reference to a number of findings and conclusions in relation to the process. In summary, these are as follows. There was:
... no substantive conclusion about inappropriate disclosure of budget sensitive information ...
How did Senator Evans, Senator Ray, Senator Faulkner, Senator Crowley and all the rest of them get from the report that the minister is guilty? It is not in there. The report states:
The Department's approach to risk management in the development of the MRI policy measure was uneven.
It further states:
... the Department's management of the probity arrangements surrounding the negotiations for the MRI measure was not adequate for the circumstance ...
It further states:
There was a lack of adequate documentation by the Department ...
It further states that the investigation by the HIC could have been more effectively managed and that the HIC's procedures for managing the perceived conflict of interest of board members did not work appropriately on all occasions. 
With respect to each of these conclusions, I want to make the following point: there was no leak. The report states that no substantive conclusion can be drawn in the light of contradictory evidence. In particular, the Auditor-General found that:
All participants agree that the Minister did not discuss what measures would be in the Budget.
That is paragraph 76, for the Labor Party's reference. Again, the Auditor-General reports: 
All College members who attended the meeting of 6 May 1998 agree that the Minister did not reveal Budget measures.
That is paragraph 2.27, for the Labor Party, who cannot read. Further, the report states:
... there is no evidence that the Minister had any discussions between 6 May and Budget day with any parties outside of government with respect to MRI supply measures ...
The inquiry's findings in this regard are clear. The minister stands by his statements to the House of Representatives and elsewhere and the evidence he has given under oath that neither he nor the officers accompanying him at the meeting on 6 May 1998 leaked any information about the supply-side controls to apply to MRI machines. The Auditor-General also notes that the recollections of most participants in the various discussions do not support the view that the Commonwealth's consideration of the option of including machines on order as at budget night was discussed with the college prior to the budget. Nor is there any record of any such discussion, including amongst the college records. So let the issue of the leak be put to rest. It just did not happen. But that does not stop the Labor Party claiming that it did. They simply will not read the report. They simply will not look at the way in which the Auditor-General has investigated this matter. 
Any process of high-level negotiation carries with it some element of risk. As the ANAO notes in paragraph 34:
High level risks ... were in the overall context identified and managed. However, insufficient consideration was given to risk identification and management for some aspects of the policy development process ...
The key point is that the design of the policy responded to the risks identified. The department put into place a number of eligibility criteria, including siting arrangements, accreditation requirements and comprehensive clinical indicators. There had to be unconditional and enforceable contracts in place at 7.30 p.m. on 12 May, and this had to be attested to by way of statutory declaration. As a result of these measures, the HIC has been able to carry out its investigations, which have resulted in 19 referrals to the DPP. In view of the larger than expected number of applications for eligibility, the minister acted to enforce a cut-off date of 11 October 1999 for these applications. Further, the minister then acted to change the eligibility date from 12 May to 10 February 1998, which was the time that negotiations with the college commenced. As soon as the minister was advised that there were problems on the order side, he took appropriate and decisive action to ensure the government's objectives could be met without putting the taxpayer at risk. 
In summary, risks were identified and responded to appropriately. The report recognises:
... the policy was properly authorised and ... the Department met the formal requirements of the Budget process.
However, there was clearly inadequate documentation of the negotiations with the college and of the development of the supply-side measure itself. This is a matter that the minister has asked his department to pay particular attention to, but this shortcoming is not characteristic of his department in any way, shape or form. The HIC investigations are important. The minister is exceedingly disappointed at the length of time it took the HIC to undertake their investigation. However, the HIC had to be thorough, be fair to all parties and follow a proper process. The magnitude of the possible fraud surprised everyone, not least the HIC investigators. The paper trail was extensive and complex, the number of people that needed to be interviewed was large and there were conflicting stories. The minister is now satisfied that everything that could have been done was done. The matter is now with the DPP, and we should await the conclusions of that process. 
On the issue of potential conflicts of interest at the HIC board level, paragraph 119 of the report states that the ANAO found no evidence `that the course of the investigation was influenced improperly'. The minister has asked the HIC board to follow up with the audit conclusions on governance matters. It is important to recognise that the Auditor-General's findings and conclusions focus only on the role played by the government in the development of the MRI measure. While the minister is disappointed that an inquiry needed to be undertaken at all, the minister is pleased there has been no evidence found of wrongdoing on the part of the government—no evidence whatsoever. For the Labor Party to continue to come in here and say that this report contains evidence is plainly wrong.  
—It is not going to do their image any good. 
—That is precisely right, Senator Calvert. It is not doing their image any good, if they ever had one in the first place.
—Just read it, boofhead. 
—That is out of order, Senator Ray. 
—You have to be one to know one. Naturally, the Auditor-General's report does not go to the probity of the actions of non-government players. Broadly speaking, the minister is sure that all parties acted in good faith. Other processes, such as the investigations being undertaken by the Health Insurance Commission, should help to complete the picture in relation to actions of particular individuals. But this government did not sit on its hands, unlike Labor; the minister did not sit on his hands. The minister has substantially improved access to MRI at the same time as reining in unsustainable expenditure on diagnostic imaging that ran out of control under Labor.
—Oh dear, oh dear. 
—Senator Crowley could not care less what went out of control under Labor. That is why when she was a minister she was called `dozy Rosy'. Notwithstanding particular shortcomings in departmental processes, the overall outcome is a very good one for the Australian public. That is not what the Labor Party are concerned about. The outcomes for the Australian public do not worry them in the slightest. At each step along the way, the minister took action where it was needed and as advised by his department vis-a-vis: the overall agreement with the college; the tightening of the supply-side measures, particularly the statutory declarations; the HIC investigation and report to him; the 11 October cut-off of applications for equipment eligibility; the shifting back of the date for eligible orders from the budget to 10 February 1998; the commissioning of the Auditor-General's report; and the bringing forward of the review of MRI, the Blandford report. 
In short, the government should be applauded for the measures it has taken for they are delivering a good result for the Australian public. Not once in all of this—I have chaired all the meetings that have been conducted into this inquiry—have the Labor Party recognised the importance of this policy for the people of Australia. It will be interesting today to see whether they finally recognise the importance of this policy for the people of Australia. They failed after 13 years of government to deliver this facility at a reasonable cost. That is what this government has done. And now Labor can do nothing but criticise and be petty and paltry, calling for a minister's resignation over something that is right and proper and over something which he has been proven to be correct.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,20,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-05-10,"—Senator Knowles has had the benefit of a speech provided by the department and minister, who have had this Auditor-General's Report No. 42 into MRI services in their hands for over a month—plenty of time, you would think, to prepare a minister's defence on an issue like this. But this report is so condemnatory of the minister, so scathing of the minister, that no defence can be provided even if you have a month to look at the draft report provided by the Auditor-General. I want to briefly take the Senate back to the history of this MRI issue. 
Two years ago the Minister for Health and Aged Care went to a meeting at night in the Sydney office of the Royal College of Radiologists. It was one week prior to the 1998 budget, and the topic of conversation there was a cosy chat about what was going to be in the budget. Amazingly, no notes were kept of that critical meeting. The claim is that no secrets were let slip but, in the following four days, no fewer than 33 new orders were paid for MRI machines.  
For two years, the minister has fought desperately to keep the lid on this ministerial scandal, this growing MRI scam. The opposition, quite rightly, have fought relentlessly in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. We have asked dozens of questions; we have raised the issues at successive estimates hearings; and, bit by bit, we have winkled the truth out on this issue. The handling of the MRI issue is part of a pattern of Minister Wooldridge's. This is how Minister Wooldridge does business: he has acted without regard to the public interest; he has stonewalled when he has been questioned; he has refused to admit there has been a problem; and he delayed time and time again in deciding to establish a proper inquiry.
We have had three inquiries. We have had the Health Insurance Commission inquiry report released on Christmas Eve, which found that grounds existed to prepare briefs for prosecution in 19 cases involving up to 250 radiologists and that civil recovery of funds was required in a further eight cases. We will hear the full story of that, of course, only when those cases go to court. Then we had the report by Professor Blandford that was released on the evening before Good Friday. He confirmed what the minister was told, before he started down the road of giving private radiologists access to an MRI Medicare rebate, that Australia has enough machines already and another seven could fill any gaps in rural Australia. Instead, because of Minister Wooldridge's process, we have had over 40 surplus MRI machines and we have had a financial headache and scandal not only for the government but also for the radiologists and their bankers. 
Now we have the Auditor-General's report pushed out on the day after the budget is brought down to try to minimise the political impact of the scandal that is engulfing the minister for health in the Australian government. That is just a continuation of the cover-up tactics that we have seen from Dr Wooldridge for so long. The government knows that the Senate itself will not be meeting for another few weeks, and the minister hopes he can avoid scrutiny by hiding behind coverage of the budget.
What we have here is a pattern. This is the way that Minister Wooldridge does business. This minister has a very peculiar inability to spot a conflict of interest. He could not see a conflict in having his department negotiate multimillion dollar contracts with the people who were potential beneficiaries. He could not see a conflict in meeting with his friends in the College of Radiologists to discuss budget secrets. No, he could not see a conflict in appointing Dr Barry Catchlove, a man who had just ordered six MRI machines, to the position of chairman of the Health Insurance Commission. He could not see a conflict in appointing his fundraiser, Dr Rick McLean, to the position of chair of the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council on $25,000 a year. He could not see a conflict in awarding his friend and supporter, Dr Jack Best, contracts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars without public tender. That is the way this minister does business. 
There is a pattern with this minister of shonky political fundraising and letting those in the medical profession buy political access to the minister for health. Of course, it is the same with the radiologists, and it is going on. Dr Wooldridge delivered a budget briefing at a fundraiser in Sydney for an organisation chaired by his friend Dr Best. It is still going on. At this fundraiser was Dr McLean—they are all in it together. What did Dr Wooldridge extol at a recent budget briefing? None other than the work of Dr Best done at a cost to the taxpayer of $230,000 with travel expenses of over $80,000. Dr Best has undertaken a publicly funded stocktake of rural health that is now being used as a blueprint for the Liberal Party to restore its sinking stocks in the bush.
This is the way that Minister Wooldridge does business. This is the Dr Wooldridge pattern: `You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.' That is Dr Wooldridge's approach and he has now been exposed by the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General is scathing about the department, too. Look what he says in paragraph 34:
The Department's approach to risk management in the development of the MRI policy measure was uneven.
Paragraph 35 says: 
The ANAO concluded that the Department's management of the probity arrangements surrounding the negotiations for the MRI measure was not adequate for the circumstances.
Paragraph 36 of the A-G's report says:
There was a lack of adequate documentation by the Department of the negotiations with the College.
Paragraph 36 goes on:
Official records were not taken or maintained of some significant briefings of, and decisions by, the Minister.
Paragraph 38 states:
There were 33 machines ordered in the four working days between 7 and 12 May (Budget night) 1998, according to statutory declarations provided to the HIC ... the possibility of some prior knowledge of, or speculation about, the inclusion of machines on order in the MRI Budget measure cannot be ruled out.
Paragraph 40 states:
It is noteworthy that five of the eleven radiologists involved in the negotiations were associated with practices that allegedly ordered nine machines prior to the Budget.
Senator Knowles, in her prepared statement, asked where the Auditor-General says that Dr Wooldridge is guilty. I will tell you where the Auditor-General says that. He says it in paragraph 42 of his report:
Statements have also been made by College representatives who attended the meeting on 6 May 1998 with the Minister that, although the Minister did not reveal what measures would be in the Budget, there was discussion of the option to include machines on order as at Budget night. All but one have stated that this was initiated by the Minister (the other has indicated this was initiated by the Minister or the departmental official present) within the general context of College concerns about restrictions on sites ... On the other hand, the Minister, the Minister's adviser and the departmental officer present, dispute the radiologists' recollection of the meeting. They do not recall the specific matter of machines on order being discussed. Against this background, including related developments over the preceding month, the meeting of 6 May 1998 seems to have had some influence on the following surge in orders for machines, either directly or indirectly.
Senator Knowles and the government ask where Dr Wooldridge is found guilty by the Auditor-General. Where is Dr Wooldridge found guilty by the Auditor-General? In paragraph 42 of his report. 
If you do not like paragraph 42, go to paragraph 43, where the Auditor-General says:
... the ANAO considers that, on the balance of probabilities, the evidence does at least suggest that negotiation and consultation with the College representatives and open debate on supply control issues created an environment where some participants may have deduced, or actually become aware, that the Commonwealth was giving consideration to the inclusion of machines on order in the Budget measure.
That is what he says. The Auditor-General says Minister Wooldridge is guilty. Of course Minister Wooldridge should go. Minister Wooldridge should go because the Auditor-General has set out in scathing terms in his report why he should resign and why, if he does not resign, the Prime Minister should take the appropriate action. Perhaps the Prime Minister might even consider his discredited Code of Ministerial Conduct, which says:
It is vital that ministers and parliamentary secretaries do not by their conduct undermine public confidence in them or the government.
Dr Wooldridge has. Further, it states:
Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public. 
Minister Wooldridge has not been honest in his public dealings and has consistently misled the Australian public and the parliament. Under the heading of `Accountability' it states:
Ministers do, however, have overall responsibility for the administration of their portfolios and for carriage in the Parliament of their accountability obligations arising from that responsibility. They would properly be held to account for matters for which they were personally responsible, or where they were aware of problems but had not acted to rectify them.
Dr Wooldridge not only is personally responsible and personally has to take the rap but also has to take the rap for his department on this one. He was right in there, and so was his personal staff, from the very beginning.
This is the administrative equivalent of insider trading. This affair shows an abject failure on the part of Dr Wooldridge, a minister of the Crown. It has taken the opposition almost two years to uncover all the detail about the scan scam. But we have worked assiduously on that and we have done very well, even with all the attempts that have been made by Dr Wooldridge and the government to cover up, not to answer questions, not to provide documents and not to respond to orders of the Senate. But, finally, the Auditor-General has come down with a report that finds Dr Wooldridge guilty of the charges that the opposition have made, which leaves Dr Wooldridge with no alternative but to resign. The facts in this multimillion dollar scan scam are now public for all. 
—Who will do the fundraising?
—I do not know, Senator Ray, who will do the fundraising. But I do know this: the fundraising is part of the pattern of Dr Wooldridge's conduct. Dr Wooldridge operates on this principle: you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours. That is the Wooldridge approach to ministerial responsibility. That is how he conducts himself and that is how he conducts his ministerial affairs. He has to go. He has to go directly because of his revelation to the radiologists of the details of the budget supply-side measure and particularly because of the fact concerning the number of MRI machines on order on budget night. Five or six radiologists at the meeting have indicated that the minister himself initiated this discussion. You have a situation where the Auditor-General is convinced that this disclosure is what led radiologists to get their orders in before budget night and directly resulted in 33 orders for MRI machines in the four days prior to the budget. The Auditor-General says in his report that this minister himself was deeply involved in insider trading of market sensitive information with millions of taxpayers' dollars at stake.
But, secondly, this minister ought to go for his maladministration of his own department. He has to take the rap for the administrative failures in the department of health and the administrative failures in the negotiations with the radiologists—during many of which he and members of his staff were present. What a disgraceful performance from the minister for health. If ever a minister should go, this minister should. Minister Wooldridge must resign. The Prime Minister must ensure, under his much-discredited code of ministerial responsibility, that Dr Wooldridge resigns today.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,20,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-05-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of this document and of the report tabled earlier today.
This Auditor-General's report is the most damning indictment of a minister that you could possibly expect to receive from an Auditor-General. It proves the case that the ALP has prosecuted in this place and at estimates committee inquiries for the last two years. It establishes that, as a result of a meeting almost two years ago to this day, the minister leaked to a group of radiologists details of a supply-side budget measure dealing with MRI machines. As a result of him providing information to those radiologists at that meeting on 6 May, they went out and purchased machines. A number of the machines were purchased by members of the committee present at that meeting, but the rest of the industry got to hear of this decision as well. We have evidence that 33 new MRI machines were purchased in the four days following that meeting in the lead-up to the budget, at a cost of about $3 million each. You do not go out and buy an MRI machine off the rack and you do not go out and commit $3 million of your own money unless you are pretty sure you are going to get a return on that money.
As a result of the meeting on 6 May, those radiologists, and other radiologists who were informed of the decision, knew that they would get a return on their money. How would they get a return on their money? Because the taxpayers of Australia would pay for it through Medicare rebates. The minister leaked information which resulted in every Australian taxpayer in this country having to pay more taxes—he leaked what was in the budget. The Auditor-General draws the links and makes the case that, as a result of the minister raising that issue in the meeting, the radiologists knew what was in the budget. The minister had got the tick the day before and when he went along to meet with the radiologists to finalise the agreement they were seeking to make on control of radiology measures he gave them this information.
The Auditor-General found that all of the radiologists at that meeting said that the minister or someone from the government raised this issue. There was a discussion that the budget might include a measure meaning that machines on order at the date of the budget—on 12 May—would receive Medicare rebates. Only 50 or so machines were currently in operation in Australia at the time, but 33 more machines were ordered in a matter of four days. You do not go out and spend $3 million on a whim or on the basis of a rumour; you go out and spend that if you know something. The radiologists at that meeting knew about this because Dr Wooldridge had told them. He told them, so they were in the know about the budget decision. This is insider trading at its worst and it has cost every taxpayer in this country money.
The minister has to resign. He has failed all standards required of a minister. He leaked a commercially sensitive decision that cost the taxpayers of Australia millions of dollars. The Auditor-General has established that case. The Labor Party has pursued this for two years. The minister at every stage has sought to delay the inquiries and has refused to provide answers to avoid a proper investigation, but after three investigations we finally got there. The Auditor-General sets it out chapter and verse. People ought to read this report because it is a stunning indictment of the minister—it proves that he leaked budget information. In trying to curry favour with the radiologists and in trying to get a deal on longer-term measures, he told them what was in the budget. 
One of the reasons we know that is that the people at the meeting told us, and they gave affidavits to the Auditor-General to establish that. But a whole range of other facts are now being revealed that establish the case that there was a budget leak and that the leak came from the minister. I could never understand, when pursuing this matter, why there was not an investigation. I kept asking the department at estimates: why did you not have the normal budget leak inquiry—call in the investigators, check telephone records and do all those sorts of things? Do you know why there was no budget leak inquiry? Because they knew who had leaked it. They knew it came from the highest placed person possible in the whole operation: the minister. As a departmental secretary you cannot order an inquiry into a leak when you know that the culprit is the minister. That is why there was never an investigation. In two years there was never a proper investigation into the leak. The best that happened is that a couple of senior officers had a chat. They all agreed that it was not them and they dropped the matter. No-one worried about the millions of dollars it cost taxpayers and no-one bothered to pursue it. Why? Because they knew where the leak had to come from.
There were only three people present at the meeting where the critical information was passed to the radiologists: the minister, his adviser and one departmental bureaucrat. That bureaucrat, after one round of estimates, was transferred to the blood bank and has not been seen since. We have not been able to question her about what happened. But the key person at that meeting—the lead negotiator for the government—was the minister. The Auditor-General nails him, and nails him good and proper. He says that, because of that meeting, the radiologists knew and therefore went out and acted. As I say, you do not spend $3 million of yours or anybody else's money unless you know something. They knew that they needed Medicare rebates to make those purchases profitable—to get a return on their money. So they went out and purchased 33 machines. Talk about a Christmas spree!
That means that they purchased eight machines per day. They were out there buying machines hand over fist. Why would you do that, when there had been only 50 or so machines in Australia in the 20 years before that? They did it because they knew that they were going to get a return. Minister Wooldridge said to them, `You will get a return for your buck because the rebates are in the budget. The Prime Minister signed off on it yesterday, so you are okay.' We also know that the radiologists, as a result of that meeting, signed up to the deal. This was a two-way process: they gave something, so they got something back. The minister's and the department's defence would have us believe that the radiologists signed up to the deal not knowing what was going to happen in terms of the supply of machines—that they were somehow that naive that they were going to agree to an arrangement which would cap their income while not knowing how many MRI machines they were going to be able to access to generate that income. You have to accept that they were either very naive or complete fools if they were going to sign up not knowing what his side of the bargain was.
What we do know is that the minister knew on 6 May because the Prime Minister and cabinet had ticked off on his side of the bargain, and he told them, `The deal can be finalised today because I know what is in the budget. It's all fixed. You blokes will be happy. You can sign the deal.' That is what happened. His actions caused a significant drain on the Commonwealth purse. Millions of dollars were spent on funding MRI rebates on machines that should never have been approved and would never have been purchased without the leak. We know all that. We know that since then they have had to rescind that decision, but again it took almost two years for them to rescind that decision. The minister has tried for the last two years to hide the facts and to deny that the leak occurred. There was no investigation. Only through the opposition pursuing this has this matter come to light. Otherwise, he was hoping that it would blow over, that he would get away with it and that no-one would hold him accountable. Well, he is accountable. He must be held accountable by the parliament, he must be held accountable by the Prime Minister and he must resign. This is one of the most serious offences a minister could be accused of, and the Auditor-General has proved the case. The Auditor-General has established the case that the minister leaked budget information as part of his negotiations with radiologists and that as a result there was a blow-out in the order of machines—a commercial advantage to many and a huge cost to the taxpayer. 
Despite all the denials that there are any problems and the minister continuing to defend his actions and deny that there has been a problem over the last two years, we have gradually learnt the extent of the problem. We have learnt the fact that there were 50-odd machines ordered over and above what was expected and the fact that many people were in the know because the word got out. But he has denied all this. It has taken three inquiries to finally establish it. I note in the document today that, when questioned by the Auditor-General with some fairly strong legal powers at his control, the minister on this occasion, despite giving very strident denials in the parliament, said, `I can't say I didn't make a comment, but I didn't disclose the mechanisms of supply.' The minister gave a much weaker response when faced with the Auditor-General pressuring him under oath about what might have happened. This is the minister who has denied that there has been a problem for the last two years and has refused to acknowledge the legitimate public policy concerns here.
We have had three reports into this matter, all providing further evidence of the minister's bungling and complicity in this leak. One was released on Christmas Eve, one was released on the evening before Good Friday and this one has been released the day after the budget. What a trifecta! And this is a minister who is open and accountable! It just so happens that the return to order documents we have been seeking for a year have been tabled this afternoon as well. It is just too damn convenient. This minister is trying to survive what is a damning indictment of his own performance. He is responsible for costing the taxpayers of Australia millions of dollars. He must go. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report No. 42 of 1999-2000</title>,Documents,20,2
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-05-10,"—I am absolutely astounded at this ongoing assault on the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge. I would like to see every member of the opposition party go under oath to give evidence in the way the minister did to the Auditor-General. The fact of the matter is that the allegations constantly being made by Senator Evans, Senator Crowley, Senator Faulkner and anyone else who wants to buy into the system are not being made under oath; they are just wild allegations being made under parliamentary privilege. Go outside these doors and make the same allegations against Minister Wooldridge that you have made in here. The answer to that is that you are not game to do so. As part of the 1998 budget, the minister announced that an important new technology named magnetic resonance imaging would be funded under the MBS.
—The Labor Party might like to listen for five seconds. They might actually want to know the truth. This announcement was part of a bigger diagnostic imaging package which the Labor Party had completely overlooked for the people of Australia. The people of Australia wanted access to MRI at a reasonable cost. What Minister Wooldridge was trying to do with this policy and what he has actually achieved with this policy is to make that facility available to more Australians at a reasonable cost. That has covered up for a Labor Party failure of 13 years in government when they refused to make such a tool available for imaging. Now there are 17 units accessing public funding in non-metropolitan areas.
—Here we have Senator Crowley interjecting again. She does not listen, she did not hear what I said, she has not read the report and still she is trying to correct something that is wrong. It would be lovely if Senator Crowley would go under oath just to wake up in the morning. I want to make sure that the Senate knows the facts surrounding this. Dr Wooldridge was the one who asked the Auditor-General to inquire into the processes surrounding the development of the 1998 budget measure on MRI and the diagnostic imaging package. It was Minister Wooldridge who set the inquiry in train. The Auditor-General has now released the report of the inquiry into the probity and effectiveness of the arrangements to improve access to MRI. Minister Wooldridge has recognised and thanked the Auditor-General for undertaking such a comprehensive process in a relatively short time frame. 
I would like to remind the Senate that this report was requested by the minister, not by anybody else. According to the report, the minister wrote to the Auditor-General on 18 October requesting `an audit inquiry into, and reporting on, the probity of the processes surrounding the negotiation of the agreement between the government and the diagnostic imaging profession'. The minister specifically asked the Auditor-General to focus on accusations that people had inappropriate access to budget information that would have given them commercial advantage. The report says that the minister also indicated that `he would welcome any observations the Auditor-General may have about how similar processes might best be handled in the future'. The minister also agreed to a request by the Auditor-General to extend the scope of the audit to `put beyond doubt the Auditor-General's authority to cover the role of the minister and that of his staff' in the process. In short, the minister has nothing to hide. It is in the interests of good government that there be an open and transparent process. That is what the Labor Party do not like. That is not the way they operate. In this regard, the Auditor-General has undertaken a very thorough inquiry.
As the Auditor-General's inquiry was operating under sections 18 and 20 of the act, he was able to review all relevant documents in the department, the HIC and the minister's office—including retrieved electronic communications—and to undertake over 75 personal interviews with the minister, his staff, government officials and radiologists. Where the Auditor-General felt it necessary, evidence was taken under oath. The minister gave evidence under oath, yet the Labor Party—who have not shut up for one second since I stood up—still will not say why they will not commit any evidence to oath.
—Is there any chance that Senator Ray might be shut up in this debate so that I can make some comments? I did not interrupt Senator Evans's contribution.
Opposition senators interjecting—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Order!
—The inquiry's conclusions and findings are important. I note the Auditor-General makes reference to a number of findings and conclusions in relation to the process. In summary, these are as follows. There was:
... no substantive conclusion about inappropriate disclosure of budget sensitive information ...
How did Senator Evans, Senator Ray, Senator Faulkner, Senator Crowley and all the rest of them get from the report that the minister is guilty? It is not in there. The report states:
The Department's approach to risk management in the development of the MRI policy measure was uneven.
It further states:
... the Department's management of the probity arrangements surrounding the negotiations for the MRI measure was not adequate for the circumstance ...
It further states:
There was a lack of adequate documentation by the Department ...
It further states that the investigation by the HIC could have been more effectively managed and that the HIC's procedures for managing the perceived conflict of interest of board members did not work appropriately on all occasions. 
With respect to each of these conclusions, I want to make the following point: there was no leak. The report states that no substantive conclusion can be drawn in the light of contradictory evidence. In particular, the Auditor-General found that:
All participants agree that the Minister did not discuss what measures would be in the Budget.
That is paragraph 76, for the Labor Party's reference. Again, the Auditor-General reports: 
All College members who attended the meeting of 6 May 1998 agree that the Minister did not reveal Budget measures.
That is paragraph 2.27, for the Labor Party, who cannot read. Further, the report states:
... there is no evidence that the Minister had any discussions between 6 May and Budget day with any parties outside of government with respect to MRI supply measures ...
The inquiry's findings in this regard are clear. The minister stands by his statements to the House of Representatives and elsewhere and the evidence he has given under oath that neither he nor the officers accompanying him at the meeting on 6 May 1998 leaked any information about the supply-side controls to apply to MRI machines. The Auditor-General also notes that the recollections of most participants in the various discussions do not support the view that the Commonwealth's consideration of the option of including machines on order as at budget night was discussed with the college prior to the budget. Nor is there any record of any such discussion, including amongst the college records. So let the issue of the leak be put to rest. It just did not happen. But that does not stop the Labor Party claiming that it did. They simply will not read the report. They simply will not look at the way in which the Auditor-General has investigated this matter. 
Any process of high-level negotiation carries with it some element of risk. As the ANAO notes in paragraph 34:
High level risks ... were in the overall context identified and managed. However, insufficient consideration was given to risk identification and management for some aspects of the policy development process ...
The key point is that the design of the policy responded to the risks identified. The department put into place a number of eligibility criteria, including siting arrangements, accreditation requirements and comprehensive clinical indicators. There had to be unconditional and enforceable contracts in place at 7.30 p.m. on 12 May, and this had to be attested to by way of statutory declaration. As a result of these measures, the HIC has been able to carry out its investigations, which have resulted in 19 referrals to the DPP. In view of the larger than expected number of applications for eligibility, the minister acted to enforce a cut-off date of 11 October 1999 for these applications. Further, the minister then acted to change the eligibility date from 12 May to 10 February 1998, which was the time that negotiations with the college commenced. As soon as the minister was advised that there were problems on the order side, he took appropriate and decisive action to ensure the government's objectives could be met without putting the taxpayer at risk. 
In summary, risks were identified and responded to appropriately. The report recognises:
... the policy was properly authorised and ... the Department met the formal requirements of the Budget process.
However, there was clearly inadequate documentation of the negotiations with the college and of the development of the supply-side measure itself. This is a matter that the minister has asked his department to pay particular attention to, but this shortcoming is not characteristic of his department in any way, shape or form. The HIC investigations are important. The minister is exceedingly disappointed at the length of time it took the HIC to undertake their investigation. However, the HIC had to be thorough, be fair to all parties and follow a proper process. The magnitude of the possible fraud surprised everyone, not least the HIC investigators. The paper trail was extensive and complex, the number of people that needed to be interviewed was large and there were conflicting stories. The minister is now satisfied that everything that could have been done was done. The matter is now with the DPP, and we should await the conclusions of that process. 
On the issue of potential conflicts of interest at the HIC board level, paragraph 119 of the report states that the ANAO found no evidence `that the course of the investigation was influenced improperly'. The minister has asked the HIC board to follow up with the audit conclusions on governance matters. It is important to recognise that the Auditor-General's findings and conclusions focus only on the role played by the government in the development of the MRI measure. While the minister is disappointed that an inquiry needed to be undertaken at all, the minister is pleased there has been no evidence found of wrongdoing on the part of the government—no evidence whatsoever. For the Labor Party to continue to come in here and say that this report contains evidence is plainly wrong.  
—It is not going to do their image any good. 
—That is precisely right, Senator Calvert. It is not doing their image any good, if they ever had one in the first place.
—Just read it, boofhead. 
—That is out of order, Senator Ray. 
—You have to be one to know one. Naturally, the Auditor-General's report does not go to the probity of the actions of non-government players. Broadly speaking, the minister is sure that all parties acted in good faith. Other processes, such as the investigations being undertaken by the Health Insurance Commission, should help to complete the picture in relation to actions of particular individuals. But this government did not sit on its hands, unlike Labor; the minister did not sit on his hands. The minister has substantially improved access to MRI at the same time as reining in unsustainable expenditure on diagnostic imaging that ran out of control under Labor.
—Oh dear, oh dear. 
—Senator Crowley could not care less what went out of control under Labor. That is why when she was a minister she was called `dozy Rosy'. Notwithstanding particular shortcomings in departmental processes, the overall outcome is a very good one for the Australian public. That is not what the Labor Party are concerned about. The outcomes for the Australian public do not worry them in the slightest. At each step along the way, the minister took action where it was needed and as advised by his department vis-a-vis: the overall agreement with the college; the tightening of the supply-side measures, particularly the statutory declarations; the HIC investigation and report to him; the 11 October cut-off of applications for equipment eligibility; the shifting back of the date for eligible orders from the budget to 10 February 1998; the commissioning of the Auditor-General's report; and the bringing forward of the review of MRI, the Blandford report. 
In short, the government should be applauded for the measures it has taken for they are delivering a good result for the Australian public. Not once in all of this—I have chaired all the meetings that have been conducted into this inquiry—have the Labor Party recognised the importance of this policy for the people of Australia. It will be interesting today to see whether they finally recognise the importance of this policy for the people of Australia. They failed after 13 years of government to deliver this facility at a reasonable cost. That is what this government has done. And now Labor can do nothing but criticise and be petty and paltry, calling for a minister's resignation over something that is right and proper and over something which he has been proven to be correct.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report No. 42 of 1999-2000</title>,Documents,20,2
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-05-10,"—Senator Knowles has had the benefit of a speech provided by the department and minister, who have had this Auditor-General's Report No. 42 into MRI services in their hands for over a month—plenty of time, you would think, to prepare a minister's defence on an issue like this. But this report is so condemnatory of the minister, so scathing of the minister, that no defence can be provided even if you have a month to look at the draft report provided by the Auditor-General. I want to briefly take the Senate back to the history of this MRI issue. 
Two years ago the Minister for Health and Aged Care went to a meeting at night in the Sydney office of the Royal College of Radiologists. It was one week prior to the 1998 budget, and the topic of conversation there was a cosy chat about what was going to be in the budget. Amazingly, no notes were kept of that critical meeting. The claim is that no secrets were let slip but, in the following four days, no fewer than 33 new orders were paid for MRI machines.  
For two years, the minister has fought desperately to keep the lid on this ministerial scandal, this growing MRI scam. The opposition, quite rightly, have fought relentlessly in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. We have asked dozens of questions; we have raised the issues at successive estimates hearings; and, bit by bit, we have winkled the truth out on this issue. The handling of the MRI issue is part of a pattern of Minister Wooldridge's. This is how Minister Wooldridge does business: he has acted without regard to the public interest; he has stonewalled when he has been questioned; he has refused to admit there has been a problem; and he delayed time and time again in deciding to establish a proper inquiry.
We have had three inquiries. We have had the Health Insurance Commission inquiry report released on Christmas Eve, which found that grounds existed to prepare briefs for prosecution in 19 cases involving up to 250 radiologists and that civil recovery of funds was required in a further eight cases. We will hear the full story of that, of course, only when those cases go to court. Then we had the report by Professor Blandford that was released on the evening before Good Friday. He confirmed what the minister was told, before he started down the road of giving private radiologists access to an MRI Medicare rebate, that Australia has enough machines already and another seven could fill any gaps in rural Australia. Instead, because of Minister Wooldridge's process, we have had over 40 surplus MRI machines and we have had a financial headache and scandal not only for the government but also for the radiologists and their bankers. 
Now we have the Auditor-General's report pushed out on the day after the budget is brought down to try to minimise the political impact of the scandal that is engulfing the minister for health in the Australian government. That is just a continuation of the cover-up tactics that we have seen from Dr Wooldridge for so long. The government knows that the Senate itself will not be meeting for another few weeks, and the minister hopes he can avoid scrutiny by hiding behind coverage of the budget.
What we have here is a pattern. This is the way that Minister Wooldridge does business. This minister has a very peculiar inability to spot a conflict of interest. He could not see a conflict in having his department negotiate multimillion dollar contracts with the people who were potential beneficiaries. He could not see a conflict in meeting with his friends in the College of Radiologists to discuss budget secrets. No, he could not see a conflict in appointing Dr Barry Catchlove, a man who had just ordered six MRI machines, to the position of chairman of the Health Insurance Commission. He could not see a conflict in appointing his fundraiser, Dr Rick McLean, to the position of chair of the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council on $25,000 a year. He could not see a conflict in awarding his friend and supporter, Dr Jack Best, contracts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars without public tender. That is the way this minister does business. 
There is a pattern with this minister of shonky political fundraising and letting those in the medical profession buy political access to the minister for health. Of course, it is the same with the radiologists, and it is going on. Dr Wooldridge delivered a budget briefing at a fundraiser in Sydney for an organisation chaired by his friend Dr Best. It is still going on. At this fundraiser was Dr McLean—they are all in it together. What did Dr Wooldridge extol at a recent budget briefing? None other than the work of Dr Best done at a cost to the taxpayer of $230,000 with travel expenses of over $80,000. Dr Best has undertaken a publicly funded stocktake of rural health that is now being used as a blueprint for the Liberal Party to restore its sinking stocks in the bush.
This is the way that Minister Wooldridge does business. This is the Dr Wooldridge pattern: `You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.' That is Dr Wooldridge's approach and he has now been exposed by the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General is scathing about the department, too. Look what he says in paragraph 34:
The Department's approach to risk management in the development of the MRI policy measure was uneven.
Paragraph 35 says: 
The ANAO concluded that the Department's management of the probity arrangements surrounding the negotiations for the MRI measure was not adequate for the circumstances.
Paragraph 36 of the A-G's report says:
There was a lack of adequate documentation by the Department of the negotiations with the College.
Paragraph 36 goes on:
Official records were not taken or maintained of some significant briefings of, and decisions by, the Minister.
Paragraph 38 states:
There were 33 machines ordered in the four working days between 7 and 12 May (Budget night) 1998, according to statutory declarations provided to the HIC ... the possibility of some prior knowledge of, or speculation about, the inclusion of machines on order in the MRI Budget measure cannot be ruled out.
Paragraph 40 states:
It is noteworthy that five of the eleven radiologists involved in the negotiations were associated with practices that allegedly ordered nine machines prior to the Budget.
Senator Knowles, in her prepared statement, asked where the Auditor-General says that Dr Wooldridge is guilty. I will tell you where the Auditor-General says that. He says it in paragraph 42 of his report:
Statements have also been made by College representatives who attended the meeting on 6 May 1998 with the Minister that, although the Minister did not reveal what measures would be in the Budget, there was discussion of the option to include machines on order as at Budget night. All but one have stated that this was initiated by the Minister (the other has indicated this was initiated by the Minister or the departmental official present) within the general context of College concerns about restrictions on sites ... On the other hand, the Minister, the Minister's adviser and the departmental officer present, dispute the radiologists' recollection of the meeting. They do not recall the specific matter of machines on order being discussed. Against this background, including related developments over the preceding month, the meeting of 6 May 1998 seems to have had some influence on the following surge in orders for machines, either directly or indirectly.
Senator Knowles and the government ask where Dr Wooldridge is found guilty by the Auditor-General. Where is Dr Wooldridge found guilty by the Auditor-General? In paragraph 42 of his report. 
If you do not like paragraph 42, go to paragraph 43, where the Auditor-General says:
... the ANAO considers that, on the balance of probabilities, the evidence does at least suggest that negotiation and consultation with the College representatives and open debate on supply control issues created an environment where some participants may have deduced, or actually become aware, that the Commonwealth was giving consideration to the inclusion of machines on order in the Budget measure.
That is what he says. The Auditor-General says Minister Wooldridge is guilty. Of course Minister Wooldridge should go. Minister Wooldridge should go because the Auditor-General has set out in scathing terms in his report why he should resign and why, if he does not resign, the Prime Minister should take the appropriate action. Perhaps the Prime Minister might even consider his discredited Code of Ministerial Conduct, which says:
It is vital that ministers and parliamentary secretaries do not by their conduct undermine public confidence in them or the government.
Dr Wooldridge has. Further, it states:
Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public. 
Minister Wooldridge has not been honest in his public dealings and has consistently misled the Australian public and the parliament. Under the heading of `Accountability' it states:
Ministers do, however, have overall responsibility for the administration of their portfolios and for carriage in the Parliament of their accountability obligations arising from that responsibility. They would properly be held to account for matters for which they were personally responsible, or where they were aware of problems but had not acted to rectify them.
Dr Wooldridge not only is personally responsible and personally has to take the rap but also has to take the rap for his department on this one. He was right in there, and so was his personal staff, from the very beginning.
This is the administrative equivalent of insider trading. This affair shows an abject failure on the part of Dr Wooldridge, a minister of the Crown. It has taken the opposition almost two years to uncover all the detail about the scan scam. But we have worked assiduously on that and we have done very well, even with all the attempts that have been made by Dr Wooldridge and the government to cover up, not to answer questions, not to provide documents and not to respond to orders of the Senate. But, finally, the Auditor-General has come down with a report that finds Dr Wooldridge guilty of the charges that the opposition have made, which leaves Dr Wooldridge with no alternative but to resign. The facts in this multimillion dollar scan scam are now public for all. 
—Who will do the fundraising?
—I do not know, Senator Ray, who will do the fundraising. But I do know this: the fundraising is part of the pattern of Dr Wooldridge's conduct. Dr Wooldridge operates on this principle: you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours. That is the Wooldridge approach to ministerial responsibility. That is how he conducts himself and that is how he conducts his ministerial affairs. He has to go. He has to go directly because of his revelation to the radiologists of the details of the budget supply-side measure and particularly because of the fact concerning the number of MRI machines on order on budget night. Five or six radiologists at the meeting have indicated that the minister himself initiated this discussion. You have a situation where the Auditor-General is convinced that this disclosure is what led radiologists to get their orders in before budget night and directly resulted in 33 orders for MRI machines in the four days prior to the budget. The Auditor-General says in his report that this minister himself was deeply involved in insider trading of market sensitive information with millions of taxpayers' dollars at stake.
But, secondly, this minister ought to go for his maladministration of his own department. He has to take the rap for the administrative failures in the department of health and the administrative failures in the negotiations with the radiologists—during many of which he and members of his staff were present. What a disgraceful performance from the minister for health. If ever a minister should go, this minister should. Minister Wooldridge must resign. The Prime Minister must ensure, under his much-discredited code of ministerial responsibility, that Dr Wooldridge resigns today.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-05-10,"—I move opposition amendment No. 1:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 26), after item 4, insert:
4A  After Division 6 of Part 5.7B
Insert:
Division 6A—Liability of a company for the debts or liabilities of a related body corporate
588YA  Liability of a company for the debts or liabilities of a related company
	(1)	When a company is being wound up in insolvency, the liquidator, a creditor of the company or the Commission may apply to the Court for an order that a company that is, or has been, a related body corporate pay to the liquidator the whole or part of the amount of a debt of the insolvent company.  The Court may make such an order if it is satisfied that it is just to do so.
	(2)	In deciding whether it is just to make an order under subsection (1), the matters to which the Court shall have regard include:
	(a)	the extent to which the related body corporate took part in the management of the company; and 
	(b)	the conduct of the related body corporate towards the creditors of the company generally and to the creditor to which the debt or liability relates; and
	(c)	the extent to which the circumstances that gave rise to the winding up of the company are attributable to the actions of the related body corporate; and
	(d)	any other relevant matters.
	(3)	An order under this section may be subject to conditions.
	(4)	An order shall not be made under this section if the only ground for making the order is that creditors of the company have relied on the fact that another company is or has been a related body corporate of the company.
The new division 6A deals with the liability of a related body corporate for debts of a company being wound up in insolvency. Proposed subsection (1) would enable the liquidator, a creditor of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, to apply to the court for an order that the related body corporate pays to the liquidator the whole or part of a debt of an insolvent company. The court may make such an order if it is just to do so, having regard to the matters listed in subsection (2).
—Did you write this?
—Thank you, Senator McGauran, for your contribution. I look forward to your informed contribution on this bill shortly. The purpose of subsection (4) provides that an order may not be made under these provisions if the only ground for making the order is that creditors of the company have relied on the fact that another company is, or has been, a related body corporate of the company. This amendment is aimed specifically at corporate entities which seek to restructure and avoid their financial responsibility to employees. More specifically, the bill addresses the circumstances of the corporate restructuring undertaken by Patricks in 1998 when sacking its work force. The employees of Patricks labour hire companies were left basically without any claim to accrued entitlements like annual leave and sick leave, redundancy payments and long service leave. These accrued entitlements could only be made against their direct employer, who was now a Patricks company in receivership. Any employee of a corporation is potentially at risk of this type of corporate restructuring.
As I said earlier, the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities heard evidence that the use of this type of corporate restructuring is increasing at an alarming rate. Labor does not accept that employers have the right to artificially manipulate their corporate entity to avoid their legal obligations to their employees and accordingly has moved this amendment. This provision will give greater security to employees in relation to their accrued legal entitlements. This amendment is necessary and it is urgent. The number of companies going into external administration is increasing, and it is becoming only too clear that those companies are failing to make the provisions for employee entitlements. One company with which I am familiar and have dealt with is a transport company called Gosch, who restructured themselves into two companies—one hiring the employees and the other contracts. They unfortunately were placed into external administration, and the company employees were unfortunately going to receive almost nothing as part of a corporate structure. I simply wish to make it clear to the chamber that this is not an isolated situation, it is not an unusual situation and it is certainly not restricted to textile companies or waterfront companies. It is a common standard tactic across corporate Australia. 
The amendment Labor is proposing is a sensible amendment. The court, in exercising its discretion as to whether to make an order that a related body corporate pay the whole debt of an insolvent company, is only to exercise its discretion when it is just to do so. Subsection (2) of the new section lists some matters for the court to consider. These matters respect the fact that in Corporations Law each company is a separate legal entity. However, the court should be permitted to raise the corporate veil between related body corporates in certain circumstances, and the courts have demonstrated that there will be circumstances when that is appropriate. In this amendment the Labor Party is also saying that there are circumstances when it is appropriate to make a corporation liable for the debts of their related body corporate. It is appropriate to raise the corporate veil when the corporate entity has been artificially manipulated to avoid legal obligations owed to employees. This new provision will give greater security to employees in relation to accrued legal entitlements. This amendment should be supported. ",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-05-10,"—The Labor Party amendment before the committee is very similar to the Australian Democrats amendment  which has been circulated in respect of this bill and is in the same terms as amendments I moved to the Company Law Review Bill 1997 and the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Bill 1998. I will briefly encapsulate the history of those amendments. When I moved those amendments in the committee stage of the Company Law Review Bill 1997 they were supported by Labor, but when the bill came back from the House the amendments were not insisted on by Labor and therefore fell away. When I moved them again to the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Bill 1998 and the Financial Sector Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1998, both Labor and the coalition rejected them. So I am pleased and the Australian Democrats are pleased that these amendments have come back largely in the form we put them in and that they now have full Labor support to such an extent that they are moving them. Given the similarity of my amendment to the Labor amendment, if Labor's amendment is successful, I will not be moving mine. If theirs is not successful, then there will be no point in moving mine. Either way, my amendment will not be moved. Therefore, I formally advise the chamber that I will withdraw my amendment. 
The Labor amendment has the effect of providing a court with a discretion to make related companies liable for the debts of an insolvent company after having regard to a number of factors. The matters to which the court must have regard are: the extent to which the related company takes part in the management of the company, the conduct of the related company towards the creditors of the company generally and the creditors to which the debt or liability relates, and the extent to which the circumstances that gave rise to the winding up of the company are attributable to the actions of the related body corporate. These kinds of matters have been around ever since the 1988 Law Reform Commission's inquiry into these very factors. So it has had a long gestation. From those factors it can be seen that it is not merely the relationship between the two companies that gives rise to liability; it is the conduct of the related company towards the creditors of the insolvent company. That is very important—it is not the relationship but the conduct. This bill, from the government's perspective and in terms of Labor's amendments, is very much related to conduct. That is an important point to make. 
The ill that we are attempting to address in this Labor amendment is entities structuring themselves in such a way as to avoid liability or responsibilities by interposing companies with little capital backing between creditors, employees and the company within the group which has substantial assets—in other words, deliberately restructuring themselves and then conducting themselves in a manner by which they can avoid their obligations to creditors, particularly employees. In 1988 the Law Reform Commission conducted a general insolvency inquiry. As part of that inquiry, the commission considered the possibility of making related companies liable for the debts of an insolvent company in certain circumstances, and the commission recommended that companies should be so liable. The commission produced a draft section and that draft was the basis of our amendments in 1997 and 1998 and the Labor amendment today. 
The government has made it known to us that the Corporations and Securities Advisory Committee, CASAC, is presently considering the issue of court ordered contributions and the recommendations of the general insolvency inquiry. I am heartened that that consideration is taking place. However, I have no reason to believe that the issues that CASAC is considering will differ from the issues considered by the Law Reform Commission some 12 years ago. We all know what the history has been of these kinds of transactions not only over the last few years but also over a couple of decades. We feel it is time to take action on the issue. Therefore, the Australian Democrats will support Labor's amendment No. 1 on sheet 1779 revised. ",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-05-10,"—The government will be opposing the amendment. It is interesting to have the history of this amendment from the Harmer committee from 1988 retold to us by Senator Murray, because Senator Murray continues to highlight the Labor Party's lack of consistency on this proposal. To the extent that Labor have refused to support this amendment almost year in, year out, for the last 11 or 12 years, they have shown some consistency, but the fact is that when their union mates have obviously put their heavies on to them they have changed their minds.
That highlights a couple of facts. As you know well, Mr Chairman, most members of the Australian Labor Party in the Senate are former union officials and well over 60 per cent of the voting stock in Australian Labor Party preselections is held by the unions. The unions have the ALP as a wholly owned subsidiary and related group. There is no doubt that the union movement still controls the Labor Party. We will see this of course at their national conference when the Labor Party are dictated to in regard to their policies for the next election wholly and solely by the trade union movement, who control the Australian Labor Party. They are very unlike the modern Labour Party led by Tony Blair in Great Britain. They have a leader who had the guts and fortitude to ensure that the Labour Party in Great Britain spread their network of people, spread their network of members, encouraged working men and women who were not members of unions to join the Labour Party and encouraged working men and women in the suburbs to have an influence on Labour Party policy. He got rid of the union movement's insidious control of the Labour Party in Great Britain. They had a forward looking leader for the next millennium in Tony Blair. They had a character who was prepared to recognise that the trade union influence on the Labour Party in Great Britain was an insidious dead hand on policy development.
In Australia, you have no such leadership. So policy is not made in the caucus room in this parliament; policy for the Australian Labor Party is made up in the back bar of the Breakfast Creek Hotel and in union meetings in smoke filled rooms by faceless men in the Australian Labor Party. That is exactly what has happened here. I do not need to actually retell all the history, because Senator Murray has done it perfectly. When Mr Harmer's committee reported in 1988 and said, `This is a good idea; this is what you should do; this is how you should protect employee entitlements,' what did the Australian Labor Party government do? They said, `No, we are not going to do that.' There were very good reasons why they chose not to do it, and that is why the government will be opposing it now: it basically destroys the entire concept of the corporation.
—It says that, if one corporation incurs debts and liabilities, another corporation—an entirely different legal entity under the Labor Party's loopy proposal—would be responsible for those debts and liabilities. Why create a corporate identity? It is not unusual to see Senator Conroy opposite, whose understanding of Corporations Law, financial services and regulation generally is not, at the very least, at the standard where he should be the shadow spokesman. He does not do his homework or study. He comes into debates with a cursory knowledge of the subject and tries to wing his way through them. Often when you read the contributions he makes to debates, it is embarrassing to him and the Labor Party but, because he is such a bit player in the Australian Labor Party, we do not seek to embarrass him. He has come in here twice in the last three years and said, `No, we are not going to support this.' He would not support Senator Murray's amendments, but he comes in now and says, on behalf of his party, that they are going to support it. But for years and years in government they did not do this. It is a bit like their approach to deficits and surpluses. They have become experts on surpluses now and on whether you can have a good surplus or a bad surplus. They ran on average $10 billion a year deficits year in, year out, for nine out of 13 years. We deliver a $2.8 billion surplus, the fourth surplus in a row, and they have the hypocrisy and the audacity— 
—I rise on a point of order. Mr Temporary Chairman, I cannot hear you making rulings because of Senator McGauran's interjections. I was wondering if you would be able to make him quiet.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I will take that into consideration next time, and I am sure there will be a next time, Senator Conroy.
—I think Senator Conroy was appealing to you under the standing order which is headed `The pot calling the kettle black'. I think the important thing to understand is that this is total hypocrisy. The Labor Party have all of a sudden become experts on surplus. This is from a party that have virtually never run a surplus in their life, in all of their years in federal government postwar. I think they have run about three surpluses in all of the years that they have been in office federally since about World War II. They are the biggest borrowers in Australian history. Year after year, they have spent tens of billions of dollars and, all of a sudden, when it comes to employee entitlements, it is exactly the same behaviour. What did Simon Crean say on the television about the budget when—
—What has this got to do with it?
—I will tell you what it has got to do with it, as the person has who has just raised a point of order about interjections interjects. This has to do with the Labor Party's hypocrisy. In other words, `Do not do what we did in government; do not look at what we did in government.' Except for Senator Peter Cook, all of them are very embarrassed about what happened under the Hawke and Keating years. When Mr Crean was asked, `What did you do with asset sales? What did you do with spectrum receipts when you were in government?' he said, `We are not in government; they are in government. Don't talk about that,' and quickly changed the subject.' Ask Mr Crean and the Labor Party what they did about employee entitlements when they were in government, and the answer is absolutely nothing. All of a sudden you have a Liberal-National Party coalition government that is doing more about employee entitlements in four years than these blokes even thought about doing in 13 years.
We have these amendments to the Corporations Law and we have the Employee Entitlement Support Scheme—two very important initiatives which will supply real, deliverable support for employees, support that you can touch and feel, and all in less than four years of a Liberal-National government. What did Labor do in 13 years? Nothing. Mr Harmer said, `Here is a report. This is what you can do,' and still you did nothing. It must be very embarrassing to turn up, if you are a Queensland senator, in the Breakfast Creek Hotel or into a trades hall anywhere in Australia and to have your union mates in the Labor Party saying, `Look, this coalition government is actually doing quite a good thing.' I have spoken to Greg Combet about this. I said to him, `What do you say to your mates in the Senate now about why they didn't act on Harmer?' I have got to say that Greg Combet will not say this publicly but he will say it privately: he will reinforce that the Keating and Hawke governments' performance in relation to employee entitlements was a disgrace. It must very embarrassing. So no wonder, Senator Murray, that they have been dragged kicking and screaming to support your amendment.
They do not have the humility to support your amendment. They have to write their own—or grab yours, probably. They probably found an old copy floating around from the Financial Sector Reform Bill. Senator Conroy probably told someone to find Murray's amendment, and they got the old white ink out and coloured it out, got their crayon out and wrote Senator Conroy's name where he had rubbed yours out. They could have at least said, `We've looked at Senator Murray's amendment and, after 12 years of consideration, we have come to our senses and Senator Murray is right.' But no, they have to write their own one, change a few words, get the white ink out, get the crayon or the pencil—I do not think they have let Senator Conroy loose with a biro yet: I think he has just gone from crayons to pencils. 
So the government will not support this amendment. I say that, very importantly, for all of the reasons that the Hawke government opposed the Harmer reforms, for all the good reasons the Keating opposed these reforms—because you effectively destroy the foundational corporations principles—we will not be doing this. The government will not allow the employee entitlements bill to pass into law if the Senate passes this amendment. I say again that we will not allow it to pass into law. So those senators who take the decision to destroy the fundamental corporate concept by breaking down the legal entity of a corporation will in effect ensure that the benefits of this legislation will not flow to employees around Australia. We have very carefully looked at how you construct a regime to protect employees by amending the Corporations Law. We believe that our amendments provide a significant improvement to those protections. We believe not only that the amendment would significantly hurt the underpinnings of the principles of the Corporations Law by breaking down the boundaries around a corporate entity but that it has a number of other significant flaws in it. They do leave bodies corporate liable for any debts and not just those relating to employee entitlements, and so it opens up a Pandora's box there.
The amendment is framed very broadly and will leave bodies corporate with an unascertainable and potentially unbounded liability for the debts of related insolvent companies. The proposed amendment provides little meaningful guidance to a court and, more importantly, to directors of companies in group structures. The amendment begs the question of what is just and from whose perspective the court is to consider it. In contrast, the provisions in the bill as it stands focus on the protection of employee entitlements where there is a deliberate attempt to avoid their payment. The protection is available even where the company in question is not insolvent, making it a proactive protection. The government's amendment targets the objectionable conduct in relation to protection of employee entitlements. It is not a bill that targets the liability of corporate groups generally.
I also say that the ALP amendment, while it on the one hand seeks to broaden the scope of liability, also has the effect of being more narrow than the government's proposed amendment. The government's proposed offence has coverage beyond group companies and related bodies corporate. It can apply to any person who enters into an agreement or transaction for the purpose of avoiding or reducing payment of employee entitlements. Under the general principles of criminal law, a penalty could be imposed on people who aid or abet a breach of the provision.
It is also important for the record to note that the Corporations Law already provides substantial protections against asset stripping by related companies. The law provides that holding companies can be liable for debts incurred by the subsidiaries while insolvent, and this places sensible and usable restrictions on the liability of companies for debts of their subsidiaries. The government's bill will widen this duty to cover uncommercial transactions as well as debts.
Senator Murray referred to the consideration by CASAC of corporate groups, and the issues that have been mentioned by me and Senator Murray would clearly fall within the ambit of CASAC's inquiry. There is no way that the government would seek to pre-empt the advisory committee's consideration of these issues. Why have an advisory committee advising on these important issues that are related to the amendments before us and then just ignore that work? You might as well close CASAC down. Very many eminent people spend hours, days and months of their time, cumulatively, advising the government and the parliament on these matters—as people like Senator Cooney would know better than just about anybody in this chamber. That is not to say that their decisions or opinions will ultimately be accepted by the government or the parliament; but why would you even have an advisory committee if, in a pre-emptive way, you just ignore their consideration? It sends a very bad message to the good men and women of Australia who put themselves forward to serve on those committees, only for the government to say, `Stuff you; we'll do it anyway.' 
We in this government will never ignore the regime put in place in the national corporations scheme put in place by the federal Labor government and supported by, as I again recognise, Senator Cooney as the then chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Committee who was responsible for that legislation to establish Australia's corporate scheme. We will not ignore the sound requirement—as you, Mr Chairman, would appreciate more than most in this place—to seek, through consultation and approval of any measure in relation to the Corporations Law particularly as it pertains to the former jurisdiction of the states in this matter, the approval of the Ministerial Council of Corporations, a body made up of the attorneys-general of each state, a body put in place to ensure that this is a truly national scheme.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-05-10,"—Senator Ian Campbell has spoken about the concept of corporations and about the fact that people's ideas on what should be the responsibility of corporations change as time goes by. I think that is correct. Corporations Law is a member of a group of issues that keep changing. We will be debating in the future and we have debated in the past laws that relate to workplace relations. They change as different situations arise. Matters dealing with compensation for people injured in the workplace is another area in which the laws keep changing to try to cover issues that arise in particular contexts. The Family Law Act is another one that is constantly changing as people—legislators, judges—strive to obtain a result that meets the need then expressed. And so it is with the legislation that the government brings forward on this occasion, that is, the Corporations Law Amendment (Employee Entitlements) Bill 2000. This bill put forward by the government changes the Corporations Law in dramatic ways and visits quite significant penalties on people who would deny employees their benefits—just benefits that they have earned through the sweat of their brow.
The concept of the corporation, as you know, Mr Temporary Chairman Hogg, originally was that people who were the owners of an enterprise and who were also workers in the enterprise who benefited from the enterprise and managed the enterprise would be protected from ruin if they went about their business in a proper fashion and without harming other people in a deliberate or negligent way. It was thought that people who went about their business in that way should be protected from ruin if their business did not succeed as well as it might have. Originally, the concept of a corporation was one where the owner, the workers and the people who benefited were all of the same identity. Since then it has developed to the point where the managers of companies are not the only owners; you have got shareholders and you have got people who buy in and out of the company to take such benefits as they can, and they are separate from the people who actually manage the company. So it has become quite complex. You have companies owning companies, you have companies that are closely related in the sense that they might have common directors and you have people who are directors of one being very influential in the other. It is always a case by case matter as to whether a particular company—particularly related companies—is related in such a way that it should take responsibility for the debt of the company in which it has influence. In other words, if we talk about this in terms of company A and company B, are company A and company B, although separate identities, so closely related that one should take responsibility for the other? That is a difficult question, and it is a matter that should be decided on a case by case basis. The amendment that has been suggested by Senator Conroy, 588YA, attempts to overcome the problem of when is A properly liable for the debts of B and when is it not.
This particular amendment leaves that question up to the decision of the court, and that is a very proper approach to take in this instance. The courts, may I say—if I can digress for a minute—built up a lot of the law that relates to companies; a lot of the company law that we now operate under began in the courts. You will remember the debate that took place in the eighties and early nineties about whether company legislation should leave everything up to `fuzzy law', as was said, which meant that general principles were set out in the act, the various instances that arose that led to problems were dealt with by the judges and the judges continued to make the precedents that they had up until then, or whether it should be black-letter law. I remember the Attorney-General at the time was Mr Duffy, a very eminent Attorney-General, may I say, and a very eminent lawyer. He, I think, favoured the black-letter approach, although a lot of lawyers and a lot of people in business said that the fuzzy law was the right approach. This section put forward by Senator Conroy on behalf of the opposition is one that is, I think, a fuzzy law type. It is appropriate that it is, because it is very difficult to state as a matter of general principle when a particular company should take responsibility for the debts of another company. This sets out in subsection (2) certain principles that should guide it. They are not exhaustive because they include these four points, but they are inclusive rather than definitive of what the courts might take into account. 
But, as I said before, the courts are used to this; it is their bread and butter. The Federal Court has been quite brilliant in this area, and it is a great pity that a lot of their jurisdiction in this area is going to be taken away following the Wakim case. But the Federal Court has produced quite brilliant judgments on this. The supreme courts of the various states have decided these issues for over a century. It goes back to the English courts, which developed the principles that we now look to. This is a good provision. May I say, it is not devoted simply to people who have been left in a disastrous state because their remuneration, their wages, their long service leave and what have you have not been paid. It simply says this:
(1)When a company is being wound up in insolvency, the liquidator, a creditor of the company or the Commission may apply to the Court for an order that a company that is, or has been, a related body corporate pay to the liquidator the whole or part of the amount of a debt of the insolvent company. The Court may make such an order if it is satisfied that it is just to do so.
Far from being a radical clause, it is a conventional clause in the sense that it deals with a problem in a conventional way. That is illustrated by the fact that it will be set out in that part of the Corporations Law that deals with these sorts of issues. I just go down the index of the contents of the Corporations Law in the area where this particular amendment will go. The headings read: Division 1—Preliminary; Division 2—Voidable transactions; Division 3—Directors' duty to prevent insolvent trading; Division 4—Director liable to compensate company; Proceedings against director; Proceedings by creditor; Liability of holding company for insolvent trading by subsidiary; and so on. This will fit neatly into this area and give the courts the proper opportunity of deciding when a company should pay up in justice. To simply say this is anything but a reasonable proposition is, I think, to say that we do not really rely on the courts of this land.
Senator Campbell was talking about approaches taken previously, the history of matters. I think it is fair enough to talk about the history, but in the end we have to make a decision in the light of the realities that exist at this time. If we go to the realities that exist at the moment, we have places like Cobar, Wodonga and Grafton that have become symbols of the sorts of things that can happen to workers.
—What about all the failures during the recession though, Barney?
—I understand all that. The Corporations Law had not been developed to the point where that ought to have happened. I did some work in the old days for the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, under the auspices of that great—
—You're to blame. Wally Curran's gone.
—You have mentioned Wally Curran? He is a neighbour of the senator and a most outstanding union leader.
—Still drink at the John Curtin Hotel?
—No, no; he has an Australian medal, an OAM. He was brilliant in the arts, brilliant as a union leader, brilliant as a political mind. 
—Wally Curran was brilliant in the arts?
—He was and is. And, may I say, secretary of the meatworkers union. And you, Mr Temporary Chairman Hogg, would know in your capacity as union leader that he was one of the great luminaries in the union movement in the past. But the reality is that the number of meatworkers who have been left without proper remuneration or any remuneration at all because of companies that go into liquidation and then, in a phoenix way, come up again is a great illustration of why there is a need to make sure that those companies that are related are, in a way that satisfies a judge, responsible for the debts of the first company.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-05-10,"—It is always useful to follow Senator Cooney, because as a lawyer, a legislator and an experienced senator he has a considerable interest and ability in the area of Corporations Law. I thought his contribution was helpful in terms of both putting this matter into perspective and enabling the issue to be aired. The parliamentary secretary made the point—and I said it was an important point—that we have to distinguish between relationship and conduct. Parliamentary secretary, in much of your rebuttal of the need for the amendment you did focus on relationship and how this amendment would put at risk the autonomy of legal entities and their ability to stand alone. However, I believe your focus should be on conduct not relationship. If you have a look at the government's own bill, it does focus very much on conduct. This amendment requires the court to establish whether conduct was such that it should take action. Not only would an employer have a considerable defence in these circumstances but of course within the court process—in contrast to black-letter law, prescriptive law—there is always the opportunity to appeal. And in the generation of the court process, case law will be developed.
You did put the rhetorical question to the Senate, Parliamentary Secretary, as to how you would determine whether something was just. My understanding of Senator Cooney's points is that he clearly said that determining whether something is just is very much within the ambit of a court's understanding and daily practice. It is not as difficult as you may have implied. If you look closely at the amendment concerned, it states:
When a company is being wound up in insolvency, the liquidator, a creditor of the company or the Commission may apply to the Court for an order that a company that is, or has been, a related body corporate pay to the liquidator the whole or part of the amount of a debt of the insolvent company.
It is very precise because it then states:
The Court may make such an order if it is satisfied that it is just to do so.
Then in clause (2) there is a very wide set of considerations that the court should have regard to, none of which interfere with its absolute discretion in this matter. The clause states: 
... the matters to which the Court shall have regard include:
(a) the extent to which the related body corporate took part in the management of the company—
in other words, it has to determine that there was a direct and very personal interaction in conduct terms between one company and the other by the same officers—
(b) the conduct of the related body corporate towards the creditors of the company generally and to the creditor to which the debt or liability relates—
those matters would, to a large extent, be issues of fact—
(c) the extent to which the circumstances that gave rise to the winding up of the company are attributable to the actions of the related body corporate.
If the actions of one set of directors and the management in the dominant company result in an outcome in a subordinate company which results in that company being unable to meet its obligations, clearly there is a link. To say that such a link should not be capable of jurisdiction by a court is in a sense allowing an immoral situation to continue—one that has applied in the past and that will apply in the future if clauses similar to these are not taken into law. The parliamentary secretary made the government's approach clear. He said that the government would not accept this amendment—that they would reject it in the House of Representatives—and that it would return to the Senate. That is a kind of threat. 
—It is a statement of fact.
—Yes, but as you know, the Senate will make up its own mind, and thereafter events have a certain train. I always wonder why, when such statements are made, the government does not consider the alternative possibility—that is, to improve or make better those areas of an amendment that they regard as inappropriate. I make these points to you, through the chair, Parliamentary Secretary, because it is clear to me from the minister's statements, the explanatory memorandum and the bill that you condemn immoral conduct and that you are seeking to address it. This just adds to the ability to address immoral conduct by companies who avoid their obligations to creditors, particularly employees. In that sense, to dismiss this solely because you believe it attacks the independence and autonomy of legal entities—because you concentrate on the relationship aspect—I think does a disservice to the cause or the problem that you are trying to address.
To summarise, I agree with Senator Cooney that this is fuzzy rather than prescriptive law. This is law which enables a court to make a discretionary judgment taking into account the merits of each individual and each particular case. I agree with Senator Cooney that it is entirely within the history, knowledge, experience and understanding of the courts to do this job appropriately. I do not think for one minute that it would put at risk the corporate structure and the normal daily conduct of corporations under the Corporations Law in our society. Therefore, having made such strong statements, Parliamentary Secretary, I am sure that you are not going to change your mind. But I would at least suggest to you and your advisers that, when this is being considered in the House of Representatives, you might consider the alternative remedy to rejection—that is, to improve this to meet any of the particular objections you may have, and then the Senate could consider that. For our part, we have, as you know, been committed to this for many years—we have been consistent in our support of it—and we do think it is appropriate law.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-05-10,"—I was not going to speak again, but I do want to ensure that Senator Murray and all the other honourable senators know that the government have very closely considered this option. It is something that has clearly been considered in detail by the department and the minister. As I said, it is also currently before CASAC, so it is not something that we are being pig-headed about and saying that we are not going to do. It is actually something that we have under close consideration. I certainly did not try to make this point—that we are not going to go ahead with this—in a threatening way. I think it is fair to say that Senator Murray would know better than most that, in terms of previous amendments to the Corporations Law, we have accepted a number of amendments that he has moved, and they have gone into law. Sometimes we have not been entirely happy about those amendments and sometimes it has been a balancing act between what we regard as the negatives of some of the amendments and what we regard as the positives of the rest of the bill. But that is compromise, and that is unfortunately what life in the real world is often about, both outside and inside this place.
We have looked at this option. We believe, and I will quickly reiterate, that the proposed offence in the government's bill extends beyond group companies and related parties. It can apply to any person who enters into an agreement or transaction for the purpose of avoiding or reducing the payment of employee entitlements. The amendment limits recovery to group companies or related parties and will most likely result in a gap. Transactions could be deliberately structured not to involve related parties. We believe it is seriously flawed. We have looked at the amendment closely, and we have had it before us for some weeks, as you know. CASAC, our advisory committee, are looking at it. We are not being dogmatic about this, but I do think it is fair that everybody involved understands the government's position on this, which is that we will not be accepting this amendment at any stage and that insistence on the amendment will obviously have the effect of this proposed legislation not becoming law.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-05-10,"—Mr Temporary Chairman Hogg, I would like to draw to your attention the previous contribution of parliamentary secretary Ian Campbell as you were not in the chair. It was a very broad ranging contribution, and it has actually drawn me into this debate. He canvassed many issues from yesterday's budget and its relevance to this debate. I would like to draw your attention to that because I would not want to be deemed to be wandering far and wide when the parliamentary secretary has made a very broad ranging contribution on this debate.
I am moved to make a contribution because some of the facts seem to have escaped the parliamentary secretary, which is surprising because the parliamentary secretary has been involved in debate on these amendments moved by the Labor Party previously. In actual fact, with the support of the Democrats back in 1998 on the Wallis bill, we had the numbers. This chamber actually passed them. It is not, as the parliamentary secretary is trying to portray, that the Labor Party has been tardy in the last few years in pursuing this issue. With the Democrats, we jointly successfully moved and passed the amendments in this very chamber. The parliamentary secretary himself stood up—and I was here that day—and sought agreement from the Democrats and the Labor Party to withdraw the amendments because the Wallis bills were being held up because the House of Representatives was refusing to accept them. We made it clear that, even though we believed in these amendments and in the necessity of these amendments, we would cooperate with the offer that the parliamentary secretary made to the Democrats and to the opposition to conduct a hearing of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities. The government gave its word that it would support the parliamentary committee holding that hearing.
—That is right. They did.
—Thank you, Senator Sherry. Senator Campbell's word was given, not just on his own behalf but on behalf of the government. The Democrats and the opposition withdrew their amendments and allowed the speedy passage of the Wallis package. At the time I thought it was very generous of both the Democrats and the opposition. After that, Senator Campbell, as I have raised with you previously, the election intervened. Following the election, I sought to re-move the terms of reference on the committee, as is required to re-establish an inquiry. I moved that at the committee, and to my dismay government members and senators broke the word of the government and the parliamentary secretary in moving that the terms of reference not be re-established. I have raised it with you once before in the chamber that this happened. You undertook to find out what had happened and to ensure that the members of the committee understood that it was not just a parliamentary secretary, Ian Campbell, off on his own personal frolic; it was a government commitment to hold the inquiry. Unfortunately, the Democrats at the time—Senator Murray, as I am sure you remember—decided that it was not an appropriate time either. I was a little taken aback.
—Because the bill was coming up. 
—Unfortunately—and we made the point at the time—the bill did not cover all of it. The fact that we are moving these amendments indicates that the bill does not cover the areas that we wanted to hold, but I accept in good faith that you hoped that the inquiry that would subsequently take place would cover these issues. Unfortunately, we are a little bit more suspicious of the government. Once those bills arrived, we found that—surprise, surprise—they did not cover the areas particularly relevant to Patrick. We were a little disappointed that the government members continued to block and defy your commitment and the government's commitment and would not allow us to hold the free-ranging inquiry that you had promised we would be able to hold. It was disappointing that that continued to be the position, and it was disappointing, Senator Murray, that at the time you took the position you did. But these are swings and roundabouts. We all have our wins and losses, and that was one of mine. I have had a few losses at the hands of the government and the Democrats. I would like to think there were more wins than losses but, in opposition, I suspect there are more losses than wins. There is a very famous one, Senator Murray, and you know which one I mean.
—Tell us!
—No. I would not want to mention the Packer family in the context of this debate. That would be making an unfair reference. The other Liberal party scoundrels, those in Victoria, are responsible for the Patrick debacle—the Scanlans and the Corrigans, who are all intimately involved in other corporate fraud in Victoria.
—Hang on!
—Sorry, Senator Calvert, did you have something to say?
—Bet you wouldn't say that outside the door!
—Senator Calvert, please. The casino and the Packer family are not benefiting from today's debate as they have from the largesse of this government—and, unfortunately, the Democrats—in previous debates. Those are some of the losses I refer to. I have been provoked by Senator Campbell's contribution. He sought to draw yesterday's budget into this debate, so I feel I must respond on behalf of the opposition. The deceitful behaviour that it is characterised by Patrick was equally characterised by the government's budget yesterday. Yesterday's budget portrayed a surplus. Senator Murray, I am sure you have had a chance to crunch the numbers, and you have picked up those rorts. I heard the Democrats ask a question on those very rorts today. Those rorts include pretending that an asset sale should be used as a revenue offset and included as revenue. That is the sort of shonky budgeting that has gone on in these corporations.
—What about the loans to the states?
—I will come to that, Senator Sherry. The sort of corporate shonkiness that this amendment goes to the heart of was evident yesterday in the budget. As Senator Sherry has indicated, asset sales were classified as revenue. Senator Murray, I do not think you were there last week when I asked Greg Smith—who is a fine and outstanding bureaucrat for Treasury; one of the most highly considered Treasury officials—about the sale of spectrum. He said that it was `of course' a capital item. Those were Mr Smith's own words. But the government turned up yesterday with a bodgie classification, did not want to admit to a cost and got flushed out because they were under so much heat in the budget lockup. They lost control of the debate in the budget lockup. Is it any wonder they have copped a bath in the public today? They were forced to issue a clarifying memorandum. Do you know what time they gave it to us in the lockup, Senator Murray? I am sure you got it slightly ahead of us. I would not want to suggest for a moment that you are their favourite, ahead of us, but I am sure you did not get it at five minutes to seven, as you were about to walk out of the lockup.
—Half past seven.
—Oh dear, you are slipping, Senator Murray. On your behalf, I will remonstrate with them that they treated you so shoddily in the lockup yesterday. But it indicated to us at the time, in the lockup, that this was an extraordinary development—that the government were on the run in their own lockup. They could not get out of their own lockup fast enough. They had been caught with their hand in the cookie jar; they were trying to have their cake and eat it. Then, as Senator Sherry has already indicated, we had the case of the classification of a state grant as a loan. You may ask: how on earth could you classify a state grant as a loan? Let me tell you the story, Senator Murray. Again, the sorts of shonky practices that companies like Patrick have been involved in are highlighted by these shonky accounting practices—and I know you care about accounting standards, Senator Murray, because you have supported me in a very important statement by this parliament about accounting standards. I know you supported me on that, and I know you have a deep and abiding interest. 
Unfortunately, because the government did a deal with the Democrats on the GST on issues like the small, struggling business of the Packer family—and, because of those amendments, the Democrats gave extra cash to the Packer family—the government got less revenue for the states. That was one of the outcomes. There were many others, but that was the highlight for me—the struggling family business of the Packers getting a $10 million subsidy, courtesy of the Democrats. Under the new agreement, the government were required to maintain the revenue base of the states in the transitional period to the full flow-on from the GST revenue coming to them. That amounts to $2.6 billion coming to them—that is $2.6 billion that the federal government have to give to the states to keep their commitment arising from a variety of changes. Did you notice that, in the budget papers, they very kindly set your amendments aside? They have even described, in a budget document, `the Democrat amendments'. Wasn't that good of them? I am sure you welcome that. You are able to walk around saying, `Look, we did this.' Most others think they were just trying to drop you in it with the financial markets, but I think they were doing you the favour of giving you a bit of extra publicity, Senator Murray. I think that was their motive. I think they were very kind to you when they did that.
But I will go back to the point of the discussion: what we saw was the $2.6 billion broken into two separate transactions. An amount of $1 billion was accurately described as a grant because, when you describe something as a grant, you have to put it in the budget papers. What happened to the other $1.6 billion? It was not included in the budget papers; it is actually described elsewhere in budget documents as a loan. If you describe it as a loan to the states, it does not have to be included as a grant, a revenue or an expenditure. You might ask: what is wrong with the fact that they had chosen to pull this sort of dodgy rort a la Patrick and the fact that they had got away with classifying a state grant as a loan? We actually have a couple of states where we are in government so we have been able to check this out. We have phoned them and asked, `Could you tell us the terms of this loan?' The states have fessed up. They do not really care how they get the $2.6 billion; they just want their money. 
—You will never get the money back from the states. 
—That is exactly right. They do not care how it is classified; they, frankly, could not care less how this particular money that comes to them is classified from the Commonwealth end. They have told us that in three years time, when they pay back their loan, do you know what the government have agreed to do? Up their grants in three years time by the amount of the loan they are paying back. 
—It sounds like a deferral of an expenditure to me. 
—Yes, it does sound like the deferral of an expenditure. It is the exact sort of shonky practice that Patrick and a variety of corporations in this country are being investigated for at various stages by ASIC. That is exactly the sort of behaviour that ASIC traditionally investigate, and this government has been caught red-handed. What we have is a budget deficit of close to $2 billion. The third of the rorts, which I may come back to as time does not permit me to cover it right now, involves the Reserve Bank again. The Reserve Bank made $3 billion or $4 billion worth of profit this financial year on its various activities, which it pays traditionally as a dividend to the government. What has happened this year?

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2000-05-10,"—It is important to respond to Senator Conroy's comments on the promise by the government that there would be an inquiry into the issue of employee entitlements and also to respond to his comments on the terms of reference of that inquiry. The first point that needs to be made is that promised inquiry—I understand that promise was made by Senator Ian Campbell—was in fact delivered. The Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities initiated an inquiry into the issue of employee entitlements in the middle of 1999. 
Following that inquiry being initiated, we became aware as a committee that the government intended to legislate in this field. Therefore, the committee agreed to defer that inquiry pending the provision of that legislation. I have to say that decision to defer the inquiry was agreed to by Senator Murray, and it was also agreed to by a member of staff in Senator Conroy's office. Although Senator Conroy himself was overseas at the time, the matter was raised with his office and his office agreed to accept the deferral of that inquiry pending the legislation. Subsequently, the committee prepared an issues paper on the matter of employee entitlements based on the submissions which we had received. Having already advertised for submissions with regard to our pending inquiry, we prepared an issues paper based on those submissions, and that issues paper was provided to Ministers Reith and Hockey to assist them in the preparation of the legislation. So that is the chain of events in terms of the inquiry.
When the Corporations Law Amendment (Employee Entitlements) Bill 2000 came forward this year, we proceeded with our inquiry into that legislation. Senator Conroy has said that the terms of reference for that inquiry were not adequate. In actual fact, the terms of reference under which that inquiry was conducted were the exact terms of reference that were initiated by Senator O'Brien in this chamber in referring the bill to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities for inquiry. I had actually drafted terms of reference to initiate an inquiry into the legislation on the part of the committee but, overlapping that, the Senate itself referred the matter to the committee. In the final wash-up, the terms of reference that applied were the terms of reference as moved by Senator O'Brien and determined by the Senate chamber. Senator Conroy has absolutely no grounds for complaint with regard to whether or not the inquiry was adequate and in particular whether or not the terms of reference were adequate, because they were the terms of reference that came from his side of the chamber.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-05-10,"—I must respond to Senator Chapman's very, very misleading response. 
—They are the facts. 
—The facts are that I moved after the election for the re-establishment of the inquiry and that before the election we had gone as far as setting a hearing date and drawing up a witness list, as you well know. That was how far down the track we had gone in the inquiry on agreed terms of reference before the election intervened. Those are the facts. Then, after the election, when I sought to re-establish that inquiry with the original terms of reference, that is when you ratted on the government and you ratted on the word of the parliamentary secretary—that is when you defied them and you voted me down. And you did so, unfortunately, with the support of the Democrats at the time. Those are the facts. 
—They are not. Go and check with your own office. 
—Then we get to the purported agreement that Senator Chapman was good enough one day to phone my office and speak to my staff while I was overseas. What a coincidence, Senator Chapman. I happen to be overseas, and you happen to make the phone call to my office.
—I was overseas myself.
—And you made no attempt to contact me personally. I do have a mobile phone, you do have my number and you know, as I do, that you can leave messages and it is possible to get return phone calls—this technology is wonderful. But, no, you decide you will just phone up and allegedly speak to my office. I do not want to call you a liar, Senator Chapman, but if you force me to I will. I will leave it as we have discussed previously and say that what took place was a misunderstanding, but at no stage did the Labor Party agree to the terms of reference you claim we agreed to. I am prepared to leave it as a misunderstanding.  
 (Senator Hogg)—Order! Senator Conroy, address your remarks through the chair.
—I am prepared, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to leave it as just a genuine misunderstanding because both parties were overseas at the time and communications were affected. I am prepared to leave it at that, Senator Chapman, but if you want to insist then I will defend the integrity of my office. I am prepared to leave it as just a genuine misunderstanding.
However, the terms of reference that were finally agreed to were not the terms of reference that were originally sought and, more importantly, originally agreed to by the committee and you. It was made quite clear prior to the last election that we were seeking an investigation into the Patrick situation and the government agreed, and last time I checked you were part of that government. I would have expected you to honour the word of Senator Campbell and honour the word of the government. So those are the facts. The inquiry did not take place in the terms that had been previously agreed to.
—I am being provoked, Mr Temporary Chairman, so I will respond. Senator Chapman, you may not have been in the chamber when the legislation was voted on and the amendments were passed, and then Senator Campbell stood up and sought the goodwill of the Democrats and the opposition to withdraw our successful amendments because there was a bipartisan agreed desire to pass the Wallis bills urgently. It was the goodwill sought by Senator Campbell that led to you voting to establish the terms of reference that you originally agreed to. Then, after the election, when I sought to re-establish the inquiry on the same basis that you had previously agreed to, you voted me down. Those facts are all on the record of the committee and I will willingly debate with you the minutes of the committee.
Senator Chapman, you have come in here and tried to misrepresent what transpired and you have said that you did not defy the government. Maybe you got the fix in from the government and they said, `Make them wait for the legislation.' Even after the legislation came out, we indicated that we were not happy with it. It did not cover the issues that we sought to go to. You still refused to allow us the original terms of reference which you had previously agreed to. We considered that you acted in bad faith. We raised it in the chamber, as Senator Campbell well knows. I actually took him through the sequence of events and explained that it seemed there was a communication problem with the commitment given in this chamber and recorded in Hansard that we could hold an inquiry on the terms that we desired and that had been set out in that bill. But Senator Campbell indicated to us, when it was raised the second time, that he believed he had given his word. 
Senator Campbell is a man of honour; I have no doubt about his word. Each and every other time Senator Campbell has stood up in here and given his word on behalf of the government, Senator Campbell's word—whether or not he has been directly involved in the delivery—or the government's word has been kept. Senator Chapman, you and the coalition members on that committee are guilty of defying Senator Campbell's word and causing his name to be sullied in this unfortunate fashion. I do not hold Senator Campbell responsible for this particular act. I do not hold Senator Campbell responsible for your conduct. I hold you responsible for your conduct—no-one other than you.
—You should leave the Senate and go on the stage.
—Thank you for your endorsement, Senator Chapman; I appreciate your confidence. I am not as confident in my capacities in the way you are suggesting. 
—I appreciate your support as well, Senator Calvert. I am, again, not as confident in my capacities in that field. I would like to return to the third rort that I was talking about. The Reserve Bank made a $3 billion or $4 billion profit in this financial year which they have remitted to the government as a dividend, as is the requirement. What has come to light in the last 48 hours is that the Reserve Bank have held back nearly $700 million of dividend for the purposes of giving it to the government in the next financial year. So if you take the $1.6 billion rort of misclassified expenditure—that is, misclassifying a loan so that it does not look like a grant—add the near $700 million of Reserve Bank dividend that should be rightfully classified as receipts in this financial year but you are rorting the system and having it delivered next financial year, and then take out the asset sales money, which Greg Smith from the Treasury defined as a capital asset just last week, you actually find that this government is shonkily trying to pretend it is running a surplus when in actual fact it is running a $2 billion deficit. Those are the true figures. As the Trade Practices Act and other acts of parliament do not apply to government accounting, there is no redress for ordinary Australians—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order: we have now had Senator Conroy speaking for about 25 minutes on a range of issues, none of which have anything to do with the bill before the chamber. I think at some stage he should be asked to make some remark that at least bears some resemblance to the employee entitlements bill which is before us at the moment.
—On the point of order: as I indicated at the beginning of my first contribution, Senator Campbell ranged widely over budgetary matters.
—What about Simon Crean last night? How did Simon Crean last night on the radio get into a debate on this issue if you were not ranging widely, Senator Campbell?
—I was happy to allow the flow of the debate. I am not afraid of the debate.
—Order! Senator Conroy, what is your point?
—My point is that a consistent position should be adopted by the chair. Senator Campbell was allowed to range widely, and I simply seek the same latitude as Senator Campbell received from the previous chair. Mr Temporary Chairman, you unfortunately were not here to witness or listen to all of Senator Campbell's contribution.
—On the point of order, I draw your attention to the amendment that is before the chair, Senator Conroy. I understand that there has been a wide-ranging debate on this issue but, nonetheless, you should at least draw your remarks to the issue that is before the chair. I think the wide-ranging debate has been tolerated by me on both sides.
—You had better read the Hansard to determine whether it was wide ranging.
—Once again, the parliamentary secretary is defying the chair in a flagrant manner.
—Senator Conroy, I am not asking you to make any interpretations. I have ruled on the point of order. I am drawing your attention to the amendment that is before the chair and asking you to contain your remarks to the debate that is currently before the chair, given the context in which other remarks have been made before the chair and previously to other chairs prior to my assuming the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. I was just making the point that the sort of corporate shenanigans that this amendment is trying to catch include trying to mislead shareholders and mislead workers with accounting shonkiness, which this government has displayed in the last 48 hours. If this government were forced to adhere to the same standards which now will be delivered by this bill for the protection of workers, ASIC would have been knocking on the Treasurer's door last night seeking an explanation for the sorts of outrageous misrepresentations and corporate accounting shenanigans that we have seen in the Patrick case. 
Do not let the Patrick case be forgotten. Time is a great healer. But those who were involved and who went down to the docks—and I know, Senator Cooney, you were down at the docks, and I visited the docks on occasion—would know of the sort of shenanigans that we are trying to stop with this bill: the dogs on chains, the balaclavas, the un-Australian acts, this government being in the dock on conspiracy to breach its own laws. That is the sort of behaviour which this amendment seeks to stamp out—how this government was complicit in having ordinary Australians sacked simply because they were members of an union. The Prime Minister even admitted that every single union member had to be sacked. It did not matter whether they were involved in an industrial dispute with Patrick or not. It did not matter whether there were world-leading productivity issues at stake. It did not matter that the company had not put any money into upgrading its machinery and equipment and, therefore, that you could not achieve world productivity standards. It made no difference. The Prime Minister said, `Every unionist has got to go'—clearly in breach of his own laws.
So this amendment is designed to catch the sorts of shenanigans of Patrick, the sort of corporate spivery of Scanlan and Corrigan—Liberal Party mates in Victoria who have been in it up to their necks in a whole range of corporate scams—and the sorts of scams that this government has been caught red-handed with yesterday on the budget. This amendment deserves the support of this chamber. This amendment deserves the support of the government. I welcome Senator Murray's support, and I hope that we can conclude this debate reasonably soon.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-05-10,"—Apropos of what Senator Campbell has said and as Senator Conroy has said about Senator Campbell, I wish to say that Senator Campbell is a person who does look at these matters fully and with consideration. He said that, nevertheless, the government would not be looking at the amendments put forward by the opposition. Of the amendments put forward by the opposition, this particular one, proposed section 588YA, attempts to make a company responsible for money that is owed by another company to which it is related, in a way that is fair and just. Senator Campbell was concerned that this would hit at the heart of the concept behind corporations.
Perhaps I might say for a start that corporations are very much the subject of legislation of the parliament. I think that originally we may have had some charter from the king. But, fundamentally, corporations are creations of statute. In that sense, parliament can make them, and break them for that matter—not that it would ever want to break them. But certainly parliament would want to restrain them, and that is proper for parliament to do since companies are the creature of the legislative process.
The proposed government amendments show just how serious it is about these matters. Proposed section 596AB—entering into agreements or transactions to avoid employee entitlements—says:
(1)	A person must not enter into a relevant agreement or a transaction with the intention of, or with intentions that include the intention of:
(a) preventing the recovery of the entitlements of employees of a company; or
(b) significantly reducing the amount of the entitlements of employees of a company that can be recovered.
So this is proposing that people should not go about planning things in such a way that anybody who is owed money by companies—and we having been talking about employees here—should be denied what is rightfully theirs by some person, or a group of persons, entering into agreements and transactions to ensure that those creditors and those employees in particular do not get what is duly theirs. The penalty proposed for people who commit that offence is, according to schedule 3 of the bill, 1,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 10 years, or both. That is a very heavy penalty and shows the significance that is placed on this by the government. Subsection 2 of proposed section 596AB states that this applies: 
... even if:
(a) the company is not a party to the agreement or transaction; or
(b) the agreement or transaction is approved by a court.
The scheme is that anybody who enters into an agreement or transaction that will deny a worker his or her entitlements, his or her wages, or indeed any creditor of the company that enters into an agreement to deny them their true entitlements, will be punished, even if that agreement was sanctioned by a court and even though the company is not a party to the agreement. It would be sanctioned, of course, by the court without the court knowing the intention that lay behind it. There are a couple of concepts behind this proposal—one being that parliament ought to step in and make sure that the people who act in the way that is dealt with under this section ought to be punished for denying people their rights and another being that people ought to be punished, even though the company was not party to the agreement, or the company was not involved, as it were, with that agreement. So there is this concept of having persons outside the company made responsible in a very solid way for what the company does.
That concept lies behind the proposal of the opposition to introduce a law that makes related companies responsible for the debts of a company that denies its workers their entitlements. The opposition's proposal requires that the two companies—the company that has the debt and the related company—have joined, as it were, in an enterprise that results in this difficulty, or that in some way has a relationship to it because subsection 4 of this opposition amendment says:
An order shall not be made under this section if the only ground for making the order is that creditors of the company have relied on the fact that another company is or has been a related body corporate of the company.
So it has to be more than just a related company. It has to be a related company that in some way has helped the company owing the worker his or her wages, has in some way done work, carried out transactions, entered into agreements or done something with that debtor company that has led to that debt. That idea of one company being liable for another company's debts has precedent, and I refer to section 588B of the Corporations Act, which sets out when a holding company is liable for the company that it is the holding company to and so on.
So I would invite the parliamentary secretary and the government to consider proposed section 588YA going into the Corporations Law. As I say, it comes from a long tradition of one company being responsible for another. It comes from a long tradition of parliament regulating companies in the interests of the creditors. It comes from a long tradition of parliament trying to balance the good that comes from allowing corporations, allowing people who are members of the corporations, to take actions and to develop innovative products and services without the fear that they might go broke doing so and measuring that against the fact that companies that have their liability limited in some way can also inflict terrible damage on those to whom they owe money. I put it to you that this is a very sensible proposal put forward by the opposition.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-05-10,"—I will really try not to delay this, but Senator Cooney said that we were not going to consider it. I actually said very clearly in my last intervention in the debate that we have considered this very closely, and CASAC are currently considering this very matter—the most senior eminent body of advisers is actually considering this. We have looked at it very closely, as did the Hawke government and the Keating government. I think Mr Duffy may have even looked at it—it was just at the time when Mr Duffy was the Attorney-General—and he rejected it for the same reasons, I presume, that the government is rejecting it now.
The only other issue I picked up amongst the points you made is that you gave the example of two companies, company A and company B, being related and, to use your words, `entering into an enterprise to deprive employees of their entitlements'. The very case you articulated, I am informed, would be caught under the provisions of the bill as it stands—that is, company A and company B being related parties entering into an enterprise to ensure that employees did not get their entitlements would be caught under the provisions of this bill without this amendment.

(2)	Schedule 1, page 9 (after line 17), after item 5, insert:
5A  After subsection 1317J
Insert:
Application by creditor
	(2A)	A creditor of the corporation may apply for a compensation order.
This amendment means that if a corporation has contravened a civil penalty provision creditors will be able to apply to a court for a compensation order. Currently, only ASIC or the corporation can apply for a compensation order. This amendment will assist employees where ASIC has proven the contravention of a civil penalty order. In that case, a creditor can apply to the court for a compensation order if the corporation has suffered damage. It will allow employees to take an active role in recovering their entitlements where a civil penalty provision has been proven to have been contravened. Employees want that role. They want to know that their employee entitlements are safe or, if they are lost due to the unscrupulous actions of a director, that they can be recovered. Employees do not at the moment have that security. They deserve that security. This amendment will mean that the risk that the assets of a corporation will be diminished by the actions of unscrupulous directors is reduced. It will maximise the amount of assets which, in the event of insolvency, are available to be distributed to employees. It will enhance the opportunity of employees to recover, to protect their employee entitlements. This bill is an inadequate response to the issue of employee entitlements. More needs to be done.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-05-10,"—We are referring here to amendment No. 2 on sheet 1779 revised, moved by Labor. The Democrats have considered that amendment. The effect of the amendment is to allow individual creditors to apply for compensation orders under the civil penalty provision division of the Corporations Law. There are a couple of reasons we do not support the amendment, and we have conveyed these to the Labor Party. We are concerned with the possibility of the company and several creditors bringing separate actions based on the same circumstances. That would create problems with any of the parties negotiating settlement of an action if a full discharge could not be given to a dependant. Furthermore, the company could expend unnecessary resources defending multiple actions by creditors based on the same circumstances. We do support the goal of the Labor Party of trying to give greater power to individual creditors, but, from a technical perspective, we think this provision could create more problems than the benefits it delivers. Therefore, we do not support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS LAW AMENDMENT (EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,26,1

This is not dissimilar to some of the issues that we have all been grappling with about how we capture and protect and enhance the protection. I know the words sometimes do not always mean the same to us as they mean in a legal sense, and we have to be very careful how we frame these laws. We are very conscious that we are in a position to not cause unintended consequences. I know we have had discussions on other bills to try to find common words that we have been unfortunately unsuccessful in agreeing on because the legal interpretation of what we would mean would probably be different from that which we actually intended. This is something we have to be very conscious of. I am conscious of the concerns of the Democrats, and I hope that we are able to reach consensus on some words that do further enhance our capacity to protect workers' entitlements.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-05-10,"—The concept behind this is a good one—that is, people should be entitled to apply to a court for a compensation order in respect of the damage they have suffered or injuries they have experienced without relying on the goodwill of other people. I understand what Senator Murray has said, and whenever Senator Murray says something I always tend to lose confidence in my own thoughts because he is very forceful and very experienced and bright in this area.
Senator Murray—through you, Mr Temporary Chairman—I will put this proposition up. If you look at the sweep of history, starting off in the Middle Ages when the church was a very powerful organisation, all sorts of institutions, and people within them, grew up at that time who wanted, as it were, to modify its power. And then, when the monarchy was very powerful, all sorts of institutions grew up—parliament itself grew up at that time—in an attempt to modify the power of the dominating institution. Of course, parliament itself became very dominant in the 18th century in England, and there had to be all sorts of reforms brought in then. I think the dominating force in modern days is the corporation itself. If you think about the vast wealth that corporations possess—like the church and the monarchy once did—
—And the shareholders.
—And the shareholders, as Senator Campbell says, and that is true, but the vast wealth is not controlled by the shareholders; it is controlled by the board and the chief executive officer. It is just like the kings: they were not the only people in the various countries—England is the one that we are most familiar with—but, nevertheless, the monarchy was in control. Senator Campbell is quite right: companies do not consist simply of the board, the chief executive officers and the managers; they consist of shareholders. But the shareholders are powerless. They have their annual general meeting, but there is not much they can do there, as experience would show. They can do some things, but they do not have the power that the board and the chief executive officer have of some of these companies, which are quite vast and upon which our modern world depends. The creation of wealth comes largely through companies. People's lives are very much affected by decisions of boards—this is a point that has been made again and again—whether they are overseas or here. Look at the situation in South Australia with Mitsubishi: if they went, that could cause great trouble for South Australia. Look at the issue of the Rover corporation in England now: if they go, and if they are not held up by some foreign company, that could have all sorts of results for workers.
There is, I think, an argument to say that people who are affected by these corporations ought to have an ability to move against them in their own interests, just as a citizen is entitled to move against a state to preserve his or her rights. If a person is wrongly taxed, they can go to the AAT—the Administrative Appeals Tribunal—or somewhere else. If the state refuses to pay sufficient social security, a person can sue the Commonwealth in respect of that. If a person has an accident on the road—at least in some states—they can sue the government. Hasn't the time arrived in the development of corporations when people can move against corporations in the same way as citizens used to move against the state? It is in that context that this particular amendment is moved.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-05-10,"—We are discussing the A New Tax System (Trade Practices Amendment) Bill 2000, the main purpose of which is to insert a new provision in part VB of the Trade Practices Act 1974 that would prohibit conduct in connection with the supply of goods or services that falsely represents or misleads or deceives the person about the effect of the new tax system, specifically the GST changes. The first body that ought to be prosecuted under this particular piece of legislation is the government. If anyone is guilty of deceiving or misrepresenting or misleading the Australian public with respect to the GST it is the government, and they have spent substantial amounts of money doing so. We know that they have spent at least $360 million-odd, identified after some very good questioning through the estimates process. I think it grew from somewhere around $25 million in the morning to $361 million in the afternoon.
This particular amendment to the Trade Practices Act in some ways goes across section52 of the same act, because that particular section prohibits conduct in trade or commerce which misleads or deceives or is likely to mislead or deceive. According to Professor Warren Pengilley, who is a professor at the University of Newcastle, section 52 is worded in general terms and incurs no criminal penalties. The section is enforced by the sanctions of damages, injunction or wide-ranging `other orders', including corrective advertising, which can be made under the Trade Practices Act. Last year a new part VB, sections 75AT to 75AZ, was inserted in the TPA, which prohibited price exploitation by corporations during the new tax system changes and also empowered the ACCC to monitor prices from 1 July 1999 to 1 July 2002. I suppose we could call this bill the 10 per cent is 10 per cent is 10 per cent bill, with respect to which, frankly, the Labor Party has been able to uncover one of the great misleading factors of the approach of this government in the introduction of the GST. We know that the government has not issued a directive to the ACCC to prosecute particular traders should their price exceed 10 per cent as a result of the effect of the GST; that is clearly the case.
The legislation also introduced the price exploitation code but, because the Commonwealth's power is limited in this respect, all jurisdictions, with the exception of Queensland, have agreed to implement this new code so the ACCC can have the same functions as above with respect to persons rather than corporations. The explanatory memorandum states that the intent of the legislation is to: 
... prevent the possibility of consumer exploitation and excessive profit taking in the transition to the New Tax System.
Part of section 75AYA asks the ACCC to police the clause:
A person must not, in trade or commerce ... engage in conduct ... that falsely represents the effect, or likely effect, of all or any of the New Tax System changes.
When we look at that, we have got to look at what the ACCC has said, and we also have to look at what the government said. Back in January of this year the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Joe Hockey, made an announcement about this. He said:
No prices will increase by more than 10% as a result of the GST—that is our policy and that is the law.
Any rounding that increases prices beyond the GST of 10% is unacceptable. And companies that try to profit from the introduction of the GST will face fines of up to $10 million.
He further said in the statement:
Mr Hockey reaffirmed that if prices increase, as a result of the GST, it must be by 10% or less and many prices will come down as wholesale sales tax and other taxes are abolished on 1 July.
You would have thought that with such a statement the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation would have written off to the ACCC, which is going to be the watchdog body responsible for ensuring that his statements, the government's policy, is implemented, is followed. But no, he did not do that. We look also at what has happened in respect of the ACCC. The ACCC has said that 10 per cent is 10 per cent. With the greatest of respect to Professor Fels, he did make the comment that 10 per cent is 10 per cent is 10 per cent. They have issued price guidelines that say something slightly different. The price guidelines say:
... no price should rise by more than 10 per cent because of the New Tax System changes ...
In the supplementary additional estimates on 1 May, when the ACCC appeared before the Economics Legislation Committee, Senator Conroy questioned Mr Jepsen of the ACCC about this issue of whether or not the government has actually directed the ACCC in writing—that is, to make it law—that no price will go up by more than 10 per cent. The Hansard read:
Senator CONROY—So you have not received a mandate from the government to determine what those effects are?
Mr Jepsen—I have not, no.
Senator CONROY—There is nothing in the legislation, Professor Fels, that says the ACCC will determine what the effects or likely effects of the changes are?
Prof. Fels—I think I understand the question and, if so, I do not think we have had that from the government—if I understand your question.
Further:
Senator CONROY—Mr Hockey has been quoted—and I think everyone saw it at the time—in January or February—as saying that he has directed you that no price is to increase by more than 10 per cent. Professor Fels, that is not accurate, is it?
Prof. Fels—He made a statement something like that.
The next question was:
Senator CONROY— ... that he had directed you to that effect.
Then Professor Fels again said:
Prof. Fels—I think he made a press statement to that effect, yes.
Senator CONROY—That is not correct, is it? He has not directed you that no price is to increase?
Prof. Fels—Not in terms of a direction under the Trade Practices Act, no.
Senator CONROY—He is required put that in writing, isn't he?
Prof. Fels—Yes.
Senator CONROY—And he has not put that in writing?
Prof. Fels —No.
That again gives a clear indication. Unfortunately, the poor ACCC is under significant pressure from the government to conduct this scare campaign on business, to actually silence business in terms of the criticism and make sure that, if possible, they do keep their prices as a result of the effect of the GST within 10 per cent when in reality we know that in many instances that is not going to be the case. It is simply not going to happen. As a result of that, the government has embarked upon this campaign of changing the law, putting in huge penalties for the same thing, which is very interesting. The current legislation has penalties that are much lower. I have got to say—just as a side issue—that in respect of deceit and misleading and misrepresenting there are enough corporations out there now doing it. We have not got the ACCC prosecuting too many of those, and that is a matter I am going to take up with the ACCC in respect of some investment schemes about the place at the moment. I am going to ask them why those things are not being prosecuted under section 52 of the Trade Practices Act. 
I come back to `10 per cent is 10 per cent is 10 per cent'. As I said, the ACCC are being put in the very invidious position of having to run the government's argument for it. We have had Minister Hockey making statements that no price shall rise more than 10 per cent when in fact we know that that is simply not going to be the case. The ACCC have to look at these matters on a case-by-case basis. Professor Fels has said that. They can do nothing other than that. The reality—despite the ACCC having been put in a corner of having to say that they cannot envisage a circumstance where the price will increase as a result of the net effect of the cost of the introduction of the GST—is that the ACCC will not say they will prosecute a business if there is a case where that business can legitimately demonstrate that the costs of the introduction of the new tax system to them have caused them to put up their price by more than 10 per cent. Because they will not. They simply cannot under the law. And that is where this government is clearly misleading the people. That is the reality. Minister Joe Hockey's statement back in January was just a load of rubbish.
—Rear end of the horse.
—Yes, if anyone should be prosecuted, the first cab off the rank should be the government or at least Minister Hockey for making misleading statements. There is another aspect about the guidelines that the ACCC have come out with. Of course the ACCC have a big job. It will be very interesting to see how they manage given the number of complaints that they get. We were given various figures, but they receive around 1,000 calls a week. They indicated during the estimates process that they were able to cope with that—that they could swing more staff into action—but there are concerns when you look at the national complexity of retail prices and the number of potential outlets that could put prices up, as has already occurred. The ACCC have therefore already had cause to take action in certain areas on this. But when this becomes a full-blown issue after 1 July, one just cannot imagine how the ACCC are going to have the capacity—and I have the greatest respect for them—to deal with all of these issues.
I think it is abundantly clear that the ACCC are not going to have the resources to deal with this and there are going to be a lot of dissatisfied people out there. This is as a result of this government not being able to get this thing right in the first place. As I said, this government are embarking upon this campaign whereby they are just trying to scare business. There is no legitimacy whatsoever to this or, if there is—and note that the government are going to make it a $10 million fine for a corporation and $500,000 fine for an individual—I suppose you could say that the government know that people are going to try to rip other people off. That is what those fines have to indicate. You are talking about making the fines so high for this sort of practice that you must have some view that there is going to be profit-taking on this.
To go back to the number of complaints that the ACCC receives, it is quoted in an article in the Financial Review of 24 March that since last July the ACCC has received more than 7,500 complaints and inquiries, and the number is growing. A Dr Cousins is quoted in that article as saying that `last week the ACCC received about 1,000 calls'. I think that is an indication of the concern—and this is before the ball has even bounced on this thing. When we get to 1 July and thereafter, as I said, taking the number of the retail outlets around this country and the calls—
—I hope that they have a new switchboard. They might want to use Telstra.
—We want Telstra right on the job here. We want to make sure that everything is working, including mobile phones. 
—They might need Optus and Vodafone as well.
—Yes, there would not be a problem. I think all of the telecommunication service providers can expect an increase in business after 1 July, especially on the complaints line. They could well find that they could do a bit of profit-taking themselves. As I said, the 10 per cent is 10 per cent is simply not stacking up. It is wrong for the government to try to force the ACCC into a position of having to defend a policy that is not true. That is the case, because it is simply not true that prices will not go up by more than 10 per cent. Trying to restrict the costs of some businesses—that is, as to what they can include in their costs—is a deliberate attempt to do that because many of these businesses will have to get new equipment that they would not have needed without this tax system change. Yet the indication from the ACCC and the government as to what can and cannot be included in such costs is clearly inadequate. As has been pointed out, it will be difficult for a lot of businesses.

Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2000-05-10,"—I want to take the opportunity in the adjournment debate tonight to acknowledge the service of former Senator David Brownhill, who resigned from the Senate on 14 April after nearly 16 years of service representing the National Party, New South Wales and Australia. His service is longer than that of any other National Party or Country Party senator from New South Wales. The next longest service was that of the late Colin McKellar, who served 12 years. David served longer than his immediate predecessor, Doug Scott, who retired in 1984 after 11 years. After former Senators Cooper, Drake Brockman, Webster and our current leader, Ron Boswell, David is the fifth longest serving National Party or Country Party senator in our 80th year as a federal party.
David Gordon Cadell Brownhill—and I mention all his names because he is justifiably proud of his heritage—came into the Senate as a well-regarded and innovative farmer. He brought the skills honed in his previous profession to this place. He was extremely hardworking, almost tireless in his areas of responsibility, and he showed a level of application necessary for all successful people. He came to and left this place with a close, interesting and successful family. The Arnotts, the family of his wife, Julia, also have a tradition of community service. David's late father-in-law, K.M.H. Arnott, won a DSO in New Guinea. As a junior officer, this was an award that did not merely come up with the rations. David came here having been chair of the New South Wales National Party, and he had wide political experience and understanding of the problems facing regional Australia. He served on a whole range of committees while the coalition was in opposition, including the rural and regional affairs committee, in which he played a leading role in inquiries dear to his heart like the one into animal welfare. He is justifiably regarded as a great committee man, having served on more than 90 parliamentary inquiries.
He has always said that the highlight of his career was his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in the first Howard-Fischer government. He had a particular sympathy with and regard for the primary industry portfolio, where he was responsible for horticulture, wine and some aspects of quarantine, among other things. Funding for research and development in horticulture increased significantly during his term. He is somebody who makes plans for the future, and he always believed that research and development must remain a high priority if producers in this country are to remain competitive. The wine industry continued its strong export growth during his time, and he remains very interested in the product, probably both on a personal consumption level of some good quality reds and also in its continuing export growth. David was the principal parliamentary organiser of the National Rural Summit and then went on to chair the activating committee that prepared a report from the 140-odd recommendations. That report played a key role in the development of the $500 million Agriculture Advancing Australia package that received a $300 million boost in last night's budget. 
This package provided many things for agriculture, but first among equals must be the change to risk management provided by the farm management deposits, encouraging farmers to plan for economic and seasonal downturn by a tax-deductible and market driven alternative. David was a member of the organising committee for the Regional Australia Summit held last year. Last night's budget showed the delivery of some of the summit's work for regional Australia. This includes the health package, which expands medical training facilities to increase the opportunities for medical students to train in rural service delivery. It adds 85 new regional health services, provides support for small community hospitals and aged care facilities, and improves access to specialists for country people. It encourages medical graduates to commit to rural practice, and it also increases assistance to isolated children, relaxes the assets test and reduces country fuel prices. Along with the massive tax cuts from 1 July, there is a very genuine attempt by the government flowing from the Regional Australia Summit to maintain the infrastructure and opportunities of country areas. David played an important part in that. He always acknowledged that there were no easy answers and that there is no cavalry about to ride over the hill but that there is a bright future for regional Australia if there is the right leadership, particularly local leadership, in cooperation with the government.
I am sure all senators on both sides of the chamber would agree that David Brownhill was honest and straightforward in his dealings with people and issues. He laboured hard with his conscience, particularly over the euthanasia and republic debates. He was true to himself in both of these. He served Australia well overseas. He led a number of parliamentary and trade delegations, and he presented a good and decent face for Australia. I think the distinguishing aspect of David's parliamentary career is that he was a team player, not the sort to let his side down. Right through from the debilitating Joh for Canberra campaign until he was a parliamentary secretary for trade and primary industries, he was given responsibility for government initiatives and applied himself accordingly.
To conclude, I wish him and his wife, Julia, well, and I am sure that his skills can be further used. I would like to thank him for retiring now, allowing me to return to the Senate after a break of 10 months. Few people have a chance to be in the parliament. I have been given a second chance. I particularly thank my party and my colleagues, both National and Liberal. I feel privileged to have a second opportunity to make a contribution to constructive debate in this country, and I will not waste any time in doing so. David Brownhill did that wisely for 16 years.
