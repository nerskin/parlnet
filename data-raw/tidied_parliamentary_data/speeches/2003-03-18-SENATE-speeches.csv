"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2003-03-18,"—On 30 April next, it will have been 28 years since the fall of Saigon. People of my generation remember the Vietnam War mainly from the grainy black-and-white television images we watched as children and teenagers. Later, many of us studied those events as university students, and read about them in books like David Halberstam's The Best and the Brightest and Neil Sheehan's A Bright Shining Lie. The consensus of opinion—not just on the Left but also, I think it is fair to say, among the political middle ground at the time—was that the Vietnam War was a grave error of American policy; that Vietnamese communism was, in truth, merely an expression of Vietnamese nationalism; that the war was a civil war in which the Western powers had no interest.
With the passage of the years, that 1970s view of the Vietnam War has come to be more and more discredited. Increasingly, thinking people have come to realize that the people of South Vietnam were betrayed by a weakness of will among the West—a weakness made fatal by the disgrace of Richard Nixon. Had the American government not been immobilized by Watergate in late 1973 and 1974, would North Vietnam have violated the Paris Peace Treaty? Would it have succeeded, had it tried?
In his memoirs published in 1994, General Colin Powell, who was a commander in Vietnam, lamented the policy of American administrations in the 1960s and 1970s— both Democrat and Republican—by which American soldiers were sent into battle with one hand tied behind their back: constrained from finishing their task by weak political leadership, itself intimidated by hysterical and wrong-headed domestic public opinion. Had the West demonstrated the will to prevail in South Vietnam, how different would the history of our region have been? And, in particular, how different would have been the lives of the South Vietnamese people? Perhaps South Vietnam would have developed, under the benevolent influences of democratic government and free enterprise, into another South Korea.
But we know that did not happen. To this day, the people south of the 17th parallel have not known democratic government. They have not known civil liberty. They have not known free enterprise. It is not to the point to say that the government of the Republic of Vietnam was corrupt and illiberal. Perhaps it was. But it was a government from which healthy liberal democratic institutions could have evolved, as they did in South Korea. The communist government of Vietnam is a government from which liberal democratic institutions can never evolve, under which fundamental human rights and freedoms will never be protected.
This evening Senator Ian Macdonald, Senator Payne, Senator Mason, Senator Santoro and I had the privilege of welcoming to Parliament House Mrs Jackie Bong-Wright, the President of the Vietnamese- American Voters Association; Mr Trung Doan, the president of the Vietnamese community in Australia; Dr Phuoc Vo, Chairman of the Vietnamese Physicians of the Free World; Mr Henry Dang, Secretary-General of the Buddhist Federation of Australia; and Miss Dang Lan of Vietnamese Community Radio. I acknowledge their presence in the President's gallery tonight. Mrs Bong-Wright is visiting Australia to raise public awareness of the political persecution of Vietnamese citizens. I am glad also to acknowledge the role of Amnesty International in agitating on behalf of Vietnamese prisoners of conscience. As well, I wish to acknowledge the work of my good friend Dr Cuong Bui, a greatly respected leader of the Vietnamese community in Brisbane and Australia, in advancing this issue.
Tonight, Senator Mason and I will speak about the persecution of adherents of the Buddhist and Catholic faiths by the Vietnamese government. I acknowledge the contribution of Senator Santoro, who also spoke in this place, on 3 March, about other Vietnamese prisoners of conscience.  
The cases which I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate are those of two leaders of the Buddhist church in Vietnam, the Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang and the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do.
Thich Huyen Quang is the leader of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam. The Venerable Quang is currently held under house arrest and in internal exile. He has been in this situation since 1981. Although he is now an 83-year-old man who requires daily medical attention, he is denied the medical care which he needs. The Venerable Quang's current circumstances are the latest episode in a long tale of political persecution, which began two years after the communist conquest of South Vietnam.
And what was his crime? In March 1977, he wrote a letter to the then Prime Minister of Vietnam, Pharn Van Dong, protesting at 85 instances of repression of Vietnamese Buddhists. He did not publicly agitate. He did not stage protest rallies. He wrote a letter! And for this `crime', he was arrested on 9 June 1977, together with five other prominent church leaders, and charged with the crime of `opposition to government policy'. He was, of course, convicted and given a two-year suspended sentence. In October 1981, and again in February 1982, the Venerable Quang was arrested for defending the rights of his church. On the latter occasion, he was placed in internal exile, the civic no-man's-land from which he has never emerged.
A similar fate has befallen the Secretary-General of the Buddhist Church of Vietnam, the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do. He was one of the five other Buddhist leaders arrested with Thich Huyen Quang in February 1982. In Venerable Do's case, he was sentenced to 10 years internal exile after a sham prosecution and a process of interrogation during which he was tortured. In August 1994, Thich Quang Do wrote a 44-page document, directed to the General-Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Do Muoi, outlining the persecution of Buddhists in Vietnam. For that act, he was arrested on 4 January 1995. He was subsequently prosecuted for the `crime' of `sabotaging government policies and damaging the interests of the state'. Apart from the August 1994 document, the particulars of the charge against him included the allegation that he had attempted—presumably, without the sanction of the authorities—to organize an emergency food convoy to flood victims in the Mekong delta. He was sentenced to imprisonment for five years. After his release, Thich Quang Do was periodically harassed, interrogated and detained. In June 2001, he was placed under house arrest, where he is currently detained by a 24-hour police cordon.
Both Thich Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In the former's case, the nomination was signed by two Nobel laureates; in the latter, by some 200 members of parliament from the United States, Canada, Australia, France and Belgium. The persecution of these two distinguished spiritual leaders is symbolic of the persecution of the Buddhist religion by the government of Vietnam. The church was banned in 1981, and the government declared the practice of the Buddhist religion by adherents of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam to be illegal. In the years since, Vietnamese authorities have confiscated the church's possessions and records, invaded its pagodas and holy places—in particular, by the seizure of the Hoi Phuoc Pagoda in December 1994—and systematically harassed its leaders and adherents. Its two principal spiritual leaders, the holy men of whom I have spoken—Thich Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do—remain under house arrest and in internal exile to this day.
When we read of the events which led to the Vietnam War, we read of the persecution of Vietnamese Buddhists by President Diem's government in the early 1960s. It was a cause of justifiable outrage, and it was used by many on the Left as a moral foundation for criticism of the American policy of support for the Diem regime. But the persecution of the Buddhist religion by the communist government of Vietnam for more than a quarter of a century has barely raised a whisper of complaint in the West. We see yet another example of a phenomenon upon which both I and Senator Mason have commented before: that selective morality, which condemns with abundant vehemence the illiberal acts of governments in open societies, but is blind to the much more serious and systematic abuse of human rights by the closed societies of the communist world. 
As we speak, in the imprisoned land of Vietnam, two venerable old holy men are suffering tonight. They have been suffering for a quarter of a century. The Western democracies failed the people of South Vietnam 30 years ago. We cannot avert our eyes from the consequences of that failure today.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Human Rights: Vietnam</title>,Adjournment,7,1
