Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator Farrell today relating to a proposed plebiscite concerning marriage equality.


I think the failure of the Attorney-General to properly answer any of these questions is pretty typical of the failure of this government to deal with the real issue that is affecting the lives of many Australians, and that is: why they should be treated differently to other Australians who have got rights in this country.


Senator Farrell had asked about the issue of public funding of the 'yes' and 'no' campaigns for the proposed marriage equality plebiscite. Well, we know that there are some groups in this country that want to get funded so that they can get up and denigrate other Australians' rights to have a loving relationship in the same terms as every other Australian has the right now. This is unacceptable in a modern economy. This is unacceptable in a modern democracy. It should not be so. Everyone should get access to the same rights.


I find it unbelievable that a government that claims it is about the proper economic stewardship of this country would contemplate spending what some people have estimated to be nearly a quarter of a billion dollars, to have a so-called plebiscite that will not be binding on parliamentarians and will not mean anything to anyone coming in here who will be entitled to vote according to their conscience or religious beliefs. It will not be binding. It will not deal with this issue effectively or properly.


I would say that there is a quarter of a billion dollars that could be spent better elsewhere. And it is clear that the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has a view that is different from the view of the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, the Most Reverend Dr Glenn Davies, who said that the Prime Minister gave an unambiguous offer to fund the 'no' campaign. Well, after watching this Prime Minister in inaction—not in action, but in inaction—for 12 months, there is only one person you would believe out of that conversation, and that would be the Archbishop of Sydney. The Anglican Archbishop of Sydney had absolutely no doubts about what the Prime Minister had offered, and the Prime Minister had offered funding. And I am saying that some of the groups who are looking for funding want to use that funding to have government-sponsored, publicly-funded campaigns to denigrate our fellow Australians. That is an unacceptable proposition.


The view that I take and that the Labor Party takes is that we should not be wasting time and money going to a plebiscite that will simply generate hate and fear amongst our fellow Australians. We should be ensuring that we are dealing with the real issues in this country. And one of the issues should be that this parliament comes together and does its day job—that is: to come here and make a decision, as we have been elected to do, in the interests of Australian citizens and provide equal rights to all Australian citizens. Whether you are lesbian, gay, transgender or transsexual, you should have the same rights as every other citizen.


Why should our fellow Australians be subjected to a government-funded campaign of denigration against their rights as Australians to love a fellow Australian and get married in this country? This is an obnoxious proposition, this plebiscite. This is a plebiscite that has been forced on the Prime Minister by the extreme right in this government. It is a plebiscite that is driven by the right wing on a weak prime minister. (Time expired)

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:07):  I thank those opposite for providing this opportunity to comment on this issue. As a newer senator, I have not had the opportunity to put my views on this broader issue on record. I would like to use this as an opportunity to do so. For the record, I am a supporter of same-sex marriage and I have been public in my support for same-sex marriage for some time. I first advocated for same-sex marriage in 2011, when I was appearing in my capacity at the Institute of Public Affairs on the ABC's Q&A program.


I am not too keen to hear lectures from those opposite about where we stand on this issue and what we have done on this issue, because unlike many of them I have been on the record in favour of same-sex marriage for longer than they have. In 2011, when I advocated it, your Prime Minister was opposed to it and your party, in large part, was opposed to it. Many of you have come to the party on this issue in more recent times and I congratulate you for it, but I will not be accepting any lectures from those opposite about supporting same-sex marriage. You had six years in government to address this issue and you missed that opportunity every one of those years. You took no action to address this issue.


For me, same-sex marriage and my support for it is in part about equality, and I respect those opposite who put that argument forward, but it is also about freedom. I think two people who love each other and who happened to be of the same gender should have the freedom to marry. I do not think it is an appropriate role for government to prevent people who wish to marry from choosing to marry, I do not think it is appropriate for them to prevent gay couples from calling their relationship a marriage and I do not think it is appropriate for government to stop people standing up, celebrating that love in front of everyone and calling it a wedding. Having said that, I do hold genuine and sincere concerns about freedom of religion and freedom of conscious. I am very keen to ensure that those are sufficiently protected in any bill that does legalise same-sex marriage, whatever the mechanism.


On the question of the plebiscite, I think this is an entirely reasonable solution to a problem which the parliament has proven itself incapable of resolving. Over the last nine years, this has been one of the most debated issues in our parliament. It is an issue which has had many private members' bills and many hours of debate. There are few other policy issues that had been examined in any greater detail or at any greater length. I think a reasonable solution—which we took to the last election, which we won, and which we have a mandate for—is to have a plebiscite. I think that is a reasonable solution to the parliamentary deadlock that we have had on this issue.


On the question of funding for the yes and no cases in this plebiscite, as members opposite will be aware from the Attorney-General's answer in question time, this is a question which is yet to be resolved. It is a question which the cabinet will discuss, and it is a question which the party room will discuss. We have made clear though that if there is to be any public funding, then it should be equal.


My own personal view is that there should be no public funding for either the yes or the no case. If there is to be funding, in my view it should be the absolute bare minimum. I do not hold that view because I think advocates of the traditional definition of marriage will be bigoted, will be hateful or will engage in denigration, as Senator Cameron suggested. I think they hold their beliefs in a sincere way and I do not think they are motivated by homophobia, although there are some people in our community who do hold those views. I think those who oppose this change will be very careful in the campaign to be as respectful as they should be to ensure that their campaign receives the support that they would like it to in the Australian committee.


My reason for opposing public funding for either the yes or the no case is that I think if we cannot think of a better way to spend taxpayers' money than in a political campaign, then I think we are not doing our jobs. My view is that there are better ways of spending this money. If people want to raise money themselves to spend in this campaign, then I wish them the absolute best in doing so. They should do as any other organisation campaigning for or against community change or social change does. They are able to fundraise from their supporters to generate support for their ideas and to use their position in the community to raise that money and support themselves. I do not think there is a compelling case for taxpayer funding in this instance.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2016-09-12,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:11):  I really welcome Senator Paterson's comments and his personal opinion on the issue of marriage equality, though that was not the point about which this taking note was called. When Senator Brandis was responding to the question, he ended his comments by saying that it is not unusual for two groups to have different views about what happens in a certain process. Of course, that is one of the real problems we have: it is never unusual for people to walk away from a conversation and be unclear as to exactly what the intent or the purpose of that conversation was.


However, in this case I am slightly disturbed, as this issue of the plebiscite was raised by the government as their great response to the concerns about same-sex marriage in our community. They lauded the issue of a plebiscite and talked about at length. From the very start of those discussions, one of the simple questions that came forward was whether there would be paid funding from the government around a plebiscite. That was because our most recent experience of a plebiscite in this country—probably one of the few experiences of a plebiscite in this country—was around the referendum. In that case, through the whole process—it was not a plebiscite but it was asking the public what they thought of an issue before it came back to the parliament—there was significant public funding.


I remember when we had our Senate inquiry, at the very start of this discussion, around plebiscites and same-sex marriage. The issue of public funding was key in that Senate inquiry. I ask people to go back and read the Hansard of that Senate process. At the very start, this was a question that people were asking when the government decided that this was the way they were going to handle the process. I do want to quote Senator Brandis's discussion about how the parliament would handle it. He used a term with which I was not familiar. He said the way that this issue would be 'disposed' of by the parliament would be through a plebiscite. That was a position that I was interested in, that we were going to 'dispose' of the whole process via plebiscite, in terms of where we are going.


The ongoing discussion about whether there was public funding was key to the questions that were being asked by the community leading up to the election and during the election, though I am not convinced that it was a core issue for the election; but nonetheless this was something that was discussed. I know that people were interested. I was not at the meeting that has been discussed in the media, where there seems to be situation where the bishop and some other people who were at that meeting seem to have gone away from that particular meeting with a clear understanding that there would be public funding. That is now a view we believe that the Prime Minister does not share. At the same meeting, he and his advisers, walking away from that process, did not seem to understand that that was the kind of understanding that would be taken away by others.


It worries me that, on such a clear element of the whole issue of a plebiscite, there is this confusion and there is this misunderstanding, even after we have had public announcements of how much this plebiscite would cost. This issue has been the public arena since the very start. That is an issue that has been raised in this place, and we are still not clear about it because there has been no statement from the government except from Senator Brandis, who said that if there is going to be public funding—that was his statement, the great 'if'—that would be part of the decision that is made through their standard practices through that process. What we can take away from today is that, if there is going to be public funding, which we will find out about at some time in the future, we are not quite sure about how much funding and we are not quite sure how it will happen; however, if there is public funding, there will be a process in place to handle that.


I believe that this just continues the confusion. I think it continues the uncertainty in the community about how this will operate, and it does not genuinely reflect the levels of concern that seem to be around people about how this plebiscite will operate. That there would be a plebiscite was hung out as an election promise, but the details around that plebiscite and how it is to be funded are still uncertain. (Time expired)

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:16):  I have to start by saying that, in question time, the Attorney could not have been clearer about where things are at the moment in relation to a decision being made about the funding of the yes and no cases for the plebiscite. In relation to that, there will be an answer given once we go through the process we need to go through. It disappoints me that, on such an important issue, those opposite descend into a game of 'he said-she said'. That is the biggest thing—was this person right or was that person right, rather than looking at the substance of the issue. This is what we are taking note of today—whether someone said this or someone said that. I think we need to just focus on the substance of the issue rather than nitpicking about whether this issue is to be disposed of or things like that. I think we are losing sight of the bigger picture here.


I am not sure about those opposite, but I remember pretty clearly—and as Senator Moore pointed out—that the issue of a plebiscite on marriage equality was a feature of the entire election campaign. No-one hid it from the people of Australia; no-one hid it from members in this place or anywhere else. It was debated every day. I received emails from people in the community every day. We knew this issue was coming. It is not like it is a surprise for any of us. And of course this is part of it—the funding, which is to be resolved. The Attorney, in his answer to the question today from Senator Farrell, outlined that we would be going through a process and that a decision would be made and announced. There is not much more to it than that, unless you want to play 'he said-she said' and look for some sort of gotcha moment.


On this side of the chamber, as I say, it was an election promise. We made a commitment to the Australian people before the election that we would give them the opportunity to have their say on this important issue. We are keeping faith with them. We are not going to abandon what we said we would do, because I tell you what: if we broke that promise, the first people who would be jumping all over that would be those opposite. That is what we are doing—we are honouring an election commitment, and there are details to come on that, including the cost and funding arrangements. But that is what we are doing—honouring an election commitment. It is the most democratic way to allow Australians to have their say on this important issue. Everyone can have their say rather than simply restricting it to a few. I understand that as a contrast between the idea of having legislation brought into the parliament and a free vote versus a plebiscite; however, since 2004, I have read that something like 18 pieces of legislation relating to marriage equality have been introduced into the parliament, but nothing has changed. So this opportunity that we have as Australian people for everyone to have a say will be very different and, hopefully, the Australian people's will will be respected.


I think everyone would agree that this is the best way, regardless of where you stand on the issue of marriage equality. Whether you are for it or against it, this is the best way, as everyone can have their say. The most disappointing part for me is the fact that those opposite do not believe Australians can conduct themselves in a respectful way; that having a public debate means that we will automatically degenerate into a disrespectful and hateful debate. I have higher expectations of the Australian people. That is what we should be encouraging people to have, rather than assuming they will just launch into some tirade of hate speech against one another. We should be encouraging them to engage in this important debate in a respectful way rather than just assuming the worst of the people we represent in this place. That is the most disappointing thing about the questions that were asked today, and I encourage everyone opposite to take that back to their communities. Rather than assuming the worst, expect the best and encourage that. I think it is incumbent upon all of us.


As I said at the beginning of my contribution to this debate, Senator Brandis was incredibly clear on the issue of funding. What the government will do will be announced in due course once we have gone through the process that needs to be gone through and the decision has been made. We will then announce what is going to be the case. We can all drop this 'he said-she said' political game, focus on the important issue at hand and allow the Australian people to get on with considering this important issue. I am sure many of you get thousands of emails and letters from your constituents asking you to vote a certain way. As soon as we know what the details are, we will be able to move on and get on with the debate.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2016-09-12,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:21):  I too would like to make a contribution to taking note of the answer by Senator Brandis to Senator Farrell's question. The question was fairly clear: whose recollection was correct, or did the Prime Minister make a commitment to funding the respective sides? Senator Brandis has said, 'Well, it wouldn't be the first time that someone's come away from a meeting with a different recollection'. But, truly, who is correct—the bishop or the Prime Minister of Australia? I do not think a question gets any clearer than that, and it probably deserved a more concise and straightforward answer. My position in this debate is on the public record.


I have listened very carefully to the debate on this plebiscite issue and I am persuaded by the Hon. Michael Kirby, who made a prescient contribution in respect of this debate in a recent interview. He said:


The constitution doesn't provide for interposing this additional step in the law-making process. The last time we tried it was in 1916, 100 years ago, on the question of overseas compulsory military service. And we haven't really attempted a plebiscite as an interposition for 100 years.


He comes to that position as a juror, as a lawyer and as a judge. He said further:


We are not a populist democracy and we don't elect our prime minister or a president. We are a representative democracy who does things through an elected legislature, which meets in public session, whose record is kept by the Hansard, whose speeches are recorded, whose votes are recorded. That's the way we've done it for 110 years—


'And we really should do it this time.' I am persuaded by that argument. There has been an election. There is a government in place, and it should govern. It should take on that decision-making authority that it has and proceed. A plebiscite at a cost of $160 million, with equal funding for either side to add to that, would seem a little excessive to most of the hardworking taxpayers and the electors of this country. The really interesting thing is that the Westminster system provides for this parliament, the executive, to commit troops in times of war without reference to a plebiscite. 




Senator Brandis:
  Parliament doesn't commit troops.




Senator GALLACHER:
  The Westminster system provides for the executive authority to commit troops. We make agreements and treaties in this place. The Japanese economic partnership agreement, the Korea free trade agreement and the China-Australia free trade agreement are all made at the executive prerogative. The enabling legislation comes through these places. 


Why is it that on this one issue, probably the first time in 100 years, we need to spend $160-plus million on a plebiscite? The reason is that in order to get the mantle of prime ministership, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull had to do a deal, agree with the conservative wing of his party, that he would maintain the promise by the Hon. Tony Abbott of a plebiscite. It is very, very clear. His heart is not in it. He is on the public record in other areas committing to marriage equality and support thereof. But in order to stay Prime Minister, in order to become Prime Minister, he had to pick up this conservative idea, this $160 million expense, plus the funding for either side, in order to stay Prime Minister. That is as clear as day. 


Those on the other side can debate the issues to and fro on marriage equality. But in order to get to Prime Minister, he had to honour Mr Abbott's plebiscite arrangement. He is now in conflict with a bishop of the Anglican Church in respect of whether or not he promised funding, and, really, he could just use the executive prerogative. We did not elect him as Prime Minister; his party room did. Therein lies his problem. He could go out and put this to the Australian parliament as early as this week. He cannot because the conservative wing of this parliament would probably roll him. That is the awful truth.

Senator McGRATH:
  The government will not waver in our commitment to the strong and consistent border protection policies that have stopped the boats and prevented deaths at sea. Regional processing is vital to ensuring our borders remain secure. We have seen the disastrous consequences of weak border protection policies.

Toll roads are operated on behalf of state governments and are a matter for those jurisdictions.

Information related to project details is commercial-in-confidence in nature, and its release may prejudice Commonwealth-state relations.

Senator GALLAGHER:
  We will oppose this motion. Labor was not consulted on the words of this motion. While the motion supports transparency, which Labor does support, the wording would require disclosure of tender documents, potentially costing taxpayers the benefit of competition and innovation in tenders. Further, Labor supports proper transparency in all transport projects, not just toll road projects. Labor believes transport modelling and business cases should be able to be made public early, as part of project justification. The community has a right to know the reasons for chosen solutions to identified transport problems, but it should also be able to benefit from competition, to achieve value for money.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2016-09-12,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (16:08):  I rise to debate the MPI put forward to the chamber today by Senator Wong and object to what I feel is the abhorrent way in which those opposite are dealing with the question of marriage equality in this place, in their party room and in the community. The very idea that the civil rights of Australians should be subject to a plebiscite at all is abhorrent. What those on the other side are setting out is not a path to marriage equality. It is simply an attempt to paper over the divisions in the coalition on this critical issue—and divided you are, a mess you are. As a result of that division, Labor and LGBTI Australians can have no confidence that what you are putting forward is any kind of path towards marriage equality. Indeed, you have pretty much said as much.


In the last couple of days we have learned that one of Australia's most senior Anglican leaders has said that the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, made an 'unambiguous' offer to provide public funding for opposing sides in the same-sex marriage plebiscite. As we have seen reported:


A spokesman for the Archbishop of Sydney Glenn Davies said Mr Turnbull made the remarks at a meeting of church leaders earlier this year. 


""It is the Archbishop's clear recollection that the Prime Minister, in words that were unambiguous, stated that funding would be available to both sides on a similar basis to the republic referendum, thought the exact amount was not discussed,"" the spokesman said in a statement.


""The promise was later raised at a smaller meeting with [Attorney-General George] Brandis in March, who then asked what funding was appropriate, to which the Archbishop replied: the same amount as in 1999, CPI adjusted.""


We know that the 'no' camp is pushing for about $10 million to be provided to both sides of the plebiscite campaign. We have been told that the government has made those commitments, even though we have also been told that the position Senator Brandis wants to take forward is for no public funding.


On this side, we have been listening to the LGBTI community, and we are not in favour of a plebiscite at all, and we are certainly not in favour of public funding for a plebiscite, in what would amount to public funding for hate speech, public funding for a divisive and costly referendum. Those preparing for a plebiscite in favour of marriage equality have pretty much said, 'If a plebiscite is forced upon us by the government, then it should have no public funding.' Let us be clear: this is not a condition of support for a plebiscite, as there is no such support. Those in favour of marriage equality are getting ready for a plebiscite but have said there are good reasons not to support one. I certainly do not support one. 


What we have before us is a Prime Minister and indeed an Attorney-General who say they support marriage equality. We have on one side an anti-marriage-equality camp, who represent a minority of the Australian community, who want a plebiscite and public funding for such a plebiscite in a last-ditch attempt to stop marriage equality, and a pro-marriage-equality camp, who support a parliamentary vote, who do not support a plebiscite and who certainly do not support public funding for a plebiscite. As many opinion polls show, this is the majority of the Australian community.


The simple fact is: the very idea of a plebiscite is one that has been put forward by those opposed to marriage equality. What is especially galling to me and those opposed to public funding for a plebiscite is the fact that church groups opposed to marriage equality already have access to tax deductible donations through which they can channel funds for such a campaign. However, those in favour of marriage equality, LGBTI groups and rights groups, do not. We have no such access to tax deductible donations.


What do we know about the history of this issue? We know that the Prime Minister has been forced to adopt a position in support of a plebiscite as a condition on his leadership. How then, even though he purports to support marriage equality, are we supposed to have any confidence that such a plebiscite is a meaningful path to equality, especially when there is no detail? Right on the cusp of this question being put to cabinet, there has been no plan championed by our Prime Minister to make marriage equality real. That is because there are too many on the other side who simply do not want it to be. Even Warren Entsch MP has said as much. We have heard reports that when Mr Entsch was asked if Senator Brandis was doing a good job on the plebiscite, he said: 


I want him to be more transparent, more open, more inclusive. I have no doubt the Attorney-General is committed to making it happen but I want to see him work with everyone. I want to see him talking to the other side about their views. 


How are those of us in favour of marriage equality supposed to have any confidence that what you are setting out is any kind of path to marriage equality when even those on your own side do not see it that way? I am extremely concerned that a plebiscite, and public funding for it, will turn into a platform for people to attack, abuse and demean Australians on the basis of who they love and who they are—their gender identity and their love for their partner. The fact is that casual, unthinking discrimination and deliberate, malicious homophobia are still too common in Australian society.


I am not concerned here about Australians who have traditional notions of marriage. I am concerned here about people on the fringes who will use this plebiscite to say hurtful and extreme things about the LGBTI community. This is certainly what happened in Ireland, to the great detriment of the community there. Sadly, today, we know that two out of five Australians who are gay have thought about self-harm or suicide. A young Australian who identifies as gay is six times more likely to consider taking their own life compared to a sibling, a classmate, a teammate or a colleague. I find it deeply disturbing that we should have a plebiscite that will give a taxpayer-funded platform and a megaphone to the very worst forms of hateful abuse. It will add too greatly to the burden of what too many Australians already have to bear.


In my view, it is fine for me as a senator to make a plea to the parliament about equality. It is my job. I have heard a minority of extremists in the parliament—in this place—make just about every homophobic spray possible. It is horrible and it hurts. Frankly, this is not something I want young, same-sex attracted people to be exposed to—the need to go door to door to plead for their civil rights. This negative campaigning is not likely to defeat a plebiscite, in my view, because people will be repelled rather than persuaded. However, its impact will be lasting and damaging to some of the most vulnerable people in our community.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:18):  In 2012, I had the privilege of hosting the Hon. John Howard at a wide-ranging seminar in Perth. One of the questions he was asked was why, when Paul Keating won government in 1991, did the then opposition, led by Mr Howard, not object to legislation that the Keating government introduced in the House and in the Senate. His response was relevant to this debate, because he said this: 'The people of Australia decided that the Keating government should be allowed to govern. They won the majority.' Howard then said: 'It was not incumbent on us in our opposition to oppose the will of the Australian people.'


Why is that relevant to this discussion? Because, on 2 July this year, the Australian people decided that the Turnbull-led coalition would continue to govern for the next three years, at least, in this country. Nobody can argue that the coalition took to the 2016 election a commitment that there would be a plebiscite on same-sex marriage should the coalition win government. We did win, and it is a commitment that, unlike our political opponents, we will hold true to. That is the critically important point. 


When that plebiscite will be held is to be determined by others. We have had advice from the Australian Electoral Commission that it would not be practical to have such a plebiscite this year, it now being mid-September. As you and I well know, Madam Acting Deputy President, there is a state government election in early March in Western Australia, and I for one would not want the distraction of a plebiscite prior to then. If I had my say, I would be urging that the plebiscite be held after that date, but that is my own personal opinion. 


I want to make this point to everybody in this place: we went to an election giving an undertaking that there would be a plebiscite on same-sex marriage so that the people of Australia could make their decision on how this issue should go. There are not many plebiscites. They say that during the First World War there was a referendum on whether or not we should have conscription. There was no referendum; there were two plebiscites. The difference—the young people in the gallery should take notes on this—is that a referendum is held if there is a potential change to the Constitution, but a plebiscite is held to ascertain the will of the Australian people. That is what the Australian people knew when they went to the polls prior to and on 2 July. 


If people want to get this matter resolved, the quickest way would be to get Mr Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, to go along with the Prime Minister's mood and support a plebiscite. Unfortunately Mr Shorten is not going down that path, but I can say that the Labor Party has no high moral ground in this space. It is the case that the Labor Party is actually bound to a certain position, and that position is to oppose the situation we now have in this country—that marriage is between a man and a woman. 


You will hear people say, 'No, that's not the case; Labor isn't bound until about 2019.' But I would simply ask you to put that point to now Mr Joe Bullock, then Senator Joe Bullock, the then Labor Party senator representing Western Australia. Senator Pratt is now here, because she replaced him. As you and I both know, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, then Senator Bullock said he could not accept the position of the Labor Party on this issue and so he did the honourable thing and he resigned as a senator for Western Australia. So the Labor Party has a fixed position on this. We cannot have a debate and a vote in this parliament, because one of the two major parties has already told us how they are going to vote. The Greens party, and perhaps others, might also say whether they are bound to their position. We in the coalition are not bound. We had this discussion in our joint party room and we took a decision that the best thing to do would be to seek the confidence of the Australian people on a matter as important as this and go to a plebiscite.


People change their opinions and they are entitled to change their opinions, but I just want to make a point, if I may. In 2010, in the time since I have been in this parliament, the now Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, whose motion it is we are discussing here today, made this statement on 26 June 2010:


On the issue of marriage I think the reality is there is a cultural, religious, historical view around that which we have to respect. The party's position is very clear that this is an institution that is between a man and a woman.


Current frontbench members of the Labor opposition in the other place, Mr Bowen, Mr Husic, Mr Burke, Ms Rowland and Mr Fitzgibbon, all voted against same-sex marriage in 2012, as was their entitlement and as is their entitlement now because, as Australian citizens, they will be entitled to a vote in the plebiscite.


I have been asked what my position would be if, in a plebiscite, the result of the plebiscite is a favouring of same-sex marriage—changing what is now the law of the land in which marriage is between a man and a woman. I have said publicly and I will state it again in this place that, if the majority of the people of Western Australia, voting in a plebiscite, say that they want same-sex marriage, I will change my position and I will support same-sex marriage, because it is the democratic position of the people in my state. And I challenge the other 225 people in the other place and this one to agree to do the same—that, if the majority vote in a plebiscite in their state, in the case of senators, or in their electorate, in the case of members is one way or the other, they will commit in the coming days to do as I am committing to do and that is to change, if necessary, my situation.


A plebiscite, unlike a referendum, will not require the majority of people in the majority of states and territories; it will simply be a straight majority of the population of Australia. So I know very well that the population-dominant cities of Melbourne and Sydney will have a skewed opportunity and weighting in this debate. But I object vehemently to statements that have been made by leaders of parties that, for some reason or other, the people of Australia cannot be allowed to have their say on what is such an important issue. I also think it is disgraceful to speculate, postulate or hypothesise on how different people in the Australian community might react to the views of others. That is not the Australia I know. I object vehemently to party political leaders giving some sort of prediction as to what the mood, the behaviour and the performance of people might be. We have laws in this country—very, very strong laws—that protect people against discrimination or any other form that might be offensive to them. Those laws exist in this place.


I say very strongly that I have very little faith in those who are not prepared to allow the Australian people to have their say in a plebiscite. I hear all these predictions: 'The vote is so overwhelmingly in favour of same-sex marriage, that we needn't even bother having the vote.' Well, is that case? I do not know, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, and, with deep respect, neither do you. But what I can say is that this is an issue upon which the people of Australia should have their right to have a say.


It has been put to me that the cost of something like $150 million is a lot of money. Yes, it is, but let me put that into perspective. At the moment, this country is borrowing $1.2 billion a month overseas, not to repay any Labor debt built up between 2007 and 2013 but just to pay the interest. We are borrowing $40 million a day, when we were debt free in this country in 2007. So, yes, $150 million is a lot of money—it is 3½ days interest on the debt that we are paying now—to give the people of Australia their opportunity to make their decision on whether or not they want to see a change to the Marriage Act.


I do have to say that I have little confidence in the integrity of people on the other side who are likely to put the cases for which they so eloquently speak. Why do I have little confidence? It is because I have long believed that the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour. The recent past behaviour of those opposite is that of the scandalous Mediscare campaign leading up to the 2 July election, when it took an ABC journalist to call out the Leader of the Opposition and the national president of the Australian Medical Association to call them out. But did they stop? No. On the evening of 29 June an elderly lady in a nursing home in Perth received a phone call—not a robocall; a phone call—asking her what she was going to do beyond 30 June when the coalition government, if they won the election, would remove all funding for aged care and health care. That is the level of integrity we see and, if it flowed through to this other exercise, I have no faith in Mr Shorten's position. (Time expired)

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2016-09-12,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:30):  I rise to speak today on the MPI and the latest example of the extreme right dictating the agenda of the Turnbull government. Not only is the government trying to impose its harebrained plebiscite on the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer community but now we have to put up with the 'he said, she said' game about whether the government is going to spend millions of taxpayers' dollars to advertise these well-worn arguments.


Senator Back, in his contribution, made no mention of not only the harm of the plebiscite but adding to the harm of spending millions of dollars to amplify the hatred and the homophobic hate speech that will come from this plebiscite. Many in favour of the plebiscite tell us: 'No, this won't be the case. The plebiscite will be okay. Don't automatically assume the worst.' Let me tell you: we do not automatically assume the worst; we have seen the worst. Sadly, the strong anti-discrimination laws that Senator Back talked of will not protect us and will not protect, particularly, young LGBTIQ people struggling with their sexuality and their gender identity. It will not protect us from the worst of that hate speech and homophobia.


Politicians are often the target of social media trolls, and, late last week, I was. I want to share this experience with you to give you an example of what we can expect—what will be amplified and what will be broadcast through the megaphone—if this plebiscite goes ahead. Late last week, a person called Jeff contacted me. Jeff is a troll. I ask you all to not be like Jeff. Jeff said to me, 'How dare you stupid, ugly, ultra-corrupt scum', and accused marriage equality advocates of advocating the creation of a whole new stolen generation. He prefaced a sentence with, 'As much as I hate being rude to a woman', and then launched into some of the most appalling misogynist language imaginable. He finished up, threateningly, by saying:


You and your kind will not be allowed, nor tolerated to brainwash our kids and sexually groom them. We will never forget. Be sure about it.


Jeff, who is friends on Facebook with the Australian Christian Lobby's Lyle Shelton, is not representative of all who oppose marriage equality, but his contribution to social discourse is not isolated either. I have a growing collection of hateful correspondence to my office. On this occasion, Jeff needed to be called out. It would have been very easy to just delete his comments, but he needed to be called out because not only what he was saying was wrong but the community needs to know the sorts of comments that will be given a megaphone in a plebiscite.


So I told Jeff about the many same-sex couples and their children; they are wonderful parents with loved, loving and well-adjusted kids. And the response was overwhelming. Today, I want to share just a few of their comments with you. Liz said: 'So many same-sex couples have children. And while these attitudes make me angry, I worry about the hurt they will cause any of my future kids.' Another person, Real, said:


Gay couples are not asking anything but equal rights, no idea what he is talking about. My children grew up with 3 parents, their mother and me when they were between their birth and pre- school and then they came living with me and my gay partner as their mother was unable at the time to have them…We love our children and they always have frequent contact with their mother, there was never a conflict or disagreement and my children have grown up into balanced and happy adults. All I am saying is when love guides your hearts and actions, there is no problem.


Sarah asked: 


And what about the millions of children who have lost 1 or both ""natural parents"". Sure makes them feel great to be told they should have ""natural parents"".


And Mathieu said: 


THIS is a perfect example of why a plebiscite might be ""civil"" in—


the Prime Minister's—


eyes and in the Parliament where people's jobs hinge on their choices of words, but in the eyes of any LGBT person or their families, on the level of the talk on the street and social media it will be anything but.


So do not be like Jeff. But also do not encourage Jeff. Encouraging Jeff and the others like him is exactly what a plebiscite would do. Even worse would be to give the people opposed to marriage equality $10 million, on top of the $160 million plus that we have already been spending, to amplify their attacks. For politicians, we are used to it. Some would even say we are paid to cop it. But the others do not need this. A plebiscite would give a megaphone to the haters. And a plebiscite would tell us what we already know—that the vast majority of Australians are ready for marriage equality; they are way past ready.


Parliament should protect the rights of minorities not subject them to a harmful, hateful, non-binding poll. Why would you want to set such a dangerous precedent? The real reason is a sad reflection on this current government. We have a Prime Minister without the courage to stand up to a backbench that is stuck in the past. The plebiscite was a brainwave of the former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, to delay the inevitable and to keep us behind the rest of the world. Some of the most conservative countries in the world have already legalised marriage equality. Quite frankly, it is embarrassing how far we have fallen behind. Australia should not risk being on the wrong side of history when marriage equality becomes the standard across the world.


So what is the way forward?


It is easy. We can enrich the lives of so many Australians through a simple vote in the parliament. We could do it this week. We could hear wedding bells ringing before Christmas. There are a lot of bills floating around parliament at the moment, but the reality is that it will take cooperation from all of us to make this happen. 


It was pleasing to hear, in the contribution from Senator Pratt, the Labor Party's opposition to a plebiscite. I urge the Labor Party to completely shut the door and to make the announcement that they will join the Greens and join and some on the crossbench to block this plebiscite legislation when it comes to us in the Senate, because it is so damaging and unnecessary. To the Liberals who will listen, I ask them to put their internal disputes aside and vote with their heart. I ask Prime Minister Turnbull to allow that to occur, because we could end this so quickly. I ask everyone in this chamber and in the other place to listen to the views of lesbian, gay, bi, trans, intersex and queer Australians and to consider the survey that was done by the Parents and Friends of Lesbian and Gays Australia. It surveyed 5,500 LGBTIQ Australians, and overwhelmingly they said they wanted marriage equality, absolutely, and they wanted it as soon as possible, but they did not want to achieve it through a damaging, divisive popular vote. 


I think we do need to come together. We can come together. We can bring together the best of us. We can listen to the views of people who are hurting at the moment, who do not have the rights of other Australians and who are suffering because of this largest state sanctioned discrimination, which is being imposed upon LGBTIQ people. We can listen to them, and people can then vote with their heart. We can move forward. We could have a vote in this parliament next week, then this discrimination would end and then Australia would catch up with the rest of the world. Instead, we are stuck in this debate about having a plebiscite that we will know will cause harm, that we know will cause suffering and that we know is not the precedent that we should be setting for the human rights of people. 


We are talking about subjecting the human rights of a minority, of LGBTIQ people, to a popular vote. There are no other minorities that we are saying that this should happen to. The rest of us do not have to ask the rest of the country whether we can get married. For the rest of us, it is just accepted. It is how it should be for LGBTIQ people as well, so that together we can support and embrace their rights and really come together, because we know that love is love. We know that they deserve to be able to get married and celebrate their love with the rest of us. Let us work together and put it into law. (Time expired)

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2016-09-12,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:40):  You have to wonder why we are here still having this conversation about a plebiscite on marriage equality when a majority of Australians support marriage equality, as has been demonstrated many times in much polling, but, more importantly, when a majority of parliamentarians here and in the other place also support marriage equality. So knowing that that is the case, why is it that the Prime Minister is set on taking the nation back to the ballot box for a $160 million dollar opinion poll that will have no legal effect whatsoever? There is certainly nothing about marriage equality as an issue that demands that. Not constitutionally, not legally and not as a question of public policy do we need to have this plebiscite. 


As the Leader of the Opposition put it so nicely this morning: in 115 years of our democracy, 44 parliaments before us have managed to declare war, negotiate peace, sign trade deals, break down the White Australia policy, open the economy, float the dollar, build universal superannuation, pass world-leading gun control and legislate several changes to the Marriage Act, all without recourse to a plebiscite. So why is this different? What is it about this issue that means that we have to go to this very special public vote? Everyone here knows the answer. We know the answer and the people on the other side of the chamber know the answer. The difference is not the issue. It is not that the marriage equality is so unique and so special. The thing that is different is the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister wants a plebiscite because he fears the social conservatives in his party more than he wants change. The plebiscite is a ploy. It was dreamed up by the former, and perhaps future, Prime Minister Abbott and his clique in the 'Monkey Pod'. It was designed to push marriage equality off into the never-never. It was a way to look like you were doing something whilst very deliberately doing absolutely nothing at all. 


If the Prime Minister wanted marriage equality we could legislate for it tomorrow. So why is it that the Prime Minister, who dons a leather jacket from time to time and who was once the darling of Q&A, has stuck with this position? It cannot make him very popular in the electorate. I cannot imagine that he wanders down to the shops in Double Bay and people say, 'Good on you, Malcolm; I'm really so pleased by the position you've taken on marriage equality.' It cannot do much for his standing amongst the Australian public as a person who is prepared to stick to his convictions and prosecute them in the place he has been elected to. The answer to why he is sticking with this, I would submit, is that the plebiscite was part of the price he paid for the job. It is part of his Faustian pact, and that is a term that is particularly relevant here, because Dr Faustus was someone who was not as smart as he thought he was and who made a deal with forces that he could not understand that he could not control. The Prime Minister is too scared of the social conservatives to do the things that he once said he believed in. Senator Bernardi may be thousands of kilometres away in in New York, but one suspects that the Prime Minister sees his shadow everywhere he goes.


The plebiscite was a way to keep marriage equality from breaking what passes for peace in the coalition party room. This government is, in fact, so inept that it cannot even manage to drag its feet on marriage equality without falling into pieces! The government was supposed to have the supporting legislation before parliament by now. Instead, we find out that the proposal has not even gone to cabinet. There has been an embarrassing public split in the party today on the question of whether there should be guaranteed public funding for the 'yes' and the 'no' campaigns. In today's newspapers, senior Liberals have all but accused the Prime Minister of lying. Senator Bernardi is reported in The Sydney Morning Herald as follows:


… ""people will make up their own minds"" about whether they believe Mr Turnbull or the church leaders.


It is unbelievable, and it is emblematic of the deep divisions in the Prime Minister's party room and his inability to control them and to pursue the agenda that he took to the election—as Senator Macdonald has so correctly pointed out. 


If the plebiscite were simply a device to delay marriage equality it would be bad enough. The problem is that it is not just about delay; it is a wasteful, hurtful way to delay marriage equality. It is obviously unnecessary. As I pointed out before, the majority of people support marriage equality and the latest polling suggests that three-quarters of them do not think that a plebiscite is necessary. We also know that the Prime Minister and the opposition leader in this place support marriage equality. A plebiscite is a wasteful way of going about things—costing $160 million. That is $160 million that could be spent on so many other public services but instead will be spent on a vote which has no binding influence on any member of this chamber or any member in the other place. 


It is likely that the plebiscite will be harmful. There is a real risk of hurtful, hateful speech—we know this because some truly awful things have already been said. Senator Rice gave us some examples. I have some examples. Most of us in this chamber who have in any way advocated for marriage equality have examples of incredibly nasty things that have been said about us on social media and that have been written to us—nasty things which, under the proposition of public funding for the 'no' case, could be advertised through television to LGBTI Australians in their own lounge rooms. 


I question the impact that this will have on more vulnerable members of the LGBTI community and I question the impact it will have on their children. Senator Pratt pointed this out: two out of five young Australians who are gay have thought about self-harm or suicide. Think about that in the context of your own family. Think about your own children. Think about what it would mean for you to have a child who was exposed to so much community hatred that that was where they were at in their teenage years. A young Australian who identifies as gay is six times more likely to consider taking their own life when compared to their siblings, classmates, colleagues or teammates. The veteran gay rights campaigner Rodney Croome is reported today as having come to the conclusion:


… that it will be easier to achieve a cross-party free vote, or encourage Liberals to cross the floor, than it will be to conduct a plebiscite fairly and have a 'yes' vote implemented quickly. 


What an indictment that is of the Prime Minister of this country—a Prime Minister who went to an election saying that he would conduct a plebiscite, a Prime Minister who went to an election—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  He was elected by the people of Australia.




Senator McALLISTER:
   The Prime Minister was elected on the grounds of conducting a plebiscite, and yet the very people that he sought to speak to in making that commitment do not believe him. They have concluded that this process is a joke, that it will not lead anywhere and that it will not produce the results that people have been looking for. 


This stands in very real contrast to the alternative pathway, the pathway that has served our democracy pretty well for more than 100 years, which is that the parliament takes its responsibilities seriously and takes seriously its responsibility to decide issues. That is why we are here. That is what we are elected to do. Labor takes that responsibility seriously. It is why we have introduced a bill into the House of Representatives today to legislate for marriage equality, as we have done so many times before. What does it say to LGBTI Australians that their issue is the only one that is so special that we need to have a special process to ask every Australian citizen about it specifically? What we want is a conscience vote in the parliament to let the majority of parliamentarians who support marriage equality have their say and get this done. But there is one thing you need to vote with your conscience, there is one thing you need to have a conscience vote, and that is the one thing that Prime Minister Turnbull seems to be lacking.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:50):  At the start of this debate I express my sympathy for and understanding of those members of the Labor Party who I know hold deeply religious convictions—not many of them, I concede, but there are some. I have some concern about and understanding of their conflict over this whole debate and the fact that they are being ramrodded by the Labor Party into promoting a particular view. Having said that, at the beginning of my contribution perhaps I should indicate my position. I, like most Australians, hold no discrimination against people—be they gay or whatever their agenda or situation in life is. In fact, over the years this parliament has legislated to remove all forms of discrimination against gay people or people who, because of their gender, would have otherwise, earlier in their lives, been disadvantaged economically or otherwise. There is no discrimination within Australia, and I have not seen the sort of harm that Labor speakers have spoken about. I suspect that they are issues far removed from the topic of this debate. 


My own belief is that marriage is between a man and a woman. It is a Christian ceremony and it should stay that way. When the plebiscite occurs I will be voting 'no'. But I do indicate that if the majority of the Australian public vote yes then I will vote yes in this chamber when the bill comes before us, because that is what democracy is about—that is what we are having a plebiscite for. And I challenge every other senator to say the same thing: will they commit today to voting to legislate the decision of the Australian public in the plebiscite? So that is my position. It is pretty simple; I do not need a great campaign. I do not think most Australians have a view on this issue and I do not think their view is going to change between now and the time of the plebiscite. I simply say to those that are so much in its favour of it: if you are so convinced that it is going to be successful then why not have the plebiscite and get rid of the issue once and for all by the highest possible authority—that is, a plebiscite of the Australian people? Why not? I cannot understand the argument against it.


There has been, today in question time, raised the issue of whether either side should be funded. Labor speakers have made a big thing about the Bishop of Sydney saying one thing and the Prime Minister having a different version. What the heck is that all about? Quite frankly, my own personal view is we do not need to fund it. I think most people understand the issues and can vote without any major campaign. But if there is a greater decision to fund them then I am easy with that, providing it is equally funded.


I pause here to emphasise the difference between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. You see, in the Liberal Party, we are allowed to have different views. We are allowed to have our own views. We are not regimented to have the view of the unions, who control the Labor Party. So I can say, quite frankly, today I have not heard the arguments, I must say, for having the 'no' and 'yes' cases funded so perhaps I am speaking a little bit out of turn. I will hear the arguments once cabinet has had its determinations and when the matter comes before the coalition party room tomorrow. In the coalition party room, we are entitled to say what we think and make our points and we will do that. At the end of the coalition party room process, the government will come to a conclusion. But whichever way it is, I am relatively relaxed about it.


What this whole point is about is that for years our side of politics, the coalition, has had a policy that marriage was between a man and a woman. In fact, the Marriage Act was changed a few years ago to provide for that and that has been the policy of our party. We went to the 2013 election with that policy and that commitment. Because we made that promise, I know, a lot of Australians voted for us. In fact—I do not like to admit too much family political discussion—I have a nephew who has never voted Liberal in this life. He says he always votes for me but I am not 'Liberal'; I am a 'relative'. But other than that, he always voted Labor. At the last election he voted Liberal because he has a very strong view on this particular issue.


The coalition went to the 2013 election with a commitment to the Australian people that marriage would be between a man and a woman. After the 2013 election, the coalition had a big discussion about it. There was a lot of comment, there were different arguments put forward, and the ABC ran its relentless campaign as it has done from day one on this—it is a pity the ABC did not run the same campaign on homelessness or help for our neighbours or whatever. But as a result of that and many other things, the coalition then decided that we would go to the next election and we would do the fairest thing that could be done; we would leave it to the Australian people to decide what it should be.


So prior to that 2016 election, we said to the Australian people: you elect us as a government and we will not have a conscience vote in parliament. What we will do is put it to you at a plebiscite to determine what you, the Australian public, think about this. There could not have been an Australian, who was interested in this subject—I might add that qualifier—that did not know where the coalition stood. I am not sure the Australian people, in a democracy, knew what the Labor Party stood for because that seemed to change as we approached the last election. First of all Labor had one view then they had another view, then they smelt the way the wind was blowing and then they consulted with the unions. But they did go to the election, I think, with a firm commitment to a parliamentary vote.


The Greens have always had that position and, whilst I do not have a great regard for any policy of the Greens, at least on this issue they have been consistent—consistently wrong, I think—so we knew where they stood. The Australian people knew that if you voted Labor or if you voted for the Greens, you would get perhaps a conscience vote in the parliament. But if you voted for the coalition, you knew what you would get: you would get a plebiscite where everybody, every single Australian could express their view. It does not need me to tell the chamber what the result of the election was. We are sitting on this side so clearly we won the election, which means the majority of Australians believed in most of our policies but this was one of them and they accepted our version that when or if we won the election, there would be a plebiscite.


Unlike the Labor Party, which makes promises before the election and completely disregards them afterwards, we are not of that ilk. We make a commitment, we make a promise prior to an election and we intend to stick by it. I do not need to remind too many listeners that there was an election where Labor promised 'there would be no carbon tax under the government I lead'—remember that? Hand on heart, hand on the Bible—well, I do not think it would have been the Bible—'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. Do you remember that? It was a firm promise just before the election. In fact, three days before the election, two days before the election and one day before the election there was this commitment that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. And remember, as soon as the Labor Party leader did lead that government, what the first bit of legislation they brought in was? The introduction of a carbon tax.


For the Labor Party, you can make promises before the election and, afterwards, you can treat them with disdain, you can ignore them. It is like, as I often mention—not many people remember this, but I was around then—the L-A-W law tax cuts. Mr Keating, the Labor Prime Minister, not only promised but actually legislated for tax cuts, before the election he did not expect to win, and promised that they were there forever. When he unexpectedly won the election, what was the first thing he did? He reneged on that commitment for tax cuts for hardworking Australians. The Labor Party will make any promise they like. It does not really matter—'We're not going to honour it, should we win the election.' That is the real difference between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. That is why we, on this side—even those who vocally support same-sex marriage and those who are committed to it—make a promise and stick by it.


Again, I raise the question: if, as Labor and Green speakers have said, everybody in Australia supports this, why not have the plebiscite? Why not go ahead and put it beyond doubt, once and for all? Let the Australian people have a say on this issue which, for many people, is very, very troubling. I do not feel, as an elected parliamentarian of some years now, that I can commit to the people who voted for me to a particular position on this. I can commit to them on an economic issue. I can commit to them on infrastructure issue. I can commit to them on a border protection issue. But I do not want to commit to my fellow Australians on an issue that, for many, is as sensitive as this.


For many, it is a matter of deep religious conviction—not for me, I might say, but for many it is. If the majority of the Australian people are so overwhelmingly in favour of this, what is wrong with the plebiscite? Let's have it. As I said, I commit myself and I again challenge people—there are a few more here now—to do as I will do and commit, to voting the way the Australian people will vote at the plebiscite. I do not know how they are going to vote. I am going to vote no in the plebiscite but I will vote yes in the parliament, if the Australian public say that that is their view.


For me, it is a pretty simple matter. It is a matter of trust, keeping your promises and keeping your commitments. The Labor Party find that foreign. I am proud as a Liberal to abide by this underlying principle: when you make commitments prior to an election, you honour them.



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Carr, from the Mal Colston faction of the Labor Party, would not understand what that was about. Keeping your word and honouring your promises is something foreign to the Labor Party but something that I, as a Liberal, am proud my party always adheres to.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2016-09-12,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (17:50):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance—the failure of the Turnbull government to clearly outline its position on public funding of campaigns in the proposed plebiscite on marriage equality. We know that the Turnbull government is hopelessly split on this issue of marriage equality, on the plebiscite, and now on public funding for the plebiscite campaign. This split was aptly described by Phillip Coorey in today's Australian Financial Review as a 'brewing civil war'. As the Australian Financial Review story explains, the personal accusations are flying as to just what the Prime Minister has promised on funding for the plebiscite. Whether you see this as a civil war or an unholy stoush, it is obvious to everyone that the Turnbull government is hopelessly divided. With the right wing of the Liberal Party yet again flexing its muscle, reminding Mr Turnbull of the tenuous hold he has on his party leadership, Senator Abetz telegraphed his warnings to the Prime Minister on ABC Radio. Senator Abetz said:


I wanted to flag my concern up front straight away that this idea that somehow you can have a proper plebiscite without funding for the 'yes' and 'no' cases would not be the sort of plebiscite that was envisaged by the party room when we decided on it. 


…   …   …


Ultimately the plebiscite was a party room decision and I trust that this will remain a party room decision.


And I trust that Cabinet will ensure that the views of the party room are determined and that the party room is not steamrolled.


There are very conflicting accounts of just what was decided about public funding when it was thrashed out at a six-hour coalition party room debate in August last year.


There are also conflicting views on just what Mr Turnbull told 20 of Australia's church leaders when they sought $10 million to fund a 'no' campaign. Church leaders are adamant that the Prime Minister offered to fund both sides of the campaign when they met him in Sydney on 12 February this year. A spokesman for the Archbishop of Sydney, Glenn Davies, said that the outcome of the meeting was 'unambiguous'. The spokesman went on to say:


It is the Archbishop's clear recollection that the Prime Minister, in words that were unambiguous, stated that funding would be available to both sides on a similar basis to the republic referendum, though the exact amount was not discussed.


The promise was later raised at a smaller meeting with [Attorney-General George] Brandis in March, who then asked what funding was appropriate, to which the Archbishop replied: the same amount as in 1999, CPI adjusted.


So that would be $10 million plus interest to fund the 'no' campaign. But just when you think that there will be public funding, along comes Senator Brandis, who stresses that the government wants to minimise the cost to taxpayers. But, while the Prime Minister's staff check their notes to see what Mr Turnbull did promise to the church leaders, the debate continues to fester.


It is taxpayers' money we are talking about here. It is time for Mr Turnbull to come clean on his plans for the marriage equality plebiscite. He continues to deny a vote in parliament; instead, clinging to the plebiscite that was foisted upon him by Mr Tony Abbott and his supporters—a plebiscite that is going to cost taxpayers at least $160 million; a plebiscite that now could see further tens of millions of dollars spent on a divisive campaign. If we cut to the heart of what we are talking about: tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds to be spent to promote harmful arguments—arguments that will send a message to young gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual people that there is something wrong with them; arguments that will send a message to kids growing up with same-sex parents that there is something wrong with their family.


Mr Turnbull supports the plebiscite because he lacks any conviction. Yet again on the issue of public funding for the campaigns, we see that he stands for nothing. He has become beholden to the right wing of his own party, who are seeking to delay the march towards equality. It is time to come clean and reveal the details of the secret meetings and backroom deals—or, even better, to abandon plans for this divisive, harmful, costly and non-binding plebiscite and allow a free vote in parliament.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:56):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I rise to take note of the Joint Australian and Tasmanian government response to the review of the implementation of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement for the period 2007-2012. What a sham the regional forestry agreements are in this country. For many, many years—in fact, decades—in this country, we have had RFAs that have propped up environmentally and economically unsustainable industries, such as the native forest logging industry, particularly in my home state of Tasmania—and, of course, it is the Tasmanian RFA that we are discussing tonight.


I want to be very clear about something: RFAs are designed to enshrine resource security for the logging industry. They are designed to avoid responsibilities to look after threatened species. They are designed to avoid responsibilities to allow forests to continue to embed carbon in the fight against climate change. They are designed with no other intent than to enshrine an environmentally and economically unviable native forest logging industry in this country. They are sham documents. They are camouflage for an unviable native forest industry, which in fact in Tasmania is a mendicant, make-work scheme that every year sucks tens of millions of dollars out of schools, hospitals and other essential public services in my state. They are camouflage for an environmentally destructive industry.


The view in this RFA response document from the Liberal governments here in Canberra and down in Hobart is basically, 'Everything is fine; nothing to see here.' It is like a Flat Earth Society document put out after Vasco da Gama circumnavigated the planet. That is how ridiculous it is and that is how little resemblance to reality it bears. We have now seen a rolling series of Tasmanian regional forest agreements that have failed our threatened species. They have failed all of the ecosystems services that our beautiful, magnificent, globally-significant forests provide in Tasmania; they have failed the massive amounts of carbon that are released every year after our unique forests are clear-felled and torched and most of the carbon in them and their soils released into the atmosphere; they have failed the Astacopsis gouldi—the giant freshwater crayfish that is endemic to Tasmania and, in fact, endemic to just a small number of river systems on the north coast and the north part of Tasmania; and they have failed the Swift parrot, that beautiful little bird that continues its slide towards extinction thanks in large part to the native forest logging industry in my home state of Tasmania.


I have fought native forest logging since I was arrested at Farmhouse Creek in the mid 1980s. I have fought it through my parliamentary career. I will continue to fight until we end the industrial strip mining of our forests that are protected and delivered through regional forest agreements; until we see our beautiful globally significant forests—much of which are quite rightly reserved on behalf of all of humanity inside our Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area—and the forests that need to be protected actually protected in formal reserves and inside the World Heritage Area; until we end this mendicant, make-work industry that is the native forest logging industry in Tasmania; and until we protect the carbon that is embedded in those forests so that, in Tasmania, we can move on to the 21st-century industries and away from an over-reliance on the dig-it-up, chop-it-down mentality of the last century.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:01):  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President—





Senator McKim:
  On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I thought you gave the call to Senator Rice.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Macdonald, you have the call.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I would not have minded if Senator Rice went next, as long as I would get my opportunity to proudly say that I was the minister that actually introduced the regional forest agreements and guided them through this parliament in a debate that, I think, went for some 35 hours by the time your former leader tried the effluxion of time as a way to get across the point that he, and not many others, agreed with.


The Tasmanian forest used to be a wonderful source of timber to Australia and the world. It used to mean that imports of timber to Australia from forests that were nowhere near as well managed as Australia's forests were lessened. And it meant that there was an industry, and that there were jobs created, in Tasmania. As a result of the work of Senator McKim and his allies in the state parliament and by some of the Greens and Democrats in this chamber over the years, I have to say to Senator McKim, somewhat reluctantly almost: congratulations. You and your lot have succeeded in, really, all but shutting down the Australian forestry industry—an industry that meant so much for Australia and that was sustainably managed.


I still remember when then Senator Richardson, on behalf of the Labor Party, shut down the forests in North Queensland. He went to the little town of Ravenswood to address about 1,000 angry people. The town was only about 200 or 300 people; there were 1,000 there to greet Senator Richardson. They had a sign across the street—I still remember it to this day—that said: 'Senator Richardson, you are wanting to save this pristine forest? It has been logged for 100 years.' That is the stupidity of the Greens and those who would do away with the sustainable forestry industry in Australia. Selective and careful management of our forests did provide for sustainability and for an industry. It provided some wealth for Tasmania, in particular. 


I often ask people like Senator McKim: how many trees have been destroyed in the Tasmanian forest from wildfires that have burned out of control? That used not to happen in the days when there were forestry tracks through the Tasmanian forest and when there was a workforce on hand to get to the source of an outbreak of fire as it happened so to control that fire. But thanks to Senator McKim and to his lot, those tracks through the forest no longer exist. That skilled workforce which could get straight to the source of the fire and put it out has gone. As a result, there are hundreds of thousands of hectares of burnt forest in Tasmania—and in Victoria. That does far more damage to the forests than selective, careful management of the forests ever did.


The regional forest agreements, the subject of this debate, were a good attempt at that time—back in the early parts of this century—to try and regulate and to ensure that, forever, there would be a sustainable forestry industry in Tasmania. Regrettably, over the years—and when I left the job as the minister for forestry—the Greens and the Labor Party had their way. The forestry industry in Tasmania now is but a shadow of what it was and what it should have been. The regional forest agreements were a good attempt. The response by the government highlights some of the successes of the regional forest agreements, but, lamentably, the whole forest industry in Australia is now at a stage where it is a very tiny industry—a fraction of what it should be. As a result, of course, we import timber from forests around the world that are slashed and burned, and that are not sustainably managed at all. To the Greens, that seems to be okay.


The regional forest agreements were a good idea. They worked for a while. Regrettably, they did not achieve their ultimate goal.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2016-09-12,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:06):  I also rise to speak to the motion that the Senate take note of the Australian and Tasmanian Government Response to the Review of the Implementation of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement for the Period 2007-2012. We have had regional forest agreements for almost 20 years. The very first of them, the East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement, is due to expire in February next year. This Tasmanian one is due to expire soon after, later next year. 


It is clear that regional forest agreements have failed to do what they aimed to do, which was to implement what we were told would be ecologically sustainable management and to maintain jobs in the industry. The reviews that have been done of regional forest agreements over the years have laid this bare. They have laid out clearly for all to see that regional forest agreements have not fulfilled their purposes. In particular, I read the independent reviewer's report on the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement's last five years. Although his recommendations were lily-livered, weak and weasel worded, you only had to read between the lines to see where those failures were. In particular, it went to the heart of whether it was possible to have intensive industrial scale clear-fell logging of our precious native forests and call it ecologically sustainable forest management. It was very clear that this independent reviewer was saying that even after almost 20 years we still do not have the monitoring in place and we still do not know what the impacts, overall, on forest species are going to be. In fact, he went further than that. He said not only do we still not know what the impacts of the logging industry are on threatened species and our precious natural forests but that the monitoring regime is actually likely to get worse over the coming years. This is the reality of what the current logging industry is doing to our forests. 


We had what was clearly a politically correct report from the reviewer. It said let us improve some things and get the monitoring right. For example, one of his recommendations was that the state builds on its existing monitoring framework to develop a long-term forest condition monitoring system across all forest tenures to assess changes in ecosystem health and vitality—'to develop', mind you! We have had 20 years of the attacks on our forest and 20 years of threatened species becoming more and more threatened, and yet only now are we saying, 'Let's develop a monitoring system so we can really see what the impact of that logging is going to be.' We know what the impact of the current logging processes is. We can see what is happening to threatened species, with swift parrots going from threatened to endangered to critically endangered and with the giant Tasmanian crayfish on the verge of becoming endangered as well. Yet the government's response to this—to finally, after 20 years, put in place a long-term monitoring system to see what is happening—is the state agrees to consider implementing a statewide forest monitoring information system! 


The regional forest agreements are not going to protect our forests. They are not going to protect our wonderful forest wildlife. If we have the continuation of the regional forest agreements, we are going to see animals like swift parrots in Tasmania going extinct. We are going to see animals like Leadbeater's possums in Victoria—which has gone from being threatened to endangered to critically endangered—go extinct. This is the reality of industrial scale intensive damaging logging in our forests. It is very clear that we need to say that the regional forest agreements are now something of the past. Let us put them away. That is how we used to do wood production in the past. We need to move on to producing wood in a way which is consistent with sustainability of our forests, and that is to use plantations to get the bulk of our forest products. 


Senator Macdonald claims that the timber industry has shrunk compared to what it used to be, but the reality is there has been a shift and we now have 85 per cent of the wood products that come out of Australia coming from plantations. We know that to protect our forests and to protect jobs, we have to make that 100 per cent. We can do that. We can have a thriving wood products industry in Australia but not one which is based on native forests. We can protect our forests, protect jobs and produce wood. To do that is just a matter of moving forward into the ways of the future rather than the ways of the past.

The view in this RFA response document from the Liberal governments here in Canberra and down in Hobart is basically, 'Everything is fine; nothing to see here.' It is like a Flat Earth Society document put out after Vasco da Gama circumnavigated the planet. That is how ridiculous it is and that is how little resemblance to reality it bears. We have now seen a rolling series of Tasmanian regional forest agreements that have failed our threatened species. They have failed all of the ecosystems services that our beautiful, magnificent, globally-significant forests provide in Tasmania; they have failed the massive amounts of carbon that are released every year after our unique forests are clear-felled and torched and most of the carbon in them and their soils released into the atmosphere; they have failed the Astacopsis gouldi—the giant freshwater crayfish that is endemic to Tasmania and, in fact, endemic to just a small number of river systems on the north coast and the north part of Tasmania; and they have failed the Swift parrot, that beautiful little bird that continues its slide towards extinction thanks in large part to the native forest logging industry in my home state of Tasmania.


I have fought native forest logging since I was arrested at Farmhouse Creek in the mid 1980s. I have fought it through my parliamentary career. I will continue to fight until we end the industrial strip mining of our forests that are protected and delivered through regional forest agreements; until we see our beautiful globally significant forests—much of which are quite rightly reserved on behalf of all of humanity inside our Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area—and the forests that need to be protected actually protected in formal reserves and inside the World Heritage Area; until we end this mendicant, make-work industry that is the native forest logging industry in Tasmania; and until we protect the carbon that is embedded in those forests so that, in Tasmania, we can move on to the 21st-century industries and away from an over-reliance on the dig-it-up, chop-it-down mentality of the last century.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:01):  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President—





Senator McKim:
  On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I thought you gave the call to Senator Rice.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Macdonald, you have the call.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I would not have minded if Senator Rice went next, as long as I would get my opportunity to proudly say that I was the minister that actually introduced the regional forest agreements and guided them through this parliament in a debate that, I think, went for some 35 hours by the time your former leader tried the effluxion of time as a way to get across the point that he, and not many others, agreed with.


The Tasmanian forest used to be a wonderful source of timber to Australia and the world. It used to mean that imports of timber to Australia from forests that were nowhere near as well managed as Australia's forests were lessened. And it meant that there was an industry, and that there were jobs created, in Tasmania. As a result of the work of Senator McKim and his allies in the state parliament and by some of the Greens and Democrats in this chamber over the years, I have to say to Senator McKim, somewhat reluctantly almost: congratulations. You and your lot have succeeded in, really, all but shutting down the Australian forestry industry—an industry that meant so much for Australia and that was sustainably managed.


I still remember when then Senator Richardson, on behalf of the Labor Party, shut down the forests in North Queensland. He went to the little town of Ravenswood to address about 1,000 angry people. The town was only about 200 or 300 people; there were 1,000 there to greet Senator Richardson. They had a sign across the street—I still remember it to this day—that said: 'Senator Richardson, you are wanting to save this pristine forest? It has been logged for 100 years.' That is the stupidity of the Greens and those who would do away with the sustainable forestry industry in Australia. Selective and careful management of our forests did provide for sustainability and for an industry. It provided some wealth for Tasmania, in particular. 


I often ask people like Senator McKim: how many trees have been destroyed in the Tasmanian forest from wildfires that have burned out of control? That used not to happen in the days when there were forestry tracks through the Tasmanian forest and when there was a workforce on hand to get to the source of an outbreak of fire as it happened so to control that fire. But thanks to Senator McKim and to his lot, those tracks through the forest no longer exist. That skilled workforce which could get straight to the source of the fire and put it out has gone. As a result, there are hundreds of thousands of hectares of burnt forest in Tasmania—and in Victoria. That does far more damage to the forests than selective, careful management of the forests ever did.


The regional forest agreements, the subject of this debate, were a good attempt at that time—back in the early parts of this century—to try and regulate and to ensure that, forever, there would be a sustainable forestry industry in Tasmania. Regrettably, over the years—and when I left the job as the minister for forestry—the Greens and the Labor Party had their way. The forestry industry in Tasmania now is but a shadow of what it was and what it should have been. The regional forest agreements were a good attempt. The response by the government highlights some of the successes of the regional forest agreements, but, lamentably, the whole forest industry in Australia is now at a stage where it is a very tiny industry—a fraction of what it should be. As a result, of course, we import timber from forests around the world that are slashed and burned, and that are not sustainably managed at all. To the Greens, that seems to be okay.


The regional forest agreements were a good idea. They worked for a while. Regrettably, they did not achieve their ultimate goal.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2016-09-12,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:06):  I also rise to speak to the motion that the Senate take note of the Australian and Tasmanian Government Response to the Review of the Implementation of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement for the Period 2007-2012. We have had regional forest agreements for almost 20 years. The very first of them, the East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement, is due to expire in February next year. This Tasmanian one is due to expire soon after, later next year. 


It is clear that regional forest agreements have failed to do what they aimed to do, which was to implement what we were told would be ecologically sustainable management and to maintain jobs in the industry. The reviews that have been done of regional forest agreements over the years have laid this bare. They have laid out clearly for all to see that regional forest agreements have not fulfilled their purposes. In particular, I read the independent reviewer's report on the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement's last five years. Although his recommendations were lily-livered, weak and weasel worded, you only had to read between the lines to see where those failures were. In particular, it went to the heart of whether it was possible to have intensive industrial scale clear-fell logging of our precious native forests and call it ecologically sustainable forest management. It was very clear that this independent reviewer was saying that even after almost 20 years we still do not have the monitoring in place and we still do not know what the impacts, overall, on forest species are going to be. In fact, he went further than that. He said not only do we still not know what the impacts of the logging industry are on threatened species and our precious natural forests but that the monitoring regime is actually likely to get worse over the coming years. This is the reality of what the current logging industry is doing to our forests. 


We had what was clearly a politically correct report from the reviewer. It said let us improve some things and get the monitoring right. For example, one of his recommendations was that the state builds on its existing monitoring framework to develop a long-term forest condition monitoring system across all forest tenures to assess changes in ecosystem health and vitality—'to develop', mind you! We have had 20 years of the attacks on our forest and 20 years of threatened species becoming more and more threatened, and yet only now are we saying, 'Let's develop a monitoring system so we can really see what the impact of that logging is going to be.' We know what the impact of the current logging processes is. We can see what is happening to threatened species, with swift parrots going from threatened to endangered to critically endangered and with the giant Tasmanian crayfish on the verge of becoming endangered as well. Yet the government's response to this—to finally, after 20 years, put in place a long-term monitoring system to see what is happening—is the state agrees to consider implementing a statewide forest monitoring information system! 


The regional forest agreements are not going to protect our forests. They are not going to protect our wonderful forest wildlife. If we have the continuation of the regional forest agreements, we are going to see animals like swift parrots in Tasmania going extinct. We are going to see animals like Leadbeater's possums in Victoria—which has gone from being threatened to endangered to critically endangered—go extinct. This is the reality of industrial scale intensive damaging logging in our forests. It is very clear that we need to say that the regional forest agreements are now something of the past. Let us put them away. That is how we used to do wood production in the past. We need to move on to producing wood in a way which is consistent with sustainability of our forests, and that is to use plantations to get the bulk of our forest products. 


Senator Macdonald claims that the timber industry has shrunk compared to what it used to be, but the reality is there has been a shift and we now have 85 per cent of the wood products that come out of Australia coming from plantations. We know that to protect our forests and to protect jobs, we have to make that 100 per cent. We can do that. We can have a thriving wood products industry in Australia but not one which is based on native forests. We can protect our forests, protect jobs and produce wood. To do that is just a matter of moving forward into the ways of the future rather than the ways of the past.


Debate adjourned.

Question agreed to.


Bill read a first time.




Senator RUSTON:
  by leave—I move:


That the provisions of paragraph (6) of standing order 111 not apply to this bill. 


I table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The statement read as follows—





Purpose of the Bill



The Bill amends the Registration of Deaths Abroad Act 1984 (RDA Act). The purpose of the amendments is to allow the RDA Act to function as originally


intended, establishing a Registrar of Deaths Abroad with the capacity to register deaths in particular circumstances, namely overseas deaths. The Bill provides the Foreign Minister with broader authority to appoint any State or Territory registrar as the Registrar of Deaths Abroad. Each State and Territory has been consulted on these changes.




Reasons for Urgency



It is desirable the Bill be passed in the 2016 Spring sittings since currently the RDA Act requires the Registrar of Deaths Abroad to be engaged under the Public Service Act 1999. The ACT Registrar has traditionally served as the Registrar of Deaths abroad but is no longer appointed under the Public Service Act 1999 and therefore has no authority to continue to perform this role. As a result, some deaths are currently not being registered in a timely manner.


Question agreed to.

The speech read as follows—





REGISTRATION OF DEATHS ABROAD AMENDMENT BILL 2016



This bill amends the Registration of Deaths Abroad Act 1984.


The primary purpose of this bill is to correct an anomaly in the Registration of Deaths Abroad Act 1984. The correction will allow the 'Registrar of Deaths Abroad' to register deaths in prescribed circumstances. 


Under current arrangements, applicants can remain in a procedural 'limbo' as they negotiate with State or Territory registrars to register an overseas death. By permitting the appointment of a federal Registrar of Deaths Abroad, this bill will simplify the registration of deaths abroad.


The bill will provide the Foreign Minister with the flexibility to appoint any State or Territory registrar as the Registrar of Deaths Abroad. 


The bill will also validate the prior appointment of the ACT Registrar-General as the Registrar of Deaths Abroad and any previous registrations of deaths under the Act. 


The amendments will allow the Registrar of Deaths Abroad to register deaths that could have been registered under the law of a State or Territory, where the State or Territory concerned has provided notice that it will not register a death. 


In order to ensure that only the Registrar of Deaths Abroad can register deaths under the Act, the bill removes any references to 'registering officers' from the Act.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Registration of Deaths Abroad Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,30,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2016-09-12,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:23):  The opposition supports the passage of the Registration of Deaths Abroad Amendment Bill 2016, which makes a number of amendments to the Registration of Deaths Abroad Act 1984. The act provides that the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall appoint a Registrar of Deaths Abroad. This registrar is responsible for the registration of deaths of Australian citizens, residents and other prescribed persons who die abroad, on board Australian aircraft or ships, or in other prescribed circumstances.


The opposition recognises the importance of the registration of deaths abroad regime. We all know that the death of a loved one is a sad and distressing event in anyone's life. Death certificates are important documents for a range of legal and administrative requirements which must be attended to following the loss of a loved one When an Australian dies overseas, the stresses and difficulties for family members can be magnified, which is why it is important that existing state and territory regimes for the registration of deaths are supplemented by the Commonwealth Registration of Deaths Abroad Act. On occasions when a death occurs abroad, there can sometimes be problems in registering the death under the normal state or territory arrangements. The act before the chamber or the substantive legislation ensures alternative arrangements are available where such problems exist.


The bill before the chamber has one primary purpose, which is to correct an anomaly which has arisen under the act. The amendments will validate the earlier appointment of the ACT Registrar-General as the Registrar of Deaths Abroad and validate any registrations made under the existing act. In addition, the bill makes a number of other amendments to simplify and clarify the processes and requirements for registering deaths abroad.


The opposition notes that the explanatory memorandum to the bill states that it has no financial implications for the Commonwealth or for the community. As I noted at the outset, the opposition is pleased to support this bill. This bill was introduced to the last parliament in March of this year. It was a bill which lapsed in May when the Prime Minister decided to go to an early election and dissolved both houses of parliament, so it was one of a number of pieces of legislation which were not passed when the Prime Minister chose to go to an early election by way of double dissolution. 


The opposition believes the anomalies in the registration of deaths abroad system which this bill addresses are non-controversial and could and should have been resolved months ago in the last parliament, so we are pleased to support this bill for the second time. But we want to put it on the record that the delay in securing passage of this bill is regrettable. The delay is a direct consequence of this government's failure to manage its legislative program in the last parliament and a direct consequence of the Prime Minister's decision to go to an early election. This bill also reflects the lack of a clear agenda from the Turnbull government in that this is the first piece of legislation that the government has brought before the Senate this term.


As I said at the outset, we support the bill. It is a worthy bill but it is a bill correcting a technical error; it is not a bill that is part of a clear agenda from the government. One wonders why the government believes its agenda should commence with a bill that could have been dealt with in non-controversial legislation on Thursday or, frankly, prior to the parliament being dissolved. The government's agenda is focused on fixing a technical error in this bill. To our way of thinking, this is a clear sign that this is a government that is in office but not in power. It is unsurprising that so many, even on the government benches, are wondering what on earth the government's agenda is. The opposition is happy to support the legislation. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (18:27):  This bill was initially introduced to the House of Representatives on to March 2016 and was passed by the House on 16 March 2016. The second reading speech was moved in the Senate on 16 March but lapsed on the dissolution of the parliament on 9 May 2016.


About 1,300 Australians die overseas each year. In most cases, the deaths are registered in the country where the death occurred. However, a number of recent international crises such as the disappearance of MH 370 have demonstrated that in modern society the registrar-general needs to be able to respond to requests for registering a death that may have been derived from previously unforeseen circumstances. State legislation has proved to be too restrictive to allow the registration of a death, for example, where someone has lived overseas for an extended period and cannot demonstrate a link to any state or territory. As a result, the death of approximately 10 Australians were unable to be registered states and territories in 2015.


The key elements of the bill include: broadening the scope of those persons whom the foreign minister may appoint to act as registrar of deaths abroad, providing the registrar with broader discretion to register overseas deaths of persons who have some connection with Australia, providing the registrar discretion relating to the procedural administration of the act and removing redundant provisions. More specifically, the amendments will remove references to the Public Service Act 1999 to rectify a recently identified anomaly created by the separation of the Australia Capital Territory from the Commonwealth in 1994.


Currently the act provides that the foreign minister may appoint a person who is engaged under the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1999 to act as a registrar of deaths abroad. The foreign minister, in 1984, formally appointed the registered general of the ACT has the register of deaths abroad. In 1994, when the ACT separated from the Commonwealth, the ACT government enacted the Public Sector Management Act 1994. At that time, all ACT government employees were moved to be employed under this act including the ACT Registrar-General, removing the ACT Registrar-General authority to register overseas deaths. The ACT Registrar-General ceased registering overseas deaths under the act in 2015. It also removes redundant provisions that allow for persons holding of performing duties in a country or place outside Australia to register overseas deaths. This is done by amending the definition of registered officers to remove reference to a person holding or performing the duties—

Senator RUSTON:
  This bill also seeks to amend the definition of registered officers to remove reference to a person holding or performing the duties of a consular or diplomatic officer in an overseas mission. In practice, Australian consular and diplomatic officers have not registered deaths overseas for several decades.


It also broadens the authority of the foreign minister to determine who may act as registrar, where the register will be kept and the provisions relating to the procedural administration of the act, such as the form and method of registration and official stamps. It seeks to do so through amendments to the act that will continue to provide the foreign minister with the authority to appoint the ACT Registrar-General as the Registrar of Deaths Abroad. However, it will also allow the foreign minister, when required, scope to appoint any other state or territory registrar-general to perform the role of Registrar of Deaths Abroad.


It will also broaden the legislation's scope to address previously unforeseen circumstances. It will allow the Registrar of Deaths Abroad to register any overseas deaths that could have been registered under the law of a state or territory where the state or territory concerned has provided notice that they will not register a death. For example, where an Australian national has died on a vessel not travelling to or from Australia and where another country will not register the death, such as in the case of MH370; where there was a dispute as to which country should be the issuing authority for the death certificate; or where the Australian has moved out of the country for an extended period of time and cannot demonstrate a connection to an Australian state for a death to be registered. 


Under the existing legislation, delays can occur in registering deaths overseas in circumstances that were unforeseen at the time the legislation was drafted. This can unnecessarily add to the suffering of the deceased's relatives. The amendments should simplify and expedite the process of registering deaths abroad. Under current arrangements, applicants can remain in a procedural limbo as they negotiate with state or territory registrars to register an overseas death.


The passage of this legislation will not result in any additional cost to the community or to the Commonwealth. In consultation with the Office of Best Practice Regulation, a regulation impact statement is not required because the measures are of minor policy significance and will not impose a regulatory burden on individuals, businesses or community organisations.


Australia's consular officials work in very difficult and emotionally trying circumstances. We all remember their tireless work in the days and weeks following the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine on 17 July 2014. This act of senseless violence killed all 298 passengers and crew on board, including 38 people who called Australia home. The government launched Operation Bring Them Home to secure, identify and repatriate the remains of the victims, to investigate the cause of the incident and to hold those responsible to account. Over 500 Australian officials, including police, military, diplomatic and consular personnel, were deployed to Ukraine and the Netherlands to support our operation. Australia's consular response included establishing a 24-hour crisis centre that continued for 68 eight-hour shifts involving 115 staff. It also established a six-member MH17 task force that produced 70 briefs for the government, 55 situation reports and 20 briefings to the National Security Committee of Cabinet.


The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated at the time:


The work of the dedicated consular case officers assigned to each MH17 family, perhaps the most difficult of all assignments, deserves the highest praise. Having spoken to the families of the victims, I know how heartbreaking this work must have been. So I thank everyone in my department involved in bringing home the Australian victims—and I know their work is ongoing—on behalf of the families and the Australian people. They have served our country with distinction.


I also associate myself with the foreign minister's remarks. As a minister and a senator for South Australia, not a week goes by where my office is not contacted by an Australian citizen who has experienced difficulty while travelling or working overseas. The support of Australia's consular officials at these times has been second to none.


With more Australians travelling overseas than ever before, the demand on our consular officials is growing. In 2014-15, Australians took over 9.7 million trips overseas, up from 9.5 million in 2013-14 and 8.9 million in 2012-13. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade managed nearly 16,000 consular cases in 2014-15—a nine per cent increase on the previous year. Of the approximately 1,300 Australian deaths that occur overseas every year, the majority are from natural causes. An increasing number are due to accidents or murder, however. In recent years we have also had to deal with natural disasters like earthquakes in Nepal and tropical cyclones in the Philippines. Each of these crises has presented a unique challenge to the government and Australia's dedicated consular officials. In the case of the Nepal earthquake, 12 consular officers were deployed to provide assistance to Australians in Kathmandu and surrounding regions.


The Australian government is committed to ensuring the welfare of Australians travelling or working overseas. The Australian government has expanded our diplomatic network to increase market access for Australian businesses, strengthen our national security and, importantly, enhance our ability to provide consular assistance to Australians travelling and working overseas. Since 2013 we have opened up new overseas missions in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Iran, Thailand, China, Mongolia, Qatar and the United States of America. Our announcement of five new posts in 2014 was the single largest expansion of Australia's overseas diplomatic footprint in the last 40 years. At the 2016 election, the government committed additional funds to open a further three diplomatic posts, taking the total number of diplomatic and Austrade missions to 11.


The government also committed funds to establish a global watch office within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to strengthen our capacity to monitor and respond to emergency situations overseas on a 24-hour basis. The watch office will ensure high-quality consular services can be provided to Australians overseas who find themselves in difficulty. It will also enable the government to quickly activate crisis response efforts in the event of emergency; provide detailed analysis of fast-moving geostrategic events as they occur, including real-time updates to travel advice; and provide better coordination for major events overseas, such as the Olympic Games and the Anzac Day services. Recent terror attacks in Paris, Brussels, Ankara and Istanbul, and natural disasters throughout the region, like Cyclone Winston in Fiji, highlight the need for the Australian government to be well informed and able to respond quickly to emergency situations overseas, particularly when Australians are at risk.


Lastly, I take this opportunity to remind Australians planning to travel overseas to register with Smartraveller. Australians should be informed and prepared when they are travelling overseas. In November 2015 the Australian government launched the Smartraveller information campaign to encourage Australians to be more informed and prepared before they travel and more self-reliant while they are overseas. There is no excuse for not taking out travel insurance. As has been said, if you cannot afford travel insurance, you cannot afford to travel. Sadly, the news is full of stories of Australians who encounter trouble overseas and who could not afford medical assistance of the cost of returning home. Australians travelling overseas are subject to local laws and they need to make sensible decisions about what they do. 


When Australians get into difficulty overseas, Australian diplomatic and consular missions can provide assistance, but there is a limit to what they can do. Consular officials are guided by the Consular Services Charter. While each case is unique and the level of assistance depends on circumstances, assessments may include providing the details of the local doctors and lawyers, visits to Australians incarcerated overseas to check on their welfare, liaising with local authorities in missing persons cases, and the provision of advice and support on a range of matters, including the death of a relative overseas.


Consular officials cannot guarantee your safety while overseas. They cannot give you legal advice or intervene in other country's court proceedings and they cannot get you out of prison. We cannot intervene in another country's sovereign judicial system, just as we would not countenance another country seeking to do that in Australia. Ultimately, Australians must accept responsibility for their own welfare and make decisions that reduce risks, including reducing the burden on their families and friends should they encounter difficulties while travelling overseas.


I welcome the oppositions support for this very important bill. The death of a family member is a distressing time. The Registration of Deaths Abroad Amendment Bill 2016 removes an unnecessary cause of anxiety and a stress on families when they are least able to handle it. I commend this bill to the Senate.

The statement read as follows—





Purpose of the Bill



The Bill amends the Registration of Deaths Abroad Act 1984 (RDA Act). The purpose of the amendments is to allow the RDA Act to function as originally


intended, establishing a Registrar of Deaths Abroad with the capacity to register deaths in particular circumstances, namely overseas deaths. The Bill provides the Foreign Minister with broader authority to appoint any State or Territory registrar as the Registrar of Deaths Abroad. Each State and Territory has been consulted on these changes.




Reasons for Urgency



It is desirable the Bill be passed in the 2016 Spring sittings since currently the RDA Act requires the Registrar of Deaths Abroad to be engaged under the Public Service Act 1999. The ACT Registrar has traditionally served as the Registrar of Deaths abroad but is no longer appointed under the Public Service Act 1999 and therefore has no authority to continue to perform this role. As a result, some deaths are currently not being registered in a timely manner.

STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2016 SPRING SITTINGS





PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEVIES AND CHARGES COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL





Purpose of the Bill



The bill amends the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to make minor changes to the ability to distribute levy payer information for the purpose of developing levy payer registers.


The amendments will allow distribution of levy payer information from agricultural industries that pay statutory agricultural levies, if a research and development corporation (RDC), in consultation with industry, requests that government collect this information.




Reasons for Urgency



Introduction and passage in the 2016 Spring sittings will ensure agricultural industries are able to benefit from these straightforward legislative amendments in a timely manner. The bill was first introduced to the Parliament in Autumn 2016. It was considered by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Transport and Legislation Committee, which recommended that the Senate pass the bill. The Committee received and considered 35 submissions from stakeholders in developing its recommendations. These stakeholders are likely to expect the bill's introduction and passage through the Parliament at an early stage.


The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee's report into its inquiry into Industry structures and systems governing the imposition of and disbursement of marketing and research and development (R&D) levies in the agricultural sector identified improved consultation and allocation of voting entitlements as critical for the ongoing health of Australia's R&D system. The report's first two recommendations identified legislative amendments to allow for the development of levy payer registers as key to achieving this aim.


The legislation currently prohibits information collected by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources being distributed to RDCs for the purpose of developing levy payer registers. This bill will make amendments to allow this to occur, at the request of the relevant RDC and industry.


A number of RDCs are actively investigating options for levy payer registers and are proceeding with investments in the development of interim registers.


In addition, the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper identifies a number of measures aimed at improving Australia's world-leading rural R&D system. These measures and the outcomes they seek to deliver, including new research and development priorities, improved


governance of RDCs and increased funding for the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, would benefit from timely improvements to consultation between RDCs and the levy payers that fund the R&D system.


Levy payer information will also be available to the Australian Bureau of Statistics to support its functions.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (19:41):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Australia's rural industries are among the most innovative and productive in the world. Continued investment in rural research and development (R&D) is vital to ensure ongoing growth and improvement in the profitability and competitiveness of Australia's agriculture, fisheries, forestry and food sectors. In recognition of this, the Australian Government works with industry to co-invest in research through our world-leading rural R&D system. 


Much of this work is delivered through the 15 rural research and development corporations (RDCs). RDCs provide a mechanism for industry to come together and invest collectively in R&D. The government assists by establishing and collecting a levy on behalf of an industry, if an industry requests this. The government also matches an RDC's eligible R&D spending up to a legislated cap. It is estimated that for every dollar that the government invests in rural R&D, farmers generate a $12 return over 10 years.


Feedback from primary producers is an integral part of how RDCs work. RDCs are required to consult with industry on their activities, to give those who fund the research, via levies, an opportunity to provide input into the strategic direction of the corporation. 


Numerous reviews and inquiries, including the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee's inquiry into Industry structures and systems governing levies on grass-fed cattle and Industry structures and systems governing the imposition of and disbursement of marketing and R&D levies in the agricultural sector, have identified improved consultation with levy payers as key to the ongoing strength of Australia's rural R&D system. Several of these inquiries recommended that the establishment of levy payer registers would offer a way for RDCs to consult more effectively with the primary producers who fund them. 


The government agrees that levy payers should have more of a say in how their levy funds are spent. RDCs should know who their levy payers are. Levy payer registers would provide RDCs with the ability to identify and consult directly with levy payers on research priorities and levy expenditure, and to accurately and efficiently allocate voting entitlements for polls, where this is relevant. 


This Bill makes possible the establishment of levy payer registers by RDCs by amending the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. As it stands, the Act only permits the distribution of levy payer information to the wool and dairy RDCs. This Bill remedies this by allowing the government to provide levy payer information, for the purposes of a levy payer register, to the 13 other RDCs.


The Bill removes the legislative impediment to the development of levy payer registers. However, recognising that a 'one size fits all' approach would not be appropriate given the diversity of Australian agricultural industries, the Bill allows for the distribution of levy payer information to an RDC to occur only where an RDC, in consultation with industry, requests it, and that request is approved by the minister. The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources would then work with the RDC on the administrative design and development of a register. This is consistent with the government's approach to the broader R&D levy system, which is centred on industry support.


The Bill also allows the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to permit levy payer information to be provided to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This is consistent with the Australian Government's Public Data Policy Statement, which commits to securely share data between Australian Government entities to improve efficiencies, and inform policy development and decision-making. 


The Bill maintains current practices for distribution of the name and address of the person or body that lodges levy returns with the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, to RDCs, industry representative bodies and others. In limited situations, the person that lodges returns is also the levy payer (for example, in the turf industry).


The Bill does not permit disclosure of information included in a levy payer register by an RDC or the ABS to a third party, except in limited circumstances and where expressly permitted by the Secretary in writing. This aims to protect the integrity and security of levy and charge payers' personal information.


Where an eligible recipient is permitted to disclose levy payer information to a third party, that person or body may only use the information for restricted purposes relating to R&D, marketing, biosecurity or the National Residue Survey, or in connection with any activity carried out by the RDC for the benefit of producers in the industry it serves. 


Where levy payer contact details are to be provided to an industry representative body, the administrative arrangements will enable levy payers to choose to opt-out and not receive information.


The passage of this Bill is the first key step in allowing for the development of levy payer registers, making it possible for the RDCs to identify and connect directly with those who fund their work. 


Through greater levy payer engagement in the R&D system, RDCs will be able to better align research investments to industry priorities—improving returns to primary producers and contributing to a more profitable, competitive and sustainable agricultural sector. 


We will now work with the RDCs and industry to make this happen. 


The government is committed to an Australian R&D system that remains transparent, consultative and delivers tangible benefits to Australia's agricultural industries into the future.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2016-09-12,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (19:42):  I begin my contribution by stating that the opposition will be supporting the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 2016. The bill removes the legislative impediment in the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to develop levy payer registers. This will allow all 15 rural research and development corporations, RDCs, to better communicate with their levy payers. Currently, as the act stands, it only permits the distribution of levy payer information to the wool and dairy RDCs.


The opposition also agrees that a one-size-fits-all approach would not be appropriate given the diversity of Australian agricultural industries. The bill allows for the distribution of levy payer information to an RDC to occur only where an RDC, in consultation with industry, requests it, and that request is approved by the minister. The levy payer registers would provide the RDCs with the ability to identify and consult directly with levy payers on research priorities and levy expenditure, and to accurately and efficiently allocate voting entitlements for polls, where this is relevant.


 The bill also allows levy payer information to be distributed to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the ABS, to perform any of its functions under the Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975. As detailed in the explanatory memorandum, this is consistent with the Australian government's Public data policy statement, which commits to securely share data between Australian government entities to improve efficiencies and to inform policy development and decision making. It is important to note that this bill is enabling legislation and that, for a levy payer register to occur, the RDC, in consultation with industry, would need to agree to the development of the register, and then that request would need to be approved by the minister. 


Both the shadow minister for agriculture and the Minister for Agriculture have acknowledged that there have been a number of Senate inquiries that have recommended that the RDCs should know who their levy payers are. In particular, the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee tabled its report in June 2015 recommending that the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 be amended to enable the collection and distribution of levy payer information which will allow the creation of levy payer databases for all agricultural industries that pay agricultural levies.


Further, it must also be acknowledged that the government actually introduced this bill in the dying days of the 44th Parliament on 3 March 2016, some eight months after the committee tabled its report. The bill was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on 17 March 2016, and the committee tabled its report in April 2016.


The Senate committee made three recommendations: (1) that the bill be passed; (2) that the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources continue to consult with RDCs and representatives of the agricultural industries as it implements the regulatory and administrative framework associated with the measures contained in the bill; and (3) that the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources tables a response to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee's report, tabled in June 2015, of the inquiry into the industry structures and systems governing the imposition and distribution of marketing and research and development levies in the agriculture sector.


The report acknowledged concerns by various submitters about how the implementation of the regulatory and administrative framework associated with the measures contained in the bill would actually work, especially with regard to sharing information with third parties. More information was requested about how the information about levy payers might be shared by peak industry bodies and councils, the degree of consultation required by RDCs, and the method by which levy payer information would be collected. The department advised that it is working closely with RDCs and industry representative bodies to develop detailed guidance so that the agricultural industry would have explicit guidance on how the levy payer database can be used, how the data should be stored and the protections that should be in place. The opposition believes that the government should have put forward draft guidelines for the parliament to consider while debating this bill, as it is important that levy payers are confident that their private information will be securely stored and are provided with information about how the data will be used.


Further concerns were also raised about the ability for the secretary to authorise disclosure of levy payer information to third parties, particularly to peak industry bodies. The submitters feared that levy payer information may be used by peak industry bodies for the purpose of conducting political campaigns. For example, FLAGS Australia expressed concern that peak industry bodies could misuse the levy payer register for this purpose. United Stockowners of Australia expressed similar concerns, specifically about the Cattle Council of Australia.


The committee were told that the bill sets out the purposes for which an eligible recipient would be able to use the database, and this includes a clause that it cannot be used for political purposes. However, without draft guidelines or regulations, it is difficult to reassure concerned levy payers that their information will not be misused.


All of us in this place can provide examples of database information being misused, and, once this information is shared and possibly misused for political purposes, it will be just about impossible to undo the damage. Further, concerns were expressed about the absence of penalties if the information were misused.


Voice of Horticulture and others sought further information about the costs of establishing the levy payer register database. The department noted that each RDC would need to consider the potential benefits against the significant investment that would be required. There is no obligation for RDCs to create a database. The bill only offers the RDCs the opportunity to create a levy payer register. This of course raises the issue of conflict of interest if the RDC and industry bodies are at odds as to whether the database should be created. Further, there are no details as to whether the costs will be the responsibility of the RDC or whether industry could assist with the associated costs. Once again, had the government put forward draft framework guidelines these unanswered questions could have been addressed. I will acknowledge that the government finally responded to the June 2015 committee report in May 2016—almost one year on.


As I initially stated, the opposition do see value in allowing the RDCs to create a levy payer register database if they choose to do so and we are supportive of this legislation. However, we are critical of the government's lack of detail regarding the implementation of the regulatory and administrative framework associated with the measures contained in this bill.


Rather than further delaying this bill due to the go-slow nature of the government, the shadow minister for agriculture has written to the minister for agriculture asking him to ensure that draft guidelines are put forward for consideration by the opposition, minor parties, Independents, industry groups and individual levy payers, so that we can ensure confidence is maintained in our world class levy payer rural research and development system.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2016-09-12,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (19:50):  I rise today to speak to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 2016. I am pleased to say that this is the first agriculture bill that I am speaking to in my new position as the Greens' spokesperson for agriculture and rural affairs. But I firstly want to thank my predecessor, Senator Rachel Siewert, the previous Greens' spokesperson, for the work that she has done on agriculture over her years in the Senate, not only in general, as a member of the regional and rural affairs and transport committee, but in particular as an advocate for a fairer and more sustainable agricultural sector in Australia.


The bill before us today deals with the transparency, accountability and responsibilities of our rural research and development corporations. The roles of the RDCs are only going to become more important over the coming years and, as the rural and regional affairs and transport committee investigation found last year, research and development investment from state and commonwealth bodies is contracting, right at the time when the agriculture sector is facing a whole new set of constraints. This leaves the rural research and development corporations to bear the majority of the responsibility in leading the Australian agriculture sector into the 21st century.


We are now seeing the impact that volatile globally connected markets are having on several of our agricultural industries, as the stories of our dairy and now our wheat farmers hit the front pages of the press. Critically, we are also seeing an increased realisation of the reality of our changing climate, and the consequences of these changes on our farming communities, as we need to both mitigate and adapt to these changes.


Both of these challenges coincide with what has been an extended slump in the sector's productivity growth, which, by world standards, is pretty unique to Australia. This productivity slump must be reversed if we hope to meet the growing demand for our limited food resources without irreparably harming our communities and ecosystems. I hope in my tenure as the Greens spokesperson for agriculture and rural affairs to continue to push for responses to these challenges from my fellow elected leaders and to stand up against a 'business as usual' complacency from those that benefit from the status quo.


The bill before us is the first legislative response to the committee inquiry into the collection and disbursement of research and development levies that was conducted last year. It was clear in last year's references inquiry into the levy system that the current processes are in need of reform—firstly, to better build on the transparency and accountability of the rural research and development corporations to levy payers; and, secondly, to better assist the RDCs in the performance of their responsibilities and effective dissemination of their work back to the community.


The legislation before us would amend the Primary Industry Levies and Charges Collections Act 1991 to allow the department to provide levy and charge payer information to additional rural research and development corporations and industry service bodies and to the ABS. Recipients, in turn, would be able to use the information for purposes including developing levy payer registers, publishing statistics and performing their functions. These shifts would increase the ability of RDCs to consult with their levy payers, helping shape research priorities, while enabling RDCs to better understand both the character and interests of their constituencies. Additionally, by empowering the Australian Bureau of Statistics to also access this information we open up the possibility of much more comprehensive agricultural statistical indicators, to inform our policy priorities both in this place and across departments.


When you are talking about data being accessible to a wider range of people, the Greens understand the privacy concerns associated with that and treat very seriously the concerns that were raised in some of the submissions to the committee. There are serious privacy implications for the handling of peoples data, especially when third parties are involved. And these need to be seriously addressed in further work that we do not believe has yet been completed. However, we do not believe the issues raised are enough for us to consider that this bill should not be supported. We also understand that the legislation does not explicitly empower industry representatives who have important roles to play in facilitating the relationship between the research and development corporations and levy payers.


We believe that collectively these concerns we have about this legislation do not amount to enough to give us grounds to reject the legislation before the chamber today. We believe that both the explanatory memorandum and the majority committee report do make a persuasive case for how privacy will be protected, potential misuses of information mitigated and the community consulted. However, there is clearly more work to be done to give certainty and to make sure that people's privacy is going to be protected.


We ask that the government take these reservations into consideration, and we echo the majority report of the committee in recommending that the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources consult with the research and development corporations, agricultural industry representatives and the wider community as it implements this new regulatory and administrative framework.


Following on from this, thcre is still a case for further reform in developing greater transparency and accountability processes between levy payers and RDCs, and there is a larger debate still to be had about the role of levy payers in voting on rates and setting research priorities. But we believe that is something we can continue to work on in the future. With regard to this bill, the Greens will support the legislation and we commend the bill to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (19:57):  The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 2016 is a much needed reform that is fortuitously before the parliament now, and I congratulate the minister for his work in bringing this bill before the parliament.


The issue particularly arose—what is now some years ago—when the minister arranged for the Senate Standing Committee of Rural and Regional Affairs, I think it was, to look into the question of levies, particularly in relation to the grass-fed cattle industry. That inquiry by the committee revealed some very interesting issues and some very interesting facts. It also quite clearly established that there was need for change. This bill brings forward some of that change.


The Australian rural industries, as senators will know, are amongst the most innovative and productive in the world. It is important that we continue investment and rural research and development, and it is vital to ensure that the ongoing growth and improvement in profitability and competitiveness in Australia's broadly described agriculture sectors does continue. It is important that the government works with industry to co-invest in research through our world-leading rural research and development systems.


The inquiry to which I referred, which took quite a substantial amount of the committee's time when the inquiry was in the course of its operations, heard particularly from grass-fed beef cattle producers right across the nation, and it was clear that reform was needed. I am trying to find these passages as I speak but, as I recall, there were some real problems with the constitution of the R&D corporations in whatever form they were, and there were some real anomalies in how those R&D corporations were governed—what their rules of operation were and, most importantly, who was appointed to the board that decided what matters should be researched and what matters should be given priority and predominance by the R&D corporation.


There were some real anomalies in relation to the grass-fed beef cattle people, as I recall. I am going from memory here, because I have not quite been able to pick that up in the time I had to have a look at it. There was an instance, as I understand, where you got a vote for the board at the R&D corporation in accordance with the number of cattle transactions that you were involved in over a particular period of time, but there was no auditing, no careful consideration of how many votes you were entitled to. I recall one person giving evidence to say that they made up a number; they said they had 50,000 transactions with cattle at one particular time. They did not, though—they were quite open about it—but they put that number in, because the only way that they got a vote was by simply advising the authority that there had been this many transactions. Therefore they got that many votes even though they may well not have, in effect, had any cattle transactions at all. So it was quite clear that there needed to be reform, and the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee did look into that at some length.


This bill before the parliament makes it possible for the establishment of levy payer registers by the particular RDCs. I am talking about the grass-fed beef cattle industry, but it applies to a number of other levy payer registers where there is a research and development corporation. The bill remedies some of the problems by allowing the government to provide levy payer information for the purposes of the levy payer register to 13 other regional development corporations and, consistent with the application of the broader R&D levy system, the establishment of levy payer registers will occur only when the RDC actually requests it. 


As I say, these RDCs go beyond just the beef cattle area—they include the Australian Egg Corporation Limited, Australian Grape and Wine Authority, Australian Meat Processor Corporation, Australian Pork Limited, Australian Wool Innovation, Cotton Research and Development Corporation, Dairy Australia, Forest and Wood Products Australia Limited, Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Grains Research and Development Corporation, the Horticulture Innovation Australia, LiveCorp, Meat & Livestock Australia, the RIRDC and Sugar Research Australia.


This bill allows the distribution of levy payer information to the various regional development corporations for the development of levy payer registers, and the register will allow the RDCs to identify and consult directly with the levy payers who fund the R&D system and ensure accuracy in the allocation of voting entitlements. That was the issue that the Senate committee identified and looked into very, very carefully at the time because, as I mentioned and gave the example of, there were a lot of anomalies in that area. This required addressing in the grass-fed beef cattle area, and clearly in these other rural R&D corporations as well.


Through greater levy payer engagement, the RDCs will be better able to align research investments to industry priorities. That was one of the problems that came up in this inquiry. The grass-fed beef cattle industry players—those who actually grew the cattle—did not believe that the R&D corporation was investing the research and development moneys into the area which they thought was a priority. This new system will align research investments to industry priorities, which in turn will hopefully improve returns to farmers, fishermen and foresters, and will contribute to a more profitable, competitive and more sustainable agricultural sector.


It was clear in the Senate inquiry and it is clear when you discuss this matter and consult across rural industries that the one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate because within Australian agricultural industries there is a great deal of diversity. This bill allows for the distribution of levy-payer information to an RDC to occur only where the RDC in consultation with industry asks for it and that that request is approved by the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources would then work with the RDCs to administer the design and development of a register.


What this bill does is try to regularise the levy-payer information—what can be distributed, what can go to the Australian Bureau of Statistics for their purposes. It is also consistent with the government's public data policy statement, which commits to securely shared data between government agencies to improve efficiencies and inform policy development and decision making. Secondary disclosure of levy-payer information by an RDC and the Australian Bureau of Statistics will be limited. The departmental secretary can approve its disclosure in some circumstances, including for example disclosure by an RDC to an industry representative body for the purposes of consulting on research and development activities that are to be conducted by the corporation. 


In coming to this bill, the minister did consult widely and, to a fairly high degree, the minister's decision in relation to amending this bill came from the inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee into the industry structures and systems governing levies on grass fed cattle and industry structures.


This is an important bill. It has been a fair while in the making and I am pleased to see that it is here before the parliament at the moment. I suspect there are a few other things that need to be done and these were identified in that committee inquiry, but this is a very good start and I congratulate the minister for doing this and bringing this bill before the parliament. It will make things 'better'—a silly word—but it will make things better and more efficient for the industries that are able to access the innovations in this bill. Hopefully, that will lead to better research and development in our primary industries, our agricultural industries, which in turn will lead to better wealth for the farmers involved, and better export potential for those agricultural export products. All of that, of course, means a better Australia, a healthier and, hopefully, wealthier rural and regional Australia and continuing success for our agricultural industries. I support the bill and urge the Senate to do likewise.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-09-12,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (20:11):  Taxation without representation sucks. It is inherently unfair to be required to pay for a system but have no say in how the system works. This is currently the world of agricultural levies. A levy may sound more benign than a tax. But make no mistake, R&D levies, marketing levies and biosecurity levies are all taxes on production. In fact, compulsory levies paid by producers each year amount to about $500 million. At various times, the amount paid in levies can be more than the profit made by individual producers, and numerous producers pay hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in levies. By any measure, levy payments are a significant impost and should be fully justified. In many cases, farmers who pay the levies are happy to continue doing so. I suspect most believe, perhaps innocently, that the levies are put to good use and should be paid. The problem is very few levy payers are ever actually asked whether they are happy. If they are not happy, there is nothing whatsoever that most of them can do about it. 


In the previous parliament, two Senate inquiries recommended that this should change. I was an active participant in the second inquiry which examined the levy system across all agricultural and horticultural sectors. By the end of the first hour of evidence at the first hearing, it was apparent the system is broken. What the committee heard is that a number of farmer groups have never been consulted as to whether they want to pay levies. They were not asked when the levy was first imposed and they have never been asked if they want to keep paying. Some had the opportunity to vote to impose a levy the first time, but decades later have not been able to vote on whether to keep paying it, not even when the money has been poorly spent. Some had the opportunity to vote for an increase in a levy but found the votes so rigged it was laughable. We saw this in the last parliament with mushrooms, mangoes and onions, based on ridiculous notions of what is a representative vote.


Until about four months ago, two sectors were standout exceptions to this antidemocratic, unrepresentative taxation. Tens of thousands of dairy farmers and wool producers were polled every few years to determine the rate of the levy. Quite appropriately, they were offered a zero option, which if adopted would mean levy payments would cease and various people in the RDCs—that is, the research and development corporations—would lose their jobs. So far, this has never been chosen, but the possibility that it might be the preferred option focused the minds of those who spent the money, the organisations and RDCs responsible for marketing, research and development. They knew they needed to continually demonstrate to levy payers the value they were getting for their money. It is called accountability.


Unfortunately, on the last sitting day before parliament rose, the government rammed through a bill that removed the requirement by the dairy industry to conduct regular votes. I was the only senator to oppose it. It would have been dealt with in the non-controversial session, but for my opposition. Dairy Australia, and the other dairy industry groups that promoted this, should be ashamed of themselves. It was a nakedly obvious move to reduce, indeed avoid, accountability. The cost argument they claimed was utter garbage. The supposedly high cost of the dairy poll was merely attributable to campaign costs.


With dairy prices currently at rock bottom, there are dairy farmers incurring huge losses, while at the same time paying tens of thousands of dollars in levies. As a result of the bill, a vote will only be held if there is a proposal by Dairy Australia to vary the dairy levy, or, in a catch 22 situation, if enough dairy farmers vote, to conduct a vote. So, now, only the wool industry has levy democracy. It is a disgrace. We all get to vote for a government every three years, and we can choose a party that promises higher or lower taxes. In agriculture, such a basic right does not exist. This bill will go some of the way towards rectifying that. What it will allow is for each industry body to establish a database of levy payers.


I support the bill, although clearly it does not go far enough. It will not oblige the industry bodies to establish databases of levy payers. It merely gives them the legal authority if they choose to do so. It will also not ensure the RDCs use their databases for any constructive purpose, such as a periodic vote on the payment of levies. Indeed, I believe there is a distinct possibility that some RDCs will not want levy payers to be asked whether they want to continue paying levies, especially if they suspect they might not like the answer. I can assure those RDCs that I will be watching with considerable interest whether they actually go ahead and establish a levy payer database. If they do not, I will assume the worst about them. 


A database of levy payers is the first step in introducing accountability, and a semblance of democracy, to the levy system. I am quite sure most producers do not begrudge paying a levy if they see value in it. But they deserve to be asked. In fact, they deserve to be asked about how the money is spent, too, such as whether to fund marketing as well as R&D—but I do not expect to see that any time soon. As for giving levy payers a vote, in this age of the internet secure online polls can be undertaken at very low cost, and even a postal vote is not expensive. But to conduct a poll you obviously need a list of voters. It is time we gave primary producers some say over their hard-earned money. This bill is a step in the right direction.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2016-09-12,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (20:18):  I am very happy to make a contribution to this debate on a bill that amends Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. Like the previous speaker, Senator Leyonhjelm, I too was involved in one of the two inquiries into levies. I will start my contribution by talking specifically about the beef industry, given that, of the rural industries that are affected by this change, it is the area I know best. I imagine that much of what I have to say will be as applicable to other livestock research and development corporations, along with horticulture and some of the other industries in our rural sectors. 


Despite some of the observations that have been made by previous speakers about more having to be done, I have taken the view that this bill is focusing directly on using technology and innovation to increase the level of communication between research and development corporations and their constituencies, for want of a better description. In the case of the cattle industry, it is true to say that there were millions of dollars, and in fact millions of transactions, that attracted a levy. Where that money was paid, agents and others in the saleyards and others had a responsibility to complete the returns. Information about the levy payer, information about the transaction itself—that is to say, what promoted the transaction in terms of the description that was involved, in this case, cattle—was of course not available in those circumstances to the meat and livestock authority. What we do know is there are between some 36,000 and 47,000 cattle producers. Hopefully, this bill and the establishment of this register—assuming that the MLA is one of the applicants, and from my discussions with them I suspect that they will be one of the first to make application for the register, as it is something that they have wanted for a long time—will allow us to more accurately determine just how many cattle producers there are, all the way down to small producers, where a small part-time operator might just be involved in 10, 20 or 30 transactions annually, right through to major corporations, including large family corporations, who of course trade in tens of thousands of head of cattle each year. 


In my discussions with Meat and Livestock Australia, one of the problems that they have had is engagement from these levy holders, or these cattle producers, in the life of the MLA. In fact, as alluded to by the previous speaker, Senator Leyonhjelm, there were issues presented that suggested that some of the system was being corrupted to a certain extent by big players who together were very organised in how they might exercise their powers, pursuant to them being a levy payer, with the elections within Meat and Livestock Australia itself.


Meat and Livestock Australia has been picked as an example for me because it covers a number of very significant industries in our country. The MLA, through peak industry bodies, is involved with the Cattle Council of Australia and the red meat authority. It deals with sheep, goats, feedlots and meat exporters. In fact, the peak industry bodies that are affiliated with the MLA cover just about the entire supply chain within the beef industry. This is a multi-multibillion dollar industry in this nation. The industry is currently enjoying somewhat of a price resurgence but, at the same time, we recognise that there are many thousands of families who have not yet recovered from the effects of the live cattle ban in 2011 and the terrible drought which, whilst now largely behind us, has left a legacy where there are operations that are yet to have sufficient pasture regeneration to restock their properties. Some of these producers have spent anywhere between three and five years without a productive income. In terms of recovery, these entities often rely very significantly on organisations like the MLA and the results of the research and development that is done.


The MLA have a budget of about $170 million annually, made up of levy payments from these various sectors, along of course with the matching grants provided by government—the dollar-for-dollar match on research grants. Over a number of decades now, a tremendous amount of work has been done—and continues to be done—on research and development. One of the challenges for Meat and Livestock Australia has been how they disseminate that information back to interested parties. There are many ways to do that in a modern world, and the MLA do that as well as most and better than some.


In effect, this legislation will give them a direct link back to a levy payer. Not only will it allow them to communicate directly with the levy payers, but the information that will be lodged on the register will start to allow them to determine where the levy payer is. The beef industry is a very diverse industry. If you are growing cattle in northern Tasmania, northern Victoria, the highlands of New South Wales, the western desert country of my home state or up in the gulf, the only thing that those respective enterprises in those geographic zones may have in common will simply be that they produce cattle. There are so many other variables in terms of the markets that they are offer. Some areas specialise in the use of hormones and growth proponents with their cattle; whereas, others pursue markets, particularly the European market, where those things are banned.


This legislation will allow authorities like Meat and LiveStock Australia to take the results of their research and development efforts and tailor them to go back to these levy payers—the people who have invested in the research and development, along with the government of the day—and provide them with feedback from the R&D that is quite specific to both the scale of their operation and the geography of where they are operating. In fact, as I understand, in this data there will be descriptions of the trade. So they will be able to indicate what markets some of these levy payers are pursuing, so that they can further refine the research and development outcomes with these producers.


My family is in cattle in a reasonably exposed way, and I know that members of my extended family have used the results of the research and development efforts of the MLA over a period of time. This research and development was to do with pasture management, genetic selection and breed plans. They received great benefit from this R&D. In one case in particular, they modernised their operations to the point where they took what was a marginal living block or family block and they turned it into quite a profitable enterprise. Most of that resulted from them having the benefit of research and development knowledge created by, in this case, Meat and Livestock Australia.


Importantly, this legislation will now create a direct, unbroken nexus between the MLA and these levy payers. So they should receive updates of the results of this research and development work that is directly tailored to the enterprise that they are involved in. It almost defies modern techniques to think that that had not happened up to this point. This legislation is an important leap for rural industries. As we all know, information is power. If this information is collected and collated properly, I think this will provide a great lift to productivity for many of these producers and growers of grains and cereals—in horticulture in particular.


I heard my colleague speak about investment in marketing. I would have to disagree with Senator Leyonhjelm. His reference was to a couple of sectors, and I know in the case of beef that Meat and Livestock Australia, for example, have invested tens of millions of dollars in marketing. The MLA have established offices all around the world where our major markets are, and we have seen the fruits of their labour. We have seen the fruits of labour in the lift of volumes that have gone into the markets—of course, aided by our recent free trade agreements with Korea, Japan and China. There is some exciting work going on in this field with India and now, of course, with Europe. With the Brexit affair there are markets that are going to open up in Europe that our people had not necessarily had a chance to compete in before. With this two-way structure where these research and development corporations will now have firsthand knowledge of who their levy payers are and who their audience is, they will be able to work with the peak industry bodies in the respective fields to be able to communicate with these people, also, in relation to marketing issues and the dissemination of the information from the Research and Development Corporations.


I am inclined to agree with Senator Leyonhjelm. I have only heard his contribution since I came in here. He calls for these peak bodies and these RDCs to pay more attention to the issue of transparency. I do not think there would be anybody in this place—anybody in this Senate—that would argue against creating the most transparent environment one could with the performance of peak bodies and with how they spend their money. I do agree that, over a long period of time, there have been sectors which have, I think, with some right complained about how the investment of their money has occurred, the balance between research and development and marketing, and, of course, when you get down into some smaller sectors, allegations that some of the behaviour favoured some in the sector over others.


It is particularly important, at least as far as I am concerned, to ensure that we create an environment where small operations—for what I call 'small operations' we in the cattle industry call them 'living blocks'; I am sure that they have titles in horticulture and in farming, also—are able to function and flourish. Small operations, of course, do not have a personal capacity to conduct research and development on any scale. So it is very important that their peak bodies and these RDCs are, when they disseminate this information, able to tailor it, as I mentioned earlier, to the size, scope and geographic considerations of the operations of the recipients. Small operators could not, as you would appreciate, invest money in genetic research with livestock operations as one might expect would occur on the scale of Meat and Livestock Australia. So if we do not have this two-way communication where the peak bodies and the RDCs can disseminate this information, these small operations will be at a complete disadvantage. The knock-on effect of that is: much more large-scale corporatisation in many of our rural industries. Whilst large-scale corporatisation is an important component, if we get to a point where smaller-scale, family-sized operations—extended family operations—cannot operate and compete, then the knock-on effect will be the impact it will have on so many hundreds of our small rural communities around the country.


The larger corporate operations receive equal benefit for the investment in R&D. In fact, some R&D can only be applied on scale. So you could argue that many of the large corporations get a better bang for their levy buck from research and development than the smaller-scale operators. With some R&D, as you know, the introduction of innovative technologies requires investment. So many of our small family farms and small family horticulture growers just do not have that sort of capital to invest. It is important that we pay attention to that fact and do whatever we can through our research and development investment as a government and within the industry to ensure that these smaller-scale operations can stay and compete in the industry, lest we will see, as I say, the corporatisation of the agriculture sector. Whilst that has a positive contribution on occasions, if we were to do everything on scale then so many of our small communities out west would disappear.


Many of these larger corporate operations operate very much like the resource sector—in that they fly-in fly-out with their staff. They are more inclined to buy 10 or 15 Toyotas at a time in Melbourne and import them onto Melbourne ports than they are to go into Charleville or Roma, or Cloncurry, in my state to make purchases. So it is so significantly important that, as the government, and as a nation, we continue to focus on whatever it is we can do to enhance the ability of small family operations—these family farms—to continue to prosper, to flourish and, indeed, to make it attractive enough for a generational investment from father to son, from mother to daughter, so that they can remain in rural areas and grow the economies of those small districts.


I think in the fullness of time, as we reflect upon this legislation that is before us today, we are going to see it make a significant contribution. In a modern world, communications are instantaneous. You can press a button, if you know how to—some of us who, sadly, were born in the fifties struggle a bit with which button to push, but, fortunately, we have people who can show us what to do there—and you can instantaneously pass on very large volumes of important and significant information between one and another. That is what this bill will be about. It is a two-way street. The information that these peak bodies will receive will allow them to engage with these levy payers. And I agree with Senator Leyonhjelm: it is a challenge for them now to engage with their base, with these individuals, and to put as many tests against themselves for transparency as one can. They no longer will have an excuse that they have not communicated back to the people who have invested in this research and development, and marketing. Up until now they have had a defence that they did not know, necessarily, who they were, except for their development of databases that they have done independently of this.


I think all the appropriate privacy considerations have been taken into account in this legislation. I know that the peak bodies and the RDCs whom I have had a chance to talk to since the inquiry will welcome this. There will be some, of course, who will be anxious because they know now that they may have to make sure that the investments done on behalf of their members are done in a proper, fair and equitable fashion, because they will have an obligation, in my view, to report back to them on the progress of their efforts on their behalf.


So I think this is a positive bill. I am sure it is one that is going to be supported. I cannot see any reason why it will not be supported by everybody across the chamber. For my part, I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (20:38):  I rise to support the comments of my colleague Senator O'Sullivan in supporting the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 2016. I am absolutely delighted here in 2016 that agriculture and agribusiness have found their place in the Australian psyche. When I came here in 2008/09, you could not even get agriculture onto the agenda. Today, it is recognised that agriculture is not only so important domestically but that, from an export point of view, agriculture contributes about $50 billion to the Australian economy. It is one of those areas that is expanding astronomically as we embrace the free trade agreements with Korea, with Japan and with China. I hope we embrace the opportunities with the Trans-Pacific Partnership over time, because it is going to open up a whole new geographic area for us in the areas of Mexico, Chile and Peru—into Central and South America. 


I want to make some comments more generally about agriculture and primary industry levies and charges, but I do want to focus for a few moments more particularly on the beef industry. With regard to agriculture more widely, it is important for people in the chamber and those listening to understand that the government support on a dollar for dollar basis the research activities of levy payers. For that reason, it is vitally important that we in this chamber and in the other place, on behalf of the Australian people, have an interest in, and an oversight of, how levy moneys are spent. 


During the inquiry into this bill, we heard from pretty well every one of the agriculturally related companies or organisations, and we learnt from different sectors within the agribusiness and agricultural industries that there was frustration as to who the levy payers were, as to how much they were paying, as to whom they were making the payments and as to, most particularly, where their dollars went. Again, the government, on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia, do support that research component very, very actively. It is important, particularly in today's world with today's technology, that levy payers are identified, that the amount they pay is correctly recorded and reported, that those funds are made available through the responsible organisations and that, most importantly, we have the smallest amount of administrative burden between the payment of moneys by levy payers and the value of those levies paid by way of research, marketing, development or whatever purpose they are allocated. 


In proposing this legislation, the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources and Deputy Prime Minister made the point that there are 15 rural regional and development corporations, RDCs, and that one size does not suit all. The Senate inquiry we had into this legislation led to a report and recommendations which, I am pleased to say, were almost unanimous if not unanimous. In that inquiry there was a recognition from those who pay levies, to those who receive the levies and those who allocate the research and marketing funding: (a) that there be a separation between the two and that it be transparent, and (b) that on the research component we know where those dollars are being spent.


I want now to focus more centrally on the recommendations that came from the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report into grass-fed cattle. That is going to lead me also to make some observations on the first speech this evening of the newly elected Senator Derryn Hinch. I go back, initially, to the recommendations of the grass-fed beef levy report and its hearings. We held those hearings around Australia: in Canberra, in Broome, in Tennant Creek, in Rockhampton, back to Canberra and back to the Riverina area of New South Wales. 


The recommendations of that inquiry are reflected widely in the bill which we are discussing this evening. The first recommendation was that there be established a producer owned body which would have the authority to receive and disburse the funds for research and development as well as marketing, in this case, of the cattle transaction levy funds. Why did that come about? Simply because there was a recognition that there was a wide gap in the knowledge of who paid levies, when they were paid, to whom they were paid and the source of that funding. That recommendation went on:


The producer-owned body should also be authorised to receive matching government research and development funds. 


There was also mention made of reforming the Cattle Council of Australia to achieve these outcomes. So immediately this chamber and this parliament became involved in the oversight and husbanding, on behalf of the Australian taxpayer, of funds for research and development—not for marketing but for research and development. I am very pleased to see that the bill, as it has been presented to us for approval, does pick up those questions associated with the recommendation that was made. 


The second recommendation was for the establishment of a cost-effective, automated cattle transaction levy system. That system, we said, should identify levy payers against levies paid. The scenario that we encountered as we went around Australia was that there was no immediacy with settlement. A levy payer would sell cattle into the market and funds would be taken out of that transaction for the purposes of the levy. But a long time gap existed between when the levy payer paid the funds to the person—often the agent who held the funds—and when those funds were eventually retired to the responsible authority. We said in 2015—bearing in mind the current electronic settlements that occur by their billions today in the credit card market et cetera—that there should be a more immediate settlement of levy fees paid and allocation of what are called voting entitlements. 


I want to introduce that topic because, obviously, upon the payment of levies a levy payer—a producer—then has certain entitlements to vote on where research, development and marketing funds are allocated. We also said that this should be the subject of independent auditing and verification, which at that time it was not. We did recommend, and it was perhaps a bit unique to the grass-fed beef industry, that there should be an amendment to the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act so that levies paid by beef processors—in other words, those who are involved in the processing of the product from the live animal through to the product available for retail—should be separated, and recognised as being separated, as slaughter levies and not as producer levies. This was somewhat unique to that industry but, nevertheless, vitally important. Why was it important? Because there was a concern that processors, as a result of the dollars involved in their component of levy collection, had an unfair benefit over producers in terms of how levies were allocated and the purposes for which research and development was undertaken.


During that inquiry we recommended—as I recall, it was again unanimous with the support of my own side and of my colleagues from the Labor Party, Senators Sterle and Gallacher—that the Australian National Audit Office should conduct an audit of the cattle transaction levy scheme, tracing the levy from inception and focusing on revenue through to expenditure and the respective components—research, development and marketing. 


The final recommendation that is relevant to our discussion this evening involves drawing on international experience. The fear was raised continually by producers that there was no transparency in the supply chain from the calf through to the retail plate, so our final recommendation was that the Department of Agriculture, in consultation with the cattle industry, should conduct an analysis of the benefits, costs and consequences of introducing American legislation akin to the US Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 and the Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 1999. What does this legislation do in the USA? Basically, it allows a scenario in which those involved in production, processing, transportation, marketing and retailing have a greater degree of transparency on where the funds come from and what the fate of the funds is. I am pleased to see that my colleague Senator Reynolds is now in the chamber, because she was instrumental in the original Senate inquiry being undertaken, which has led to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 2016. 


I now turn to the speech given this evening—or at least a small part of it, since it was so long—by Senator Hinch. Where is the relevance? The relevance involves the beef industry and the grass-fed levies. When we went around Australia—Senator Whish-Wilson, as I recall, was a participant in Broome and in Tennant Creek, but I do not recall if he was there in Rockhampton—it was the first time since 2011, when that shocking ban on the live export trade was visited upon the beef industry of this country, that the beef producers had their opportunity to be heard on the effect of that event on their industry. I want to reflect on it this evening because, while there are some elements of what Senator Hinch said tonight with which I agree, let me tell you this, and let me place it very firmly on record: it is obvious that Senator Hinch has no understanding of the live export trade in this country at all—whether it involves sheep or beef. He mentioned the names of people who I do not mention anymore, because I am under legal recourse to not mention their names anymore. But the time will come when I will speak to Senator Hinch, and I will explain to him the error of his thinking when it comes to this industry. 


As Senator Whish-Wilson has heard and knows, there are 109 countries in this world that export live production animals for processing purposes. Senator Hinch, in his little cocoon, does not know this: there is only one country that has ever invested time or money or personnel or expertise in the wellbeing and the husbandry and the management and the transport and the nutrition and the welfare of animals in our target markets, and that country is Australia. I will not stand by and listen to the nonsense that was visited upon this parliament this evening by this man, who pretends to think, because he has been on the end of a radio microphone for some years, he is the voice of all knowledge in this industry. It was the worst piece of legislation that ever came down in this country. Not only did it affect cattle producers across the country but it affected transporters, it affected marketers, it affected transport companies and it affected helicopter companies.


As I have said in this place, does Senator Hinch, if he understands anything about this industry, think for one minute that the timing of that Four Corners program at the end of May in 2011 was in any way coincidental, that it coincided with the trough of the revenue side of that industry and the peak of the expenditure side? Does he not understand that it was a deliberate effort by a number of people, including the meat industry employees union, GetUp!, animal activists and others whose only interest was the destruction of an industry and to get a Prime Minister off the front page?


Let me tell you a little bit more. I know Senator Hinch will not be in the least bit interested, but let me tell you a little bit of the history. In 2010, Dr Ivan Caple, then or prior to that the senior honorary veterinarian for the RSPCA in this country, had been commissioned to go to Indonesia with a highly specialised group to look at issues associated with the processing of live cattle in Indonesia. He presented that report to the then agriculture minister, Mr Burke. An officer of Mr Burke's office, a Ms Skye Laris, had been an ABC journalist. Ms Laris subsequently became the chief of staff to Mr Burke and subsequently his wife. 


From the time that Dr Caple produced his report advising that there were some minor problems associated with the processing of Australian beef in Indonesia but by no means the nonsense that we saw in that Four Corners cooked up show. That show, incidentally, reminds me to tell you that the producer, Ms Sarah Ferguson, lied to me under oath six times in a subsequent Senate inquiry. Let me put that to one side. Ms Laris received the Caple report but never presented it to the then Minister for Agriculture, Mr Burke. We know that the 2010 election occurred, former Minister Burke went on to other ministries and then Senator Joe Ludwig became the agriculture minister. Did Ms Laris ever report to new Minister Ludwig the events associated with the Caple report, reported to Ms Laris? No. Caple was never called upon to report to any minister of a Labor government. We know the sequel: late May 2011 we had the Four Corners report; early June the ban on the trade took place.


Some days later, on the steps of Martin Place in Sydney, we had a group of people, including animal activists and GetUp!, who stood on those steps to say that they would see the end of the live export trade in this country. Do you know who the representative of GetUp! was on that occasion? It was Ms Skye Laris, the recent chief of staff to the Minister of Agriculture, who had withheld any information from the Caple report from 2010 upon which action could have been taken if they so minded but nothing—no action no nothing. And so we had a circumstance in which the then chief of staff, now a GetUp! aficionado, was proudly telling us all that she had tens of thousands of email addresses to whom she could send this information.


Senator Hinch stands condemned for his lack of knowledge and for the presentation of that information.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (20:58):  I too rise to speak in support of the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 2016. I first became involved in the issue of levies shortly after I was sworn into this place. Not coming from a rural background, I first became aware of significant issues in relation to levies after visiting our horticulturalists in the south-west of Western Australia. It soon became very clear to me in talking to the horticulturalists that there were very significant and very profound flaws and issues with the current levy system as is stood and as it still stands today.


In conjunction with my colleague Senator Leyonhjelm and other senators, I co-sponsored an inquiry to investigate compulsory marketing and research levies faced by growers in Australia's $50 billion agricultural industry. Under the current research and development corporation model, primary producers are required to pay an annual fee to bodies which carry out research and development in their specific commodity industry. Research and development feeds into agricultural productivity and into our economy. Collective investment by producers into research absolutely makes sense, but I came to the belief very quickly and very early on in this place that a lot needed to be done to make the system more effective for growers and for the organisations themselves, and that there was very little transparency or accountability in the whole system.


The inquiry was designed to enable all sides to have their say on the operation of the levy system as it stood and to provide suggestions on how it could be improved. I was quite stunned by a lot of the evidence I heard through the inquiry over the course of 2014 and into 2015. One of the first observations that I had was around the overwhelming evidence from across commodities and growers and organisations: if somebody had tried to design a worse system I do not think they could have succeeded in making one any worse than the one that we found in this inquiry.


One of the things that particularly alarmed me throughout the inquiry and on reviewing the submissions, was that there was almost zero accountability across many of the commodity levies. You have the growers across the 60, 70 or 80 different commodities. They all have a completely different levy payment system which is calculated and paid differently. Sometimes there are intermediaries and brokers. There is very little accountability across all of those different commodity systems in terms of who has paid, how much they have paid, whether they have paid the right amount and whether the right amount has actually gone through to the department.


But it was actually a lot worse than that. What we found in this inquiry was that there was, in some commodities, almost no accountability whatsoever between the growers who paid the various levies and the people who spent the levies on marketing and research activities. These organisations were happily spending the money, sometimes on very laudable projects, and doing their annual reports—nice glossy reports that showed that they were doing a lot of things, sometimes over and over again—but a number of organisations had very little accountability to the growers who paid the levies. This was particularly so in a number of commodities in Western Australia. For example, with avocados and other commodities, we had a lot of evidence where they were paying the lion's share of the levies but little, if any, of the marketing and, particularly, the R&D money was actually going into the particular circumstances of growing avocados and other commodities in Western Australia.


One of the first things in the report was that this issue of accountability needed to be fixed. Hundreds of millions of dollars are paid every year by Western Australian farmers, by growers across all commodities, but few of them actually have any idea or any say into where their money is going and, across many commodities, many of them do not ever see any tangible benefit for the money they are paying. Indeed, many of them have had no confirmation that the money they pay actually goes to where it is supposed to go. We had many stories of money disappearing among intermediaries and elsewhere. It is clearly a system that is badly in need not only of accountability and transparency but also of reporting back to the growers whose money is being paid to those levies.


I am very happy to rise to speak tonight on this bill because, while it does not yet address all of the recommendations that the Senate inquiry made, it is certainly a fantastic first start. What does this bill actually do? The bill reintroduces a bill which was presented to the previous parliament and which passed the House with bipartisan support. This bill was supported by a Senate committee inquiry but, unfortunately, did not pass through this chamber before parliament was dissolved. The bill amends the Primary Industries Levy and Charges Collection Act 1991 and allows for the creation of levy payer registers and for the distribution of levy payer information to rural R&D corporations. Again, it is a great first step in the process of providing accountability and transparency between the growers who pay the levies and those who spend the money.


Currently, levy payer information is only distributed to the RDCs for two commodities: Australian Wool Innovation and Dairy Australia. This bill enables that information to go to all 13 RDCs. This bill is the first step. RDCs will then need to talk with industry and decide whether to fund the development of a register. They will need to apply to the minister for approval and they will need to work with the department on the design of the system so that it meets the department's requirements. The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources is already talking to those RDCs and to industry on what they need to do to collect the data efficiently. Once all of those details are settled, the government will amend the regulations to formally mandate the collection of the data.


This bill also enables the secretary of the department to agree to provide levy payer register information to industry representative bodies, such as the Cattle Council of Australia and Grain Producers Australia et cetera—for example, for the purposes of consulting with all levy payers on R&D priorities and levies. So these organisations, the RDCs spending the money, will be able to go back and consult the growers, the people whose interests they are there to look after and to do research behalf of. They will be able to ask growers: what do you actually want and what you actually need? It is quite astounding that this system has been in place for so long and we still do not have those basic accountability and transparency mechanisms, so this bill is a very good thing.


Why is the bill needed? The bill makes it possible for RDCs to identify and connect directly with primary producers, who, after all, fund their work, pay their bills and employ their staff. Numerous reviews and inquiries have identified improved consultation with levy payers as important, if not critical, for the ongoing strength of Australia's rural R&D system. Several of these inquiries recommended establishing levy payer registers as a way for RDCs to consult more effectively with the primary producers, who, as I said, pay their wages.


The government agrees that levy payers should have more of a say in how their levy funds are spent. In fact, personally, I think they should have more than just say; it should be up to them how their money is spent in their own commodity industries. Levy payer registers will provide RDCs with the ability to identify and consult directly with levy payers on research priorities and levy expenditure and to accurately and efficiently allocate voting entitlements where useful. Again, I think it is critically important for all of the RDCs to look at allocating voting entitlements so that their growers actually have a fair say in the operations of the RDCs. As it currently stands, the legislation does not allow for levy payer information to be distributed by the department to RDCs where they have collected it, as I said, with the exception of two industries—the wool and the dairy industries. This bill remedies this situation by making it possible to provide the information to the other 13 RDCs.


What more does this bill do? The bill amends the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to allow the department to distribute levy and charge payer information to all RDCs. The information that will be provided includes the name, the address, the contact details and the ABN of levy and charge payers as well as the amounts of the levy or charges paid. The bill also allows levy payers' information to be used by the ABS in performing its functions. This is consistent with the Australian government's Public data policy statement, which commits to securely sharing data between Australian government entities to improve efficiencies and inform policy development and decision making. The bill also allows the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to approve the disclosure of information by an RDC under limited circumstances also to a third party, such as to a ballot provider for a levy vote, for example. 


The bill in and of itself does not create levy payer registers. The distribution of levy payer information to an RDC for a levy payer register will only occur where the RDC makes that decision in consultation with industry. As I said, the department has already started consulting with RDCs, which is a very welcome development. It is also consulting now with industry representative bodies and levy collection agents on their requirements, such as IT systems and other administrative matters. Once the department understands the system requirements there will be subsequent amendments to the regulations under the bill to formally mandate the collection of this data.


How is this of benefit to the RDCs? When we went through this inquiry it almost did my head in and bogged my brain to think that most RDCs did not have a list of their levy payers or any access at all to their contact details. Just think about that in any private company when you have shareholders or somebody who has invested their money and you do not even know who is paying the money, and you certainly have no accountability to get back to them to advise them how their money is being spent and to consult. The fact that most RDCs did not have a comprehensive list of their levy payers was a real surprise and not a very welcome one. 


Access to levy payer information will provide RDCs with the ability to identify and consult directly with levy payers. Again, when we are talking about levy payers, we are talking about farmers; we are talking about those primary producers around the country who are spending a lot of money—some of it is quite significant margins—on these levies and who really have never had a say in how that money gets spent. Through greater levy payer engagement, RDCs will be able to better align research investments to industry priorities. As I said, the bill allows levy payer information to be used by the ABS, which again is also a welcome change.


In relation to privacy considerations, obviously the logical question is: who will have access to this information and how will the information be used? I can assure the Senate that the government is committed to upholding the highest possible standards of security and privacy for individual and commercial confidentiality. The bill provides for levy payer information to be disclosed to and used by the RDC and by the ABS. The use of personal information is of course subject to the relevant privacy legislation, including the Australian Privacy Principles. 


The bill also limits the purpose to which levy payer information can be used: to maintain levy payer registrations, to maintain a register of eligible voters for polls that are conducted by the RDC, to publish statistical information, and to fulfil the RDC's functions under its funding agreement with the Commonwealth. Further protections include the fact that the bill does not allow for disclosure of levy payer information by an RDC or by the ABS to a third party, except where approved directly by the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources in writing. This is to protect the integrity and security of levy and charge payers for personal information. This measure will allow RDCs to employ the services of an information technology company for data management and allow an industry representative body to consult with industry on a levy proposal, as one example. 


Where an RDC is permitted to disclose levy payer information to a third party, that person or body may only use the information for activities relating to research and development, to marketing, to biosecurity and to the National Residue Survey or other activities of the RDC that directly benefit the producers, the farmers of this country. It will not be compulsory for the RDCs to set up these levy payer registers, although after going through the inquiry and hearing the overwhelming weight of evidence, it is my personal and very sincere hope that all the RDCs do set up these levy registers and do ensure they have contact with all growers who pay their levies—and not just have contact with those growers but also consult and engage and give them the voting rights in the organisation. 


Levy payer registers will only be established when an RDC, in consultation with industry, chooses to fund the development of the register and puts a request to the minister and the request is approved. As I said, I hope that all RDCs embrace this process, not only because it is the right thing to do by the growers who pay the levies but also because it is simply good governance. It is not just grower money; it is also funded by the Australian taxpayer. Where this money is spent should be clearly transparent and be able to be seen by those who pay it, including the Commonwealth.


There are, however, a number of steps in the process, and it is expected to take some time for each levy payer register to be established. Levy payer data is not currently collected by the department, except, as I said, in the wool and dairy industries.


So, while it is a good thing that some RDCs have expressed an interest in establishing this register, the department's advice is that it might take them some time to build this register and also do it in a staggered approach, industry by industry. Developing a fit-for-purpose, cost-effective system to deliver levy payer information is, unquestionably, a complex process, simply because it is such a mess. Every single one of these commodities has different processes; they have different procedures, different methods of payment, different rates of payment—I think the colloquial way to put it is that it is a complete shemozzle. So it is not surprising that it will take the department some time to work through, commodity by commodity, with each of the RDCs. But they have to start somewhere, and I think this is a great start—developing a new, fit-for-purpose system.


The bill has no financial implications, and the bill does allow the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to provide this payment information. The bill does not alter existing arrangements currently in place for the collection and distribution of levy payment information to Dairy Australia and to Australian Wool Innovation.


The bill will also allow the secretary of the department to approve the disclosure of levy payer information by an RDC to a third party, such as an industry representative body. But the department is also developing guidelines under which that will be able to occur.


Again, inquiry after inquiry has made similar recommendations—that these reforms need to occur. Extensive consultation on the agricultural levy system was undertaken by the Senate rural and regional affairs committee in, as I said, the inquiry that I cosponsored in 2014 that reported in 2015. The committee itself received 151 submissions, and we held seven public hearings across Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. As I said, the evidence to these inquiries was consistent, and overwhelmingly damning of the current system. Few, if any, of the people who made submissions were saying that levies should not be paid for marketing and for R&D, but it all boiled down to making the system transparent, to making it sensible, and to making sure that the money spent by Australian taxpayers and the money spent by growers was actually going to give some benefit and that they had a say in the process.


In conclusion, the bill will help allow levy payers to have more of a say in how their levies are spent. That is an overwhelmingly good thing, because it is not just growers, as I have said, but also Australian taxpayers who put hundreds of millions of dollars into these organisations every year. If the bill is not passed, an opportunity to improve consultation between RDCs, levy payers and the department will be lost.


I am also very happy to see that the bill is compatible with human rights. The measures proposed in the bill are consistent with the right to protection against arbitrary and unlawful interference with privacy, and I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (21:18):  I rise tonight to speak on the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 2016. Australia's rural industries are among the most innovative and productive in the world. Continued investment in rural research and development, or R&D, is vital to ensure the ongoing growth of and improvement in the profitability and competitiveness of Australia's agriculture, fisheries, forestry and food sectors. In recognition of this, the Australian government works with industry to coinvest in research through our world-leading rural R&D system. Much of this work is delivered through the 15 rural research and development corporations, the RDCs, of which we have heard much this evening. The RDCs provide a mechanism for industry to come together and invest collectively in research and development.


The government assists by establishing and collecting a levy on behalf of an industry, if an industry requests this. The government also matches an RDC's eligible R&D spending, up to a legislated cap. It is estimated that, for every dollar that the government invests in rural R&D, farmers generate a $12 return over 10 years. Feedback from primary producers is an integral part of how RDCs work. RDCs are required to consult with industry on their activities and to give those who fund the research via levies an opportunity to provide input into the strategic direction of the corporation. Agriculture levies and charges are imposed on primary producers by government, at the request of industry, to collectively fund R&D, marketing, biosecurity and residue testing programs. The levy system enables agricultural sectors to respond to industry needs and to help maintain and strengthen their position in highly competitive world markets through resource-sharing and cooperation.


This bill allows for the distribution of levy payer information to rural research and development corporations, or RDCs, for the development of levy payers' registers. As it stands, the legislation at the moment only permits the distribution of levy payer information to RDCs in the wool and dairy industries. This bill remedies this by allowing the government to provide levy payer information for the purpose of a levy payers register to the 13 other RDCs. Consistent with the application of the broader R&D levy system, the establishment of levy payer registers will occur, but only when an RDC requests it.


This bill also provides for levy payer information to be distributed to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the ABS, and to be used by it to perform any of its other functions, and this is consistent with the government's Public Data Policy Statement which commits to securely share data between Australian government entities, to improve efficiencies and inform policy development and decision making. Secondary disclosure of levy payer information by an RDC and the ABS will be limited. The secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources can approve its disclosure in some circumstances, including, for example, disclosure by an RDC to an industry representative or to an industry representative body for the purpose of consulting on R&D activities conducted by the RDC.


This bill makes it possible for the rural research and development corporations to identify with the primary producers who fund their work and connect directly to them. A number of reviews and inquiries have identified improved consultation with levy payers as vital to the ongoing strength of Australia's rural R&D system. Several of these inquiries have recommended the establishment of a levy payer register as a way for RDCs to consult more effectively with those primary producers that fund them.


The government agrees that the levy payers should have more of a say in how their levy funds are spent. RDCs should know exactly who their levy payers are. Levy payer registers will provide RDCs with the ability to identify and consult directly with those who pay those levies on research priorities and levy expenditure and, then, to accurately and efficiently allocate voting entitlements where useful. As it currently stands, the legislation does not allow for levy payer information to be distributed by the department to the RDCs where this information is collected, except in two industries: the wool and dairy industries. 


The bill addresses this by making it possible for this information to be provided to the other 13 RDCs. The bill amends the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to allow the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to distribute levy and charge payer information to all of the rural RDCs should they choose to fund the development of a levy payer register. This information includes the names, addresses and contact details as well as the ABN of levy and charge payers and the amount of levy or charge paid. The bill allows levy paid payer information to be used by the ABS in performing its functions. This is consistent, as I said, with the Australian government's public data policy statement, which commits to securely sharing data between Australian government entities to improve efficiencies and inform policy development and decision making. 


The bill also allows the secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to approve the disclosure of information by an RDC, under limited circumstances, to a third party. The bill in and of itself does not create levy payer registers. That is up to the RDC itself. The distribution of levy payer information to an RDC for a levy payer register will only occur when the RDC makes that decision, in consultation with industry, to fund the development of a register and requests the minister to improve its development.


The department has already started consulting with RDCs as well as industry representative bodies and levy collection agents on their requirements. These might include IT systems that would allow the data to be appropriately collected and distributed. Once these systems are known there will be subsequent amendments to the regulations under this bill that will formally mandate the collection of data.


Most RDCs do not currently have a database of their levy payers or access to their contact details. A comprehensive list of levy payers will provide RDCs with the ability to identify and consult directly with those levy payers on the strategic direction of research activities and other elements of the RDC's functions. Through greater levy payer engagement, those RDCs will be able to better align the research investments they make to industry priorities. This bill allows levy payer information to be used by the ABS in performing its functions and to inform policy development in decision making.


The government is committed to upholding the highest standards of security and privacy for individual and commercial confidentiality. This bill provides for levy payer information to be disclosed and used not just by the RDC or the ABS. The use of personal information, however, is subject to the relevant privacy information, including Australian privacy principles. The bill also limits the purposes for which the levy payer information can be used to maintain levy payer registers, to maintain a register of eligible voters for polls conducted by an RDC, to publish statistical and de-identified information, to fulfil an RDC's function under its funding agreement with the Commonwealth or to fulfil functions of the ABS. 


Further, the bill does not allow for disclosure of levy payer information by an RDC or the ABS to a third party, except where approved by the secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources in writing. This is to protect the integrity and security of levy and charge payers' personal information. Where an RDC is permitted to disclose levy payer information to a third party, that person or body may only use the information for activities relating to R&D, marketing, biosecurity, the National Residue Survey or other activities of the RDC that benefit producers.


Levy payer registers will only be established where an RDC, in consultation with industry, chooses to fund the development of a levy payer register and puts a request to the minister and that request is then approved. There are a number of steps in the process and it is expected to take some time for each levy payer register to be established. Levy payer data is not currently collected by the department, except in the wool and dairy industries. A number of RDCs have expressed an interest in establishing a levy payer register already. It will not be possible for the department to build them all at the same time and, therefore, we will need a staggered approach.


The department has been and continues to liaise with RDCs, industry representative bodies and levy collection agents on the design and implementation of levy payer registers and the collection of data. The department welcomes early engagement and participating in the design. Developing a fit-for-purpose, cost-effective system to deliver levy payer information to RDCs is a complex process and work has commenced to capture relevant stakeholder requirements. Once the system requirements are known there will be subsequent amendments to the regulations under this bill that will formally mandate the collection of that data. Importantly, this bill has no financial implications at all.


The bill allows the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to provide levy payer information to an RDC to establish a levy payer register. This will only go ahead, as I have said, where the RDC, in consultation with industry, chooses to fund the development and requests a levy payer register itself and that request is approved by the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. Therefore, it is a matter for each RDC, in consultation with industry, to decide to fund the development of a levy payer register itself. In line with the department's existing approach to the administration, collection and disbursement of levies, this would include cost-recovery arrangements.


The wool and dairy industries, as I have said, already have levy payer registers. This bill does not alter existing arrangements for the collection and distribution of levy payer information to those two industries. The bill amends the Dairy Produce Act 1986 to remove repetition between it and this bill, but it will have no practicable effect on the industries. The department will consult with RDCs and industry representative bodies on the administrative arrangements through which third parties can access levy payer information and assure that any administrative burden is therefore minimised.


This bill also allows for the secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to approve the disclosure of levy payer information by an RDC to a third party such as an industry representative body. The department is developing the appropriate guidance that will allow for levy payer information to be made available to third parties in some situations. The department will consult with industry on these arrangements to ensure that they are not overly burdensome but, at the same time, provide for appropriate security, privacy and use of the information.


The government is committed to upholding the highest standards of security and privacy for individual and commercial confidentiality reasons. In some cases, levy payer information will be personal information and it will be governed by the relevant privacy legislation. Levy payer information may also include commercial information which would be subject to common law obligations. The appropriate guidance being developed by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources will also set out the expectations for the appropriate use of this data. The department will consult with industry on these arrangements to ensure that they are not overly burdensome but provide for the appropriate security, privacy and use of the information.


Extensive consultation on the agricultural levy system was undertaken by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in its inquiry into these levies. In conducting its inquiry, the committee received 151 submissions and held seven public hearings across the country—in Canberra, in Sydney, in Melbourne and in Perth. In addition, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee received 35 public submissions on its inquiry into this bill when it was referred to the committee during the previous parliament. The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources has been liaising, and continues to liaise, with RDCs on the design and implementation of levy payer registers.


In conclusion, the passage of this bill is the first key step in allowing for the development of levy payer registers, making it possible for RDCs to identify and connect directly with those who fund their work. Through greater levy payer engagement with the R&D system, RDCs will be able to better align research investments to industry priorities, improving returns to primary producers and contributing to a more profitable, competitive and sustainable agricultural sector. We will now work with the RDCs and industry to make this happen. The government is committed to an Australian R&D system that remains transparent, consultative and delivers tangible benefits to Australia's agricultural industries in the future.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (21:34):  I too rise to speak on the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 2016 that makes legislative changes to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991, which will allow the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources to provide levy and charge payers, which are commonly known as levy payers, information to the rural research and development corporations for the purposes of developing levy payer registers.


As it currently stands, the act only permits the distribution of levy payer information to the wool and dairy RDCs. This bill remedies this by allowing the government to provide levy payer information to the 13 other RDCs. Levy payer registers allow RDCs to identify and consult directly with levy payers who fund the research and development system in Australia, and ensure accuracy in the allocation of voting entitlements. Through greater levy payer engagement in their work, RDCs will be able to better align their research investments to industry priorities, improve returns to farmers, fishers and foresters, and contribute to a more profitable, competitive and sustainable agricultural sector.


The bill removes the legislative impediment to the development of levy payer registers. However, recognising that a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate given the diversity of Australia's agricultural sectors, the bill allows for the distribution of levy payer information to an RDC to occur only when an RDC, in consultation with the industry, requests it and that request is approved by the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. The bill further allows an authorised person to provide levy payer contact information and details of the levy payer or the levy payable to an eligible recipient. The bill sets out the purposes for which the information provided to the eligible recipient can be used. The bill also allows the secretary of the department, via a legislative instrument, to provide further information relating to the production or processing of a commodity to be given to an eligible recipient, and this will allow additional industry-specific data which may be collected by the department to be distributed to the relevant RDCs or to the ABS—such information in relation to reduction, inputs or production or processing methods used in relation to a particular commodity.


The bill does not permit secondary disclosure of information included in levy payer registers by an eligible recipient to a third party, except where expressly permitted by the secretary in writing. The administrative arrangements will enable levy payers to opt out of receiving information from industry representative bodies, should they choose to do so. 


The bill maintains current practices for the distribution of the name and address of the persons or body that lodges levy returns with the department to the RDC's industry representative bodies and others. The bill also makes consequential changes to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 and the Dairy Produce Act 1986. These amendments repeal similar limitations on the use of levy payers information by the dairy and meat and livestock RDCs, as these are now captured in section 27B of the bill.


The Australian government believes that the value of research and development to this nation's profitability is unparalleled anywhere in the world. Australia's position as a world leader in agricultural production is based on our high quality and world-leading R&D sector. The purpose of this bill is to deliver better farm gate profitability to our farmers but also our R&D sector. Because of the position R&D holds within industry, it is also a greater attractor of co-investment from other sectors to ensure that Australia's R&D sector provides a great service to our agricultural sector more generally.


As you would be well aware, Acting Deputy President O'Neill, Australia has a very high standard of living and consequentially the cost of doing business in Australia is a lot higher than many of the countries for which we compete with our agricultural produce. The cost of compliance in Australia is very high, our environmental standards are very high and our occupational health and safety standards are very high. It is for these reasons that we will never, ever be the cheapest producer in the world. But we can be the best and we are the best because we have such a highly advanced research and development industry in Australia.


This government invests massively in research and development alongside our industry sectors with matching dollar for dollar funding. The Abbott Turnbull governments of the last three years also provided additional research and development funding through the Rural Research and Development for Profit initiative to ensure that our research and development is particularly targeted at making sure profitability at the farm gate is its primary purpose. 


It is also essential that we deliver what the industry wants. Therefore, the RDCs need to know what the levy payers want and the only way that they can do that is if they know who they are. This bill seeks to deliver the ability to directly connect the research and development corporations in Australia and the levy payers that pay those levies. In the process of doing this, we will ensure the privacy of that information so that it is only used for positive and beneficial outcomes. 


A further possible benefit of this type of legislation is for use in the event of a biosecurity incursion. By knowing where our growers are through this levy-payer collection method, we will be able to better target our responses should we be unlucky enough to have a biosecurity incursion. The other thing that we need to remember is the importance of our clean, green and safe image in maintaining our very important international markets. It is through the constant and diligent use of research, development and innovation that we are able to maintain that image and our competitive advantage in international markets.


The development of the levy-payer register has been identified by a number of reviews and inquiries as being important to strengthening Australia's agricultural sector. The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into industry structures and systems governing the imposition of and disbursement of marketing and R&D levies in the agricultural sector recommended legislative amendments to allow for the development of levy-payer registers to improve consultation with levy payers and ensure accurate allocation of voting entitlements. 


It was quite clear that submitters to the inquiry on this bill welcomed the bill and supported its key elements. A large number of submitters outlined to the committee the many benefits that they believed would arise from the creation of a levy-payer register. Support came from both research and development corporations and peak industry groups. For example, the Council for Rural Research and Development Corporations offered up that the council:


… fully supports the principles of open, transparent and accountable processes for informing and engaging with levy payers. This Bill enables the establishment and use of levy-payer registers which in turn will mean the RDCs can have accurate, up-to-date information about levy payers. The Council supports the Bill being passed.


New South Wales Canegrowers Council and Sunshine Sugar explained how the changes proposed in the bill would benefit the sugar industry. They said:


… the amendments as proposed would allow SRA to better achieve its overall objectives resulting in improved returns to our growers and contribute to a more profitable, competitive and sustainable sugar cane industry in NSW.


Grain Producers Australia described the proposed reforms as a 'key to providing grain producers with a strong link' with research and development. The Grains Research and Development Corporation also indicated its support for the bill.


The Cotton Research and Development Corporation explained that a levy-payer register would:


Strengthen CRDC's capacity to consult with cotton farmers on their R&D priorities, improve the distribution and extension of research results as well as receiving feedback on CRDC's performance.


The Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association welcomed the bill, submitting that giving 'RDCs access to producer information will increase the ability of these bodies to distribute information in a more efficient and timely manner'. 


The ABS welcomed the bill, observing that it 'has the potential to open up new opportunities for improving the quality and availability of agricultural statistical information for the benefit of both government and industry' and would support the government's public sector data agenda.


The Council for Rural Research and Development Corporations supported the proposal to share information with the ABS, observing that:


High quality statistical information about agricultural production in Australia and the number of active enterprises has also been an issue of concern for some time. Making information available as appropriate to support the functions of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, consistent with the government’s Public Data Policy Statement, is also expected to help improve this situation.


The committee's view was that the changes proposed in the bill would enable research and development corporations to better communicate with all levy payers in a particular industry not just those growers who are members of the RDC. The ABS would also have access to de-identified data. The bill is the first step towards improving the systems governing levies in the agricultural sector. 


The committee went on to recommend that the Senate pass the bill and further made the recommendation that the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources continue to consult with research and development corporations and representatives of the agricultural industry as it implements the regulatory and administrative framework associated with measures contained in the bill. 


So we stand here today with the unanimous support of the committee that undertook the inquiry into the bill. But this bill is but the first step. The RDCs will now need to talk with their respective industries and we also will be seeking for the RDCs, if they choose to go forward with development of these levy payer registers, to fund the development of those registers. Obviously, once they have made a decision that they see the benefit of being involved with the establishment of a register, they will need to seek the approval of the minister to establish that register. Then, obviously, the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources stands ready to assist the RDCs in the design of a system so that it meets their particular individual requirements as well as achieving the broader agenda of transparency, efficiency and farm gate returns to our primary producers. The department is already out talking with the RDCs and industry about what they need to collect the data efficiently, and once all those details are settled we will amend the regulation to formally mandate the collection of data. The bill also enables the department secretary to agree to provide levy payer register information to industry representative bodies—for example, for the purposes of consulting with levy payers on R&D priorities and the levies themselves. 


In addition to the wool and dairy RDCs, this bill will incorporate the following RDCs under the new legislation: the Australian Egg Corporation Limited, the Australian Grape and Wine Authority, the Australian Meat Processor Corporation, Australian Pork Limited, Australian Wool Innovation, the Cotton Research and Development Corporation, Dairy Australia—which currently is already under this particular legislation—Forest and Wood Products Australia, the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, the Grains Research and Development Corporation, Horticulture Innovation Australia Limited, LiveCorp, Meat & Livestock Australia—which is already under this particular legislation—the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and Sugar Research Australia. 


Before I close, I acknowledge the support that Senator Leyonhjelm has pledged for this bill. Senator Leyonhjelm has made his views very clear about his lack of support for compulsory levies, but his acknowledgement that if we have these levies in place it is absolutely essential that we are able to communicate with everybody who is paying the levy is noted and greatly appreciated. I also acknowledge the support of the Labor Party for this amendment bill, because they too see the importance of making sure that we ensure the greatest level of transparency that we can with the view that we achieve the greatest level of efficiency in our agricultural sector and the best possible returns for our R&D dollar. 


The government is committed to an Australian R&D system that is transparent, consultative and delivers tangible benefits to Australian agriculture industries into the future. I commend the bill to the Senate.

The statement read as follows—





STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2016 SPRING SITTINGS





PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEVIES AND CHARGES COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL





Purpose of the Bill



The bill amends the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to make minor changes to the ability to distribute levy payer information for the purpose of developing levy payer registers.


The amendments will allow distribution of levy payer information from agricultural industries that pay statutory agricultural levies, if a research and development corporation (RDC), in consultation with industry, requests that government collect this information.




Reasons for Urgency



Introduction and passage in the 2016 Spring sittings will ensure agricultural industries are able to benefit from these straightforward legislative amendments in a timely manner. The bill was first introduced to the Parliament in Autumn 2016. It was considered by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs Transport and Legislation Committee, which recommended that the Senate pass the bill. The Committee received and considered 35 submissions from stakeholders in developing its recommendations. These stakeholders are likely to expect the bill's introduction and passage through the Parliament at an early stage.


The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee's report into its inquiry into Industry structures and systems governing the imposition of and disbursement of marketing and research and development (R&D) levies in the agricultural sector identified improved consultation and allocation of voting entitlements as critical for the ongoing health of Australia's R&D system. The report's first two recommendations identified legislative amendments to allow for the development of levy payer registers as key to achieving this aim.


The legislation currently prohibits information collected by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources being distributed to RDCs for the purpose of developing levy payer registers. This bill will make amendments to allow this to occur, at the request of the relevant RDC and industry.


A number of RDCs are actively investigating options for levy payer registers and are proceeding with investments in the development of interim registers.


In addition, the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper identifies a number of measures aimed at improving Australia's world-leading rural R&D system. These measures and the outcomes they seek to deliver, including new research and development priorities, improved


governance of RDCs and increased funding for the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, would benefit from timely improvements to consultation between RDCs and the levy payers that fund the R&D system.


Levy payer information will also be available to the Australian Bureau of Statistics to support its functions.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2016-09-12,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (21:49):  I rise tonight to speak of one of the more shameful red herrings deployed recently by the ALP. This is Labor's referral to the Auditor-General of supposed donations by Parakeelia to the Liberal Party. It should have been obvious to everybody, particularly to some of the breathlessly credulous commentators on this issue at the time, that the amounts in question were in fact not donations but other receipts—a fundamentally important distinction. So surprise, surprise: today the Audit Office said a preliminary investigation has confirmed that the referred arrangements are completely above board—hardly a surprise. The Audit Office found absolutely no evidence that Parakeelia donated any profits from the sale of Feedback software to the Liberal Party. In fact, the Audit Office found absolutely the opposite. The Audit Office found that the financial transactions reported to the AEC between Parakeelia and the Liberal Party indicated a net cost to the Liberal Party from the years 2000 to 2015. So not only was no money directly going from Parakeelia to the Liberal Party in net terms; the Liberal Party was actually subsidising the cost of it to Liberal Party members. 


So, rather than profiting from Feedback, the Liberal Party has been subsidising it. This very arrangement that Mr Shorten called a scam was actually no scam at all, and in fact it is so typical of the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. The same charge—equally, I must note, without foundation—could have been made about Labor's arrangement whereby money has gone directly from the taxpayer to the Labor Party and, before then, going to Labor's software provider, Magenta Linas. Mr Shorten talked of a scam that the Audit Office has dismissed. 


But I now turn to something for which there is evidence in my home state of Western Australia, namely an apparent so called round-robin scam which appear to channel money from Perth Trades Hall to the Labor Party and then from the Western Australian taxpayer to Magenta Linas and then back to Trades Hall. As I said, an apparent round-robin, using Mr Shorten's words, looks like a scam to me. After his comments on Parakeelia, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, not unreasonably was asked if he could rule out Magenta Linas ever having donated to the Labor Party or any of its subsidiaries.


In answer to this question, Mr Shorten said in part:


The Labor party has no ownership structures at all of Magenta Linas. I don't know every transaction they've had at the state level but what I do know is that the clear difference here is that the Liberal Party—they love a dollar these Liberals.


Let us look at just who really loves the dollars. It is very interesting that Mr Shorten professed ignorance of transactions at a state level, because an examination of electoral returns showed that in 2000-01 Perth Trades Hall made a donation of $431,089 to Labor, and that over five years until 2004-05 Magenta Linas returned a total of $284,978 to Trades Hall. This $284,978 was paid by Magenta Linas to Perth Trades Hall in the form of two unspecified prima facie 'donations', two 'payments' and one 'other receipt'.


The interesting thing is that in October 2000 Magenta Linas, following a tender process, was conditionally accepted to supply, install and support the Electrac electorate information management system for WA ALP members. In 2006, then WA opposition leader in the Legislative Council complained in parliament that the cost to the WA state government of supplying Electrac to Labor members using Magenta Linas was double that of supplying opposition members with an electorate information management system called EMS, after the state Labor government had excluded Parakeelia from the initial tender process.


The WA government awarded and paid Magenta Linas $157,000 per annum for Electrac, which was for the exclusive use of ALP members, but only $80,000 for non-government members to use Consultech's EMS software. I can assure members of the Senate that there were not twice as many ALP members. Were ALP members getting twice the value for their electoral database system? I suspect they were not. In a motion on this matter, the then opposition leader in the Legislative Council, the Hon. Norman Moore, moved on 2 November 2006 the following motion on electoral database systems:


That this house expresses its serious concern at the government’s decision to provide a different and more expensive electorate information management system to each Australian Labor Party state member of Parliament than that provided to all non-ALP members.


He also noted:


In Western Australia, the government provides more money to Labor members of Parliament for their electorate information management system than it provides to non-Labor members. That, to me, is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, in the absence of any explanation to the contrary.


Guess what? He never got an answer to that contradiction of why the Labor system was so much more expensive than that provided to non-Labor members.


What makes these particular transactions between Trades Hall, the ALP and Magenta Linas even more concerning is the very close links between WA Labor and the Perth Trades Hall at the time. Bill Johnston was the State Secretary of the ALP in WA from April 2001 until his election to state parliament in September 2008. He was also State Secretary of Perth Trades Hall. As such, he is the person who submitted the return detailing the Perth Trades Hall's donation of $431,089 made on the 17 October 2000, as well as the person who disclosed the same amount as having been received by the ALP in its 2000-01 return to the AEC. He was also the person who on five separate occasions disclosed the receipt by Perth Trades Hall of a total of $284,978 from Magenta Linas, the provider of the ALP's electoral management system.


In light of the above and Mr Shorten's statement that he knew nothing about any state payments, I now call on Mr Shorten to detail all he knows about these transactions at a WA state level. He and the WA Leader of the Opposition, Mark McGowan, must advise the Western Australian taxpayers what the federal and state Labor leaders knew about the transactions between Magenta Linas, Perth Trades Hall and the WA Labor Party. The $431,089 donation from Perth Trades Hall was made about four months before the 2001 state election and would have been of obvious benefit to the state ALP. As we again approach a state election in Western Australia in little over six months, I would hope commentators treat Mr Shorten's statements, such as those he made about Parakeelia, with the scepticism they deserve. Next time he deploys similar red herrings, his claims will be more closely scrutinised. 


In conclusion, the Audit Office did not find a shred of evidence that Parakeelia donated any profits from the sale of Feedback software to the Liberal Party. In fact, it was quite the opposite. The Audit Office actually found that the Liberal Party subsidised the provision of this database. The Labor Party in Western Australia now clearly have questions to answer on these matters.
