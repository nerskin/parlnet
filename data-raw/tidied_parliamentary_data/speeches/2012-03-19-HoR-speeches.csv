Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (10:10):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, I present the committee's report entitled Advisory report on the Constitutional Corporations (Farm Gate to Plate) Bill 2011 and the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Horticultural Code of Conduct) Bill 2011, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.


Although the bills have some merit in looking to improve the ways that we market horticulture in Australia, they face some difficulties with regard to the cost of implementing them and also for the people involved in the industry from the producers and growers through to the people who market the horticulture of Australia. Some of the submissions that we received pointed these things out, like identifying a farm gate price. It can be very difficult to do that. How do you do that when it has passed through two or three different hands? Displaying a farm gate price in supermarkets could also be rather difficult for that reason and there were many issues from the submissions that indicated there were impracticalities in implementing some of the clauses of the bills presented to us.


The transparency and accountability asked for in some of the bills were quite good and they are always good to have in these areas of marketing. The more people can see how things are done, the better, in my opinion and that is also what the committee thought. There are complexities in the way costs come together in these areas. The status of existing agreements and contracts, which came about from the code, I think in 2006, are still in place. People using those, from producers to the marketers, are quite happy with them, so it is difficult to find ways through that. With regard to administration and oversight, some of the bills talked about setting up whole new sets of bureaucracies to administer processes and there is always a cost to that. In today's world, where government seeks to have those costs always met with by industry itself, that would not be an easy process.


The committee's conclusion about these concerns are all detailed in the report and the committee's recommendations to the House of Representatives are that the House should not pass these bills. I would like to thank the members of the committee for their work in relation to the inquiry, including the four supplementary members who joined the committee for the purpose of this inquiry. I would also like to thank the individuals and organisations for making submissions to our inquiry. We do appreciate the work done by those groups. Of course, I also thank my secretariat for the work they did. I commend the report to the House.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (10:38):  I introduce this bill, the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Bill 2012, today to redress an injustice that the government appears determined to inflict upon the nation's dental health professionals. My intention is that, once enacted, this bill will require the government to redress past and future inequities that have arisen from the operation of subsection 10(2) of the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Determination 2007. The bill describes the inequities imposed on dental practitioners by the operation of the subsection of the determination and specifies five courses of action which the minister can take to redress these inequities. It establishes a time frame in which action is to be taken and requires a report to be tabled in both houses of parliament, detailing the actions taken.


It is unfortunate that it has come to this, and it would not have done so if the ministers of this government had an ounce of common sense and a skerrick of decency and compassion. Members of this government, both in government and previously when in opposition, have stubbornly opposed Tony Abbott's chronic disease dental scheme, a billion dollar investment into dental services introduced by the former health minister, Tony Abbott. It provides for general practitioners to refer patients with a chronic disease or complex health problems to dental professionals for treatment up to the value of $4,250 over any two years.


The Rudd and Gillard governments have tried twice to close Tony Abbott's chronic disease dental scheme, but these attempts have been rejected by this parliament. They seek to discredit the scheme simply because Tony Abbott was its architect. Unable to close the scheme, the government changed tack, deciding to denigrate it, perhaps in the hope that this would garner enough public support to force closure. And so we have ministers describing the scheme as full of rorts and being constantly rorted. To date they have produced not one iota of proof to back these claims, yet they continue to make these false allegations. In making the allegations they are slandering the entire dental profession.


Let me make it clear: the coalition does not defend anyone who has done the wrong thing. If there are dentists who have indeed rorted this Commonwealth health program then they should be held accountable, weeded out and punished to the full extent of the law. But that is not what we are talking about here. We are talking about the good, honest, community-minded dental health practitioners who have provided dental services under the chronic disease dental scheme. They have done the right thing by their patients; patients are satisfied with the treatment they have received. These dentists have expended money to provide these treatments; they have bulk-billed, ensuring there were no out-of-pocket costs for the patient in many cases. They have claimed the appropriate Medicare benefits to which they are entitled, benefits that do not always cover the cost of the treatment, only to now find themselves being pursued with demands for repayment from Medicare. Their sin was either a technical failure to provide their patients with written treatment plans and quotations for the services to be provided or failing to forward details of the treatment plan to the general practitioner who had referred the patient for dental treatment. Essentially, they have provided treatments but failed to provide the paperwork as required by subsection 10(2) of the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Determination 2007.


Yes, they have technically breached the law. That is true. But in the eyes of any sensible person clearly they are guilty of a technical breach of the law only. Any sensible or fair-minded person would exercise discretion in their dealings in such circumstances, but that is not what this government or Medicare, under the government's direction, are doing with members of the dental profession. They say they are, but the facts prove otherwise.


In mid-2010 the then Minister for Human Services, Mr Bowen, established an audit task force to investigate the compliance of dentists with the scheme. In a media release at the time he stated:


Medicare Australia has had ongoing concerns about compliance with the scheme, as it has identified dentists claiming for work they have not provided and claiming when they did not meet the legal requirements of the scheme.


He went on to say:


I understand that most dentists try to do the right thing and that the majority of incorrect claiming is accidental.


That is what this government says, but what it does is very different.


11,713 dentists have provided treatment under the chronic disease scheme. They have provided more than 11 million treatments to around one million Australians, the vast majority of whom are the most needy and who have not had access to dental services for years. That is the scheme that Tony Abbott set up, investing $1 billion into helping those people most in need of dental care. On the latest figures available, Medicare has 933 audits of those dentists either active or under consideration—629 are underway or completed and 89 cases have been closed. Here is the important statistic. Of those 89 dentists, 26 were found to be compliant with the scheme, while 63—basically two-thirds of the dentists—were noncompliant. Ask yourself: in a scheme where two-thirds are noncompliant, is the problem with the dentists or with the government's failure to explain the requirements of those dentists under that scheme? Only 12 of those 63 were found to have not provided the services for which they had claimed benefits and, in some of those cases, it may be that the services were to be provided in the future. So there are some question marks over those 12. It may not be the case that all of them were acting wrongly.


But the important point here is this: the bulk of dental professionals falling foul of the requirements of the chronic disease dental scheme were actually doing so because they were failing to fill in required paperwork. They were not rorting anything. I would have thought that common sense would tell any person or organisation that, when it is finding that two-thirds of a particular group of people are noncompliant with the requirements imposed upon them, something must be wrong in the totality of the situation. There is, and I will come to that later. I do not think anyone would argue that two-thirds of one group of people, in this case dental professionals, are out there deliberately doing the wrong thing or, as the government would have it, rorting this scheme, but dental professionals are being pursued as if that is exactly what is happening and as if they are rorters.


Medicare knows that they are not. Appearing before a Senate estimates hearing in October last year Medicare officials said:


In terms of the claiming behaviour, it is essentially around not providing the treatment plan to the patient, not providing an itemised quote to the patient and not providing a summary or copy of the treatment plan back to the GP. They are essentially the non-compliant activities that have been occurring.


At this point there are hundreds of dentists, dental specialists and dental prosthetists who have been audited and are awaiting a demand from Medicare for repayment of all the benefits they have claimed and been paid. Scores are already dealing with this reality. These actions are having financial, emotional and psychological impacts on people who are respected professionals and community members who saw treating people under the chronic disease scheme as a civic duty. There have been many letters and emails sent to my office. Let me quote from just a few. The first one says:


I and the bulk of my colleagues have helped a large number of sick and disadvantaged people improve their oral health and then (we) are going to be seriously punished for not complying with certain paperwork requirements which were not properly explained to us. Since I have treated a large number of these people this could send me into bankruptcy. 


Another said:


I feel very helpless as the way I see it, my and my wife's and kids' future lies in the hands of a questionnaire that has been sent to patients some three years after the completion of their treatment. How are they meant to remember which date they received a treatment plan from my office. If they get it wrong I would be up for a full refund. I have 11 staff and 4 dentists working in my practices. If I am asked for a hefty refund, I will have no choice but to go bankrupt and let all these employees go.


Another said:


I looked upon it—


the scheme, that is—


as an opportunity to help the underprivileged and ill people in my suburb … often there were not enough funds available from Medicare yet these patients were treated at no extra expense to themselves …


… the extent of the witch-hunt over alleged rorting … has become unreasonable …


I have become anxious, do not sleep at night and have become extremely stressed since this audit has started.


For most in the dental fraternity, the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was the first time they had interacted with Medicare. They were not familiar with the paperwork requirements that go with obtaining benefits from Medicare for the provision of health services. In fact, the common practice in dental practice is to deal with matters verbally—to discuss problems and possible courses of treatment with patients. The profession as a whole argues that since the scheme was established in 2007 up until at least mid-2010 most dentists were not properly informed of the requirements placed upon them under the chronic disease scheme. Indeed, some dentists argue that they were still receiving conflicting information from Medicare as late as late last year.


If there is wrong here it is on both sides. Medicare should not be demanding repayment from dentists who have acted in good faith and provided treatment but failed to comply with the paperwork they were expected to file—paperwork requirements they say they were not informed about. The work has been carried out. I commend this bill to the House because it is incumbent upon the government to get this problem right. It is a problem of their own making and they should sort it out. This bill enables the government to do just that.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (11:00):  I move:


That this House acknowledges the importance of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax for the funding of important physical infrastructure in capacity constrained mining regions.


The minerals resource rent tax is a government initiative to ensure that the great wealth which flows from this country's mineral resources is equally and evenly shared across the entire Australian community. We will take the superprofits flowing from the mining sector and redistribute them to all Australians—to the people who actually own those resources. We will do so through both the tax and the superannuation systems.


We will also be redirecting billions of dollars of that revenue back into the mining regions from which the wealth comes. I of course represent one of those regions and I am determined that many of the issues which arise out of mining are addressed in the communities of my electorate. Mining has brought great wealth to the region I represent and to regions, such as the Illawarra, represented by some of my colleagues. But it has also brought great pressures. The most obvious are the environmental effects—the impact on air and water quality. But they also include higher housing prices, higher rental prices and even higher grocery prices in areas of my electorate. The growth in mining has also brought about enormous capacity constraints—difficulty in securing child care, for example. Employers in my electorate, particularly those in the non-mining sector, are having an extraordinarily difficult time securing employees. I very much welcome the Prime Minister's announcement today and, if I get a chance, I will have something to say about that issue a bit later on.


The capacity constraints arising out of growth in the mining sector are highlighted by transport issues in my electorate. At peak hour these days, the main road through Singleton is like a car park. That is also true of Maitland and Muswellbrook and many other towns in between. And these car parks are pretty heavily potholed—roads in my region are nothing short of a disgrace. The vineyards of Hunter wine country—the jewel in the Hunter region's tourism crown—have the worst roads in the region, not because of tourism traffic but because those roads are also used by thousands of mineworkers travelling from their homes to the mining sites on a daily basis. In Scone, people travelling on the New England Highway, an extension of Scone's main street, now wait up to eight minutes at the level railway crossing while the coal trains go by. This congestion, these problems in wine country and this difficulty we are having in Scone are all directly related to the growth of the mining sector.


This is what the MRRT is all about. It is about taking money from the superprofits earned by the coalmining companies and addressing the capacity constraints directly caused by the mining sector. This will enable us to deal with issues like the Scone level railway crossing, which requires an overpass; bypasses for Muswellbrook and Singleton; traffic congestion in Maitland and elsewhere; and, very importantly for me, the really serious road quality issues we have in the Hunter wine country.


There is a threat—because this money, this new tax, will effectively offset royalties raised by the New South Wales government and other state governments. For too long, the New South Wales state government has been taking money out of the Hunter region and spending it on roads, tunnels and bridges in Sydney. That is no longer acceptable to us. Barry O'Farrell has decided that he will continue to increase the rate of royalties he is collecting at the state level. This is a great disappointment because it breaches faith with the negotiations the Commonwealth had with the state on the introduction of this tax. I remind the people of my electorate and anyone watching this issue very closely that they can have it one of two ways—they can allow us to raise taxes through the MRRT and return that money to mining regions such as my own or they can sit back and allow Barry O'Farrell to continue to increase royalties so he can spend that money on infrastructure in Sydney.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (11:05):  For the very first time in this place, I actually rise to agree with the words of the federal Treasurer. He is 100 per cent right when he says:


… ultimately when it comes to our mining tax reforms, history will judge our actions.


It certainly will. But history can be a very harsh critic.


History will judge the mining tax, the carbon tax and the 20 new or increased taxes which have been brought about by this government. History will also judge the pink batts debacle, the waste and mismanagement of the school halls program, the green loans, cash for clunkers, the complete debacle with the live cattle trade, the set-top boxes, computers in schools, the dismantling of border protection—and the list goes on. History will in fact judge not only this Treasurer but this government. I do not have the same optimism as the Treasurer that the judgment will be in the government's favour, because the MRRT is yet another example of the shambolic way this government governs.


We should not forget that this is not the government's first version of the mining tax. Who could forget the RSPT? Depending on whose version of events you believe, the Treasurer or the former Prime Minister's, the resource super profits tax was introduced without proper consultation—a very common theme with this government—and with no chance for the industry to look at the impact it would have on industry and on investment, particularly infrastructure. It led of course to the deposing of Kevin Rudd as a one-term Prime Minister—something that is quite unheard of.


Let us make no bones about it: this legislation has been cooked up to try to quieten all the voices of discontent and all the alarm that was raised when the government said it was going to introduce this tax. In doing so, it is an admission that the original tax was inherently flawed and that the Treasurer was the architect of this flawed tax. This tax is no better. 


The incompetence of this government knows no bounds. Let us understand the circumstances in which this government brought together this tax: the three biggest miners in a closed room, with no public servants, determined this new mining tax. In fact, there were reports that the mining tax was actually written on one of the miner's computers. It is no accident that there is going to be a market valuation method to determine how the tax should come about. This means that smaller miners are going to be disproportionately disadvantaged. They are going to bear the impact of this tax and it means that the investment and risk that they take, and the jobs investment as well, will be under significant threat.


The incompetence of this government knows no bounds. Only last week Bob Carr said, 'Look into our eyes, look into our eyes, there will be significant tax cuts' as a result of this great big new tax. They say, 'Look into our eyes, look into our eyes, there will be an increase in superannuation.' But at the same time that we are looking into their eyes, the Treasurer is reaching around into the back pocket of every Australian citizen and pinching their wallet. This government call this a tax reform, but it is like everything else: a great big new tax hike. Of course, this will be compounded by the carbon tax and the other 20 new or increased taxes that this government have brought about. 


The government can only introduce supposed tax cuts by imposing great big new taxes first. We all know that the government are simply talk on this. The government have not delivered tax cuts. The only tax cut they have been able to deliver was the one introduced by the former government when Peter Costello was Treasurer. Since then, all they have been able to do is increase taxes. That is why we oppose this mining tax. (Time expired)

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (11:10):  It is my great pleasure to be seconding the motion by my colleague the member for Hunter on this important issue. Today we are engaged in two important arguments. The first is an argument with those opposite about the concept of the minerals resource rent tax. What motivates us is to ensure that we spread the benefit of the mining boom, that we spread the benefit of the resources boom beyond those mining regions and right throughout the country, that we spread it to every person in Australia who has a superannuation account, that we spread it to every small business and every large business around the country in the form of a tax cut, and that we spread it to those mining areas and elsewhere in the form of additional infrastructure—much-needed economic infrastructure—to ensure that we are able to get these commodities out of the mine heads and to the ports of our nation.


It is not surprising that those opposite oppose it, because every day they stand up with a shovel in their hands and the purpose of the shovel is to dig another few feet in their $70 billion budget black hole. Their intention is to fool the Australian people that they can fill that black hole through a commission of audit. But we know that their intention is to fill it with the jobs of public servants, manufacturing workers, auto industry workers and the like. They will simply not be able to make ends meet without drastically slashing the services and programs of this country.


By 2036, Australia's population is going to exceed around 30 million people. By then, Sydney will have a population of around six million, an increase of 1.7 million on today's figures. That takes me to the second argument and that is an argument by members such as the member for Hunter and myself to ensure that we get a fair share of the fair share—that is, that we get a fair share of that additional pool of money that will be available to fund infrastructure in this country. The growth in population in Sydney and the ensuing economic activity will bring challenges for our infrastructure. It will mean that regional Australia, in particular large regional cities like the Illawarra, Wollongong, Newcastle and the Hunter, will be taking up the slack. We need to ensure that those cities have the infrastructure that is necessary—that is, the rail capacity, the road capacity and the port capacity—to meet those increased needs and to ensure that, as Sydney and Melbourne are bursting at the seams, those regional cities are able to take up the growth capacity.


In my region we know that coalmining is undergoing a resurgence and that is because we have some of the best metallurgical coal found anywhere in the world. Despite the attempts by the Leader of the Opposition to talk down the prospects of the coal industry in my electorate and in the member for Cunningham's electorate, it is literally booming. New longwalls are going in as we speak to increase the mining capacity because if you want steel then you need the high-quality metallurgical coal that comes from the Illawarra. 


We have plans to expand the ports. Some of the plans look at doubling, even tripling, the size of the ports. All this puts stress and pressure on our road network and our rail network. We already have an overly congested rail network between Wollongong and Sydney. Over 20,000 people use that road network each and every week to commute to Sydney for work. If we are to have expanding economic activity and expanding freight moving north and south along that route, we need to provide alternate freight passage. That is where the Maldon to Dombarton rail link comes in. It was cancelled by the former Greiner government because the Liberals have never supported infrastructure projects in the Illawarra. They cancelled it with only 35 kilometres left to be built. Thirty-five kilometres of standard rail gauge needs to be put in to ensure that we can link our port to the inland coalfields, wheatfields, and alternative internodal hubs of Western Sydney. I was very pleased that, when she visited the Illawarra, the Prime Minister pledged another $25 million to review planning and design work to ensure that it is up to speed. But the reality is that without the money—the revenue from the minerals resource rent tax—that rail link will not be completed. We cannot leave it to the Liberals, who have never spent a cent, not a brass razoo, on infrastructure in the Illawarra. We need this tax to pass through the House and we need our fair share in the Illawarra. (Time expired)

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (11:15):  I rise to speak against this motion of the importance of the minerals resource rent tax. It disappoints me that the Chief Government Whip continues down the negative path that the Labor Party takes in this place, using all his time to talk about negative things—to talk down certain sectors of the Australian economy, rather than being positive about what is a truly magnificent performance by the Australian minerals industry at the moment with such wonderful opportunities for them due to growth in Asia. We talk much about it and we hear the Labor Party occasionally refer to it. The Labor Party's approach to that growth is to knock down the minerals industry, to go after the resources sector, to complain about entrepreneurs who do well, to complain that this industry is doing so well that 'we need to find a new way to tax it'. They are pretending that the industry is not taxed already.


The mining industry already pays a 41 per cent tax rate, which is a combination of company tax and royalties paid at the state level. Under the Australian Constitution, mining companies and resources have always been a matter which state governments have taxed outside of the company tax regime, through the royalties regime. The Labor Party feigns concern about the operation of the royalties system, but what this is really all about is another tax grab to cover over their massive budget blow-outs and expenditures, which have seen Australia with a record debt. It is a record deficit which our future generations will be trying to pay back at a time when we will be challenged by an ageing population and all the challenges that were outlined so well by the best treasurer this country has ever had, Peter Costello, in the Intergenerational reports during the 2000s.


This process has highlighted the inability of the Labor Party to govern at the federal level. Thankfully, this Saturday we will get rid of one of this nation's Labor Party governments when Queenslanders toss out a terrible 20-year government, a government that has caused so much pain in Queensland—a state that should be performing better than it is in the current environment, with such opportunities in the resource sector and Queensland such a resource-rich state. What it needs is a can-do person as the Premier of Queensland to ensure that the opportunities of the resource sector are not talked down, as the member for Hunter did for so long in his speech on this motion, and as so many people in the Australian Labor Party tend to do. What we need in Queensland is to take advantage of historic opportunities, not tax them into submission.


This government would have you believe that to make industry more successful you need to tax it more; you need to apply higher taxes to it and the industry will just adapt to that! It believes more taxes will not impact on investment decisions at all, that it will not increase the sovereign risk of investing in mining and resources exploration, which is already a risky proposition. My colleague at the table, the member for Canning, knows better than most that the great state of Western Australia—where the resources sector has gone through ups and downs throughout its history—is now taking advantage, with a very good Liberal government, of the opportunities which present in our region.


I would say to the member for Hunter: start talking positively about the resources sector. Start talking positively about the opportunities it creates for our country. Stop being so negative. Stop the campaign of personal denigration that we see day in, day out in the Queensland campaign and which we see the member for Hunter engaging in. It is really disappointing from that member in particular. I thought he was better than that.


We know the resources sector has a trickle-down effect through the economy that the Labor Party refuses to recognise. There is no better example than the one which was outlined by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Philip Lowe, who is an outstanding thinker in this area. He said in a recent speech:


The indirect effects come through a variety of channels. Day to day, they can be hard to see but they percolate through the economy. In effect, there is a chain that links the investment boom in the Pilbara and in Queensland to the increase in spending at cafes and restaurants in Melbourne and Sydney.


The member for Moreton and the member for Hunter would have us believe otherwise. They would pretend that there is no benefit from this mining boom which is having such great consequences for other industries. They would have you forget that the mining industry pays more tax. The industry already pays $23.8 billion in taxes and royalties, and it is going to be paying an extra tax with the introduction of the carbon tax this year. This government is 'tax and spend Labor'. It is taxing more to cover its massive record deficits, as it tries to engage in social engineering in the tradition of the Labor Party. This motion is a further negative complaint about a great performing sector—a sector we should encourage and not talk down as Labor Party is intent on doing. (Time expired)

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:21):  It is with great pleasure and passion that I rise to speak on the motion that we have before the House this morning on the importance of the minerals resource rent tax. I congratulate the member for Hunter for bringing this very important motion to the House.


This is a motion that has an enormous importance for electorates like the one that I represent in this parliament. It is addressing the capacity constraints that exist in our area and making sure that the minerals resource rent tax is spent in areas such as the one I represent. Those on the other side of the House may not be as aware, as we on this side of the House are, of the important roles the Hunter, Central Coast, and Lake Macquarie have played in mining throughout the ages. They may not be aware of the enormous implications and capacity constraints that have arisen due to the impact of mining. For once, this is about putting some money back into areas that have given so much to Australia and have been responsible for the strength of our economy. At one stage the Shortland electorate in New South Wales had the most coalmines in the country. I ask myself and the parliament what the mining companies have put back into the electorate as a result of its enormous contribution to Australia and the contribution of its men in those mines. The answer is: not much. We still have problems with traffic in the electorate, with coal trucks travelling from the mines to the port. There are enormous capacity constraints and problems with dust and other health issues. We have given a lot more than we have received. The minerals resource rent tax is an opportunity for the companies to put something back into areas such as the Hunter and the Central Coast.


The Belmont Wetlands in my electorate have been denuded by mining, and the community has been fighting to ensure the land is rehabilitated and the area becomes available for the people of Shortland. BHP gave the wetlands back to the community, but they gave back a very denuded piece of land. It needs some major infrastructure investment so that we can allow commercial development and community access. For a long time all residents of Lake Macquarie have been arguing for the Glendale interchange. 


As I have already indicated to the House, Lake Macquarie has a rich history in coalmining and it has given a lot more than it has received. The minerals resource rent tax is an opportunity to put something back into electorates such as mine and the other electorates in the Hunter. There are 50 coalmines in the Hunter and a port that is responsible for shipping coal out of Newcastle. We have constraints on coal loaders, causing delays for ships waiting to dock and load. I would argue strongly that areas such as the area I represent in this parliament need to have these infrastructure constraints addressed, and how better to address those infrastructure constraints than to implement a minerals resource rent tax?

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (11:26):  I am pleased to speak on the motion moved by the member for Hunter, although I have to correct much of what he said. The minerals resource rent tax is a tax based on the politics of envy of those opposite. This tax was born in a tawdry backroom deal by the three big miners—Xstrata, BHP and Rio—and the Prime Minister after she had done a hatchet job on then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. It was a tax which was bought by a $22 million campaign by the big miners, and that gave them a $60 billion break on their mining tax commitment. This is a tawdry deal that left out the mid-cap miners and left out the juniors, of which there are so many in my state of Western Australia. It is not just a bad new tax; it is a tax born out of illegitimate circumstances. We know that there was to be a resources superprofits tax, but it was headed off.


The member for Hunter talked about the MRRT being a mechanism to redistribute wealth. Have we ever heard as good an example of the left-wing agenda of those opposite as this proposal for a redistribution of wealth? The best thing you can do for the workers of this country is to give them a job, not try in some sort of Centrelink way to redistribute wealth across the nation. In an article in the West Australian on 23 February 2011 headed 'Ditch this dog's breakfast of a tax', Paul Murray says:


A drover's dog could show Julia Gillard that her cobbled together mining tax is a dud.


He goes on to point out the myth being promoted by federal Labor that these minerals are owned by all Australians. No, they are not—they are actually owned by the states. He goes on to say:


The simple truth is that the States have always owned the minerals that Ms Gillard—and Mr Rudd before her—disingenuously tell all Australians are theirs. 


They are owned by the states. If you really wanted a proper mechanism which made the collection of revenues across all sectors fair, you would increase the corporate tax. That is the fairest way to go about it. The states outmanoeuvred Prime Minister Gillard on this. She and former Prime Minister Rudd did not understand how the states levied royalties. Then they had to do a reverse twist when they realised that they had to rebate any increases in state royalties. It is a sovereign risk tax. 



If you want any further evidence of this, Mark Cutifani from AngloGold Ashanti has said that Australia's new mining tax is encouraging for mining investment in South Africa, Canada and Brazil, which are major competitors to Australia in the mining field. In Perth, most companies are hedging their bets and looking for alternative mine sites either in Africa or South America, or somewhere in our region, as fallbacks as a result of this increase in taxation. This government will tax anything that it can, and it believes any new tax is a good tax. My electorate has the second-highest number of fly-infly-out and drive-indrive-out workers in a metropolitan electorate in Western Australia. Those workers know how bad this tax is. They know this is a terrible tax that will hurt their jobs. This is a job-destroying tax that will gradually slowdown investment in Australian mining and exploration and eventually send it offshore.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Before I consider the motion of the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations I have before me the motion put by the member for Cook. Under the standing orders it is not available to the member to actually bring on a suspension motion when the order of the day has already been called on. We are not between business items—I had already called on the bill for consideration in detail by the House. In looking at the order of the day, I do not consider the motion of the member for Cook to be relevant to the business before the House.




Mr MORRISON:
  The wording of the motion was confirmed by the clerks before it was brought to this matter. It is open to any member to bring a suspension of standing orders at any time. I ask you to explain why a suspension of standing orders on a motion such as this cannot be brought, when we have a situation where the police commissioner of New South Wales has described this as one of the most significant smuggling activities we have seen in this country. If the government does not want to debate the motion—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Cook will resume his seat.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I have received advice from the clerks—thank you to the member for Canning for his interjection. The clerks have advised me that, yes, the motion can be brought on, but it must be brought on in between business. I had already called on the order of the day. The motion does not relate to the business before the House. I ask the member for Cook to resume his seat for the moment. I will take the member for Cook to section 47 of the standing orders, 'Motions for suspension of orders', and will read it into the Hansard. For the benefit of those present:


(a) A Member may move, with or without notice, the suspension of any standing or other order of the House.


(b) If a suspension motion is moved on notice, it shall appear on the Notice Paper and may be carried by a majority of votes.

I move:





That the Renewable Energy (Electric
ity) Amendment Regulations 2011 
(No. 5), as contained in the Select Legislative Instrument 2011 No. 222, and made under the 
Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000
, be disallowed.



If new Senator Bob Carr is to really be the wonderbra for Labor politics—to lift, solidify and focus the fortunes of the ALP—then he surely should be listened to. In one of his opening speeches to the Senate last week he made the point that Australia should keep all its energy options open because use of renewable energy was growing more slowly than expected. It is therefore a surprise that today the Labor Party is choosing to ignore new Senator Bob Carr on the issue of renewable energy and to make it harder for biomass, as a genuine renewable source, to be a contributor to the climate change challenge of our time.


Over the last month there has been a war of scientists—views have been cited both for and against this disallowance motion. But today the chairman of the Centre of Excellence for Climate Change, Woodland and Forest Health has come out publicly and said that the position I am taking should be supported. If Senator Bob Carr is not good enough, what about the chairman of the Centre of Excellence for Climate Change, Woodland and Forest Health? Why would we deny his voice and why would we deny the centre of excellence in developing best policy? 


I also put on the record the views of the National Farmers Federation. They have genuine concerns about the loss of opportunity for farmers to contribute to the climate challenge of our time. I received a letter from Jock Laurie which said:


There are huge benefits in utilising woody biomass technology to assist Australia reduce its carbon footprint.


If that is still not good enough, I put on the record the views of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, who I note have made large donations to organisations like GetUp! that have been running a pretty stinging campaign around dead koalas being shredded. Even so, the CFMEU have written in support of this disallowance motion, saying they strongly support the use of biomass in sustainable active forest management. 


I also put on the record the views of the very loyal representative of Australasia on the board of the World Bioenergy Association. His letter to me said:


I am not aware of anywhere else in the world where there is this obstruction of use of native forest residues and timber industry processing residues for energy. Over the last six years, I have attended numerous peak conferences in this field in Europe, particularly Sweden, Finland, Brussels, Austria and the USA. And two things stand out. One is that most of the woody biomass being used, always under tight guidelines of sustainable forest management backed up by good research, is from native forests. Second, there are no Australians there from state or federal governments, research or energy organisations, conservation bodies or consulting groups. 


If we are serious about taking on the challenge of renewable energy, we must use all sources available. It is all hands on deck. That includes hydro, that includes wind, that includes solar and that includes geothermal. But it also includes bioenergy. That is why I do not understand why the Labor Party today is choosing to make it harder to invest in bioenergy and harder for the forestry sector to participate in addressing the challenge before this parliament—that of climate change. 


I am pretty sure I know what the government will argue today. They will argue three things. Firstly, they will argue that the RET scheme is only about ecologically sustainable activity. But, by law, forestry in Australia is to a standard of ecological sustainability. Sure, there might be all sorts of enforcement issues on the ground, but the law says forestry in Australia must be to an ecologically sustainable standard. It therefore meets the objectives of the RET scheme.


Secondly, we will hear from government that it is double-dipping—that getting support through both the carbon scheme and the RET subsidy is somehow unfair. They will make that argument despite the fact that all other renewables and all other forestry options can participate in both the scheme to price carbon and the renewable energy scheme For some reason, apparently, we have to isolate native forestry. Somehow this is the bogey in renewables that must be stopped at all costs. I disagree with both of those arguments and I will point out why. 


For me, that leaves only the third argument that I reckon we will hear from government speakers—concerns about potential unintended consequences and fears about loss of biodiversity. Concerns around those fears or unintended consequences are real. I accept those, but they do not beat science and they do not beat international comparative work. That is surely where best policy should come from—from the science and the international comparative work that clearly show those fears are unfounded and that those fears are ideologically driven rather than driven by fact and best policy.


I am not a lone voice on this. We have heard from the NFF, the CFMEU and people who represent Australia on world bioenergy associations in international forums. My local branch of the climate change association of Australia have said they do not want to be a party to any form letters from environmental groups that are doing the rounds. They understand that it should be all hands on deck in dealing with the challenge of renewable energy and the transition to a low-carbon economy.


The disappointment today is that the Australian parliament is choosing to intervene in the renewable energy market and make one sector harder—that is, biomass. Genuine renewables, including wind, solar, geothermal, hydro and bioenergy all have their place. Rather than encouraging and supporting bioenergy within a market, today we are making it harder and calling it a non-genuine option, despite all world evidence to the contrary. Today, I expect to lose this debate based on the latest counting. It will only be by one or two, and that is a disappointment and a frustration. It is a disappointment that bioenergy is not considered a genuine renewable energy in Australia and a frustration that many voting against this disallowance motion in their heart of hearts know they are not voting for best policy.


This disallowance motion is based on two very simple, sound and sensible principles. The first is that the private sector engagement in sustainable active forest management is a good thing in Australia and it is to be encouraged. It is not a bad thing to be discouraged. We use wood and paper in our economy, and we need to find a source for these products somewhere, preferably domestically. The second principle is that biomass and bioenergy do have a place in a genuine renewable energy market and do have a place in tackling climate change. Encouraging a biomass and bioenergy industry to develop is a good thing for Australia and is to be encouraged, not a bad thing to be discouraged. If it is, as I say, all hands on deck in reducing carbon, then biomass and bioenergy surely deserve support and encouragement alongside other carbon-reducing options. Science supports this and international comparative work supports this, so why don't we as an Australian parliament?


If we accept these two broad and sound principles that encourage investment in the landscape, encourage investment in active forest management and encourage investment in more renewable options as one of the many parts in the story of tackling climate change then the logic follows that we should be encouraging investment in existing wood waste for energy by disallowing this regulation, rather than allowing this regulation to pass so that we leave wood waste as pollution. By allowing this flawed and unscientific regulation, we will be allowing greater use of coal, we will leave wood waste to be burnt as nothing other than pollution and we potentially increase the trade imbalance in wood and paper products from less sustainable forestry practices. Where in any of that is thinking globally and acting locally? Where in that are any sensible environmental outcomes? If this regulation is owned by the Greens, it will do little to deliver on that party's platform. In my view, it will do the complete opposite to what they want to achieve as it will encourage the burning of more coal, create more pollution and increase less sustainable forestry practices throughout the Asia-Pacific.


It is a fact that forest residues generally and native forestry residues in particular have the potential to supply low-cost renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions without increasing native forest harvesting or threatening ecological sustainability. This is a fact and no fear-based campaign can change this known fact.


This was identified in the report from the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry. On the last sitting day of last year, that committee made the following recommendation:


… bioenergy sourced from native forest biomass should continue to qualify as renewable energy where the biomass is a true waste product and does not become a driver for harvesting native forests.


This was a bipartisan committee, with unanimous recommendations, chaired by the very good Labor MP Dick Adams, whom I suspect Labor will now pair due to the absence of my colleague Bob Katter and stop him doing his job of being a representative in this parliament. I hope that is not the case.


As a related issue to this committee's work, from a parliamentary procedure point of view, if we are serious about this investment in committee work in the 43rd Parliament then what are we saying about us as a parliament that a committee delivers a report that makes recommendations and then the very next day a minister brings in a regulation that does the complete opposite? At the very least, we should digest, reflect and debate the recommendations made rather than allow a minister to dismiss the work done by a parliamentary committee with no consideration at all. This is a sound committee doing sound work and making sound recommendations. Why are we as a parliament choosing to ignore its work?


As per the recommendation, the former regulation was good law and this new regulation is not. We do not need to deny the option of treating wood waste as genuine renewable energy as it contributes to lower carbon emissions and more investment in renewables. It is part of the symphony of genuine renewables—hydro, wind, solar, geothermal and bioenergy. They all talk to each other and there are co-benefits from having all in the field working as hard as they can. Under the original law, all mills could access renewable energy certificates under current arrangements such as regional forestry agreements, meeting the known legal standard of ecologically sustainable forestry as well as the higher value test whereby no tree was or is harvested for energy; rather the primary purpose must always be for a value adding process such as furniture, flooring or wood products. It is therefore only the residue, at the very most approximately 15 per cent of a log, that we face a choice on in Australia. We either burn the wood waste as pollution or we encourage it to be burnt for energy. I say we convert this waste product to renewable energy rather than add further to pollution in Australia. I also add that, under the original law, very good work was being done by the Forest Stewardship Council and similar bodies. There was a point of engagement between foresters and environmentalists working on lifting standards throughout the industry. This is the place for arguments about on-the-ground definitions of what is, or is not, waste and on-the-ground issues of enforcement of the legal standards of rule of law in this country around ecological sustainability. These are real issues that should be appropriately dealt with through these bodies. But these are not arguments to say the law itself is bad and I hope, whichever way this vote goes, that the very good work of bodies like the Forest Stewardship Council continues to tackle these thorny on-the-ground issues that make this such an emotive community debate throughout Australia.


Over the past month this climate change debate has, in a fascinating way, turned into a forestry debate. That is okay because none of this is inconsistent with my views on forestry. I believe in a strong forestry policy that encourages the establishment of plantations, that ceases logging old-growth forests, that makes a proper long-term commitment to, and investment in, forest monitoring. I believe in a strong forestry policy to improve the reserve system for forests, to improve forest management and develop more ecologically sustainable logging systems, to develop new ways to improve integration of farm forestry with on-farm management and on-farm biodiversity conservation, to reassess sustained yield calculations for production forests to avoid resource overcommitment, to complete a climate change vulnerability assessment for forests, to develop much-improved fire management practices for forests, to make proper investments in forest research and, most importantly, to lead globally by building a sustainable forestry industry locally. To lead, we need to encourage the private sector to engage in sustainable practices. None of what I am suggesting today is inconsistent with any of that. None of this forest review is inconsistent. If we are going to vote this disallowance down, and allow this regulation, it will be a lost opportunity.


I add to anyone who is opposed to this disallowance: they need to explain the trade imbalance of $1.9 billion in wood and paper products. We still use more wood and paper in our economy than we produce domestically. The 'think global, act local' motto must surely prick the conscience of colleagues about where wood and paper is going to come from. Is it coming from forests with less sustainable forestry practices than our own? It pricks my conscience and it is for this reason I say we should not export our guilt by importing more wood and paper products from less-sustainable forests in our region. I say we deal with the trade imbalance and lead our region in building the most sustainable active forestry industry that we can—one that is encouraged by public policymakers and attractive to private investors so that we can see more use of trees in tackling carbon reductions.


That could mean using wood waste instead of coal in the electricity grid, using wood as a substitute for more carbon intensive products and keeping trees in the ground for biological carbon capture and storage and carbon sequestration. I am a strong believer that the landscape always wins out over the man-made and the landscape is the answer to climate change. That is why I argued for the $1.7 billion land sector package, as part of the clean energy package, and it is why this ongoing land sector package will be the standout legacy of this parliament from the negotiations of last year.


There has always been debate about where and how wood is harvested in Australia's forests. This forestry debate has become a climate change debate with the claim now made that a ban on biomass energy from native forestry would be a positive for climate change—a claim that is just plain wrong. Firstly, we have to recognise that we use wood in our economy and it is a substitute product. By using wood in preference to concrete, plastic, metal and steel we achieve carbon benefits. Secondly, we have to recognise that where there is native forestry there will be residues and it is wasteful to let them burn, only to become fugitive emissions, when they could be used to displace high-emission fossil fuels. Thirdly, the more narrow we make the field of allowable alternative energy sources, the harder and more expensive it becomes to deal with climate change. Finally, while Australia is importing a net $1.9 billion in wood products each year, to not allow any native forestry biomass use is just exporting our responsibility for good forestry practices and for carbon reduction.


There has been correspondence received on this topic over recent weeks and I apologise to all MPs for their increased workload. But a fundamental mistake underpinning the campaign from GetUp!, the AYCC and the Greens network is their argument that biomass as renewable energy will change the economic fundamentals of native forestry. It does not and will not. Because of time restrictions, I seek leave to table some of the letters that I have referred to, received from people who are concerned about the place that bioenergy takes.


Leave granted.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
 I strongly support Australia's high degree of protection from harvesting, through reservation and protection, for native forests. Do not get me wrong on that. But I cannot accept a total ban. It does not make sense for forestry and it does not make sense for climate change. (Time expired)

",HoR,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy Amendment Regulations</title>,MOTIONS,15,1
"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2012-03-19,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (13:36):  I second the disallowance motion moved by the member for Lyne on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 5). This disallowance motion is simply one of common sense, not hypocrisy. The coalition does not support the amendment. We support the member for Lyne's disallowance of the amendment. Disallowance of the new regulations would maintain the status quo which we would, when in government, seek to improve in line with the coalition forestry policy of 2010. It is not new, but it is based on common sense and practical measures. A coalition government will reintroduce amendments to the renewable energy legislation allowing wood biomass to benefit from energy incentives available to other energy resources. The regulations put forward by the government prevent any biomass derived from native forests, be they privately or publicly held, being declared eligible for renewable energy credits under the renewable energy target scheme. That is hypocritical, especially for a government that has introduced a carbon tax specifically to reduce emissions and to make the world more sustainable. How can they possibly put forward amendments to their own legislation that will actually reduce the ability of Australians to reduce emissions? Previously biomass from native forests was eligible provided the primary purpose for harvesting the timber was not biomass for energy production and that the logging activities complied with a number of other criteria designed to ensure relevant Commonwealth, state or territory planning and approval processes associated with ecologically sustainable forest management principles were met, such as regional forest agreements and comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve systems.


This is a prime example of the government being held hostage by the Greens. As if we ever had any doubt about it, this proposed amendment to the regulations proves that the Greens are running the country. If forests are being sustainably harvested, surely it is common sense to make use of the offcuts and leftovers to maximise the use of the harvested timber. What else should we do with it? Throw it back into the old-growth forests so that it can simply add to the methane emissions of those mature, old-growth forests? That is what happens. There is currently untapped potential in our forests. Without cutting down a single extra tree, Australia can generate up to 3,000 gigawatt hours of energy using wood waste over and above what is already being done. This is an enormous contradiction from the government. It wants to cut emissions via a carbon tax—and no-one in Australia except they and the Greens want that, and by 'they' I mean not Labor people in Australia but the Labor Party in this House—but is excluding a vital renewable resource that could reduce our carbon imprint. It is pure hypocrisy to deny the opportunity to make use of wood waste for renewable energy within 3½ months of introducing a carbon tax.


This lack of understanding underpins the whole of the government's approach to carbon emissions, and it certainly highlights why we should get rid of this government. We should get rid of the carbon tax and implement practical programs that reduce emissions. On 1 July the government's new tax will begin. It will bring about a massive redistribution of wealth, it will be a massive tax to fund government spending and it will not be a tax at all related to cutting emissions. That is underlined by the disallowance motion of the member for Lyne, which we are supporting. This government is not interested in common sense—it is so desperate to hang onto government that it will do anything the Greens want. The Greens just want to shut down sustainable forest harvesting, and this is just another in a long line of changes meant to make sustainable harvesting of native forests more uneconomic in an effort to drive the timber harvesters out of business. This is having no regard for the loss of jobs or the effect on communities that depend on the economic benefits of timber production. It must be hard for some members of parliament who come from places like Tasmania and perhaps even the Central Coast of New South Wales to tell their constituents why they are going to make their communities, not just their forests, less sustainable. We are not just talking RETs here; we are talking about making communities less sustainable.


Perhaps members from electorates in Tasmania and along the coast of Australia, for whom this issue is a big deal, should be listening to their constituents for a change. Do government members care? Obviously they do not. Do they make sense? Obviously they do not. It this about sustainability? Obviously it is not. We have already seen from the water buybacks in the Murray-Darling Basin that those opposite do not care. In the basin they could have invested in water infrastructure and efficiencies to return water to the environment without any cut in production. In their rush to please the Greens and in their rush to simply say they were doing something, they have bought back incredible quantities of water with no plan for how they will or even can use it. They do not care about regional communities and they most definitely do not care about jobs—except for their own jobs, and they will do anything to hang onto power. I congratulate the member for Lyne for standing up to the government. No rational perspective can support the regulations. This change has been conceived and designed to hurt the forest industry, and that in turn will damage regional communities, depriving them of future opportunity and inhibiting the reduction of carbon emissions.


The overwhelming weight of science supports the use of native forest biomass for energy generation. This is not just me as a farmer who happens to be in parliament going crook—people who have spent their lives studying these things are supporting the use of native forest biomass for energy generation. The 1,200 members of the Institute of Foresters of Australia, an organisation strongly committed to sustainable forest management, sustainable use of biodiversity, conservation and the provision of sustainable livelihoods, support the use of native forest residues for energy production. The vocal minority should get in touch with the Institute of Foresters and get the facts about greenhouse gas emissions, wood waste and native forests. A group of 50 eminent Australian forest scientists have provided their considerable weight in support of the continued publication of native forest residues for the RET scheme, providing tangible evidence that the clear weight of science supports this position. Most Australians know that the stated intention of the Greens is to completely end the native forest timber industry in Australia, even though this is not supported by any credible evidence. I am embarrassed that an Australian government could stoop to taking such steps just to remain in power.

I move:





That the Renewable Energy (Electric
ity) Amendment Regulations 2011 
(No. 5), as contained in the Select Legislative Instrument 2011 No. 222, and made under the 
Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000
, be disallowed.



If new Senator Bob Carr is to really be the wonderbra for Labor politics—to lift, solidify and focus the fortunes of the ALP—then he surely should be listened to. In one of his opening speeches to the Senate last week he made the point that Australia should keep all its energy options open because use of renewable energy was growing more slowly than expected. It is therefore a surprise that today the Labor Party is choosing to ignore new Senator Bob Carr on the issue of renewable energy and to make it harder for biomass, as a genuine renewable source, to be a contributor to the climate change challenge of our time.


Over the last month there has been a war of scientists—views have been cited both for and against this disallowance motion. But today the chairman of the Centre of Excellence for Climate Change, Woodland and Forest Health has come out publicly and said that the position I am taking should be supported. If Senator Bob Carr is not good enough, what about the chairman of the Centre of Excellence for Climate Change, Woodland and Forest Health? Why would we deny his voice and why would we deny the centre of excellence in developing best policy? 


I also put on the record the views of the National Farmers Federation. They have genuine concerns about the loss of opportunity for farmers to contribute to the climate challenge of our time. I received a letter from Jock Laurie which said:


There are huge benefits in utilising woody biomass technology to assist Australia reduce its carbon footprint.


If that is still not good enough, I put on the record the views of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, who I note have made large donations to organisations like GetUp! that have been running a pretty stinging campaign around dead koalas being shredded. Even so, the CFMEU have written in support of this disallowance motion, saying they strongly support the use of biomass in sustainable active forest management. 


I also put on the record the views of the very loyal representative of Australasia on the board of the World Bioenergy Association. His letter to me said:


I am not aware of anywhere else in the world where there is this obstruction of use of native forest residues and timber industry processing residues for energy. Over the last six years, I have attended numerous peak conferences in this field in Europe, particularly Sweden, Finland, Brussels, Austria and the USA. And two things stand out. One is that most of the woody biomass being used, always under tight guidelines of sustainable forest management backed up by good research, is from native forests. Second, there are no Australians there from state or federal governments, research or energy organisations, conservation bodies or consulting groups. 


If we are serious about taking on the challenge of renewable energy, we must use all sources available. It is all hands on deck. That includes hydro, that includes wind, that includes solar and that includes geothermal. But it also includes bioenergy. That is why I do not understand why the Labor Party today is choosing to make it harder to invest in bioenergy and harder for the forestry sector to participate in addressing the challenge before this parliament—that of climate change. 


I am pretty sure I know what the government will argue today. They will argue three things. Firstly, they will argue that the RET scheme is only about ecologically sustainable activity. But, by law, forestry in Australia is to a standard of ecological sustainability. Sure, there might be all sorts of enforcement issues on the ground, but the law says forestry in Australia must be to an ecologically sustainable standard. It therefore meets the objectives of the RET scheme.


Secondly, we will hear from government that it is double-dipping—that getting support through both the carbon scheme and the RET subsidy is somehow unfair. They will make that argument despite the fact that all other renewables and all other forestry options can participate in both the scheme to price carbon and the renewable energy scheme For some reason, apparently, we have to isolate native forestry. Somehow this is the bogey in renewables that must be stopped at all costs. I disagree with both of those arguments and I will point out why. 


For me, that leaves only the third argument that I reckon we will hear from government speakers—concerns about potential unintended consequences and fears about loss of biodiversity. Concerns around those fears or unintended consequences are real. I accept those, but they do not beat science and they do not beat international comparative work. That is surely where best policy should come from—from the science and the international comparative work that clearly show those fears are unfounded and that those fears are ideologically driven rather than driven by fact and best policy.


I am not a lone voice on this. We have heard from the NFF, the CFMEU and people who represent Australia on world bioenergy associations in international forums. My local branch of the climate change association of Australia have said they do not want to be a party to any form letters from environmental groups that are doing the rounds. They understand that it should be all hands on deck in dealing with the challenge of renewable energy and the transition to a low-carbon economy.


The disappointment today is that the Australian parliament is choosing to intervene in the renewable energy market and make one sector harder—that is, biomass. Genuine renewables, including wind, solar, geothermal, hydro and bioenergy all have their place. Rather than encouraging and supporting bioenergy within a market, today we are making it harder and calling it a non-genuine option, despite all world evidence to the contrary. Today, I expect to lose this debate based on the latest counting. It will only be by one or two, and that is a disappointment and a frustration. It is a disappointment that bioenergy is not considered a genuine renewable energy in Australia and a frustration that many voting against this disallowance motion in their heart of hearts know they are not voting for best policy.


This disallowance motion is based on two very simple, sound and sensible principles. The first is that the private sector engagement in sustainable active forest management is a good thing in Australia and it is to be encouraged. It is not a bad thing to be discouraged. We use wood and paper in our economy, and we need to find a source for these products somewhere, preferably domestically. The second principle is that biomass and bioenergy do have a place in a genuine renewable energy market and do have a place in tackling climate change. Encouraging a biomass and bioenergy industry to develop is a good thing for Australia and is to be encouraged, not a bad thing to be discouraged. If it is, as I say, all hands on deck in reducing carbon, then biomass and bioenergy surely deserve support and encouragement alongside other carbon-reducing options. Science supports this and international comparative work supports this, so why don't we as an Australian parliament?


If we accept these two broad and sound principles that encourage investment in the landscape, encourage investment in active forest management and encourage investment in more renewable options as one of the many parts in the story of tackling climate change then the logic follows that we should be encouraging investment in existing wood waste for energy by disallowing this regulation, rather than allowing this regulation to pass so that we leave wood waste as pollution. By allowing this flawed and unscientific regulation, we will be allowing greater use of coal, we will leave wood waste to be burnt as nothing other than pollution and we potentially increase the trade imbalance in wood and paper products from less sustainable forestry practices. Where in any of that is thinking globally and acting locally? Where in that are any sensible environmental outcomes? If this regulation is owned by the Greens, it will do little to deliver on that party's platform. In my view, it will do the complete opposite to what they want to achieve as it will encourage the burning of more coal, create more pollution and increase less sustainable forestry practices throughout the Asia-Pacific.


It is a fact that forest residues generally and native forestry residues in particular have the potential to supply low-cost renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions without increasing native forest harvesting or threatening ecological sustainability. This is a fact and no fear-based campaign can change this known fact.


This was identified in the report from the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry. On the last sitting day of last year, that committee made the following recommendation:


… bioenergy sourced from native forest biomass should continue to qualify as renewable energy where the biomass is a true waste product and does not become a driver for harvesting native forests.


This was a bipartisan committee, with unanimous recommendations, chaired by the very good Labor MP Dick Adams, whom I suspect Labor will now pair due to the absence of my colleague Bob Katter and stop him doing his job of being a representative in this parliament. I hope that is not the case.


As a related issue to this committee's work, from a parliamentary procedure point of view, if we are serious about this investment in committee work in the 43rd Parliament then what are we saying about us as a parliament that a committee delivers a report that makes recommendations and then the very next day a minister brings in a regulation that does the complete opposite? At the very least, we should digest, reflect and debate the recommendations made rather than allow a minister to dismiss the work done by a parliamentary committee with no consideration at all. This is a sound committee doing sound work and making sound recommendations. Why are we as a parliament choosing to ignore its work?


As per the recommendation, the former regulation was good law and this new regulation is not. We do not need to deny the option of treating wood waste as genuine renewable energy as it contributes to lower carbon emissions and more investment in renewables. It is part of the symphony of genuine renewables—hydro, wind, solar, geothermal and bioenergy. They all talk to each other and there are co-benefits from having all in the field working as hard as they can. Under the original law, all mills could access renewable energy certificates under current arrangements such as regional forestry agreements, meeting the known legal standard of ecologically sustainable forestry as well as the higher value test whereby no tree was or is harvested for energy; rather the primary purpose must always be for a value adding process such as furniture, flooring or wood products. It is therefore only the residue, at the very most approximately 15 per cent of a log, that we face a choice on in Australia. We either burn the wood waste as pollution or we encourage it to be burnt for energy. I say we convert this waste product to renewable energy rather than add further to pollution in Australia. I also add that, under the original law, very good work was being done by the Forest Stewardship Council and similar bodies. There was a point of engagement between foresters and environmentalists working on lifting standards throughout the industry. This is the place for arguments about on-the-ground definitions of what is, or is not, waste and on-the-ground issues of enforcement of the legal standards of rule of law in this country around ecological sustainability. These are real issues that should be appropriately dealt with through these bodies. But these are not arguments to say the law itself is bad and I hope, whichever way this vote goes, that the very good work of bodies like the Forest Stewardship Council continues to tackle these thorny on-the-ground issues that make this such an emotive community debate throughout Australia.


Over the past month this climate change debate has, in a fascinating way, turned into a forestry debate. That is okay because none of this is inconsistent with my views on forestry. I believe in a strong forestry policy that encourages the establishment of plantations, that ceases logging old-growth forests, that makes a proper long-term commitment to, and investment in, forest monitoring. I believe in a strong forestry policy to improve the reserve system for forests, to improve forest management and develop more ecologically sustainable logging systems, to develop new ways to improve integration of farm forestry with on-farm management and on-farm biodiversity conservation, to reassess sustained yield calculations for production forests to avoid resource overcommitment, to complete a climate change vulnerability assessment for forests, to develop much-improved fire management practices for forests, to make proper investments in forest research and, most importantly, to lead globally by building a sustainable forestry industry locally. To lead, we need to encourage the private sector to engage in sustainable practices. None of what I am suggesting today is inconsistent with any of that. None of this forest review is inconsistent. If we are going to vote this disallowance down, and allow this regulation, it will be a lost opportunity.


I add to anyone who is opposed to this disallowance: they need to explain the trade imbalance of $1.9 billion in wood and paper products. We still use more wood and paper in our economy than we produce domestically. The 'think global, act local' motto must surely prick the conscience of colleagues about where wood and paper is going to come from. Is it coming from forests with less sustainable forestry practices than our own? It pricks my conscience and it is for this reason I say we should not export our guilt by importing more wood and paper products from less-sustainable forests in our region. I say we deal with the trade imbalance and lead our region in building the most sustainable active forestry industry that we can—one that is encouraged by public policymakers and attractive to private investors so that we can see more use of trees in tackling carbon reductions.


That could mean using wood waste instead of coal in the electricity grid, using wood as a substitute for more carbon intensive products and keeping trees in the ground for biological carbon capture and storage and carbon sequestration. I am a strong believer that the landscape always wins out over the man-made and the landscape is the answer to climate change. That is why I argued for the $1.7 billion land sector package, as part of the clean energy package, and it is why this ongoing land sector package will be the standout legacy of this parliament from the negotiations of last year.


There has always been debate about where and how wood is harvested in Australia's forests. This forestry debate has become a climate change debate with the claim now made that a ban on biomass energy from native forestry would be a positive for climate change—a claim that is just plain wrong. Firstly, we have to recognise that we use wood in our economy and it is a substitute product. By using wood in preference to concrete, plastic, metal and steel we achieve carbon benefits. Secondly, we have to recognise that where there is native forestry there will be residues and it is wasteful to let them burn, only to become fugitive emissions, when they could be used to displace high-emission fossil fuels. Thirdly, the more narrow we make the field of allowable alternative energy sources, the harder and more expensive it becomes to deal with climate change. Finally, while Australia is importing a net $1.9 billion in wood products each year, to not allow any native forestry biomass use is just exporting our responsibility for good forestry practices and for carbon reduction.


There has been correspondence received on this topic over recent weeks and I apologise to all MPs for their increased workload. But a fundamental mistake underpinning the campaign from GetUp!, the AYCC and the Greens network is their argument that biomass as renewable energy will change the economic fundamentals of native forestry. It does not and will not. Because of time restrictions, I seek leave to table some of the letters that I have referred to, received from people who are concerned about the place that bioenergy takes.


Leave granted.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
 I strongly support Australia's high degree of protection from harvesting, through reservation and protection, for native forests. Do not get me wrong on that. But I cannot accept a total ban. It does not make sense for forestry and it does not make sense for climate change. (Time expired)

Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (13:36):  I second the disallowance motion moved by the member for Lyne on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 5). This disallowance motion is simply one of common sense, not hypocrisy. The coalition does not support the amendment. We support the member for Lyne's disallowance of the amendment. Disallowance of the new regulations would maintain the status quo which we would, when in government, seek to improve in line with the coalition forestry policy of 2010. It is not new, but it is based on common sense and practical measures. A coalition government will reintroduce amendments to the renewable energy legislation allowing wood biomass to benefit from energy incentives available to other energy resources. The regulations put forward by the government prevent any biomass derived from native forests, be they privately or publicly held, being declared eligible for renewable energy credits under the renewable energy target scheme. That is hypocritical, especially for a government that has introduced a carbon tax specifically to reduce emissions and to make the world more sustainable. How can they possibly put forward amendments to their own legislation that will actually reduce the ability of Australians to reduce emissions? Previously biomass from native forests was eligible provided the primary purpose for harvesting the timber was not biomass for energy production and that the logging activities complied with a number of other criteria designed to ensure relevant Commonwealth, state or territory planning and approval processes associated with ecologically sustainable forest management principles were met, such as regional forest agreements and comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve systems.


This is a prime example of the government being held hostage by the Greens. As if we ever had any doubt about it, this proposed amendment to the regulations proves that the Greens are running the country. If forests are being sustainably harvested, surely it is common sense to make use of the offcuts and leftovers to maximise the use of the harvested timber. What else should we do with it? Throw it back into the old-growth forests so that it can simply add to the methane emissions of those mature, old-growth forests? That is what happens. There is currently untapped potential in our forests. Without cutting down a single extra tree, Australia can generate up to 3,000 gigawatt hours of energy using wood waste over and above what is already being done. This is an enormous contradiction from the government. It wants to cut emissions via a carbon tax—and no-one in Australia except they and the Greens want that, and by 'they' I mean not Labor people in Australia but the Labor Party in this House—but is excluding a vital renewable resource that could reduce our carbon imprint. It is pure hypocrisy to deny the opportunity to make use of wood waste for renewable energy within 3½ months of introducing a carbon tax.


This lack of understanding underpins the whole of the government's approach to carbon emissions, and it certainly highlights why we should get rid of this government. We should get rid of the carbon tax and implement practical programs that reduce emissions. On 1 July the government's new tax will begin. It will bring about a massive redistribution of wealth, it will be a massive tax to fund government spending and it will not be a tax at all related to cutting emissions. That is underlined by the disallowance motion of the member for Lyne, which we are supporting. This government is not interested in common sense—it is so desperate to hang onto government that it will do anything the Greens want. The Greens just want to shut down sustainable forest harvesting, and this is just another in a long line of changes meant to make sustainable harvesting of native forests more uneconomic in an effort to drive the timber harvesters out of business. This is having no regard for the loss of jobs or the effect on communities that depend on the economic benefits of timber production. It must be hard for some members of parliament who come from places like Tasmania and perhaps even the Central Coast of New South Wales to tell their constituents why they are going to make their communities, not just their forests, less sustainable. We are not just talking RETs here; we are talking about making communities less sustainable.


Perhaps members from electorates in Tasmania and along the coast of Australia, for whom this issue is a big deal, should be listening to their constituents for a change. Do government members care? Obviously they do not. Do they make sense? Obviously they do not. It this about sustainability? Obviously it is not. We have already seen from the water buybacks in the Murray-Darling Basin that those opposite do not care. In the basin they could have invested in water infrastructure and efficiencies to return water to the environment without any cut in production. In their rush to please the Greens and in their rush to simply say they were doing something, they have bought back incredible quantities of water with no plan for how they will or even can use it. They do not care about regional communities and they most definitely do not care about jobs—except for their own jobs, and they will do anything to hang onto power. I congratulate the member for Lyne for standing up to the government. No rational perspective can support the regulations. This change has been conceived and designed to hurt the forest industry, and that in turn will damage regional communities, depriving them of future opportunity and inhibiting the reduction of carbon emissions.


The overwhelming weight of science supports the use of native forest biomass for energy generation. This is not just me as a farmer who happens to be in parliament going crook—people who have spent their lives studying these things are supporting the use of native forest biomass for energy generation. The 1,200 members of the Institute of Foresters of Australia, an organisation strongly committed to sustainable forest management, sustainable use of biodiversity, conservation and the provision of sustainable livelihoods, support the use of native forest residues for energy production. The vocal minority should get in touch with the Institute of Foresters and get the facts about greenhouse gas emissions, wood waste and native forests. A group of 50 eminent Australian forest scientists have provided their considerable weight in support of the continued publication of native forest residues for the RET scheme, providing tangible evidence that the clear weight of science supports this position. Most Australians know that the stated intention of the Greens is to completely end the native forest timber industry in Australia, even though this is not supported by any credible evidence. I am embarrassed that an Australian government could stoop to taking such steps just to remain in power.

Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (13:45):  Since 1900 swimming has been Australia's most successful sport at the Olympic Games. Few countries around the world would stop for a swimming race the way Australia stopped to watch Kieren Perkins, Susie O'Neill, Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett's races in recent times. The latest crop of Olympic hopefuls have been competing at the Olympic trials this week at the South Australian Aquatic Centre. I would like to thank the Chief Executive Officer of Swimming Australia, Kevin Neil, and the board for making the decision to hold the Olympic trials in Adelaide. I had the pleasure of attending the swimming meet on Friday and Saturday this past weekend to watch some of the great racing and results.


At 26, Leisel Jones has made history as the first Australian swimmer to qualify for four Olympic Games. Nick D'Arcy qualified with the fastest time this year for the 200-metres butterfly. Kylie Palmer set an Australian record in the women's 400-metres freestyle, and Stephanie Rice has earned the right to defend her Olympic titles in London. It was great to see Emily Seebohm, daughter of Glenelg Football Club great John Seebohm, win the 100-metres backstroke. The world's fastest man over 100 metres, James Magnussen, will swim tonight. And although the fairy tales did not work out for Ian Thorpe and Michael Klim, all Australians will take great inspiration from the story and comeback of Geoff Huegill.


The strength of the performances augurs well for all our relay teams. I would like to congratulate those successful swimmers who have qualified for the Australian Olympic team. As they are aware, they are ambassadors for Australia and are strong role models for our community, especially our children. Good luck to all those swimmers who are yet to compete over the next four days.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I move:


That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Saturday 17 March 2012, of Margaret Elaine Whitlam AO, places on record its appreciation of her long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement.


The outpouring of tributes since Margaret Whitlam's death on Saturday morning has been widespread and it has been very heartfelt. We have seen her hailed as an icon, a national treasure and a revered public figure. Margaret Whitlam was all of those things; indeed, she was so much more. For many in the Labor movement and people of goodwill everywhere, this is like a loss in the family. We feel that loss because Margaret Whitlam was a public figure in our nation for half a century—vivid, independent and entirely herself. No rule or law required any of her service; it was given freely from the depths of a warm, gregarious heart, and our nation stands thankful today.


In his statement on Saturday Gough described Margaret as the 'love of his life', and indeed this was, at its core, a very great romance. From her very first meeting with Gough at a Sydney University student party in 1939, Margaret knew what she was getting into. She recognised Gough's dry wit and thought he was a good dancer, even though he had a tendency to talk too much and not listen to the music. Margaret had indeed captured the measure of the man. The conversation begun that night lasted for another 73 years, broken only by Margaret's passing on Saturday morning.


This was a partnership of equals, a woman more than matched in brains and humour and panache to this formidable and dynamic figure. Gough entertained no limitations on his own prospects and placed none on Margaret either. For 25 years, she combined university study, professional employment and raising four children in a pattern now familiar to Australian women but which at that time was very rare indeed. Only when Gough became federal Labor leader in 1967 did Margaret embrace the full-time duties of a political partner, only to completely transform and uplift the role. From it flowed all of those achievements and contributions that have been celebrated in recent days: her work as a patron of the arts, her service on countless boards and committees, her writing and television appearances, her compassionate embrace of social causes, her unexpected late career as a tour leader and, above all, her advocacy of women's rights.


Many accomplished women owe their success to the courage and inspiration they drew from Margaret at a time when so much needed to be done and so many barriers stood in the way. As a girl who was in high school during the years of the Whitlam government, I well remember the image that Margaret gave to the nation. It was one of the first times that I believe Australian women saw so publicly in our nation's life a woman who was part of a partnership and part of a great love affair but who was also a woman of accomplishment in her own right, and it gave young girls faith that it was possible not only to be in love but to be in love without those limits being placed on you.


I mentioned on Saturday that Gough impishly called Margaret his 'best appointment' in his foreword to his monumental book on the Whitlam government. In a later book, My Italian Notebook, he called Margaret his 'prima donna', his 'first lady'. Gough's privilege in finding Margaret was a privilege our nation shared and made its own. The Whitlam family is of course greatly saddened by this loss and our condolences go to them, and it is difficult to imagine the depths of pain for Gough Whitlam himself. We are saddened by this loss too.


Gough and Margaret were tall, commanding figures who together cut a swathe through decades of events. Together they embraced a life of activity and of constant service. They were separated only by the limitations of physical frailty and now, with finality, they have been separated by death. Though we mourn today, there cannot be disappointment. Margaret Whitlam's life was long, full, substantial and complete: a great and gracious Australian whose place in the affection of our nation is assured. I commend this motion to the House of Representatives, where Gough Whitlam so effortlessly dominated, and I commend this motion to the Australian people, for whom Margaret Whitlam had such abiding love and respect.



The SPEAKER:  I thank the Prime Minister for that particularly moving contribution.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:05):  As the Prime Minister has said, Margaret Whitlam was much loved by Labor people and well respected by the wider Australian community, and Australians are united in mourning her passing. She once noted in her diary that 'if I can do some good, I'll certainly try'. She did try, and she certainly succeeded.


Prime ministerial spouses, if I may say so, have two principal means of doing good: first, to use the eminence afforded to them to promote good causes and good values; and, second, to do what they can to help their spouses to be their best selves. On both counts, Margaret Whitlam was an exemplar. To the wider community she was a model spouse, a model mother and a model for women who wanted to make the most of themselves. She was also a tireless activist in the Labor cause and a great promoter of the arts. To her husband, it seems, she was a vital reality check. For all his famous wit, her distinguished husband had a loquacious tendency. As has been remarked by former Labor leaders Hawke and Hayden and by former Labor minister Mr Cohen, just about the only person allowed to interrupt Gough when he was in full flight was Margaret. Bill Hayden was quoted in the press on the weekend describing an occasion when the former Prime Minister was speaking at some length. Eventually, Margaret said audibly, 'Will somebody tell that man to sit down?' She started banging her walking stick on the floor until finally Gough indeed sat down. Our spouses do us sterling service when they bring us back down to earth, as all of us in this place sometimes need bringing back down.


Gough, as the Prime Minister earlier noted, once described Margaret as his best appointment. But fittingly he described her last weekend simply as, 'The love of my life.' We join the Prime Minister in offering our condolences to Gough and to the Whitlam family. We join with the Prime Minister in expressing our gratitude for a great life well lived.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Minister for Health) (14:08):  I rise to add a few words to this motion of condolence. Margaret Whitlam's full and influential life has been the subject of much public comment over the last few days, and justifiably so, for she was a much loved figure. I do not repeat the public facts of her life but rather make a few remarks about the woman I knew. Margaret Whitlam was independent and fiercely so. She was a great supporter of her husband and I am sure that he would be the first to say as both local member and later as Prime Minister that she was his greatest supporter and closest adviser.


But she did not always agree with Gough; she did not automatically agree with him. She was a life member of the Labor Party and had her own views about the issues that face us and on people, too, as I found to my benefit when I asked for her support in my pre-selection, in which her husband was backing another candidate. She was kind. She made every person she came into contact with feel comfortable. When she attended branch Christmas parties or other party functions she would be mobbed but she would give each person her full attention.


She was modest. She was very surprised when I asked her to be the guest speaker at a function I was putting on. She said, 'Oh, no: I can get Gough for you.' I said, 'No, I would like you to speak, Margaret.' She said, 'What could I possibly have to say that anyone would be interested in hearing?' We in fact had to turn people away. We could not fit everyone in. Everybody wanted to hear from Margaret.


She was a magnificent example to many women entering the workforce. She balanced her public duties with raising her family. She raised four children with a husband who, as all of us in this place know, worked long hours and was away from home a lot. But she always continued her own fights for equality and for social justice. She was humorous, fun, witty, intelligent and lively. I was fortunate enough to dine with Margaret just recently. She was still absolutely full bottle on current events. She had a lot of very sensible opinions and advice to offer. She was great company that night, as always.


I express my deepest condolences to her devoted husband and loving family. We have lost much as a nation with her passing, but they have lost a great deal more.

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:11):  The long and fruitful life of Margaret Whitlam, which came to an end last week, makes it appropriate for this House to mark her life here today. She defined in her own way the role of the wife of a Prime Minister of this country. Between 1972 and 1975, Margaret Whitlam was very much in the public eye during the years of the Whitlam government in her capacity as the Prime Minister's wife. But she carved out her own identity and supported many causes of her own interest, whether social, cultural, educational or political. These causes were very dear to her heart. She left no-one in any doubt that her marriage was one of equals, true partners dedicated to public service.


This public service continued long after Gough Whitlam's retirement from politics. Much has been written of her warmth, her compassion and her capacity for love. I understand that she had a great sense of humour and that there was a side of her that liked to surprise or even shock people with her words, being amused by their impact. It was her style to speak her mind fearlessly and with wit. She was an extraordinary woman whose contribution to Australian public life ensured that she commanded respect and affection. She will be greatly missed. I offer our sympathies to Gough Whitlam and to the Whitlam family.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Mr RUDD
 (Griffith) (14:12):  Margaret Whitlam was a national figure in her own right. It is entirely deserving and right that in her own right she receives the formal recognition of this parliament. While inseparable in the Australian public's mind, imagination and affection from one of Australia's great Prime Ministers, Gough Whitlam, over the last 35 years Margaret Whitlam's extraordinary individual contribution to the face of modern Australia has become a matter of agreed historical record and, for many decades now, one that has long transcended the political divide.


Margaret Whitlam's public life was therefore not the appendage of someone else's. It was her own life: an extraordinary life and a life lived to the full. She was a strong, independent voice for the full and equal role of women in modern Australia. She was an early strong and independent voice for Indigenous Australians and an early strong and independent voice for the role of the arts and artists in Australia's national life. She was driven by the deepest principles of social justice; driven also by an even deeper love for Australia.


At a personal level, Margaret was warm, generous, blessed with a truly wicked sense of humour and always a source of encouragement for others in public life. She was all these things to my wife, Therese, and it is for this particular reason that I also wanted to speak briefly in this condolence motion today. There were many tears in our household over the weekend, as both Therese and Jessica saw Margaret as an inspiration and were honoured to call her a friend. Back in 2007, Therese asked Margaret for some advice when she came round to the Lodge for afternoon tea—Margaret's simple encouraging reply was 'just be yourself darling and you'll do beautifully'. Margaret became something of a soul mate for Therese in the years since then, and she has asked if I could publicly thank the family for sharing Margaret with her over this time.


Margaret Whitlam—a truly remarkable Australian life. A public life that is the stuff of inspiration. A private person who in her eighties and nineties still took time for others. A wonderful wife, a loving mother—we all loved her dearly.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (14:15):  I join my very eloquent colleagues in sharing our condolences with the Whitlam family, particularly with Gough, who has lost his very best appointment. I have had the honour of representing Margaret Whitlam in the parliament, a fact she never failed to remind me of whenever I saw her. She had a remarkable, grounded nature that enabled her to restrain her husband's grandiosity and flights of fancy. Having seen them closely at different times in my life, through our friendship over several decades, it was never entirely clear to me, because no-one can ever really penetrate the ineffable mystery of the intimacy of a long marriage, whether Gough's grandiloquence in Margaret's presence was not designed as much to get a rise out of her as to satisfy his own sentiments. I always felt that the way Gough described her as Dame Margaret was having a little bit of a dig back at her for having a dig at him for being so grand.


She was an inspiring and loved woman, mother and Prime Minister's wife—she was loved by all Australians. She radiated throughout her life an optimism, a generosity and a compassion that were unmistakable. She lived to a very great age—92 is a hell of an innings. We look back at her life, lived with her husband and her family over all those years, and we think of her with Gough going to China and we think of her with Gough at one great national event after another; these two enormous people—so tall—and producing these enormous children too, I might say. The image of Margaret that I think speaks most eloquently of the woman is the picture of the swimmer, the Bondi girl in her swimming costume, looking out into the future—a future she could not possibly have imagined. It was to be a future of leadership and of a long life of enormous eventfulness. She looked into that future in that picture. When you look at it, you see a look of optimism, of affection, of cheerfulness—a very Australian view into the future. You could say truly and with great affection of Margaret Whitlam that you could take the girl out of Bondi but you could never take Bondi out of the girl.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (15:04):  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Sturt moving immediately: That the Prime Minister be called on to explain:


(1) why the interests of the members of the Health Services Union come second to the Prime Minister’s interests in keeping the Member for Dobell in Parliament;


(2) why the Government won’t require Fair Work Australia to co-operate with the New South Wales and Victorian police fraud squads investigating into the member for Dobell;


(3) whether the Prime Minister agrees with the unconscionable delay in Fair Work Australia’s investigation into the Member for Dobell;


(4) why the Prime Minister or any of her Ministers will not refer the Fair Work Australia inquiry into Health Services Union Number 1 branch to the Australian Taxation Office or the Director of Public Prosecutions for further study as to whether its former officers are in breach of any Commonwealth laws;


(5) whether the links between her government and Fair Work Australia and the communications between her office, her Ministers and their staff with Fair Work Australia have tainted the investigation into the Member for Dobell; and 


(6) whether the Prime Minister will accept the vote of the Member for Dobell should an adverse finding be made against the Member for Dobell by Fair Work Australia.


Standing orders should be suspended and this matter given absolute precedence in the House today because this is a Prime Minister who is clinging to office with the support of the tainted member for Dobell, and her failure to act means that the taint that infects the member for Dobell now infects her and her government.



The SPEAKER:  Order! This is not a motion against the honourable member for Dobell. It is a motion to suspend standing and sessional orders. The honourable member cannot cast a reflection, as he has, on the honourable member for Dobell. He will withdraw.




Mr PYNE:
  I withdraw, Mr Speaker. And the reason this motion should be given precedence over all other business is painfully transparent to the Australian public and to everybody other than the members of the Australian Labor Party. The Prime Minister should be called upon to come into this House and explain how it is that what everybody knows to be true about her government—that it relies on the vote of the member for Dobell to remain in office—can continue to be the case, sapping the very confidence the Australian people can have in a Prime Minister and a government that rely on such a tainted vote.


Let us look at the undisputed facts in this case. The BDO Kendalls report, an independent report, found that the member for Dobell had been engaged in inappropriate spending and that he was likely to have breached industrial laws by taking his then wife on 19 flights and by his failure to question seven credit card transactions for adult services totalling $5,000.


We have the Fair Work Australia report into the HSU branch No. 1 that was released on Friday that found that officers acted in a manner designed to secure a private advantage and were improperly using their positions to gain a personal advantage. It found that spending of $5,000 of members' money to gain experience and knowledge for the political campaign of Barack Obama was regarded by officers of the Health Services Union as justifiable spending. Fair Work Australia found that spending on officers to send them to a wedding was regarded as appropriate spending—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat.




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am reluctant to intervene, Mr Speaker, because I know you feel uncomfortable with the contribution by the Manager of Opposition Business. If he wants to make these accusations against the member for Dobell, he needs to do so by way of substantive motion. If he wants to do that, of course he will be required—



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member will resume his seat. I am listening closely to the honourable member for Sturt. However, he has to be aware that he is not talking to the substantive motion; he is talking to the suspension motion. So he should focus on that, which he has not. The member for Sturt continues to have the call.




Mr PYNE:
  The reason standing orders should be suspended and this matter given precedence is that there is nothing more important to a Prime Minister and to her government than to have the trust of the Australian people. The reason this matter should be debated over all other matters is that the Australian public cannot have any faith or trust in a Prime Minister or a government that relies on the vote of the member for Dobell to stay in office. What I am doing in my presentation today is outlining how it is that the member for Dobell is so tainted by the Fair Work Australia investigation—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The call is withdrawn. Is the motion seconded? I call the honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition—

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:10):  Thank you, Mr Speaker—



The SPEAKER:  and, before she gets the call, I will ask the member for Sturt to return to the dispatch box to withdraw the reflection on the honourable member for Dobell.




Mr Pyne:
  I withdraw, Mr Speaker.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  Mr Speaker; I second the motion. It is vital that standing orders be suspended to provide the Prime Minister with the opportunity to explain her ongoing solidarity with the member for Dobell and her confidence in him, given the findings of a report that was handed down last Friday and the findings of a report from BDO Kendalls which she has in her possession, and whether she supports the decision of Fair Work Australia to refuse to cooperate with the New South Wales and Victorian fraud squads' investigations into the member for Dobell. And, as was apparent from the minister for employment, aka the minister for union bosses, extraordinary answers in question time, it is necessary for the Prime Minister to explain how it is that the minister for employment can say, 'We are certainly going through that report,' and 'We are certainly drawing it to the attention of the regulatory authorities to which we can,' and then, when he was asked in a later question, 'To which regulatory authorities?' he denied he had even said it. The Prime Minister must come into this House and explain how it is that the Prime Minister can still be so unconcerned with the members of the Health Services Union, particularly given the findings of the HSU No. 1 branch investigation handed down this week.


It was not always the case that the Prime Minister was unconcerned about such matters. In fact, the Prime Minister gave a speech in this House some years ago warning about the evils of credit cards. This demands an explanation from the Prime Minister. With a degree of prescience, the Prime Minister said in that speech:


… we really need to look at what causes people to have credit cards …


Well, the members of the HSU would want to know what caused the member for Dobell to have seven credit cards funded by their union dues which were allegedly spent on escort services. And that is why standing orders must be suspended.



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will recall that she is supposed to be talking to a suspension motion.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  Yes, Mr Speaker. And that is why standing orders must be suspended—so that the Prime Minister can explain why she is not interested in these allegations of credit card abuse when in fact, years ago, it was the subject of a very detailed speech in this House, and I am sure the members of the HSU would be very keen to know why the Prime Minister was once concerned about the abuse of credit cards but, when it comes to their union dues, she is no longer interested. Standing orders must be suspended so that the Prime Minister can reacquaint herself with the concerns that she once had about credit card abuse.


The Prime Minister should also explain how it is that Fair Work Australia can pride itself on its 'efficiency'. In fact, in its latest annual report Fair Work Australia boasted of the quick turnaround in the processing of enterprise agreements. Apparently they take just 22 days from lodgement to finalisation, 15 days for a greenfields agreement and 27 days for more complex agreements, and that is why standing orders must be suspended: because the Fair Work Australia organisation has claimed that, in the case of lodgement of details of loans, grants and donations, there is 100 per cent reporting finalised within 28 days. Well, congratulations, Fair Work Australia, because you have taken 1,000 days to investigate the member for Dobell's credit card misuse! And that is why standing orders must be suspended, so that the—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The honourable member referred to 'the member for Dobell's credit card misuse' which is a reflection—




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  Alleged—alleged misuse. I have said that before, Mr Speaker.



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member will withdraw any reflection on the member for Dobell.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  I withdraw. And Fair Work Australia was created by the Prime Minister. Many of its senior officers were personally appointed by the Prime Minister.



The SPEAKER:  Order! The honourable deputy leader will resume her seat.




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition now is not only abusing process but also abusing a statutory authority—in my mind an even greater crime than the reflections on the member for Dobell. If she wants to make such accusations she should do so by way of—



The SPEAKER:  The honourable Chief Government Whip will remove himself from the chamber under the provisions of standing order 94(a).




The member for Hunter then left the chamber.





Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  The Prime Minister must come into the House and explain how it is that she can hide behind the independence of Fair Work Australia yet has hand-picked from the union movement virtually all the recent appointments. The Fair Work Australia-Labor union family tree, quite frankly, rivals the organisational chart of the five mob families in New York—which can be found at www.mafiafamilytree.com. This family tree of Fair Work Australia requires explanation from the Prime Minister. (Time expired)

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:15):  This is the 49th suspension moved by those opposite and the third attempt at suspension today. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition would not associate himself with those sorts of tactics by having the Manager of Opposition Business and the Deputy Leader do it. Today the Leader of the Opposition had the Leader of the National Party ask the first question. They started low and they got lower—and they got lower as the day went on. In the last contribution they hit a nadir; they hit the bottom of the pit.


Those opposite will do anything rather than discuss the issues that are of importance to the Australian people, and that is why standing orders should not be suspended. It should not be the case that this parliament gets distracted because those opposite have absolutely nothing positive to say about the economy, about employment, about the environment, about social policy or about the mining boom. And it is on a day when the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Bill will go through the other place and will become law as a result of that. But they want to discuss anything rather than a suspension of standing orders.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the motion that is before the House is why the suspension of standing orders should be carried in order to debate the motion I moved—a very serious motion about matters to do with the member for Dobell, Fair Work Australia and the Prime Minister's involvement. It was not about the minerals resource rent tax, and there is no basis upon which the Leader of the House could be debating the minerals resource rent tax.



The SPEAKER:  Firstly, it is not about the motion he proposes to move if standing orders are suspended. The Leader of the House was straying, and he is aware of that. And he will return to the substance of the suspension motion.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I will outline before the House what we should be debating. That is why this suspension motion should not be carried. That is what I will do, and that is what I will do every single time those opposite raise these daily stunts. I was once Manager of Opposition Business, and I sat down in the tactics room in the opposition leader's office day after day. We discussed, when it came to a suspension of standing orders, whether there was momentum, whether it was significant, whether it was a big issue. What we did not do was walk in here with a motion like this one moved by the Manager of Opposition Business—pre-typed out, pre-signed, pre-ordained and with no momentum and no ability whatsoever to get traction. That is why it was not even taken seriously by their own backbench.



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business will remain silent.




Mr ALBANESE:
  So why should we take it seriously on this side of the House? We should not suspend standing orders, because what we should have had was question time. But those opposite had the hide, when earlier on today we were discussing the motions of condolence, to say, 'We'll miss out on question time.' On 13 out of 15 days they have come in here and moved a suspension of standing orders—not on the issue of the day, not on anything in which there was any urgency whatsoever, but just so they could get back into the gutter to do anything whatsoever to avoid debating the economy. This afternoon I would like to have a range of debates that are on the Notice Paper.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.



The SPEAKER:  This had better be a genuine point of order, because I have been listening to the Leader of the House, and he appears to be in order. But I am listening to the point of order.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, with great respect, I beg to differ. He was reflecting on members of the opposition by describing us as 'getting down in the gutter'. And as I was asked to withdraw matters to do with the member for Dobell in which I was accused of reflecting on the member, I regard that as offensive and I would ask you to ask him to withdraw it.



The SPEAKER:  I would ask the Leader of the House to assist the House by using more moderate language.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Mr Speaker, thank you. The fact is, those opposite have absolutely nothing to say about the economy. They have absolutely nothing to say about the big debates that are before this parliament. Just before question time we passed the safe rates legislation. I was hoping there might be a question from those opposite about safe rates for truck drivers and why it was important. If we had not had this suspension of standing orders moved we might have got it—unlikely, but possible.


I was hoping beyond hope, when the Leader of the National Party stood up at the beginning of question time, that I might get a question. They had been critical about safe rates, which is about justice for those hardworking truckies and ensuring safety on our roads. There might have been a question about the shipping reform that we have got forward. Those opposite are saying they are against that as well. Of course, that is shipping reform that, had we not suspended standing orders, we could have had a question about. I could have explained how we are introducing a zero tax rate for Australian shippers, how we are introducing a tax exemption for Australian seafarers, how we are making sure that the Australian flag can once again be used on the back of Australian ships. But of course those opposite are against it because they have never seen a tax reduction that they could support, whether it be in the area of company tax or whether it be in the area of shipping. The only tax policy that they have got is to oppose company tax reductions and they have a policy of putting it up—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Leader of the House will return to the motion.




Mr ALBANESE:
  It is not surprising that they want to suspend standing orders rather than debate substance because we know that if they have to debate substance they might have to debate their $70 billion black hole. They might have to discuss the comments of Senator Sinodinos, who said just today that 'there has been a bit of untidiness in this area'. That is what he thinks about their economic performance. They cannot even agree about which of their promises are real or aspirational.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will return to the substance of the motion.




Mr ALBANESE:
  That is why we should not suspend standing orders, because I want to discuss these issues. I want to discuss their policies on PPL, tax cuts, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the national dental scheme because it appears they are just all over the shop on all of those issues. They have a $70 billion black hole. I was hoping perhaps that I might even get a question about infrastructure. We know that it is unlikely—I have not had one for years—but we were hoping that we might get one if we did not suspend question time. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition had a blog in the Daily Telegraph recently where he promoted support for the M4 East, the F3 to M2, the M5 East widening, the North West Rail Link and the road tunnel under Mosman.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will return to the motion.




Mr ALBANESE:
  That is $50 billion of promises in a blog, and they have already got a $70 billion dollar black hole. It is no wonder they do not want to discuss the issues of substance. That is why they try to suspend standing orders every day. They come in here, but they do not put any time or effort into their questions in question time. There is no probing of the government as to the policies of the day. There is no probing of the implications behind, for example, the safe rates legislation, which they say is so terrible. There are no questions about the detail of that legislation because they are simply not interested in it. What we saw them doing last Thursday is a new thing. Not only do they waste time with the suspension of standing orders, they now waste time bobbing up like Jack and Jill up the back there giving five-minute grabs so that they avoid voting on legislation and avoid going down on that legislation.


This is a good day for the parliament. We had safe rates carried by this House and the MRRT will be carried by the other house. That is why we should not waste time with a suspension of standing orders. They do not talk about why standing orders should be suspended, but they put a whole lot of slurs out against members of parliament, statutory authorities and anyone else who stands in their way. We on this side want to talk about our plans for enhancing opportunities for nation building, for returning the budget to surplus and our positive vision for the future. That is what we are focused on and that is what this parliament should be focused on. It should not be focused on the longest dummy spit in Australian political history, which we are seeing from those opposite. It is no wonder when you see the sorts of performances from those opposite that people know in their guts that he is nuts. That is what they know, because those opposite just engage in relentless negativity day after day.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The term just used by the Leader of the House concerning the Leader of the Opposition is quite offensive and should be withdrawn.



The SPEAKER:  I did not hear the actual remark. Would the Leader of the House assist the House?




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  It is a term that the Leader of the House has used on previous occasions and has been asked to withdraw. He knows perfectly well he was offensive and should simply withdraw.



The SPEAKER:  The Minister for Trade and Competitiveness will resume his seat.



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  I warn the honourable member for Mackellar! The member for Mackellar has the advantage over me as I did not hear it. The Leader of the Opposition did not take exception to it. I ask the Leader of the House: would he be prepared to facilitate the business of the House?



Government members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Order! I did not hear what the term was, and I cannot require the term to be withdrawn unless I know what it is. If I know what it is, I am able to determine whether or not it ought to be withdrawn. I did ask the Leader of the House whether he would assist the House, but he was of the view that he had not made an unparliamentary statement. I did not hear it. On that basis, I would have called the honourable member for Menzies; however, the first member to rise was the minister for trade, who has the call.



Opposition members interjecting—




Dr Emerson:
  I was standing before him.



The SPEAKER:  The minister will resume his seat. I am listening to a point of order.




Mr Andrews:
  Mr Speaker, my point of order, with the greatest respect, is that the member for Mackellar was on her feet at that stage taking a point of order. It would have been disorderly on my part to come up here and bowl her out of the way of the dispatch box and it is my submission, Mr Speaker, that you should give the call to this side in this debate.



The SPEAKER:  The first member I saw—the minister for trade has the call.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was following proceedings very closely. I am just speaking to your ruling.



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member will resume his seat.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I am taking a point of order.



The SPEAKER:  I have ruled against your point of order. The question is that the motion moved be agreed to and I call the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness.

Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (15:29):  The reason that standing orders should not be suspended is that this parliament should be a clearing house in the contest of ideas. It should not be the forum for smearing Fair Work Australia or for smearing the member for Dobell. What it should be is a battle of ideas. That is what the Australian people expect here. They do not expect the scorn and derision and the grubby, filthy politics from those opposite, who engage in chants and mafia. What you have engaged in today is an absolute disgrace and you should be ashamed of yourselves.



The SPEAKER:  Order! The minister will withdraw the reflection on the members of the opposition. He will approach the dispatch box and do so.




Dr EMERSON:
  I withdraw. Mr Speaker, this—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The time allotted to this debate has expired. The question is that the motion moved by the honourable the Manager of Opposition Business for the suspension of standing and sessional orders be agreed to.

 (15:45):  I am confident that the standing orders have been observed on prior occasions. If I become aware of a situation where that has not occurred I will notify the honourable member privately.


Last Thursday I advised the House that I would check the Hansard record in relation to a term that appeared to have been used by the honourable the Leader of the Opposition in connection with the honourable member for Griffith. The Hansard record shows that the honourable leader had indeed used an offensive term about the honourable member. The first reference cited words that had been used outside the House by another member. The second reference was in the leader's own words. It is clear from House of Representatives Practice and from Erskine May that members may not circumvent the standing orders concerning offensive words by the device of using quotations or referring to the words of others. I would caution all honourable members about these matters and I would not expect this particular term or practice to be used again.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (16:06):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services I present the committee's report into the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012, incorporating a dissenting report.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms O'NEILL:
  by leave—On 3 November 2011 the House of Representatives referred the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011 to the committee for inquiry and report. The committee received 18 submissions into the provisions of this bill and held a public hearing on 2 March 2012 in Canberra. On 29 February 2012, the Senate referred the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012 to the committee. While the committee had limited time to consider this bill, it did call for and receive 11 submissions. The committee also offered those witnesses who gave evidence at the public hearing on 2 March the opportunity to comment on the provisions of the trustees bill and, in the report that I table today, the key issue of trustee obligations in proposed section 29VN of the bill is discussed in some detail. The committee thanks all those who made submissions and gave verbal evidence to the committee.


The MySuper core provisions bill and the trustee obligations and prudential standards bill are part of the Australian government's Stronger Super reform package announced in December 2010.


The MySuper core provisions bill would amend the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to introduce a new regulatory framework for default superannuation products. As the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation has stated:


… around 60 per cent of Australians do not make active choices in relation to their superannuation.


…   …   …


Having created an industry which flourishes on the back of compulsory savings mandated by legislation, it is fair that this industry, which benefits so much from the compulsory saving system in Australia, contributes to higher retirement savings through greater efficiency and lower fees.


The minister added:


MySuper will provide a simple, cost-effective default product that all Australians can rely upon. 


I can inform the House that submitters to this inquiry supported the introduction of simple, comparable and cost-effective default superannuation products, as envisioned by the MySuper reforms. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry argued that the reforms are required to give appropriate recognition to consumer behaviour. It stated in its submission:


ACCI supports the MySuper goals of reducing account costs, making costs more transparent, improving the basis for inter-fund comparison, and providing improved member protection. ACCI recognises that many employees are not well positioned to be actively engaged in making investment decisions, and an appropriate superannuation system must recognise this.


The Financial Services Council told the committee that the reforms will enhance transparency and consumer protection within Australia's superannuation sector. To quote the Financial Services Council:


For the first time, it effectively says that when you have a compulsory savings system in this country we believe there ought to be some protections or some provisions around where those compulsory moneys flow.


The Industry Super Network strongly advocates the reforms, arguing:


… it is entirely appropriate to reassess the regulatory framework, particularly for superannuation providers who wish to offer default funds in workplaces where members do not exercise a choice of fund.


The Financial Planning Association of Australia noted in its evidence that it:


… supports the intention to have 'comparable' characteristics based on cost, investment performance and the level of insurance coverage.


The committee considers that the introduction of a cost-effective, simple and comparable default superannuation scheme is compatible with the objective of promoting a market in which consumers can confidently invest. The evidence provided to this committee and explored by the super system review panel points to a need for reform. A system cannot be in the best interests of its members or facilitate informed participation if it does not effectively respond to members' engagement with that system.


The evidence before the committee also highlights the alarmingly low levels of consumer financial literacy regarding Australia's superannuation system. The committee would welcome greater efforts to improve members' understanding of an investment that is of significant financial importance. The committee may raise this matter with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) as part of the committee's ongoing oversight of ASIC. The committee would also be interested in advice in this area from the Financial Literacy Board regarding the board's activities in this area.


I commend the report to the House and I thank the committee secretariat for their assistance.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (16:12):  by leave—The report which has just been tabled deals with the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012. The coalition has significant concerns with both of these bills.


Firstly, the MySuper core provisions bill has some very serious implementation issues. Secondly, the bill is defective in its failure to open up the default fund system to competition. And, thirdly, the bill is defective in allowing a charge to be made for the provision of intrafund advice—that is to say, the bill is defective in relation to the arrangements under which intrafund advice may be provided, which allow the cost of that advice to be recovered across all members of the superannuation fund. This is inconsistent with a key principle underlying the Future of Financial Advice reforms, which are simultaneously going through the parliament, that financial advisers are not permitted to provide advice without charging for that advice in a transparent manner.


In relation to the trustee obligations and prudential standards bill, the coalition's view is that, while a broad sweep of reforms was recommended by the Cooper review, which underpins this set of bills, the bill deals, somewhat surprisingly, with only a selected area of those reforms. The provisions of the bill which impose additional obligations and liabilities on directors are, in our view, ill-judged and go too far, and the so-called scale test is very much opposed by the coalition. Rather than addressing all of these areas in the brief time I have available today, I wanted to focus briefly on the relationship between the introduction of MySuper products and the arrangements in relation to default superannuation funds. This is an area of significant concern to the coalition. A key aspect of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011 is that only MySuper products may be used by employers in making default superannuation contributions for employees who have not specifically chosen a fund. The wording of proposed section 29K(4), which is about the objects of that particular part of the bill, is clear:


… employers will need to pay contributions for an employee who has no chosen fund into a fund that offers a My Super product.


The difficulty is that there is inadequate choice of MySuper products for employers to pay that contribution into.


The Cooper review recommended, firstly, that the Superannuation Guarantee Act should be amended so only a MySuper product would be eligible to be a default fund nominated by an employer and, secondly, that all MySuper products should be able to be nominated for default fund purposes in awards approved by Fair Work Australia. In other words, the policy principle identified in the Cooper review, and a policy principle which on this side of the House we support, is that the only requirement for eligibility to be a default fund is simply that you have an approved MySuper product. Unfortunately, the legislative framework which will result from the bill, should it pass into law, together with existing law is that an additional necessary condition must be satisfied before a MySuper product is eligible to receive contributions in respect of a particular employee from an employer. That additional necessary condition is that the relevant superannuation fund has been approved by Fair Work Australia as a default fund—under the secretive and non-transparent process which Fair Work Australia uses.


The member for Robertson spoke of comments made by the Financial Services Council. I would like to refer to another observation made by the Financial Services Council. They had this to say:


This unnecessarily restrictive regulatory framework has a negative impact on the ability of employers to administer their compulsory superannuation obligations …


The council also said:


It also restricts competition, efficiency and innovation in the financial services industry.


The failure to include a provision in this legislation that any MySuper fund is eligible to compete in the marketplace—that any MySuper fund is eligible to be the default fund chosen by any employer—is a lamentable omission. It appears to the coalition to be inconsistent with the policy principles underlying the Cooper review.


I regret to say that the government's failure to make provision for this appears to be part of an ongoing pattern of the government using superannuation policy to bolster and benefit the union movement. Successive Labor governments have seen considerable attraction in using the compulsory superannuation system to increase the power, influence and financial position of the union movement and its key personnel. The minister with responsibility for this package of bills is a natural candidate to advance such an agenda. He is a former secretary of the Australian Workers Union and a former director of the predecessor organisation to the largest industry superannuation fund, AustralianSuper.


Under the Fair Work Act, as I have mentioned, the so-called modern awards are required to contain a clause specifying the superannuation fund into which the employer must pay the employee's superannuation contributions if the employee has not separately nominated a fund. It stands to reason that to be nominated as a default fund under a modern award is a very valuable right because a default fund is guaranteed a steady stream of contributions. This is highly relevant to the content of the bills discussed in the report which has just been tabled, because of the point that I have just made—a failure to amend the law to ensure that the only necessary requirement to be nominated as a default fund, applicable to any employer-employee relationship, is to be a MySuper fund. An analysis conducted last year by the Institute of Public Affairs found that, across 166 modern awards approved by Fair Work Australia, there were a total of 566 superannuation funds specified. Of these, 513 were industry or public sector funds.


Decisions about the superannuation system—




Mr Combet:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: as a matter of courtesy we granted leave for the member to comment on this report. It is now extending into quite a lengthy contribution and there is much government business to be conducted.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  I understand that, but leave was granted. I am sure the member for Bradfield is mindful of your concerns, but there is no time limit once leave has been granted.




Mr FLETCHER:
  I am bringing my contribution and my comments to a close. I conclude with these observations. Decisions about the superannuation system should be made in the interests of superannuation fund members. This bill's failure to deliver real choice of fund by making MySuper status the only requirement to be a default fund is a glaring omission. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that this is designed to continue to advantage one sector of the industry which in turn has very close links to the union movement.

 (Bradfield) (16:12):  by leave—The report which has just been tabled deals with the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill 2012. The coalition has significant concerns with both of these bills.


Firstly, the MySuper core provisions bill has some very serious implementation issues. Secondly, the bill is defective in its failure to open up the default fund system to competition. And, thirdly, the bill is defective in allowing a charge to be made for the provision of intrafund advice—that is to say, the bill is defective in relation to the arrangements under which intrafund advice may be provided, which allow the cost of that advice to be recovered across all members of the superannuation fund. This is inconsistent with a key principle underlying the Future of Financial Advice reforms, which are simultaneously going through the parliament, that financial advisers are not permitted to provide advice without charging for that advice in a transparent manner.


In relation to the trustee obligations and prudential standards bill, the coalition's view is that, while a broad sweep of reforms was recommended by the Cooper review, which underpins this set of bills, the bill deals, somewhat surprisingly, with only a selected area of those reforms. The provisions of the bill which impose additional obligations and liabilities on directors are, in our view, ill-judged and go too far, and the so-called scale test is very much opposed by the coalition. Rather than addressing all of these areas in the brief time I have available today, I wanted to focus briefly on the relationship between the introduction of MySuper products and the arrangements in relation to default superannuation funds. This is an area of significant concern to the coalition. A key aspect of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011 is that only MySuper products may be used by employers in making default superannuation contributions for employees who have not specifically chosen a fund. The wording of proposed section 29K(4), which is about the objects of that particular part of the bill, is clear:


… employers will need to pay contributions for an employee who has no chosen fund into a fund that offers a My Super product.


The difficulty is that there is inadequate choice of MySuper products for employers to pay that contribution into.


The Cooper review recommended, firstly, that the Superannuation Guarantee Act should be amended so only a MySuper product would be eligible to be a default fund nominated by an employer and, secondly, that all MySuper products should be able to be nominated for default fund purposes in awards approved by Fair Work Australia. In other words, the policy principle identified in the Cooper review, and a policy principle which on this side of the House we support, is that the only requirement for eligibility to be a default fund is simply that you have an approved MySuper product. Unfortunately, the legislative framework which will result from the bill, should it pass into law, together with existing law is that an additional necessary condition must be satisfied before a MySuper product is eligible to receive contributions in respect of a particular employee from an employer. That additional necessary condition is that the relevant superannuation fund has been approved by Fair Work Australia as a default fund—under the secretive and non-transparent process which Fair Work Australia uses.


The member for Robertson spoke of comments made by the Financial Services Council. I would like to refer to another observation made by the Financial Services Council. They had this to say:


This unnecessarily restrictive regulatory framework has a negative impact on the ability of employers to administer their compulsory superannuation obligations …


The council also said:


It also restricts competition, efficiency and innovation in the financial services industry.


The failure to include a provision in this legislation that any MySuper fund is eligible to compete in the marketplace—that any MySuper fund is eligible to be the default fund chosen by any employer—is a lamentable omission. It appears to the coalition to be inconsistent with the policy principles underlying the Cooper review.


I regret to say that the government's failure to make provision for this appears to be part of an ongoing pattern of the government using superannuation policy to bolster and benefit the union movement. Successive Labor governments have seen considerable attraction in using the compulsory superannuation system to increase the power, influence and financial position of the union movement and its key personnel. The minister with responsibility for this package of bills is a natural candidate to advance such an agenda. He is a former secretary of the Australian Workers Union and a former director of the predecessor organisation to the largest industry superannuation fund, AustralianSuper.


Under the Fair Work Act, as I have mentioned, the so-called modern awards are required to contain a clause specifying the superannuation fund into which the employer must pay the employee's superannuation contributions if the employee has not separately nominated a fund. It stands to reason that to be nominated as a default fund under a modern award is a very valuable right because a default fund is guaranteed a steady stream of contributions. This is highly relevant to the content of the bills discussed in the report which has just been tabled, because of the point that I have just made—a failure to amend the law to ensure that the only necessary requirement to be nominated as a default fund, applicable to any employer-employee relationship, is to be a MySuper fund. An analysis conducted last year by the Institute of Public Affairs found that, across 166 modern awards approved by Fair Work Australia, there were a total of 566 superannuation funds specified. Of these, 513 were industry or public sector funds.


Decisions about the superannuation system—




Mr Combet:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: as a matter of courtesy we granted leave for the member to comment on this report. It is now extending into quite a lengthy contribution and there is much government business to be conducted.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  I understand that, but leave was granted. I am sure the member for Bradfield is mindful of your concerns, but there is no time limit once leave has been granted.




Mr FLETCHER:
  I am bringing my contribution and my comments to a close. I conclude with these observations. Decisions about the superannuation system should be made in the interests of superannuation fund members. This bill's failure to deliver real choice of fund by making MySuper status the only requirement to be a default fund is a glaring omission. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that this is designed to continue to advantage one sector of the industry which in turn has very close links to the union movement.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2012-03-19,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (16:32):  If ever there was a time and a reason to have a disallowance motion, this is it. It defies belief for a government to turn its back on its own policy—its own mantra for dealing with renewables and reducing emissions—and allow the Greens to sit on the government and come up with an amendment to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act which defies common sense and sends the worst possible message to industries everywhere.


This amendment to the act means that a thoroughly efficient, thoroughly renewable industry is being denied the opportunity to make use of its waste. This amendment to the act defies common sense. Why, in heaven's name, would a government want to spit on itself in this way? Obviously it is because of the Greens, who have never let a job, particularly a job in regional Australia, get in the way of ruining an industry. They have never done that and they are certainly running true to form today.


I, and the coalition, thoroughly support this motion. This amendment defies common sense and imagination. In my own electorate there is a forestry industry—it is not native, but it is a huge plantation forestry industry—so what kind of message does it send to that industry? The current act does not allow the harvesting of old-growth forests, or anything else for that matter, to be used for this renewable purpose. It can only be done with the waste product of normal harvesting. I cannot stress enough that if common sense is a measure, then it has gone out the window with this amendment. I do not care what electorate you are in. There would be more electorates in Tasmania that are going to suffer than anywhere else.


If we want people living in the regions at all, we certainly do not want a government run by the Greens. As I said earlier, the Greens have never let a job, particularly a job in regional Australia, stand in the way of destroying an industry. That is their sole purpose with this amendment. This amendment is designed to make a legal industry, acting in accordance with all the laws, regulations and forestry agreements, less profitable in the eyes of the Greens so there will be no industry at all. I do not know if it ever crossed the minds of any of the Greens to get out into regional Australia and see how important the forestry industry is there. I talk about my own electorate in this—I cannot help it, because we are full of renewables, whether agriculture, the plantation industry, the forestry industry or whatever. What kind of a message does it send to anyone in regional Australia when a government walks away from its own policy on renewables and walks away from the whole reason that it is bringing in a carbon tax, supposedly? That they are willing to put this amendment up underlines the fact that the whole carbon tax is a charade. Why in heaven's name would you put up a tax which you are saying is to reduce emissions and then turn around and move an amendment to a current act which will negate the ability to have renewables? I guess only this government would know, but certainly the Greens know.


I just hope that the mover of this motion has the backing of his fellow Independents. As to the member for New England, for example, I can tell you that 90 per cent of his constituents would find the lack of common sense in this amendment to the act to be totally reprehensible. I can tell you that they would in most of our electorates. If the Australian people fully realised what this amendment did, in terms of totally letting common sense go out of the window, to simply give the Greens a win, to try and destroy an industry, then I wonder what they would say. And I hope that, if anyone does vote for this amendment and against the motion, they have got the guts to go back to their electorate and say, 'I failed you, but I did it to stop the government losing an act.'

"Combet, Greg, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:38):  This of course is a debate concerning a motion moved by the member for Lyne to disallow the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 5). The government opposes the motion to disallow those regulations. The government and I, in my role as minister, have high regard for the member for Lyne and we have worked very closely with him in relation to the clean energy package that was announced in July last year. However, this is one area where we do take a different approach from the member for Lyne's to this specific issue. In implementing its plans for a clean energy future announced on 10 July last year, the government recognised the importance of ensuring that all of the elements of the plan work together to maximise the combined benefits for our society, our economy and our environment.


We had enormously wide-ranging discussions in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee over an extended period of time looking at all issues: emissions reductions in our economy, the nature of the renewable energy technologies that are deployed, the operation of renewable energy legislation and regulations in our economy and the incentives that they give, and a whole host of other matters. The regulation that is before the House that is the subject of the disallowance motion by the member for Lyne was a product of all of those considerations. So I emphasise that the government looks at this regulation as part of the overall clean energy package and the way in which the entirety of the package comes to operate. With that in mind, the government is determined to provide support for bioenergy investment while, at the same time, ensuring that native forests are afforded appropriate protection. It is very important when you look at the overall policy settings to try and get that balance right.


A carbon price will encourage the use of woody biomass as an energy source because the combustion of biomass for electricity generation or heat energy will not attract any liability under the carbon price mechanism. Therefore, generators that use biomass, including wood wastes from native forests, will become more cost-competitive relative to generators that use fossil fuels, which will be subject to the carbon price. Of course, this is part of the entire concept of carbon pricing: it is to put a market signal into the economy with respect to the combustion of and emissions from fossil fuels, such that there is a change in the relative position of different fuel sources and energy sources in our economy. That market signal is intended to direct investment towards lower emissions fuel sources, and we believe this regulation sits squarely within that context.


The carbon price will drive a fundamental transformation of our energy sector, with Treasury modelling estimating $100 billion worth of investment in renewable energy in the period to 2050—$100 billion worth. In the government's Clean Energy Future plan, the forestry industry also bears no liability for logging and liquid fuel emissions from forestry operations because they are not covered.


There are also some potential opportunities for the industry in relation to the Carbon Farming Initiative. Indeed, at the recent United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations dealing with the treatment of forest management, several months ago in South Africa, the international accounting rules were on a pathway to be altered in a way that would strengthen the incentives for opportunities under the Carbon Farming Initiative with respect to forest management.


Also, as part of our clean energy future plan, and giving effect to the agreement reached within the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, the government has amended the Renewable Energy Target regulations to exclude biomass—a subject of this debate, obviously—from native forests as an eligible renewable energy resource. This exclusion encompasses, to be clear, products, by-products and waste associated with or produced from clearing or harvesting of native forests. Native forests are important for biodiversity and store large amounts of carbon. Excluding electricity that is generated from native forest biomass from eligibility under the Renewable Energy Target scheme removes the potential for the Renewable Energy Target scheme to provide an incentive for the additional burning of native forest biomass for bioenergy, even where this burning is a secondary use. In the context of the benefits of bioenergy from the carbon price, the additional incentive from the renewable energy target could increase both the primary and the secondary purpose use of native forest wood, which could lead to unintended outcomes for biodiversity and the destruction of intact carbon stores.


The government recognises, of course, that investments may have been made in the past on the basis of the renewable energy target rules which previously did allow the eligibility of wood waste derived from native forests and has put in place transitional arrangements to preserve the previous rules for existing power stations that are already accredited to use native forest biomass as an energy source. In doing so, my department has consulted very extensively with industry to get those transitional arrangements right. To make that clear again: those power stations accredited for the use of this material under the Renewable Energy Target scheme have transitional arrangements put in place that continue to allow them to earn benefit from the investments they have historically made. The explanatory memoranda I published as minister in relation to these particular regulations contain, in regulation No. 4, in detail, those transitional arrangements. They are very important in respect of a number of the accredited generators under this scheme, and that is a very important point to note in the context of some of the contributions that have been made.


It is also important to recognise that renewable energy certificates can continue to be created from electricity generated from other wood waste and energy crops, such as oil mallee, woody weeds, agricultural wastes and wood from certain timber plantations. So there are products that can continue to generate renewable energy certificates. Nothing in relation to the regulations subject to the disallowance motion prohibits the use of biomass for the purposes for which it has been applied and has, under the standing situation, also generated renewable energy certificates. It can still be used, and incentives are changed by the carbon price coming into effect from 1 July.


While biomass derived from native forests is no longer recognised under this regulation as an eligible renewable energy source under the Renewable Energy Target scheme, those changes do not—as I made the point a moment ago—prohibit the use of this biomass for bioenergy. I would not want anyone to gain the impression from listening to the debate that that was not the case. This wood waste can continue to be used for the purposes for which it has previously applied. However, it would not, under these regulations, any longer generate renewable energy certificates. Bear in mind, once again, that there are quite important transitional arrangements put in place for generators that are accredited under the scheme.


The government considers that in its totality the clean energy future plan, including the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 5) that are the subject of this debate, achieves the right balance for our nation and for renewable energy providers to continue to move towards a cleaner energy future. We therefore do not support the motion that has been moved by the member for Lyne.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2012-03-19,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (16:48):  I support the motion for disallowance put forward by the member for Lyne in relation to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 5). I congratulate the member for bringing this very important motion to the attention of the House. The motion the member has put forward is in line with the coalition's forestry policy on wood biomass and renewable energy. It was stated in the lead-up to the 2010 election that an incoming coalition government would reintroduce amendments to the renewable energy legislation, allowing for wood biomass to benefit from energy incentives available to other renewable energy sources.


Our support for the motion before the House today is entirely consistent with that policy position. However, the government's position on this issue is intellectually inconsistent, politically inconsistent and also environmentally inconsistent with the government's stated objectives. There is one party that has been consistent, and that is the Greens. The Greens have been consistent in their approach to this issue, because it is consistent with the Greens approach to destroy jobs in the native hardwood timber industry throughout Australia. So that is a consistent approach. The Greens will never be satisfied until they shut down the entire native hardwood industry in this nation. So the motive of the Greens in pressuring the government to this position is well understood.


It concerns me that we have an example, once again, of this government doing the bidding of the Greens at the expense of all other considerations. As I just said, the position being taken by the government in this is intellectually, politically and environmentally inconsistent with its objectives. It concerns me that we have got to the stage where we have Labor members opposite not prepared to stand up for the blue-collar workers in the timber industry that they pretend to represent in this place. It should not surprise me, though, because we have at least 40 members opposite who rely on preferences from the Greens to get themselves re-elected. So while this may not necessarily be an issue for some of the metropolitan members of this place, it is certainly an issue for many of the regional members and it should be an issue for every one of the Labor Party members who pretend to represent blue-collar workers in this place—and I am talking about members right throughout Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and of course Western Australia.


I am concerned that the government's amendment and the source of the disallowance motion by the member for Lyne is clearly discriminatory to the native-forest-harvesting industry. It seeks to omit any biomass derived from native forests, be they privately or publicly held, from being eligible for renewable energy credits under the Renewable Energy Target scheme. I think the member for Calare belled the cat quite well in his presentation earlier today when he referred to the lack of common sense in the government's position, because this amendment put forward by the government simply provides an opportunity for the Greens to claim another victory over the Australian Labor Party. It is deliberately designed to harm the native hardwood timber industry at a time when that industry is facing many other challenges. I simply cannot find a rational reason for the government's approach.


I know the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency just tried to explain the government's position. I would have to suggest to the minister, in his presence, that his heart really was not in it. He tried to justify the exclusion of biomass from the native forest industry for renewable energy certificates. I listened intently, but I am not sure it was the most passionate defence of a government policy that I have ever heard from the minister.



Government members interjecting—




Mr CHESTER:
  It may be harsh, but it is true. In his heart, he knows that this amendment is simply indefensible, both from the perspective of his so-called clean energy package and from the perspective of a person who I generally believe cares about blue-collar workers and the future of the timber industry. I just could not get a sense that anything he said indicated that he was particularly passionate about the position his government was forcing him to adopt.


My concern is that some members are not listening to the debate as closely as they should on this particular issue and that the House does not quite realise that the use of biomass as a by-product from the native forestry industry is part of the economic model for the future viability of the timber industry. That is not to say that anyone is going out there suggesting—sorry, the Greens are going out there suggesting that people will go out and cut down forest for the pure purpose of generating electricity, but putting aside the Greens for a moment—this is anything other than a by-product or a waste product from the harvesting of native timber. There are already protections in place so that you cannot harness timber for the sole purpose of generating electricity and attract any of these renewable energy certificates. So that protection already exists in the legislation. It is simply not viable, and not particularly sensible, for anyone to go down that path anyway. Anyone in the hardwood timber industry is looking for the highest possible yield they can get from any given sawlog. The whole focus of the hardwood timber industry is trying to find value-adding opportunities where they can then get the maximum possible yield from an individual log. It would simply make no sense for them whatsoever to cut down trees for the sake of the biomass industry. The renewable energy certificates that were attached to the previous position of the clean energy package would assist in adding to the viability of the industry.


There is a classic example in my electorate with the timber mill in Heyfield. I do not have the exact figures—I am going from memory but I am pretty close to the mark. It processes about 150,000 cubic metres of regrowth ash from Victorian forests per year. It is a very big timber mill and is a viable operation on a world scale at 150,000 cubic metres. All its sawlogs are certified under the Australian forestry standard. There is a whole range of international and national standards that it meets. There are about 200 direct employees at the Heyfield mill. Sixty per cent of Heyfield's output of high-value hardwood is sold to Melbourne, to customers employing about 22,000 people. This is a very impressive operation at Heyfield. 


In addition to that high-value end of the operation, where it is selling a range of products into European markets and into Melbourne, it also has the capacity to generate enough sawdust to provide eight megawatts per annum in its power station at the site. It has the capacity to do it, but it has not proceeded with this plan in the past because the running costs and depreciation associated with the electricity generation would result in a cost of 19c per kilowatt hour. The renewable energy certificates would return approximately 4c per kilowatt hour, making the price of electricity 15c per kilowatt hour. At this stage, Heyfield is currently purchasing its brown coal power for about 8c per kilowatt hour. Currently, only one-third of the sawdust is used for heat and steam generation to kiln-dry the timber and the remaining two-thirds is sold to the potting mix market. There is an opportunity here, and I have provided a classic example at a very local level in my electorate, to help ensure the future viability of that operation—as I said, this is not going to be the only reason the Heyfield mill keeps going—if it is in a position to access the renewable energy certificates and go down this path. For the government to exclude this obvious form of renewable energy is, I think, ridiculous.



Government members interjecting—




Mr CHESTER:
  No, I did not suggest that the minister himself is ridiculous; I suggested that the government's position is ridiculous. I have said it is intellectually inconsistent with his government's own position on a whole range of other areas. It is clear to me that this is not about a climate change agenda but about fulfilling the Greens agenda for the native hardwood timber industry. With the waste classified as renewable energy, a business like the Heyfield timber mill can then compete more readily with exports. Without the change, business costs at this particular mill will be driven higher and the mill may then put itself in a position which is unsustainable.


I put it to the House that this is exactly what the Greens party wants out of this legislation. The Greens' political agenda is to shut down the native hardwood timber industry. I congratulate the member for Lyne for highlighting the inconsistency in the government's approach by bringing this motion of disallowance before the House because he raises a very important point. I am disappointed that there are not more members from regional parts of Australia from the Labor Party prepared to come in here and debate their case. They should come into this place and explain to me how the timber workers in their electorates will support them in this decision, because I am afraid that they will not. The timber workers I have met with want to remain viable in the industry into the future. I am very disappointed that members opposite are not prepared to come in here and defend their position. What we have seen is a very half-hearted attempt by the minister to defend their position, when I think in his heart of hearts he would prefer to be going down the path that the member for Lyne wishes to take the parliament here today.


In making that point, I encourage all of the crossbenchers to support the member for Lyne in his position, just as the coalition is supporting him in his position. I particularly encourage the member for New England because I believe he is a man who does understand an industry like the timber industry and how its future viability can hang by a thread. If we are going down this path, where the government is going to exclude them from a clear opportunity to be viable in the future, it would be disappointing if the member for New England were not to support his colleague the member for Lyne on this issue.


In the time I have left, I reflect briefly on a couple of points. The member for Lyne referred in his contribution to the current trade deficit in wood and paper products of about $2 billion per year. This is another example where, if we come into this place and are prepared to pass legislation, regulations or whatever it might be that discriminates against the native hardwood timber industry, we need to understand the downstream ramifications of doing that. We currently have in this country a deficit of about $2 billion in terms of the wood and paper products we bring in. There is legislation before the House now on whether we are going to take a stronger line in regard to products from illegal harvesting of timber in other nations. The point I am trying to make is that we have a sustainable hardwood timber industry in this nation which is heavily regulated, yet at the same time we are making it more difficult for that industry to compete with imported products.


This motion put forward by the member for Lyne and supported by the coalition will perhaps make it fractionally easier in the future for the hardwood timber industry in this nation to compete with these imported products from timber which is not necessarily harvested to anywhere near the same level of certification as our own timber industry is on a daily basis. Our industry already faces many challenges: resource security; cheap imported products; illegally harvested timber that I have just referred to; the carbon tax, which I believe will make it less competitive; and an extreme green element in the community pursuing policies like this which are completely inconsistent with the future interests of our community.


In the time I have left I want to mention a letter that the member for Lyne thoughtfully distributed to all members. In that letter he attached a document signed by 49 recognised forestry scientists and leading forestry practitioners. I know that members receive a lot of correspondence but, in a free plug to the member for Lyne, if you can find in your files this letter with the document signed by 49 forestry scientists, dig it out. Do yourself a favour, as Molly Meldrum would say, and get the letter out and actually read what they have to say, because this letter is probably one of the most compelling bits of evidence that you will see in this place for some time.




Mr Hunt:
  Careful!




Mr CHESTER:
  No. I say that with all sincerity because I think it strongly makes the case, in a very succinct way, for members who perhaps are not necessarily that familiar with the hardwood timber industry. It explains what is at stake here. So I congratulate the member for Lyne for moving this motion for disallowance. I condemn the Australian Greens party in particular for continuing to pursue this great myth that in Australia we are down to our last tree and that the chainsaws are out to get that as well. We have a very sustainable hardwood timber industry in this nation. It is worth fighting for, and I congratulate members on this side of the House who are prepared to stand up and fight for the timber industry today. What concerns me about the Australian Greens is that that party can only survive when they are fighting to save something. As soon as they save one coupe in my electorate you will have a spokesperson for the environmental movement out there saying, 'That's a good start but now we need something else.' They are never satisfied. The Australian Greens are never satisfied because they survive as a protest party that have to be saving something.


When it comes to the Australian timber industry, it is time for all members who care about the future of blue-collar workers and regional communities to say, 'Enough is enough.' We have an extensive reserve network in this nation and we have a sustainable hardwood timber industry that is worth fighting for. So I encourage those members opposite to support the member for Lyne and, in particular, I encourage members of the crossbenches to support their colleague in this motion for disallowance. Do the right thing by the Australian timber industry and, most importantly, do the right thing by the Australian timber industry workers and their families who depend on this place and the members in this place to finally stand up for workers and give regional communities a chance.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-03-19,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:03):  I accept the comments made by the member for Lyne earlier that this disallowance motion arose from members and employers in his electorate approaching him with a situation where perhaps there was a small amount of waste associated with their operations that they thought could be turned into renewable energy. But this is much bigger than that. This is a regulation that will not apply simply to the odd employer in the electorate of the member for Lyne; it will apply right across the country. It goes to the heart of the economics of chopping down trees and burning them and counting that as renewable energy.


Firstly, there is nothing stopping the business in the electorate of the member for Lyne, or businesses anywhere else, from putting that material, if it is genuine waste material, to a use that generates energy, but they should not be paid for it. That is fundamentally the question. To quote Judith Ajani, the point about the economics of this that is overlooked in all the contributions we have heard so far is that 'sawn timber stopped driving Australia’s native forest logging in the 1980s and woodchip exports are no longer driving native forest logging'. We have a situation where the export market for woodchips is collapsing. As I said, for hardwood we have had that general shift in the whole economics of the industry away from native forests to plantations.


The only way we could continue the perverse action of burning our native forests and counting that as renewable energy is if people are given a perverse subsidy, and that is what the motion by the member for Lyne would do. It would enable these operators and any other operator who wants to enter the market, and I will come to that shortly, to get paid for what is fundamentally an environmentally and economically unsustainable industry. We are at the point where those two are converging. It has been recognised that this is environmentally and economically unsustainable. Of course, the people who want to make money out of burning down forests and counting it as renewable energy are looking for a lifeline. This motion gives them that lifeline and that is why they are lining up behind it, together with the opposition.


It will be possible for up to 50 per cent of the value of a project to be counted as renewable energy if this regulation is not allowed to stand. It is important to focus on and tackle the myth that it is somehow about some small proportion of waste product. I have heard the member for Lyne and others say that the high-value rules will address that. That is economically simply not the case. It is very possible to have the vast majority of an operation going into pulp or chips to be burnt for waste, to have the vast majority by volume, and still have the majority of value being done through the high value, through the hardwood. For example, the point that the Australian Forest and Climate Alliance make in the letter that they have circulated is that in East Gippsland pulp logs are sold for a royalty as low as 11c a tonne with the top quality regrowth pulp logs being sold for about $2.50. With that value in balance it is very easy to still have a majority of value at the high end, as the member for Lyne puts it, but the majority of the volume would still come from cutting down forests and burning them for renewable energy. That is what this regulation will stop.


It is not only a perverse economic incentive but a perverse environmental incentive, because we will be burning what are recognised as some of the world's most carbon dense forests. That is why some have been led to speculate that this could in fact increase greenhouse gas emissions. As we know—and this is happening in Tasmania and would be allowed to continue to happen if this regulation is not allowed to stand—when you burn high quality carbon stores and carbon dense stores like our native forests it takes a long time to replace that. That is why the plan that this regulation seeks to forestall has been described by Andrew Mackintosh, the Associate Director of the ANU Centre for Climate Law and Policy, as 'Pythonesque'. He says that it is climate policy plan that is incapable of lowering emissions but that could increase them, that will result in no net gain in the amount of renewable electricity generated and that will cost taxpayers millions per year.


We know that there are people waiting to get a subsidy to burn large parts of the Tasmanian forests and count that as renewable energy. We know that because the letter that was referred to by the member for Gippsland is one of the most astounding pieces of evidence to ever have been put before the parliament. It is co-signed by a number of people, including some from the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania. Of course they want this. They are going to get an economic benefit out of it. But we know that it is not going to impact just Tasmania. We know that in Western Australia, as reported in the Australian last week, some Karri trees—Western Australia's tallest and among the world's tallest—are already classified as forest waste and turned into woodchips for a market that no longer wants them. Instead of saying that this is madness and that is a market that should be phased out, this motion will give that industry a lifeline and allow those Karri trees to continue to be burned.


It is simple economics. If you give people a subsidy for something, you will create an industry around it. While I accept that the member for Lyne is acting on the basis of people within his electorate coming to him, there are people right across this country who are rubbing their hands at the prospect of another subsidy, because it will make projects viable that would otherwise have been unviable because the economics and the environment were heading in the same direction. We should not allow the continued logging of high conservation value forest. We should not allow threats to habitats of native species. We should not further undermine biodiversity in areas that are already under stress.


One point that is also critical for me is that, as the minister referred to, this was something in the Clean Energy Future package, which came out of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. It is on page 129 of the document. It says: 


The Renewable Energy Target regulations will be amended to exclude biomass from native forest as an eligible renewable energy resource. This includes products, by-products and waste associated with or produced from clearing or harvesting of native forests, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements for existing accredited power stations.


It was there in the deal. We had some talk before about respecting the work of parliamentary committees. That parliamentary committee did some outstanding work. People with differing points of view found a consensus. There are things in that document that if I personally was writing the package would not have agreed to. I would not have agreed to extensive sandbagging of polluting industries. We had a different view on petrol. But the Greens have not come back in here and said, 'We didn't like that bit of the deal, so we're now going to seek to carve bits out.' That is an important principle in this parliament, where we all often come to agreements that are not exactly as we would like but that arise out of people with differing points of view talking and agreeing on what is common. When we do that, we should stick with it. That is why I cannot support the motion of the member for Lyne.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (17:12):  It gives me great pleasure to support the disallowance motion moved by the member for Lyne. I do so for three reasons. Firstly, because this motion moved by the member for Lyne is about avoiding perverse effects. There has been much discussion about perverse effects but there are some very basic facts for those who care about emissions and the level of greenhouse emissions arising from Australia's economic activity to consider here. Secondly, there is deep, strong, credible and widespread support for the disallowance of this motion from those who care about our overall emissions level and those who care about the sustainable operation of an industry that has widespread support around Australia. Thirdly, this motion is also about electricity prices and ensuring that we do our best to reduce the average electricity price paid around Australia. For all of those reasons, the coalition and I in particular strongly support the continued use of woody biomass, where it is in waste form, as part of the Renewable Energy Target and as a source of credits for renewable energy credits.


Let me begin with the issue of perverse effects. Much has been made in this debate of the letter to the member for Lyne from the 49 recognised forestry scientists and leading forest practitioners. I want to quote one element. I note that the signatories represent universities from around the country, including Murdoch University, the University of Melbourne and many others, including many of the highest quality institutions in the country. It is not a group which would be assumed naturally to support one side or the other of parliament. It is a group to which enormous weight must be given. In my judgement, the key phrase in the letter, relating to the perverse effects of not using wood waste from the harvesting of native forests, is: 'When not used for biomass fuel, processing residues are often distributed on landscapes or buried and burnt near mills where, like harvest residues left on the landscape, they decompose to greenhouse gases without any greenhouse gas mitigation benefit. This misses the opportunity to provide energy for society, increasing our dependence on alternative energy sources, including fossil fuels, or more expensive renewable energy sources.' Within that one paragraph are two critical facts: firstly, much of this woody biomass or wood waste—I use the term 'wood waste' deliberately—is allowed to decompose by being turned into landfill, which in turn decomposes, not just to methane, but to other gases with high greenhouse potential. The net effect of not allowing the current practice to continue is that global emissions and Australia's emissions will go up, because a waste product is allowed to decompose instead of being utilised—and we have not even got to the economics of it. There is no offset, no mitigation and no avoidance of emissions; it adds to emissions. This, by the way, is one of the reasons that the use of woody biomass is fundamental to renewable energy programs right across Europe.


It is also clear, both from practice and from the work of the 49 foresters, that if it is not sent to landfill this waste wood would be burnt as a by-product, being treated and disposed of, to no electrical or societal benefit. Again, there would be a high level of emissions but no benefit from avoided emissions from other activities. In that respect, we see here a clearly perverse effect in relation to Australia's overall emissions and global overall emissions. That is not my evidence; that is the evidence of 49 independent scientists from around the country, including some of the most pre-eminent forest and carbon scientists in Australia, if not the Southern Hemisphere.


It has been the position of both sides of parliament until now that using wood waste was a desired outcome, because it avoids the problem of landfill and therefore avoids the perverse effect of emissions being generated with no positive benefit. But let us look at support, firstly, for industry. The 1,200 members of the Institute of Foresters of Australia, the IFA, an organisation committed to sustainable forest management, support the use of native forest residues for energy regeneration. These are residues; they are waste. They are things that would otherwise give off emissions if they were not used properly. Secondly, as has been noted, 49 eminent Australian forest scientists have provided their weight in supporting the continued use of native forest residues through the renewable energy target, which was a bipartisan position until July of last year. Thirdly, the members of the government's own committee that supported Seeing the Forest Through the Trees, the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, all agreed. Those committee members were the member for Lyons, who was the chair, the member for Bass, the member for Corangamite and the member for McEwen. They all supported the continued use of native forest waste or residue as a component for generating renewable energy credits under the renewable energy target. Those four government members of the committee concluded, on the same day this change of regulation was introduced by the government, that the regulation was not justified. If there could be a greater humiliation for the government than there has been on this policy issue, it is hard to imagine. The government's own members, who were specifically tasked to inquire in detail did not believe it. They did not believe their minister. They did not believe all those who would push this view. It is a simple test for those members: do you stand for your beliefs and findings and will you vote against the decision of the government to ban the very thing that you said was desirable?


Multiple environment groups around the world have supported the use of biomass waste and woody biomass residue. The World Wildlife Fund in concert with the European Biomass Association has called for 15 per cent of energy generation in OECD countries to be generated from the use of biomass by 2020. This is not a modest figure; this makes what occurs in Australia seem almost irrelevant. It goes further. When you look right across the European landscape, you see something even larger. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated in its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007:


In the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre or energy from the forest—


and I underline energy—


will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit.


To complete the package, the Clean Energy Council in Australia has said:


[It] believes the exclusion of native forest biomass as an eligible renewable energy resource under the RET is an example of the lack of understanding and support needed to harness the full potential of bioenergy resources in Australia.


Wherever you go in Europe you will see biomass used—for example, Belgium's target for 2020 is 13 per cent; biomass contributes one-third of that. The EU 'counts on heat and power from biomass to play a critical role in meeting its ""202020"" targets'. That is, 20 per cent by 2020. So there we go. That is the view around the world, whether it is in science, in industry, or in the ALP in this country. Up until a few short months ago, and even now, its four leading members in this space all supported the continued practice of using waste rather than burning waste or pushing it into landfill where it will produce methane with a greenhouse warming potential of over 20 times that of CO2. If you head to Europe and the IPCC you will see that the support for this practice could not be stronger.


When it is clear that there is a perverse effect and that there is overwhelming support, the last reason is a very simple one. It is about lower electricity prices. What this motion is really about at its heart of hearts is that it was designed, firstly, to do its best to help destroy an industry—and there are many members on both sides of this chamber who understand that. But even more so it says, 'We know that there are forms of renewable energy which are too high a cost to be justified if wood residue is able to go in there; therefore, we want to drive up the average cost of electricity to try to get to those highest cost forms of renewable energy.'


I have supported, believed in, committed to and engaged in helping to push through—I even negotiated with the current minister, and I thank him for that—the 20 per cent renewable energy target. There are those who are critical of it; I am guilty as sin of supporting it. But it was not about finding the highest cost for renewable energy; it was about finding the lowest cost for renewable energy. If we are moving into that space, we need to do it on the lowest cost basis. I think every member of this House knows this motion of the government's which has sought to be disallowed by the work of the member for Lyne is going to drive up electricity prices rather than drive them down. For that they should be condemned. For all of those reasons, it gives me great pleasure to support with every fibre of my being the disallowance motion of the member for Lyne.

"Windsor, Tony, MP",Ind.,2012-03-19,"



Mr WINDSOR
 (New England) (17:24):  I will speak only briefly to the motion before the House. I agree with the general substance of what the member for Lyne has suggested and I have listened with interest to other members in the House. I agree with the substance of what has been said by those who are going to support this. If it were in another form, I would be voting for it.


The reason that I am not supporting the member for Lyne's disallowance motion is that I feel compelled to support the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee agreement from whence this regulation has come. It is on those grounds that I cannot support it. I feel that I made an agreement. I heard from my office the member for Melbourne speak some moments ago. There are parts of that agreement that he disagrees with, there are parts that I disagree with, and I am sure there are parts that the minister at the table disagrees with on a personal level. But it was an agreement that was reached for the longer term benefit of what we believe our community requires through the various arrangements in the clean energy suite of legislation.


So even though I do not disagree with what the member for Lyne is saying, I find that because of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee agreement I am unable to support his motion. If it were introduced in another form—and a few members have mentioned the parliamentary committee that has looked at this—I would look very seriously at supporting it. But, as I said, I cannot support the disallowance of the regulation which was part of the agreement that was reached.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (17:27):  I must say that I am disappointed that the member for New England cannot support this disallowance motion because I think that it is very much in the national interest. Because we still have issues with what the carbon tax will do to the dairy industry and the meat industry, I would have hoped that the Independents would have been doing all they could to ensure especially rural and regional Australia are not severely disadvantaged by these bills. I would have thought that there would have been the ability for the member for New England to support the member for Lyne on this motion, because I feel it is going to be extremely difficult for the committee to do anything.


The committee, of which I was a member, produced the report Seeing the forest through the trees: inquiry into the future of the Australian forestry industry. As a new member of parliament, this is really the first committee report that I have been involved in. In many ways it was incredibly refreshing because the bipartisan way the members of the committee went about producing this report was something that should be commended. It shows that all members can work together to achieve a report that everybody agrees on. I take this opportunity to commend the chair, Dick Adams, for the fine job he did in chairing the committee while we went about this report, the deputy chair, Alby Schultz, and the member for Corangamite, Mr Cheeseman. We also had a member from Tasmania in Geoff Lyons. We also had George Christensen, Rob Mitchell, Tony Crook and me. We did a lot of work. We visited a lot of places. We also took evidence here in Canberra from a lot of people. One of the things that struck me throughout the hearings was that those on all sides were prepared to ask questions on all types of evidence, and we were then able to bring that all together and agree on recommendations. We covered diverse issues in this report, including managed investment schemes. I would recommend that all members of the House look at the committee's recommendations on managed investment schemes, because I think they show a very good way forward.


I think everyone on the committee was struck by the evidence we received on the use of forestry biomass. I am pretty sure that we took that evidence on a Wednesday afternoon, when constituents of the member for Lyne and members of the forestry industry appeared before us. We asked about what would happen with the off-cuts from native timber, given that the approach seemed to be that those off-cuts would not be able to be used for biomass. We were told that the majority of it would be put into landfill and that, over time, as it decays, it lets off nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is one of the most harmful CO2 gases. Here we were, looking at a piece of legislation that is meant to reduce CO2 emissions, yet by its very nature it was actually going to increase it.



Mr Windsor interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  That is the evidence that we heard. I would be happy to provide that evidence to the member for New England. We were all struck by the absurdity of what will occur unless we can get the parliament to agree to this disallowance motion.


I recommend that honourable members and anyone who has an interest in this matter look at this report, Seeing the forest through the trees, particularly chapter 7, which addresses using forestry biomass. It is quite a detailed chapter and it outlines the type of evidence that we heard. For instance, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry told us:


Biofuels and bioenergy can play an important role in expanding the range of renewable energy sources available in Australia. Australian state and territory governments have adopted comprehensive frameworks to ensure that environmentally responsible forest management practices underpin the use of wood residues for bioenergy.


So there are good practices in place. We also heard from Bioenergy Australia, who said:


During the energy recovery process, the carbon dioxide bound in the biomass is released to the atmosphere. Bioenergy is regarded as renewable, when the biomass resource consumed in the energy conversion process is replenished by the growth of an equivalent amount of biomass. Under the Kyoto Protocol bioenergy is regarded as carbon dioxide neutral.


The Institute of Foresters of Australia on cogeneration stated:


With most mills lucky to recover 40% of log volume, generating power using mill residue as a fuel source creates two economic solutions to what would otherwise be expenses. An expensive aspect of processing in the softwood industry is seasoning and drying, using kilns. The heat generated in cogeneration can be used to drive seasoning plants while augmenting power supplies.


We also visited my electorate and met with Mr Andrew Lang of SMARTimbers Cooperative in Lismore. Andrew is very much an expert in this area and is leading the way. He was able to give us a small demonstration of how native timber can be used to generate renewable energy. He told us what occurs in northern Europe:


The pattern in the Scandinavian countries is to use the heat energy for district heating (and for district cooling in summer). In Brazil and India the heat energy is commonly used by the generating industry, as well as some of the electricity.


So it is common practice in particular in Europe and it is a growing practice in India and Brazil. Other countries in the world are using this source of renewable energy, so it seems absurd and ridiculous that we would not do the same.


Australian Forest Growers suggested that funding be made available for:


… research, development and extension into biofuel, bioenergy and Biochar technology, including upscaling the technology to a commercial scale. This upscaling must include options for regionally based utilisation of biomass at sufficient scale to be economically viable yet small enough to be effectively utilised locally.


They would like to see more funding put into this area, because they see enormous long-term benefits in it. So it is not just a matter of renewable energy credits being available; if we can get the technology right we can use it a lot more, particularly in regional areas, because it can be done on such a scale that regional areas can capitalise on it.


As outlined in its report, the committee believes that bioenergy from the forestry industry presents a promising opportunity. The report states:


Using the principle of cogeneration, it is also possible to ensure that as much energy as possible is captured and used from the use of biomass.


…   …   …


As noted above, there remains a significant amount of work to be done by the industry, in order to identify the barriers to expansion of bioenergy, and to ensure that a secure fuel supply is maintained.


The report further states:


As for the question of native forest waste products being used to produce energy, the Committee is aware that recent policy change is yet to be fully implemented.


We were not quite sure which way the government would end up going on this issue. The committee then recommended that it was of the view that:


… under any version of the RET (or similar scheme), bioenergy sourced from native forest biomass should continue to qualify as renewable energy, where it is a true waste product and does not become a driver for harvesting for native forests.


All sides of the committee, once again, were of the view that:


… under any version of the RET (or similar scheme), bioenergy sourced from native forest biomass should continue to qualify as renewable energy …


That is the bipartisan report's recommendation and is spelled out in particular in recommendations 15 and 16 of the report. I ask all members to look at those recommendations.


I wish that the member for New England could be right in that there would be a way, other than this disallowance motion, for this to be brought into the parliament. The sad thing is that I cannot see a way forward. My view is that all members of this committee put these recommendations on the table and this was as far as all members could go. The hope was that this would lead to a very sensible approach and, in particular, might support the member for Lyne in bringing forward this disallowance motion. So, if there is another way forward, we on this side would like to hear about it and I think the committee would love to hear about it. My worry is that politics will get in the way and that we will not be able to achieve what will be a very sensible outcome.


I do not always agree with the member for Lyne and I do not always agree with the member for New England but on this issue it would be very good if they could put their heads together and come up with a way where we could ensure that common sense did prevail, because at the moment it is not going to prevail. There are a lot of people especially in rural and regional areas who are looking at this as a way forward. It enables those people who like to put plantations on their agricultural land to use the wood waste from those so that it adds to the income of family farmers. If the member for New England would like to talk to Andrew Lang I am sure he would be glad to show him around and show him the innovative work that he is doing in this area in adding to his farm income by using this and trying to develop it as a second income to his family farm.



Mr Windsor interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  It does not make the economics add up. If he can get the RECs it does. That is the important point on this. I would like to see a common-sense way forward on this. The last thing we want to see is this timber end up in landfill. I will conclude there. I am disappointed that it looks like we will not get a common-sense outcome on what I think is a very sensible proposal put forward by the member for Lyne. I would like to take the time once again to commend my fellow committee members who put forward this report. It was a very good bipartisan report and I call on the government to look at the recommendations in it and to act upon them.



The SPEAKER:  The question before the chair is that the motion be agreed to.



The SPEAKER:  In accordance with the principle that decisions should not be taken except by a majority and the principle that legislation should be left in its original form, my casting vote is for the noes.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2012-03-19,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (16:32):  If ever there was a time and a reason to have a disallowance motion, this is it. It defies belief for a government to turn its back on its own policy—its own mantra for dealing with renewables and reducing emissions—and allow the Greens to sit on the government and come up with an amendment to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act which defies common sense and sends the worst possible message to industries everywhere.


This amendment to the act means that a thoroughly efficient, thoroughly renewable industry is being denied the opportunity to make use of its waste. This amendment to the act defies common sense. Why, in heaven's name, would a government want to spit on itself in this way? Obviously it is because of the Greens, who have never let a job, particularly a job in regional Australia, get in the way of ruining an industry. They have never done that and they are certainly running true to form today.


I, and the coalition, thoroughly support this motion. This amendment defies common sense and imagination. In my own electorate there is a forestry industry—it is not native, but it is a huge plantation forestry industry—so what kind of message does it send to that industry? The current act does not allow the harvesting of old-growth forests, or anything else for that matter, to be used for this renewable purpose. It can only be done with the waste product of normal harvesting. I cannot stress enough that if common sense is a measure, then it has gone out the window with this amendment. I do not care what electorate you are in. There would be more electorates in Tasmania that are going to suffer than anywhere else.


If we want people living in the regions at all, we certainly do not want a government run by the Greens. As I said earlier, the Greens have never let a job, particularly a job in regional Australia, stand in the way of destroying an industry. That is their sole purpose with this amendment. This amendment is designed to make a legal industry, acting in accordance with all the laws, regulations and forestry agreements, less profitable in the eyes of the Greens so there will be no industry at all. I do not know if it ever crossed the minds of any of the Greens to get out into regional Australia and see how important the forestry industry is there. I talk about my own electorate in this—I cannot help it, because we are full of renewables, whether agriculture, the plantation industry, the forestry industry or whatever. What kind of a message does it send to anyone in regional Australia when a government walks away from its own policy on renewables and walks away from the whole reason that it is bringing in a carbon tax, supposedly? That they are willing to put this amendment up underlines the fact that the whole carbon tax is a charade. Why in heaven's name would you put up a tax which you are saying is to reduce emissions and then turn around and move an amendment to a current act which will negate the ability to have renewables? I guess only this government would know, but certainly the Greens know.


I just hope that the mover of this motion has the backing of his fellow Independents. As to the member for New England, for example, I can tell you that 90 per cent of his constituents would find the lack of common sense in this amendment to the act to be totally reprehensible. I can tell you that they would in most of our electorates. If the Australian people fully realised what this amendment did, in terms of totally letting common sense go out of the window, to simply give the Greens a win, to try and destroy an industry, then I wonder what they would say. And I hope that, if anyone does vote for this amendment and against the motion, they have got the guts to go back to their electorate and say, 'I failed you, but I did it to stop the government losing an act.'

"Combet, Greg, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:38):  This of course is a debate concerning a motion moved by the member for Lyne to disallow the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 5). The government opposes the motion to disallow those regulations. The government and I, in my role as minister, have high regard for the member for Lyne and we have worked very closely with him in relation to the clean energy package that was announced in July last year. However, this is one area where we do take a different approach from the member for Lyne's to this specific issue. In implementing its plans for a clean energy future announced on 10 July last year, the government recognised the importance of ensuring that all of the elements of the plan work together to maximise the combined benefits for our society, our economy and our environment.


We had enormously wide-ranging discussions in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee over an extended period of time looking at all issues: emissions reductions in our economy, the nature of the renewable energy technologies that are deployed, the operation of renewable energy legislation and regulations in our economy and the incentives that they give, and a whole host of other matters. The regulation that is before the House that is the subject of the disallowance motion by the member for Lyne was a product of all of those considerations. So I emphasise that the government looks at this regulation as part of the overall clean energy package and the way in which the entirety of the package comes to operate. With that in mind, the government is determined to provide support for bioenergy investment while, at the same time, ensuring that native forests are afforded appropriate protection. It is very important when you look at the overall policy settings to try and get that balance right.


A carbon price will encourage the use of woody biomass as an energy source because the combustion of biomass for electricity generation or heat energy will not attract any liability under the carbon price mechanism. Therefore, generators that use biomass, including wood wastes from native forests, will become more cost-competitive relative to generators that use fossil fuels, which will be subject to the carbon price. Of course, this is part of the entire concept of carbon pricing: it is to put a market signal into the economy with respect to the combustion of and emissions from fossil fuels, such that there is a change in the relative position of different fuel sources and energy sources in our economy. That market signal is intended to direct investment towards lower emissions fuel sources, and we believe this regulation sits squarely within that context.


The carbon price will drive a fundamental transformation of our energy sector, with Treasury modelling estimating $100 billion worth of investment in renewable energy in the period to 2050—$100 billion worth. In the government's Clean Energy Future plan, the forestry industry also bears no liability for logging and liquid fuel emissions from forestry operations because they are not covered.


There are also some potential opportunities for the industry in relation to the Carbon Farming Initiative. Indeed, at the recent United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations dealing with the treatment of forest management, several months ago in South Africa, the international accounting rules were on a pathway to be altered in a way that would strengthen the incentives for opportunities under the Carbon Farming Initiative with respect to forest management.


Also, as part of our clean energy future plan, and giving effect to the agreement reached within the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, the government has amended the Renewable Energy Target regulations to exclude biomass—a subject of this debate, obviously—from native forests as an eligible renewable energy resource. This exclusion encompasses, to be clear, products, by-products and waste associated with or produced from clearing or harvesting of native forests. Native forests are important for biodiversity and store large amounts of carbon. Excluding electricity that is generated from native forest biomass from eligibility under the Renewable Energy Target scheme removes the potential for the Renewable Energy Target scheme to provide an incentive for the additional burning of native forest biomass for bioenergy, even where this burning is a secondary use. In the context of the benefits of bioenergy from the carbon price, the additional incentive from the renewable energy target could increase both the primary and the secondary purpose use of native forest wood, which could lead to unintended outcomes for biodiversity and the destruction of intact carbon stores.


The government recognises, of course, that investments may have been made in the past on the basis of the renewable energy target rules which previously did allow the eligibility of wood waste derived from native forests and has put in place transitional arrangements to preserve the previous rules for existing power stations that are already accredited to use native forest biomass as an energy source. In doing so, my department has consulted very extensively with industry to get those transitional arrangements right. To make that clear again: those power stations accredited for the use of this material under the Renewable Energy Target scheme have transitional arrangements put in place that continue to allow them to earn benefit from the investments they have historically made. The explanatory memoranda I published as minister in relation to these particular regulations contain, in regulation No. 4, in detail, those transitional arrangements. They are very important in respect of a number of the accredited generators under this scheme, and that is a very important point to note in the context of some of the contributions that have been made.


It is also important to recognise that renewable energy certificates can continue to be created from electricity generated from other wood waste and energy crops, such as oil mallee, woody weeds, agricultural wastes and wood from certain timber plantations. So there are products that can continue to generate renewable energy certificates. Nothing in relation to the regulations subject to the disallowance motion prohibits the use of biomass for the purposes for which it has been applied and has, under the standing situation, also generated renewable energy certificates. It can still be used, and incentives are changed by the carbon price coming into effect from 1 July.


While biomass derived from native forests is no longer recognised under this regulation as an eligible renewable energy source under the Renewable Energy Target scheme, those changes do not—as I made the point a moment ago—prohibit the use of this biomass for bioenergy. I would not want anyone to gain the impression from listening to the debate that that was not the case. This wood waste can continue to be used for the purposes for which it has previously applied. However, it would not, under these regulations, any longer generate renewable energy certificates. Bear in mind, once again, that there are quite important transitional arrangements put in place for generators that are accredited under the scheme.


The government considers that in its totality the clean energy future plan, including the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 5) that are the subject of this debate, achieves the right balance for our nation and for renewable energy providers to continue to move towards a cleaner energy future. We therefore do not support the motion that has been moved by the member for Lyne.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2012-03-19,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (16:48):  I support the motion for disallowance put forward by the member for Lyne in relation to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 5). I congratulate the member for bringing this very important motion to the attention of the House. The motion the member has put forward is in line with the coalition's forestry policy on wood biomass and renewable energy. It was stated in the lead-up to the 2010 election that an incoming coalition government would reintroduce amendments to the renewable energy legislation, allowing for wood biomass to benefit from energy incentives available to other renewable energy sources.


Our support for the motion before the House today is entirely consistent with that policy position. However, the government's position on this issue is intellectually inconsistent, politically inconsistent and also environmentally inconsistent with the government's stated objectives. There is one party that has been consistent, and that is the Greens. The Greens have been consistent in their approach to this issue, because it is consistent with the Greens approach to destroy jobs in the native hardwood timber industry throughout Australia. So that is a consistent approach. The Greens will never be satisfied until they shut down the entire native hardwood industry in this nation. So the motive of the Greens in pressuring the government to this position is well understood.


It concerns me that we have an example, once again, of this government doing the bidding of the Greens at the expense of all other considerations. As I just said, the position being taken by the government in this is intellectually, politically and environmentally inconsistent with its objectives. It concerns me that we have got to the stage where we have Labor members opposite not prepared to stand up for the blue-collar workers in the timber industry that they pretend to represent in this place. It should not surprise me, though, because we have at least 40 members opposite who rely on preferences from the Greens to get themselves re-elected. So while this may not necessarily be an issue for some of the metropolitan members of this place, it is certainly an issue for many of the regional members and it should be an issue for every one of the Labor Party members who pretend to represent blue-collar workers in this place—and I am talking about members right throughout Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and of course Western Australia.


I am concerned that the government's amendment and the source of the disallowance motion by the member for Lyne is clearly discriminatory to the native-forest-harvesting industry. It seeks to omit any biomass derived from native forests, be they privately or publicly held, from being eligible for renewable energy credits under the Renewable Energy Target scheme. I think the member for Calare belled the cat quite well in his presentation earlier today when he referred to the lack of common sense in the government's position, because this amendment put forward by the government simply provides an opportunity for the Greens to claim another victory over the Australian Labor Party. It is deliberately designed to harm the native hardwood timber industry at a time when that industry is facing many other challenges. I simply cannot find a rational reason for the government's approach.


I know the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency just tried to explain the government's position. I would have to suggest to the minister, in his presence, that his heart really was not in it. He tried to justify the exclusion of biomass from the native forest industry for renewable energy certificates. I listened intently, but I am not sure it was the most passionate defence of a government policy that I have ever heard from the minister.



Government members interjecting—




Mr CHESTER:
  It may be harsh, but it is true. In his heart, he knows that this amendment is simply indefensible, both from the perspective of his so-called clean energy package and from the perspective of a person who I generally believe cares about blue-collar workers and the future of the timber industry. I just could not get a sense that anything he said indicated that he was particularly passionate about the position his government was forcing him to adopt.


My concern is that some members are not listening to the debate as closely as they should on this particular issue and that the House does not quite realise that the use of biomass as a by-product from the native forestry industry is part of the economic model for the future viability of the timber industry. That is not to say that anyone is going out there suggesting—sorry, the Greens are going out there suggesting that people will go out and cut down forest for the pure purpose of generating electricity, but putting aside the Greens for a moment—this is anything other than a by-product or a waste product from the harvesting of native timber. There are already protections in place so that you cannot harness timber for the sole purpose of generating electricity and attract any of these renewable energy certificates. So that protection already exists in the legislation. It is simply not viable, and not particularly sensible, for anyone to go down that path anyway. Anyone in the hardwood timber industry is looking for the highest possible yield they can get from any given sawlog. The whole focus of the hardwood timber industry is trying to find value-adding opportunities where they can then get the maximum possible yield from an individual log. It would simply make no sense for them whatsoever to cut down trees for the sake of the biomass industry. The renewable energy certificates that were attached to the previous position of the clean energy package would assist in adding to the viability of the industry.


There is a classic example in my electorate with the timber mill in Heyfield. I do not have the exact figures—I am going from memory but I am pretty close to the mark. It processes about 150,000 cubic metres of regrowth ash from Victorian forests per year. It is a very big timber mill and is a viable operation on a world scale at 150,000 cubic metres. All its sawlogs are certified under the Australian forestry standard. There is a whole range of international and national standards that it meets. There are about 200 direct employees at the Heyfield mill. Sixty per cent of Heyfield's output of high-value hardwood is sold to Melbourne, to customers employing about 22,000 people. This is a very impressive operation at Heyfield. 


In addition to that high-value end of the operation, where it is selling a range of products into European markets and into Melbourne, it also has the capacity to generate enough sawdust to provide eight megawatts per annum in its power station at the site. It has the capacity to do it, but it has not proceeded with this plan in the past because the running costs and depreciation associated with the electricity generation would result in a cost of 19c per kilowatt hour. The renewable energy certificates would return approximately 4c per kilowatt hour, making the price of electricity 15c per kilowatt hour. At this stage, Heyfield is currently purchasing its brown coal power for about 8c per kilowatt hour. Currently, only one-third of the sawdust is used for heat and steam generation to kiln-dry the timber and the remaining two-thirds is sold to the potting mix market. There is an opportunity here, and I have provided a classic example at a very local level in my electorate, to help ensure the future viability of that operation—as I said, this is not going to be the only reason the Heyfield mill keeps going—if it is in a position to access the renewable energy certificates and go down this path. For the government to exclude this obvious form of renewable energy is, I think, ridiculous.



Government members interjecting—




Mr CHESTER:
  No, I did not suggest that the minister himself is ridiculous; I suggested that the government's position is ridiculous. I have said it is intellectually inconsistent with his government's own position on a whole range of other areas. It is clear to me that this is not about a climate change agenda but about fulfilling the Greens agenda for the native hardwood timber industry. With the waste classified as renewable energy, a business like the Heyfield timber mill can then compete more readily with exports. Without the change, business costs at this particular mill will be driven higher and the mill may then put itself in a position which is unsustainable.


I put it to the House that this is exactly what the Greens party wants out of this legislation. The Greens' political agenda is to shut down the native hardwood timber industry. I congratulate the member for Lyne for highlighting the inconsistency in the government's approach by bringing this motion of disallowance before the House because he raises a very important point. I am disappointed that there are not more members from regional parts of Australia from the Labor Party prepared to come in here and debate their case. They should come into this place and explain to me how the timber workers in their electorates will support them in this decision, because I am afraid that they will not. The timber workers I have met with want to remain viable in the industry into the future. I am very disappointed that members opposite are not prepared to come in here and defend their position. What we have seen is a very half-hearted attempt by the minister to defend their position, when I think in his heart of hearts he would prefer to be going down the path that the member for Lyne wishes to take the parliament here today.


In making that point, I encourage all of the crossbenchers to support the member for Lyne in his position, just as the coalition is supporting him in his position. I particularly encourage the member for New England because I believe he is a man who does understand an industry like the timber industry and how its future viability can hang by a thread. If we are going down this path, where the government is going to exclude them from a clear opportunity to be viable in the future, it would be disappointing if the member for New England were not to support his colleague the member for Lyne on this issue.


In the time I have left, I reflect briefly on a couple of points. The member for Lyne referred in his contribution to the current trade deficit in wood and paper products of about $2 billion per year. This is another example where, if we come into this place and are prepared to pass legislation, regulations or whatever it might be that discriminates against the native hardwood timber industry, we need to understand the downstream ramifications of doing that. We currently have in this country a deficit of about $2 billion in terms of the wood and paper products we bring in. There is legislation before the House now on whether we are going to take a stronger line in regard to products from illegal harvesting of timber in other nations. The point I am trying to make is that we have a sustainable hardwood timber industry in this nation which is heavily regulated, yet at the same time we are making it more difficult for that industry to compete with imported products.


This motion put forward by the member for Lyne and supported by the coalition will perhaps make it fractionally easier in the future for the hardwood timber industry in this nation to compete with these imported products from timber which is not necessarily harvested to anywhere near the same level of certification as our own timber industry is on a daily basis. Our industry already faces many challenges: resource security; cheap imported products; illegally harvested timber that I have just referred to; the carbon tax, which I believe will make it less competitive; and an extreme green element in the community pursuing policies like this which are completely inconsistent with the future interests of our community.


In the time I have left I want to mention a letter that the member for Lyne thoughtfully distributed to all members. In that letter he attached a document signed by 49 recognised forestry scientists and leading forestry practitioners. I know that members receive a lot of correspondence but, in a free plug to the member for Lyne, if you can find in your files this letter with the document signed by 49 forestry scientists, dig it out. Do yourself a favour, as Molly Meldrum would say, and get the letter out and actually read what they have to say, because this letter is probably one of the most compelling bits of evidence that you will see in this place for some time.




Mr Hunt:
  Careful!




Mr CHESTER:
  No. I say that with all sincerity because I think it strongly makes the case, in a very succinct way, for members who perhaps are not necessarily that familiar with the hardwood timber industry. It explains what is at stake here. So I congratulate the member for Lyne for moving this motion for disallowance. I condemn the Australian Greens party in particular for continuing to pursue this great myth that in Australia we are down to our last tree and that the chainsaws are out to get that as well. We have a very sustainable hardwood timber industry in this nation. It is worth fighting for, and I congratulate members on this side of the House who are prepared to stand up and fight for the timber industry today. What concerns me about the Australian Greens is that that party can only survive when they are fighting to save something. As soon as they save one coupe in my electorate you will have a spokesperson for the environmental movement out there saying, 'That's a good start but now we need something else.' They are never satisfied. The Australian Greens are never satisfied because they survive as a protest party that have to be saving something.


When it comes to the Australian timber industry, it is time for all members who care about the future of blue-collar workers and regional communities to say, 'Enough is enough.' We have an extensive reserve network in this nation and we have a sustainable hardwood timber industry that is worth fighting for. So I encourage those members opposite to support the member for Lyne and, in particular, I encourage members of the crossbenches to support their colleague in this motion for disallowance. Do the right thing by the Australian timber industry and, most importantly, do the right thing by the Australian timber industry workers and their families who depend on this place and the members in this place to finally stand up for workers and give regional communities a chance.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-03-19,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:03):  I accept the comments made by the member for Lyne earlier that this disallowance motion arose from members and employers in his electorate approaching him with a situation where perhaps there was a small amount of waste associated with their operations that they thought could be turned into renewable energy. But this is much bigger than that. This is a regulation that will not apply simply to the odd employer in the electorate of the member for Lyne; it will apply right across the country. It goes to the heart of the economics of chopping down trees and burning them and counting that as renewable energy.


Firstly, there is nothing stopping the business in the electorate of the member for Lyne, or businesses anywhere else, from putting that material, if it is genuine waste material, to a use that generates energy, but they should not be paid for it. That is fundamentally the question. To quote Judith Ajani, the point about the economics of this that is overlooked in all the contributions we have heard so far is that 'sawn timber stopped driving Australia’s native forest logging in the 1980s and woodchip exports are no longer driving native forest logging'. We have a situation where the export market for woodchips is collapsing. As I said, for hardwood we have had that general shift in the whole economics of the industry away from native forests to plantations.


The only way we could continue the perverse action of burning our native forests and counting that as renewable energy is if people are given a perverse subsidy, and that is what the motion by the member for Lyne would do. It would enable these operators and any other operator who wants to enter the market, and I will come to that shortly, to get paid for what is fundamentally an environmentally and economically unsustainable industry. We are at the point where those two are converging. It has been recognised that this is environmentally and economically unsustainable. Of course, the people who want to make money out of burning down forests and counting it as renewable energy are looking for a lifeline. This motion gives them that lifeline and that is why they are lining up behind it, together with the opposition.


It will be possible for up to 50 per cent of the value of a project to be counted as renewable energy if this regulation is not allowed to stand. It is important to focus on and tackle the myth that it is somehow about some small proportion of waste product. I have heard the member for Lyne and others say that the high-value rules will address that. That is economically simply not the case. It is very possible to have the vast majority of an operation going into pulp or chips to be burnt for waste, to have the vast majority by volume, and still have the majority of value being done through the high value, through the hardwood. For example, the point that the Australian Forest and Climate Alliance make in the letter that they have circulated is that in East Gippsland pulp logs are sold for a royalty as low as 11c a tonne with the top quality regrowth pulp logs being sold for about $2.50. With that value in balance it is very easy to still have a majority of value at the high end, as the member for Lyne puts it, but the majority of the volume would still come from cutting down forests and burning them for renewable energy. That is what this regulation will stop.


It is not only a perverse economic incentive but a perverse environmental incentive, because we will be burning what are recognised as some of the world's most carbon dense forests. That is why some have been led to speculate that this could in fact increase greenhouse gas emissions. As we know—and this is happening in Tasmania and would be allowed to continue to happen if this regulation is not allowed to stand—when you burn high quality carbon stores and carbon dense stores like our native forests it takes a long time to replace that. That is why the plan that this regulation seeks to forestall has been described by Andrew Mackintosh, the Associate Director of the ANU Centre for Climate Law and Policy, as 'Pythonesque'. He says that it is climate policy plan that is incapable of lowering emissions but that could increase them, that will result in no net gain in the amount of renewable electricity generated and that will cost taxpayers millions per year.


We know that there are people waiting to get a subsidy to burn large parts of the Tasmanian forests and count that as renewable energy. We know that because the letter that was referred to by the member for Gippsland is one of the most astounding pieces of evidence to ever have been put before the parliament. It is co-signed by a number of people, including some from the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania. Of course they want this. They are going to get an economic benefit out of it. But we know that it is not going to impact just Tasmania. We know that in Western Australia, as reported in the Australian last week, some Karri trees—Western Australia's tallest and among the world's tallest—are already classified as forest waste and turned into woodchips for a market that no longer wants them. Instead of saying that this is madness and that is a market that should be phased out, this motion will give that industry a lifeline and allow those Karri trees to continue to be burned.


It is simple economics. If you give people a subsidy for something, you will create an industry around it. While I accept that the member for Lyne is acting on the basis of people within his electorate coming to him, there are people right across this country who are rubbing their hands at the prospect of another subsidy, because it will make projects viable that would otherwise have been unviable because the economics and the environment were heading in the same direction. We should not allow the continued logging of high conservation value forest. We should not allow threats to habitats of native species. We should not further undermine biodiversity in areas that are already under stress.


One point that is also critical for me is that, as the minister referred to, this was something in the Clean Energy Future package, which came out of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. It is on page 129 of the document. It says: 


The Renewable Energy Target regulations will be amended to exclude biomass from native forest as an eligible renewable energy resource. This includes products, by-products and waste associated with or produced from clearing or harvesting of native forests, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements for existing accredited power stations.


It was there in the deal. We had some talk before about respecting the work of parliamentary committees. That parliamentary committee did some outstanding work. People with differing points of view found a consensus. There are things in that document that if I personally was writing the package would not have agreed to. I would not have agreed to extensive sandbagging of polluting industries. We had a different view on petrol. But the Greens have not come back in here and said, 'We didn't like that bit of the deal, so we're now going to seek to carve bits out.' That is an important principle in this parliament, where we all often come to agreements that are not exactly as we would like but that arise out of people with differing points of view talking and agreeing on what is common. When we do that, we should stick with it. That is why I cannot support the motion of the member for Lyne.

",HoR,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Disallowance</title>,MOTIONS,25,2
"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (17:12):  It gives me great pleasure to support the disallowance motion moved by the member for Lyne. I do so for three reasons. Firstly, because this motion moved by the member for Lyne is about avoiding perverse effects. There has been much discussion about perverse effects but there are some very basic facts for those who care about emissions and the level of greenhouse emissions arising from Australia's economic activity to consider here. Secondly, there is deep, strong, credible and widespread support for the disallowance of this motion from those who care about our overall emissions level and those who care about the sustainable operation of an industry that has widespread support around Australia. Thirdly, this motion is also about electricity prices and ensuring that we do our best to reduce the average electricity price paid around Australia. For all of those reasons, the coalition and I in particular strongly support the continued use of woody biomass, where it is in waste form, as part of the Renewable Energy Target and as a source of credits for renewable energy credits.


Let me begin with the issue of perverse effects. Much has been made in this debate of the letter to the member for Lyne from the 49 recognised forestry scientists and leading forest practitioners. I want to quote one element. I note that the signatories represent universities from around the country, including Murdoch University, the University of Melbourne and many others, including many of the highest quality institutions in the country. It is not a group which would be assumed naturally to support one side or the other of parliament. It is a group to which enormous weight must be given. In my judgement, the key phrase in the letter, relating to the perverse effects of not using wood waste from the harvesting of native forests, is: 'When not used for biomass fuel, processing residues are often distributed on landscapes or buried and burnt near mills where, like harvest residues left on the landscape, they decompose to greenhouse gases without any greenhouse gas mitigation benefit. This misses the opportunity to provide energy for society, increasing our dependence on alternative energy sources, including fossil fuels, or more expensive renewable energy sources.' Within that one paragraph are two critical facts: firstly, much of this woody biomass or wood waste—I use the term 'wood waste' deliberately—is allowed to decompose by being turned into landfill, which in turn decomposes, not just to methane, but to other gases with high greenhouse potential. The net effect of not allowing the current practice to continue is that global emissions and Australia's emissions will go up, because a waste product is allowed to decompose instead of being utilised—and we have not even got to the economics of it. There is no offset, no mitigation and no avoidance of emissions; it adds to emissions. This, by the way, is one of the reasons that the use of woody biomass is fundamental to renewable energy programs right across Europe.


It is also clear, both from practice and from the work of the 49 foresters, that if it is not sent to landfill this waste wood would be burnt as a by-product, being treated and disposed of, to no electrical or societal benefit. Again, there would be a high level of emissions but no benefit from avoided emissions from other activities. In that respect, we see here a clearly perverse effect in relation to Australia's overall emissions and global overall emissions. That is not my evidence; that is the evidence of 49 independent scientists from around the country, including some of the most pre-eminent forest and carbon scientists in Australia, if not the Southern Hemisphere.


It has been the position of both sides of parliament until now that using wood waste was a desired outcome, because it avoids the problem of landfill and therefore avoids the perverse effect of emissions being generated with no positive benefit. But let us look at support, firstly, for industry. The 1,200 members of the Institute of Foresters of Australia, the IFA, an organisation committed to sustainable forest management, support the use of native forest residues for energy regeneration. These are residues; they are waste. They are things that would otherwise give off emissions if they were not used properly. Secondly, as has been noted, 49 eminent Australian forest scientists have provided their weight in supporting the continued use of native forest residues through the renewable energy target, which was a bipartisan position until July of last year. Thirdly, the members of the government's own committee that supported Seeing the Forest Through the Trees, the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, all agreed. Those committee members were the member for Lyons, who was the chair, the member for Bass, the member for Corangamite and the member for McEwen. They all supported the continued use of native forest waste or residue as a component for generating renewable energy credits under the renewable energy target. Those four government members of the committee concluded, on the same day this change of regulation was introduced by the government, that the regulation was not justified. If there could be a greater humiliation for the government than there has been on this policy issue, it is hard to imagine. The government's own members, who were specifically tasked to inquire in detail did not believe it. They did not believe their minister. They did not believe all those who would push this view. It is a simple test for those members: do you stand for your beliefs and findings and will you vote against the decision of the government to ban the very thing that you said was desirable?


Multiple environment groups around the world have supported the use of biomass waste and woody biomass residue. The World Wildlife Fund in concert with the European Biomass Association has called for 15 per cent of energy generation in OECD countries to be generated from the use of biomass by 2020. This is not a modest figure; this makes what occurs in Australia seem almost irrelevant. It goes further. When you look right across the European landscape, you see something even larger. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated in its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007:


In the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre or energy from the forest—


and I underline energy—


will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit.


To complete the package, the Clean Energy Council in Australia has said:


[It] believes the exclusion of native forest biomass as an eligible renewable energy resource under the RET is an example of the lack of understanding and support needed to harness the full potential of bioenergy resources in Australia.


Wherever you go in Europe you will see biomass used—for example, Belgium's target for 2020 is 13 per cent; biomass contributes one-third of that. The EU 'counts on heat and power from biomass to play a critical role in meeting its ""202020"" targets'. That is, 20 per cent by 2020. So there we go. That is the view around the world, whether it is in science, in industry, or in the ALP in this country. Up until a few short months ago, and even now, its four leading members in this space all supported the continued practice of using waste rather than burning waste or pushing it into landfill where it will produce methane with a greenhouse warming potential of over 20 times that of CO2. If you head to Europe and the IPCC you will see that the support for this practice could not be stronger.


When it is clear that there is a perverse effect and that there is overwhelming support, the last reason is a very simple one. It is about lower electricity prices. What this motion is really about at its heart of hearts is that it was designed, firstly, to do its best to help destroy an industry—and there are many members on both sides of this chamber who understand that. But even more so it says, 'We know that there are forms of renewable energy which are too high a cost to be justified if wood residue is able to go in there; therefore, we want to drive up the average cost of electricity to try to get to those highest cost forms of renewable energy.'


I have supported, believed in, committed to and engaged in helping to push through—I even negotiated with the current minister, and I thank him for that—the 20 per cent renewable energy target. There are those who are critical of it; I am guilty as sin of supporting it. But it was not about finding the highest cost for renewable energy; it was about finding the lowest cost for renewable energy. If we are moving into that space, we need to do it on the lowest cost basis. I think every member of this House knows this motion of the government's which has sought to be disallowed by the work of the member for Lyne is going to drive up electricity prices rather than drive them down. For that they should be condemned. For all of those reasons, it gives me great pleasure to support with every fibre of my being the disallowance motion of the member for Lyne.

"Windsor, Tony, MP",Ind.,2012-03-19,"



Mr WINDSOR
 (New England) (17:24):  I will speak only briefly to the motion before the House. I agree with the general substance of what the member for Lyne has suggested and I have listened with interest to other members in the House. I agree with the substance of what has been said by those who are going to support this. If it were in another form, I would be voting for it.


The reason that I am not supporting the member for Lyne's disallowance motion is that I feel compelled to support the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee agreement from whence this regulation has come. It is on those grounds that I cannot support it. I feel that I made an agreement. I heard from my office the member for Melbourne speak some moments ago. There are parts of that agreement that he disagrees with, there are parts that I disagree with, and I am sure there are parts that the minister at the table disagrees with on a personal level. But it was an agreement that was reached for the longer term benefit of what we believe our community requires through the various arrangements in the clean energy suite of legislation.


So even though I do not disagree with what the member for Lyne is saying, I find that because of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee agreement I am unable to support his motion. If it were introduced in another form—and a few members have mentioned the parliamentary committee that has looked at this—I would look very seriously at supporting it. But, as I said, I cannot support the disallowance of the regulation which was part of the agreement that was reached.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (17:27):  I must say that I am disappointed that the member for New England cannot support this disallowance motion because I think that it is very much in the national interest. Because we still have issues with what the carbon tax will do to the dairy industry and the meat industry, I would have hoped that the Independents would have been doing all they could to ensure especially rural and regional Australia are not severely disadvantaged by these bills. I would have thought that there would have been the ability for the member for New England to support the member for Lyne on this motion, because I feel it is going to be extremely difficult for the committee to do anything.


The committee, of which I was a member, produced the report Seeing the forest through the trees: inquiry into the future of the Australian forestry industry. As a new member of parliament, this is really the first committee report that I have been involved in. In many ways it was incredibly refreshing because the bipartisan way the members of the committee went about producing this report was something that should be commended. It shows that all members can work together to achieve a report that everybody agrees on. I take this opportunity to commend the chair, Dick Adams, for the fine job he did in chairing the committee while we went about this report, the deputy chair, Alby Schultz, and the member for Corangamite, Mr Cheeseman. We also had a member from Tasmania in Geoff Lyons. We also had George Christensen, Rob Mitchell, Tony Crook and me. We did a lot of work. We visited a lot of places. We also took evidence here in Canberra from a lot of people. One of the things that struck me throughout the hearings was that those on all sides were prepared to ask questions on all types of evidence, and we were then able to bring that all together and agree on recommendations. We covered diverse issues in this report, including managed investment schemes. I would recommend that all members of the House look at the committee's recommendations on managed investment schemes, because I think they show a very good way forward.


I think everyone on the committee was struck by the evidence we received on the use of forestry biomass. I am pretty sure that we took that evidence on a Wednesday afternoon, when constituents of the member for Lyne and members of the forestry industry appeared before us. We asked about what would happen with the off-cuts from native timber, given that the approach seemed to be that those off-cuts would not be able to be used for biomass. We were told that the majority of it would be put into landfill and that, over time, as it decays, it lets off nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is one of the most harmful CO2 gases. Here we were, looking at a piece of legislation that is meant to reduce CO2 emissions, yet by its very nature it was actually going to increase it.



Mr Windsor interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  That is the evidence that we heard. I would be happy to provide that evidence to the member for New England. We were all struck by the absurdity of what will occur unless we can get the parliament to agree to this disallowance motion.


I recommend that honourable members and anyone who has an interest in this matter look at this report, Seeing the forest through the trees, particularly chapter 7, which addresses using forestry biomass. It is quite a detailed chapter and it outlines the type of evidence that we heard. For instance, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry told us:


Biofuels and bioenergy can play an important role in expanding the range of renewable energy sources available in Australia. Australian state and territory governments have adopted comprehensive frameworks to ensure that environmentally responsible forest management practices underpin the use of wood residues for bioenergy.


So there are good practices in place. We also heard from Bioenergy Australia, who said:


During the energy recovery process, the carbon dioxide bound in the biomass is released to the atmosphere. Bioenergy is regarded as renewable, when the biomass resource consumed in the energy conversion process is replenished by the growth of an equivalent amount of biomass. Under the Kyoto Protocol bioenergy is regarded as carbon dioxide neutral.


The Institute of Foresters of Australia on cogeneration stated:


With most mills lucky to recover 40% of log volume, generating power using mill residue as a fuel source creates two economic solutions to what would otherwise be expenses. An expensive aspect of processing in the softwood industry is seasoning and drying, using kilns. The heat generated in cogeneration can be used to drive seasoning plants while augmenting power supplies.


We also visited my electorate and met with Mr Andrew Lang of SMARTimbers Cooperative in Lismore. Andrew is very much an expert in this area and is leading the way. He was able to give us a small demonstration of how native timber can be used to generate renewable energy. He told us what occurs in northern Europe:


The pattern in the Scandinavian countries is to use the heat energy for district heating (and for district cooling in summer). In Brazil and India the heat energy is commonly used by the generating industry, as well as some of the electricity.


So it is common practice in particular in Europe and it is a growing practice in India and Brazil. Other countries in the world are using this source of renewable energy, so it seems absurd and ridiculous that we would not do the same.


Australian Forest Growers suggested that funding be made available for:


… research, development and extension into biofuel, bioenergy and Biochar technology, including upscaling the technology to a commercial scale. This upscaling must include options for regionally based utilisation of biomass at sufficient scale to be economically viable yet small enough to be effectively utilised locally.


They would like to see more funding put into this area, because they see enormous long-term benefits in it. So it is not just a matter of renewable energy credits being available; if we can get the technology right we can use it a lot more, particularly in regional areas, because it can be done on such a scale that regional areas can capitalise on it.


As outlined in its report, the committee believes that bioenergy from the forestry industry presents a promising opportunity. The report states:


Using the principle of cogeneration, it is also possible to ensure that as much energy as possible is captured and used from the use of biomass.


…   …   …


As noted above, there remains a significant amount of work to be done by the industry, in order to identify the barriers to expansion of bioenergy, and to ensure that a secure fuel supply is maintained.


The report further states:


As for the question of native forest waste products being used to produce energy, the Committee is aware that recent policy change is yet to be fully implemented.


We were not quite sure which way the government would end up going on this issue. The committee then recommended that it was of the view that:


… under any version of the RET (or similar scheme), bioenergy sourced from native forest biomass should continue to qualify as renewable energy, where it is a true waste product and does not become a driver for harvesting for native forests.


All sides of the committee, once again, were of the view that:


… under any version of the RET (or similar scheme), bioenergy sourced from native forest biomass should continue to qualify as renewable energy …


That is the bipartisan report's recommendation and is spelled out in particular in recommendations 15 and 16 of the report. I ask all members to look at those recommendations.


I wish that the member for New England could be right in that there would be a way, other than this disallowance motion, for this to be brought into the parliament. The sad thing is that I cannot see a way forward. My view is that all members of this committee put these recommendations on the table and this was as far as all members could go. The hope was that this would lead to a very sensible approach and, in particular, might support the member for Lyne in bringing forward this disallowance motion. So, if there is another way forward, we on this side would like to hear about it and I think the committee would love to hear about it. My worry is that politics will get in the way and that we will not be able to achieve what will be a very sensible outcome.


I do not always agree with the member for Lyne and I do not always agree with the member for New England but on this issue it would be very good if they could put their heads together and come up with a way where we could ensure that common sense did prevail, because at the moment it is not going to prevail. There are a lot of people especially in rural and regional areas who are looking at this as a way forward. It enables those people who like to put plantations on their agricultural land to use the wood waste from those so that it adds to the income of family farmers. If the member for New England would like to talk to Andrew Lang I am sure he would be glad to show him around and show him the innovative work that he is doing in this area in adding to his farm income by using this and trying to develop it as a second income to his family farm.



Mr Windsor interjecting—




Mr TEHAN:
  It does not make the economics add up. If he can get the RECs it does. That is the important point on this. I would like to see a common-sense way forward on this. The last thing we want to see is this timber end up in landfill. I will conclude there. I am disappointed that it looks like we will not get a common-sense outcome on what I think is a very sensible proposal put forward by the member for Lyne. I would like to take the time once again to commend my fellow committee members who put forward this report. It was a very good bipartisan report and I call on the government to look at the recommendations in it and to act upon them.



The SPEAKER:  The question before the chair is that the motion be agreed to.



The SPEAKER:  In accordance with the principle that decisions should not be taken except by a majority and the principle that legislation should be left in its original form, my casting vote is for the noes.

 (Tangney) (17:55):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Defence Sub-Committee visit to the Middle East Area of Operations: report of the delegation to the MEAO 14 to 18 May 2011.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Dr JENSEN:
  by leave—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I have pleasure in presenting the report of the committee's delegation to the Middle East Area of Operations.


However, before I speak to this report, firstly let me state how saddened I was to hear of the recent deaths of 16 Afghan civilians, including nine young children. Such loss of innocent life is tragic and unthinkable. Having met Afghan leaders during our delegation's visit, I know how close these small communities are and I express my deepest sympathies for the surviving family and village members at this time. It is my fervent wish that the actions of one person will not undermine the excellent work that has been done to date in enabling Afghan, Australian and other country personnel to work together in the interests of a positive future.


The report I table today presents the findings of the committee's delegation to the Middle East Area of Operations—also called the MEAO—which took place from 14 to 18 May 2011. The delegation consisted of Senator Mark Furner as leader, me, Ms Gai Brodtmann, the member for Canberra, and Mr Stuart Robert, the member for Fadden. We were accompanied by the committee's defence adviser, then Lieutenant-Colonel, now Colonel, Stuart Kenny, CSC.


The aim of the delegation was threefold:


First, to demonstrate the parliament's strong bipartisan support for Australian personnel deployed on these demanding operations;


Second, to meet with key ADF personnel, Australian government agency personnel, and key Afghan leaders in order to review the current situation in Afghanistan; and,


Third, to enable committee members to be better positioned to review Australian defence and foreign policy.


The delegation undertook a comprehensive itinerary which enabled us to visit many of the locations where ADF and other Australian personnel are operating.


The delegation notes that, despite the demanding operational tempo faced by all Australians working in this region, we were warmly received and professionally briefed at each location.


The delegation also had the privilege of attending a Shura with local Afghan leaders and a roundtable with Afghan members of parliament. Of note, this was the first formal meeting between Afghan parliamentarians and an Australian parliamentary delegation.


The delegation concluded the visit optimistic about the prospects for the success of the mission in the MEAO, particularly in Afghanistan. The delegation observed that significant progress has been achieved for the Afghan people as a direct result of operations in this country over the past decade. I would like to mention a few concrete examples of the progress that has been achieved:


First, school enrolment has grown from 900,000 in 2002 to 7.3 million in 2009, with the percentage of girls attending school increasing from virtually nil to 37 per cent over this period;


Second, the number of teachers has increased eightfold from 2002 to 2008, and 29 per cent of teachers are now female;


Third, more than 4,480 schools have been established since 2002 and around 85 per cent of the Afghan people now have a healthcare facility in their local area. This contrasts with only 10 per cent having had a local healthcare facility in 2002;


Fourth, 1.6 million Afghans who now have access to safe drinking water and 130,000 Afghans can now access power; 


Fifth, 1,231 kilometres of roads have been constructed, connecting literally hundreds of villages to district centres and markets;


Sixth, 3.7 million employment days have been provided to local skilled and unskilled Afghans during the construction of infrastructure projects; and


Seventh, the country as a whole is becoming less dependent on growing poppies, which now constitutes just five per cent of the legal economy.


Australia has been integral to these improvements, and it is essential we continue this support. 


Afghan leaders have expressed concern for the future, particularly during the transition period as Australia and other countries draw down and eventually depart. The impact of this transition on the ability to continue to develop civil capacity and the progress made to date for women were identified as specific concerns by local leaders. These issues will need to be closely managed during the transition period.


Finally, I would like to note the delegation was very impressed by the dedication, pride and professionalism of the Australian personnel in the MEAO, many of whom are working in challenging environmental and social conditions. 


I particularly wish to express my thanks to Mr Paul Foley, the Australian Ambassador to Afghanistan; Major General Angus Campbell AM, then the Australian National Commander in the MEAO; Colonel Andrew Maclean, then Chief of Staff, Headquarters Joint Task Force 633; Lieutenant Colonel (now Colonel) Stuart Kenny, then Defence Adviser to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade; and the personal security detail from 2 Commando Regiment who ensured our safety during the visit.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (20:00):  I very strongly support the motion put forward by the Leader of the Opposition earlier today in relation to the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011. The wild rivers bill was first introduced on 8 February 2010. It is now over two years later. There have been five separate committee inquiries into this bill. The first inquiry was held by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on 25 February 2010. Then it went to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics in November 2010. There was a further Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry in March 2011 and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry held an inquiry which commenced on 15 September 2010—and I know that in that case committee members were asking why this had been put to them and complaining that, in their view, it was an absolute waste of the committee's time and absolutely frivolous. It then went to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs on 24 November. This is for a bill which is only five pages in its entirety.


All we are asking in this bill is for Indigenous Australians in Cape York to have the opportunity to make decisions about land of which they have been custodians for the last 40,000 years or more. But, in an effort to avoid going to a vote, the government continues to just dump it into one committee after another. It shows you the absolute lack of respect they have for Indigenous Australians. I often see the Leader of the House standing in here beating his chest about the number of pieces of legislation the government has got through this parliament. But it is interesting to note that, if anything comes up that they are not likely to get support for, they do not put it to the vote—I refer to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Offshore Processing and Other Measures) Bill 2011. We are still waiting for that to be reintroduced into the parliament, as we are with the wild rivers bill. 


The sad thing is that this is having a profound impact on people in Cape York, both Indigenous people and non-Indigenous people. This legislation was originally bulldozed through by the state government. They clearly did it because they were totally beholden to the Greens through the Wilderness Society and to shore up the exchange of preferences, particularly in the south-east corner of Queensland. We are seeing exactly the same thing from this current government. They are doing exactly the same thing. It does not matter what the impact is on the people living in this area. They do not give any consideration to the fact that these people have managed their own country now, as I said, for some 40,000 years. They have decided that what they need to do is introduce some sort of a motherhood policy which will do nothing more than patronise the local Indigenous population. 


I can assure you that the Cape York community generally is absolutely outraged by what is happening here insomuch as it is robbing them of the opportunity to speak on the future of their own country. It is robbing them of the opportunity to consider economic futures for their children. Over the last couple of decades, there has been a real campaign, a real push, to enable Indigenous people to start to recover some of their own country and it has been very successful. Unfortunately, some of the largest leaseholders in Cape York are now in a position where they have no capacity whatsoever to make decisions in relation to the land—because of a grubby deal between the Wilderness Society and the state and federal Labor governments. 


Another recent impact of this wild rivers legislation was the shelving of Cape Alumina's $1.2 billion bauxite mine at Pisolite Hills in Cape York. It had to be shelved as a result of the Wenlock River being declared a wild river. This project would have created about 1,700 jobs and 1,300 of those jobs would have been in Far North Queensland. Many of those jobs would have been in Marpuna, or Old Mapoon, a community north of Weipa. The project was also going to see the creation of a village in the area. Once the mining lease had been completed, the intention was for that village to be handed over to the local people as a lodge. That opportunity has been taken away from these people. This community, like many others in Cape York, have had to struggle for any sort of employment opportunities. It is an absolute disgrace that this government continue to treat Indigenous people in the manner in which they have been. We need to bring the bill on without any further delay.


In recent times, we have seen individuals from both state and federal governments going to Cape York and looking at buying support, if you like, through the rangers program. It is a bit like the old days of baubles and beads, where they offer a number of financial incentives to get individual family groups to come in behind them and support them, or to sign letters of support, and they are offered a whole range of financial incentives to do so. It is very cynical and it is creating a very false impression that there is much broader support for this legislation.


This motion is all about giving traditional people in Cape York an opportunity of having a say in their own future. It is not about throwing the legislation out. I hope that that will happen after this Saturday, 24 March. I hope and expect with a new LNP government in Queensland that the new Premier Campbell Newman and the very good state government representative David Kempton will keep their promise to the Indigenous people and to all Cape York people that they will throw out the wild rivers legislation and give the opportunity back to the local people to make decisions in relation to their own future and to be part of their own land.


They will also make sure that those people who have been engaged as wild rivers rangers will go into the national parks that have been acquired by the state government over an extended period of time—and operated without any management plans and of course without any staff. There will be lots of opportunities for these rangers to hone their skills and to start to control their land. Up until now, the management has been tokenistic on the part of both state and federal governments.


In conclusion, I think the state government will turf out the wild rivers legislation after 24 March. But we need the opportunity of bringing on the vote here before this parliamentary session is completed. I think it is only fair that we have the parliament make a decision on whether we can be committed to giving some level of support to Indigenous people and to do it in a transparent and practical way rather than the tokenism that we have seen in relation to Indigenous policy that has come out of this Labor government up until now.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (20:11):  The member for Leichhardt referred to false impressions. If there is any false impression, it is being generated by those opposite. Quite frankly, it is outrageous that they suggest that it is because of the substance of the issue, that we have a problem with the way they have attempted to pass what they are proposing. On three occasions changes have been made by those opposite to this bill. All have been referred to other committees for consideration. This bill has been brought forward three separate times since February. Even though the Leader of the Opposition is quick to point out there have been five separate committee inquiries into this bill, he does not mention that they have changed the legislation on three separate occasions.


The government cannot support the Leader of the Opposition's motion because what is being proposed is plagued with a variety of drafting problems, as the Chief Government Whip indicated today, and with a series of provisional changes that all fail to simply address the real barriers to economic development in Cape York and western Queensland. Also, it is a bit churlish for the member for Leichhardt to suggest that nothing has been done to advance the issues of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people when we have made significant commitments and harnessed all levels of government. Only a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister delivered an update to our Closing the Gap strategy, which attempts to get all levels of government, regardless of politics, focused on these issues.


We are not going to have the types of problems that have been experienced as a result of those opposite being unable to put forward a sturdy bill to this place, and we are not going to have that dressed up as some sort of indifference to the issues of the people we are seeking to help. Each version of the bill has had different content and different clauses from those opposite, and each attempt has been riddled with serious drafting problems which have required close scrutiny. The Leader of the Opposition would have the people of Australia believe that this bill has been buried because of institutional go-slow. Every time a different version has come forward, it has to come up for debate.


Frankly, sitting on the Selection Committee I have seen firsthand the abuse of the committee's process. The standing orders introduced to this place subsequent to the 2010 election were designed to change the way we operate and to allow for greater scrutiny of bills. I for one am very supportive of that and I know there are others who are supportive of it. But you cannot have a situation where every single piece of legislation that is being proposed is referred to a parliamentary committee. This is not being done for the sake of scrutiny. This is being done as a deliberate act of vandalism by those opposite, who seek to frustrate the legislative timetable and process, all in an attempt to demonstrate—mistakenly, when you look at our record of getting legislation through—that the House is not working and not getting legislation through or that there are delays when, frankly, that is not the case.


For instance, another piece of legislation—the R 18+ video games classification legislation—was successfully passed through the House after 10 years of study and 54,000 public submissions—probably the greatest number of submissions received on a piece of legislation. The opposition had sought to refer that legislation to a committee yet again. After consultation with all the attorneys-general in the country, after going through COAG, after repeated studies and committee inquiries, at the last minute being referred again by the opposition. The only reason they relented was the realisation that this had been examined to the nth degree. They recognised—and I credit them for it—that it had been over-examined, and it had been allowed to be debated on the floor of the House.


Again, we have a situation where these processes are being abused. The consequence of this is that, if legislation such as we are debating now is proposed, it cannot be given adequate time because of the backlog of legislation inquiries being undertaken by the various committees. I see this, for instance, in the Standing Committee on Infrastructure And Communications, of which I am a member, where a number of bills are being rolled in for inquiry after inquiry after inquiry. I noted a few weeks ago that the member for Kennedy had circulated a letter raising his concern about resourcing of the Parliamentary Library—a serious issue. But what the member for Kennedy did not mention in his letter—and this is not a criticism of him, but it was noteworthy—was this: if committee workloads suddenly go through the roof because those opposite decide, not in the interest of scrutiny but of parliamentary tactics, to refer every single piece of legislation to committee, then the resources of the House come under pressure. We will see more and more of the type of things the member for Kennedy raised.


What are we supposed to do? Those opposite want to indulge in parliamentary tactics and force these bills through to committee. We are expected to tolerate that. This is an abuse of the process and we are seeing it here today, with those opposite chopping and changing their minds, unable to come up with the right clauses, unable to put a competent bill forward and then trying to mistakenly, wrongfully and improperly—



An opposition member:  You're going to need a shower after this speech tonight!



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Chief Opposition Whip was heard in silence and the member for Chifley will be afforded the same courtesy.




Mr HUSIC:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It just comes with the territory. They cannot stand the heat of criticism of anything that they do, but we have to cop the type of contribution made by the member for Leichhardt tonight—and we are also forced to cop an abuse of the Selection Committee process and not say anything about it.


I think it is important that we find balance. I have absolutely no problem with the opposition referring bills that it believes need scrutiny. I think it is a good process and I think it is what we should do. But bear in mind also that the House of review is another place. This is the House that instigates the bulk of legislation and, more often than not, it is subject to public consultation. People have an opportunity to have their say. We, as House of Representatives members, have constituencies where we are required to deal with those very real concerns in a way that the representatives in that other place are not. We have to be mindful of balancing our representational role and our role in review. That is the problem that we have: all this legislation is being put through to committees for inquiry and it is putting a strain on the operations of this place.


From seeing the contributions of the opposition's representatives on Selection Committee, I might add that moderation has started to occur in recent times. We do not know if this is going to be something long lasting or if it is just a pause in the approach undertaken by those opposite. I certainly hope that it will be a fundamental change in the approach used by those opposite because the type of arrangement we have confronted to date is not sustainable.


Returning to the bill, I have discussed the abuse of the Selection Committee process by sending every bill through to committee without identifying upfront any of the bill's faults or strengths or any of the issues those opposite might actually want to inquire about. The first version of the bill we are debating was considered in February 2010 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, which recommended it not be passed. The second version was introduced in November 2010 in this House and in February last year in the Senate. Each time, it was found that these were just rehashes of the bill and they simply did not cut the mustard. If we are going to undertake these considerations we should do so in a thorough way, but not in the way that is being proposed here today.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (20:21):  In this sorry debate tonight, we see a government giving appalling explanations for their delay on the wild rivers legislation. We see these four Labor members representing their entire side of government—the members for Chifley, Shortland, Page and Fowler—and I do not even know if these four members have been to Aurukun. These four members would only turn up in an Aboriginal community if their plane ran out of fuel—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member will return to the motion or he will sit down.




Mr LAMING:
  They are four MPs who would only turn up in Aurukun, an area critically affected by this appalling legislation, if their plane ran out of fuel or there was a plaque to be unveiled—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Bowman can stop reflecting on individuals and talk to the motion. I am over people using this time as a rant.




Mr LAMING:
  That is the only time you would see them turn up to understand the implications of this bill.


We are talking about the use of river catchments. We are talking about the economic impacts upon Aboriginal Australia and Cape York and, as was so eloquently put in Balkanu's submission to this very inquiry, the notion that this is wilderness and wild simply betrays the lack of understanding that this government has of the economic desire of the people of Cape York to have a real chance at a job and a real chance at joining the global economy.


But this is a government determined to back up their Queensland counterparts who, for the last five years, have lamented the lack of consultation around the Northern Territory intervention. But what consultation was there for this Wild Rivers Act in 2005? In January they came up with a parliamentary paper, in February an explanatory memorandum and by 24 May had rammed this through the Queensland Parliament, which has no upper house of review. That is that government's record of consultation. It is appalling. And, then—given just one chance by this opposition to remedy these errors, to take, as Pearson has said, the foot off the throat of people living in Cape York—we had this appalling diversion of this legislation, and, whatever the procedural excuses made by the speaker before me, an appalling delay of years and years.


Is this a government that cares about economic development? Do they care about the complex interplay between economic development, the environment and generational equity? Of course not. These are the principles of sustainable economic development, the principles developed by the world conservation union. We have seen them used in COAG. But no. This bill goes so much further, to rip away from Cape York residents, Aboriginal traditional owners—who are considered as nothing other than unrelated third parties under this legislation—the chance to join the real economy. Within a kilometre of a major waterway there is not even a chance to engage in aquaculture; not even a chance to build anything more than a fence, a track, a road or a fire break without justifying that that piece of infrastructure is both absolutely necessary and can be put in no other location. I mean, what chance is there of having tourism in Cape York under those circumstances?


We have vegetation management acts, through which this legislation is read, that virtually prevent a weed from being pulled, for Aboriginal Australians to have a chance of joining the real economy, generating real jobs and real enterprise. This flies in the face of all of the work done in the reforms to welfare, where we here in Canberra have reached out a hand and said, 'Join the real economy through positive social norms, through paying your rent, through building and owning your own home, sending your children to school and then having a chance to take your own traditional lands and generate some form of employment and economic activity.'


To have the last 8½ minutes of that 10-minute speech devoted to pallid excuses only reminds me that this Saturday, as Churchill said, the era of procrastination will come to an end. Your half measures, your baffling expedients—it is all going to come to an end this Saturday. We will have a new Queensland government. And if this side of the parliament does not have the heart to act on behalf of Aboriginal Australians then the new Queensland government will do that and they will unravel this grave injustice.


I do not care how many green groups say that the economy is not hurt by this legislation. The Aboriginal people are telling us that, and all we ask is that Aboriginal elders, through the bill moved by the Leader of the Opposition, can have a say in this dialogue; through the principle of subsidiary, give them a chance to have a say about their own land. But no. Thanks to this collaboration between Canberra and the soon-to-be-departed ALP government in Queensland, what we have is: standing up for green preferences, for the things that work in Ashgrove over the things that work in Cape York. And to leave Cape York exposed like that is a dreadful shame that this Labor government will bear. (Time expired)

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (20:26):  I rise to speak to the motion. The motion we have before us today is nothing but a political stunt. It is not about wild rivers. It is not about the motion whatsoever. And the contribution from the previous speaker showed to me that he had not read the motion. He said 'we have got one chance' to vote for and get this wild rivers bill through the parliament. Well, could I tell the member for Bowman: this is the third version of the wild rivers bill that the opposition has introduced between the House and the Senate. They could not get it right. The problem is that they have been unable to get their legislation right. Three different versions, each with different contents, and each with different clauses. One chance? Well, I think there have been three chances and I am still not convinced that they have it right.


The motion we are looking at tonight talks about delays in consideration of the wild rivers legislation. I put to the House that a considerable amount of delay has been caused by the opposition's ineptitude—the fact that they cannot get it right. The Leader of the Opposition is the person who sponsored this legislation that has been put to the parliament and which has been sent off to committees, because it really does need to be looked at. Any legislation that is obviously so inept and has needed to have so many changes obviously needs the highest level of scrutiny, and I have little confidence that the ad hoc changes that have been made along the way in this bill will actually fix it up. It is right that it be looked at by the committee.


The latest—and I emphasise 'latest'—bill was referred by the parliament to the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs for consideration. The committee has not yet reported on the bill and it is not appropriate for the Leader of the Opposition to try to force this bill to a vote. He is trying to circumvent the process that has been put in place.


I might just share with the House, as a member of the Selection Committee, that members of the opposition constantly refer legislation to committees, and I am quite convinced that they do not even know why they are referring the legislation. I think that they just do it to delay legislation passing through the parliament. One piece of legislation that was referred to the Economics Committee and reported in this House was the mid-term budget appropriations legislation. If there is any legislation that is really examined carefully before it is put to the parliament it is that legislation.


This is all about playing politics—playing politics with Indigenous Australians. This is not about improving the lives of Indigenous Australians in Queensland; this is about playing politics with the lives of those Indigenous Australians in Queensland. This bill seeks to overturn the Queensland wild rivers regime and is pure politics—politics, politics, politics. We got an insight into those politics when we heard the member for Bowman talking about the Queensland election; the Queensland election is why we are debating this tonight in the parliament. This is bad legislation that has been poorly thought through. It has been sent to committees—and, I might add, three separate pieces of legislation have been sent to committees—because the Leader of the Opposition could not get it right. Well, if the Leader of the Opposition cannot get it right, that shows you the strength of those sitting on the other side of the parliament. This motion deserves to be thrown out of the parliament. It does not even deserve to be considered. I in no way support this legislation. (Time expired)

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (20:31):  I rise in support of the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011, and I note that I have spoken in this place on this bill before. I used an adjournment debate to talk on this bill because of what I saw as a complete abuse of process. I saw the Labor Party shamefully playing politics with an issue that all Indigenous Australians have an especially strong interest in, particularly Indigenous Australians from Queensland.


The reason I became aware of what was occurring on this bill is that I am a member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry. This bill was referred to that committee by the Selection Committee. When it was referred to that committee, every member queried why it had come to us. Upon investigation it became very clear that the bill had been sent to us as a stalling practice—as a way of deferring its coming onto the floor to be voted upon. The Leader of the Opposition has introduced this motion today so that we can see where everyone stands on this wild rivers bill before the Queensland election. There is no doubt that if we get the right result this coming Saturday this will be the end of this issue. I think every Queenslander—and in particular all Indigenous Queenslanders—will be extremely grateful that that has occurred.


I want to return to the playing of politics with this bill. The Selection Committee has referred this bill not once, not twice, not three times, not four times but five times to different committees. No other private member's bill in this place has been referred five times. The process was meant to enable the sun to shine in, was meant to put an end to petty politics and was meant to lead to being able to have substantial debates on issues of importance to members of this chamber. Instead, we have seen a blatant abuse of process by the members of the Selection Committee. That is why I am standing here, for the second time, talking about this. I used an adjournment debate to do it, but I was also very keen to support the Leader of the Opposition. His intentions in acting on this are because he knows and understands Indigenous Australia. It is absolutely shameful that we have not been able to see where everyone in this chamber stands on this motion. There is no doubt that those opposite are too afraid—are too scared—to vote on this bill because they would have to show their true colours on this issue, and they would be embarrassed to have to do so. That is why we have seen these appalling delaying tactics.


I want to mention the last few points of this motion from the member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition. It notes that most recently the wild rivers bill was referred for a fifth time. It expresses concern that, despite the scrutiny that is unprecedented for a private member's bill, this House is yet to have an opportunity to vote on this bill. It notes the comments from Noel Pearson and the Cape York Institute in support of the cause and calls on the government to allow the members of this House to exercise their vote on this important bill.


I say: let the sun shine in. Let us have the vote before Queensland votes. I have no doubt that the Queensland people will do the right thing on Saturday and put an end to this draconian policy once and for all. But let us see where everyone in this House stands before that happens. (Time expired)

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (20:36):  I am going to respond directly to what the honourable member for Wannon said in his contribution, on two points. He is talking about what happens in Queensland on Saturday. What happens in Queensland on Saturday is not the reason I am talking to this particular issue before the House tonight. But on that point I can say that the Leader of the Opposition and the Queensland LNP are all over the place when it comes to wild rivers. The Queensland LNP have said that they would overturn wild rivers declarations in Cape York but 'have no plans to repeal or replace any of the wild rivers declarations in western Queensland'. That was from 'LNP safeguards Wild Rivers', a statement from Andrew Powell MP, shadow minister for environment, 15 Feb 2012. So, before the honourable member for Wannon comes in here with wild accusations, it is better that some of the facts get put straight.


The other issue that I want to address was raised in the contribution by the honourable member for Bowman when he impugned me and my colleagues who were speaking here tonight for laying claim to righteousness in matters pertaining to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and issues. That is a big claim for anyone, and I would caution him to think very carefully before he makes such a claim. The honourable member for Bowman also impugned us by way of saying that we had not visited certain communities, as if that were somehow a test and that we lack understanding because we have not visited certain communities. Again, without going too far down that track, I would caution him about making such unsubstantiated claims. It really is a spurious accusation without substance. When you are reduced to arguing like that, you are not really addressing the issue at hand.


The other issue relates to the honourable member for Wannon and his statement that this bill has been referred five times. This bill is actually three bills, with one subject matter, in different forms. Yes, it has done the rounds of referrals and it has been referred to various committees, but it keeps changing. It is the third version of the wild rivers bill that the opposition has introduced. Between the House and the Senate, there have been five goes at the bill. There have been three different versions of the bill—each with different contents, each with different clauses and each with significant drafting and operational issues. A previous version of the bill has already been rejected by the Senate. Despite this, the Leader of the Opposition is pursuing his current version of the bill, and this latest version should be subject to higher scrutiny. It is a complex and significant area of law and it should not be dealt with in an ad hoc way.


There have been a lot of comments on both sides of the chamber tonight about politics. Yes, politics does feature in this place and sometimes we hurl it across at each other as though that is rather surprising. It is not surprising, because there are substantive issues to deal with here with wild rivers, but there is a whole lot of politics around this, and that is what is being played out here at the moment. That is why this bill requires careful consideration by a parliamentary committee.


The bill also goes to the nature and the heart of native title. That is something that took a lot of years to get a framework and laws around, which processes and issues were to be developed, and it is something that would be better dealt with other than by way of a private members' committee. However, it is our right as members of parliament to do that.


The bill, in its latest version, was referred by the parliament to the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs for consideration. The committee has not yet reported on the bill, as I understand it. It is not appropriate at this stage to try to force the bill to a vote before the committee has reported—and, yes, that can happen in this place. To force the bill to a vote is not appropriate—it is unprecedented and shows some disregard for the processes in this place. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee considered this bill and its report identified a range of drafting and operational issues and recommended that it not be passed. (Time expired)

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (20:41):  Earlier today we rightly reflected upon the life of Dame Margaret Whitlam, who tragically passed away quite recently. In doing so, we also reflected upon the life of her husband, Gough Whitlam. When you think about Gough Whitlam and some of the enduring images of his tenure as Prime Minister, one of those images was from when he was out in the Northern Territory at Wave Hill Station pouring the local dust out of his hand into the hand of the local elder Vincent Lingiari. It was symbolic of the beginning of land rights for Aboriginal people, and an important piece of legislation was passed a year subsequent to that. Today, Mr Lingiari's brothers from Queensland could well come back to this place with that sand and pour it into the hands of Julia Gillard. Such is the nature of the wild rivers legislation, which winds back the clock in relation to Aboriginal land rights.


People have been fighting for land rights for decades. They have been fighting for land rights, and I emphasise the term 'rights' because it is not just about having possession of the land but also about having use of the land and full ownership of the land, with all of the rights which go with it. The wild rivers legislation diminishes those rights. It is the first piece of legislation for a very long time in which those rights have been diminished and it is a disgrace that it is coming from this Labor government.


The motion in front of us here that we are debating is simply asking that we have a vote on a bill which says that no river will be declared wild unless the traditional owners of the land give their consent. That is all we are asking for. We are just asking for a vote to be held. We are not rushing the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill at all. In fact, this bill was introduced into this parliament over two years ago. In that two years we have had no fewer than five inquiries into this bill. This is not a long piece of legislation. It is only five pages and there is only one substantive piece to the five pages. That substantive piece says that if a river is to be declared wild, which has the effect therefore of reducing the use of the land in that river basin, that declaration must first have the consent of the traditional owners. It is a very simple proposition. It is a very simple one to understand. We are talking only about Aboriginal land itself here, so what is the problem with this piece of legislation? What is the concern from the other side of this chamber in relation to giving traditional owners consent, giving them a say over what they want to do with their land? Are those opposite seriously concerned that, after 50,000 years of looking after their land, tomorrow they are going to destroy it? Is that what they are concerned about?


If that is their concern, they should come in here and state that. Even if Aboriginal people do want to develop their land, why should they not have that right, just as we have the right to develop our land? Why should they not have that right? That is what those opposite have fought for over the last few decades. That is what Gough Whitlam was doing when he passed the sand into the hand of Vincent Lingiari. It was symbolising that, 'Mr Lingiari, you and your people now have possession and have the full rights of this land.' I think that if Gough Whitlam were looking down on this chamber today he would be disgusted by the acts of the Labor Party, because they stand for nothing. For decades they fought for the land rights of Aboriginal people, but today they wind back the clock and discard those values. The reason they do so is the grubby deal done with the Wilderness Society for preferences in Queensland in the upcoming state election. So when it comes to a challenge between the interests of the Labor Party and the interests of the most disadvantaged people in our community, who does the Labor Party side with? They side with the Greens and they side with their own grubby interests. It is a disgrace. We need to have the vote now.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (20:46):  I want to respond to a couple of comments that the member for Aston has just made about the views of the Whitlams. My response is that I suspect that you are absolutely wrong about what their perception of what is happening in this parliament would be. They would be applauding and supporting the government on the stand it is taking on the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011. More specifically, I want to respond to the comment that the member for Aston made which implied that this is 'a simple proposition where all we need is the consent of the traditional owners'.


Let me tell you about a simple proposition relating to the consent of traditional owners, and that is the matter of the uranium waste facility proposed for Muckaty Station. That was a 'simple proposition', using your words, whereby the Howard government sought the consent of the traditional owners to select the site and received that consent, and the matter is now before the Federal Court because it was not a simple proposition. In fact there is a debate taking place right now about who the traditional owners are, so do not for a moment let the House believe that these are simple matters. They are anything but simple matters and that is exactly why this piece of legislation needs to be properly scrutinised.


When it comes to dealing with Indigenous issues in this country, the record shows that they are never, ever simple. They are always complex and there is always a multiplicity of views in respect of whatever the issue is. If nothing else it should teach us a lesson that, when we are dealing with Indigenous issues, we need to carefully consider what we are doing and consider the recommendations that we finally come to.


It is interesting that this motion is being debated tonight, less than a week out from the Queensland election. It is interesting in listening to comments from members opposite how often they have referred to the Queensland election in respect of this motion. It simply highlights that this motion is not about the substance of the bill on the wild rivers that is before the parliament; it is purely a political stunt, using this parliament for political opportunism to create division in the communities in Queensland prior to the Queensland election on Saturday. That is all it is about.


As other speakers from this side of the House have quite rightly pointed out, this is the third occasion on which the Leader of the Opposition has drafted legislation on this matter. The member for Aston said, 'It is only simple legislation that is five pages long.' If it is only simple legislation that is five pages long, why has it taken him three efforts to try to get it right? On the first occasion it lapsed because we went into an election in 2010; fair enough. On the second occasion it did not lapse, and I understand that that piece of legislation is still before the Senate. It has never been dealt with, yet the Leader of the Opposition has chosen to produce a third piece of legislation, and members opposite question why the legislation has been referred to 'one committee after the other'.


It has been referred to one committee after the other because, firstly, we have had three different pieces of legislation to deal with and, secondly, members opposite cannot get their own legislation right. Yet they expect members of the House to walk in here and accept this legislation or support it or rubber-stamp it—whatever it is they expect, I do not know. The reality is that this is indeed complex legislation which quite rightly has been referred to one of the House committees. The House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs is currently looking at it and that is the right thing to do, and this House should not make a decision on the legislation until that committee has dealt with the matter. As chairman of the Standing Committee on Climate Change—


Debate adjourned.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-03-19,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (20:51):  I move:


That this House calls on the Government to set a date for the safe return of Australian troops from Afghanistan.


There is no greater responsibility for any country's politicians than to make decisions regarding war and peace. War is the most destructive and violent power of government. It creates widows and orphans. It maims and destroys body and soul. It crushes societies and economies. This means that we should only engage in war when it is absolutely necessary and when it can be justified in the cause of peace. For a long time, the decision to wage war was seen as the prerogative of the executive. This monopoly on the decision to wage war was a hangover from the feudal era. War was a decision of kings. The democratic revolutions retained this concept of sovereignty and invested the war-making power in the executive. But the decision to keep this kingly concept of war was always contested.


The Australian Greens believe that the decision to go to war should be in the hands of the parliament and we will continue to press for this democratic reform. The United States ensures that congress needs to back a president's decision to go to war. Many other countries do something similar, including Germany, Spain, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Slovakia, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. And we should join them.


But, regardless of who sends our men and women to war, the onus is on us to look for every opportunity to return to peace. It is the responsibility of the Prime Minister and the government to make clear when a war will end. Now is that time for our Prime Minister. Now is the time for her to make a clear and unequivocal statement of when our troops will leave Afghanistan. Anything else leaves the Australian people and our troops in limbo. The onus is on the proponents of war to show why we should continue to risk the lives of Australian men and women for no purpose.


The original purpose of the war was to respond to the 911 attacks and to remove al-Qaeda. That has long been accomplished. And Osama bin Laden is now dead. The Karzai government in Afghanistan is in negotiations with the Taliban with the aim of creating a national government involving all sides of this conflict. In this context, what is the great purpose for which we fight? Even if the proponents of war are correct and the withdrawal of foreign forces leads to a return of the Taliban, what is the justification for keeping our troops there for two more years for the same result? How do we justify the death of our troops by holding on until the Americans decide to leave?


The new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Carr, says we should remain in Afghanistan to protect women. Yet just this month the Afghan President Hamid Karzai endorsed an edict from the country's top religious council that confirms that women are inferior to men, sanctions the beating of women by their husbands in certain Sharia compliant circumstances and argues for greater segregation. Last month, the government that we are in there defending also demanded that women newsreaders wear headscarves. In 2010, the Karzai government in Afghanistan also passed a law which applies to the country's minority Shiite population and, in particular, to its women. This law allows police to enforce language that sets out a wife's sexual duties and restricts a woman's right to leave her own home. According to US reports, child custody rights still go to fathers and grandfathers, women have to ask before they get married for permission to work and a husband is still able to deny his wife food and shelter if she does not meet his sexual needs. This is the government that we are told that our soldiers should continue to kill and die for.


It is now clear that the war in Afghanistan cannot be won, however you measure victory. It is now clear that the reasons successive governments have given to be in Afghanistan no longer stand up to scrutiny. It is also clear that the main reason we are there is not to defend democracy or human rights but simply because the United States asked us to go and wants us to remain. And it is now clear that, although our alliance with the United States is important, a simple request is not a good enough reason for our troops to fight and die in an unwinnable and unjustifiable war.


This is a decision we must make for ourselves as a country. It is a decision that other countries have made for themselves. It is time to bring the troops home. It is time to bring the troops home safely and for Australia to shoulder the burden of Afghanistan's problems in a new way. And it is time to bring the troops home so that they can be honoured for their service. We should no longer ask them to carry out this unjustified task.


For the sake of clarity, it is important to note that the Greens do not oppose the deployment in Afghanistan based on any absolute opposition to the use of military force or from any lack of commitment to our troops. We led the call for military intervention in Timor Leste and are proud of the role our men and women played in the struggle for freedom and independence in that country. But already 32 young Australians soldiers have lost their lives and at least 218 have been wounded in action in Afghanistan. That is all the more reason why we should be having this debate.


No-one knows exactly how many people have died and been injured in the war in Afghanistan because, in those infamous words of the US military, 'We don't do body counts.' But we do know that it is in the tens of thousands. The appalling massacre this month was not an aberration. Nearly every other week there is another story of a massacre or accidental killing of civilians—more collateral damage in a war in which, like Vietnam, our troops find it harder to tell the difference between insurgents and non-insurgents.


This war has now been going on for over ten years, almost longer than World War I and World War II combined. We must remember that in the eyes of many of the people now fighting the coalition forces in Afghanistan this is a continuation of their fight to remove foreign forces from the country—a fight begun with the Soviet invasion in 1979. The Prime Minister said that this war may be the work of a generation. If coalition troops are there for another decade, a whole generation of boys and girls will have grown up knowing us only as an occupying force and as the enemy, and we must expect all the consequences that flow from that. On this, I think we should listen to Malalai Joya. In 2005, she was the youngest woman elected to the Afghani parliament. She condemned the warlords of whom the assembly was overwhelmingly comprised. Now, she says:


We are in between two evil: the warlords and Taliban on one side, and the occupation on the other. The first step is to fight against occupation—those who can liberate themselves will be free, even if it costs our lives.


Respected defence analysts have said that the process of training the army and police in Afghanistan has been far less successful than the government has made out and may never be achievable. The desertion of personnel, infiltration by Taliban supporters and the quality of the troops and police all mean that very few are able to operate without coalition forces in support. According to some recent reports, the attrition rate far exceeds the number of new recruits. None of these problems have been acknowledged by the government, which continues to make the confident declaration that it is the 'Afghan government's determination that the Afghan National Security Forces should lead and conduct military operations in all provinces by the end of 2014'. It is important to note the careful language that is being used here suggesting that even by 2014 there may be no self-sufficient Afghan military or police, suggesting that we may be there for much longer. The former leader of the coalition forces in Afghanistan and current director of the CIA, General David Petraeus, summed up his thinking on the length of deployment in this way:


You have to recognize also that I don't think you win this war. I think you keep fighting … You have to stay after it. This is the kind of fight we're in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids' lives.


While we talk here of decades and generations, President Obama is reported to have responded to Pentagon requests for more troops by saying:


I'm not doing ten years. I'm not doing long-term nation-building. I am not spending a trillion dollars.


If the US is increasingly asking how much it will cost in lives and money to be successful, and indicating that it will not make that kind of commitment, why are we not doing the same? And what would count as success, anyway? Is it the maintenance of the Karzai government, described by David Petraeus as a criminal syndicate? As the Vice-President of the United States, Joe Biden, asked: 'If the government's a criminal syndicate a year from now, how will the troops make a difference?'


According to Australian defence analyst Hugh White, the real reason the Australian government has troops in Afghanistan is that the United States has asked us. That is why the Greens believe that we need a relationship with the United States that is strong but is based on autonomy and independence. The experience of the British in standing up to American pressure to take part in the Vietnam War was that it did not undermine the British-American relationship. Australia could still retain the support of the United States even if we pursued a more independent foreign policy. While others in the world are discussing exit strategies, Australia is continuing to write blank cheques. The Greens know what 64 per cent of the Australian public know: it is time to set a date to bring our troops home.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (21:01):  I rise to respond to the motion standing in the name of the member for Melbourne, representing the Greens party. I remind the parliament that, as we debate the motion, 1,550 of our men and women are engaged in combat operations in Afghanistan, let alone the further 800 in the wider Middle East area of operations. Right now it is 2.00 pm in Afghanistan. Special operations troops are moving through Oruzgan and neighbouring provinces. At least 10 mentoring taskforce patrols are out working with the Afghan National Army. Australian Federal Police officers are working with the Afghan National Police. Members of the provincial reconstruction team are working with a range of community groups, looking at community issues and programs. There are 150 officers and senior NCOs working with a range of command elements. Trainers with the Australian artillery corps are working with the artillery school training Afghan gunners. Our men and women are working to achieve a better outcome in Afghanistan. They are working to achieve a land where stability becomes the norm, not the abnormal, and a country that can no longer be used by insurgent and terrorist elements as safe ground for harbouring, recruiting, financing and training criminal and terrorist elements.


In a spirit of bipartisanship, knowing that I speak for a majority of the parliament, I rise to say that our men and women should return safely to our land when the job is done—not before, not based on an arbitrary timeline, not on a troops-home-before-Christmas schedule and certainly not on the whim of the Greens party, which stands here and speaks of an unwinnable and unjustifiable war. I have said before to the Leader of the Greens: 'You stand and condemn all that we do in Afghanistan. If you have the courage of your convictions, go to Afghanistan, visit the troops, walk the ground and have a shura with the locals. Then you can speak with some knowledge.' Senator Brown has declined the invitation to go.


I say to the member for Melbourne: forgive me if I handle your motion with some disdain, when you walk into this House and speak on behalf of a party that, even though invited, refuses to go to the battlefield to get a first-hand view of what is actually happening in the country, meet our fighting men and women, shake their hands and look them in the eye. You talk in here about bringing our soldiers home with honour. You know nothing of honour, sir, because you refuse to go there, speak to them and demonstrate through your actions that you honour their service. So forgive me if I look at your motion as one more in a line of frivolous motions regarding our defence forces and national security that the Greens see fit to introduce into parliament. You have given no thought to the repercussions of your actions or your words. I will stand here and join with the government in a bipartisan way to support our men and women and say to them: what you are doing is valuable, this is not an unwinnable and unjustifiable war. You shed your blood, your sweat and your tears for something that matters.


Before discussing the wider elements of the merits of the motion, let us first couch this debate in the history of the Greens' defence and national security policy, because it is important to understand the motivation of the member for Melbourne. He comes into the House to talk about combat operations, yet the Greens party has no explicit defence policy. It has no veterans policy, yet he speaks of bringing our troops home with honour. It has no national security policy; the Greens' line-in-the-sand approach will simply make matters worse. This parliament views that a considered metrics based, command-led withdrawal is the best recipe for success. Anything less is to consign the Afghan people to a future nightmare of insurgent violence, drug addiction through poppy harvesting and religious terrorism.


The Greens' published peace and security policy is at best naive and at worst frankly dangerous. The Greens call on Australia to end its cornerstone national security treaty, the ANZUS alliance, to end all foreign troop deployments and training in Australia, which are fundamental to our regional cooperation, and to close all foreign bases in Australia, despite the fact that we have none. Further, the Greens have called for an end to arms trade fairs and the cessation of exporting Australian manufactured defence materiel. In other words, the Greens want to shut down the bulk of Australia's defence industry, which is worth more than $2 billion a year and directly employs over 10,000 people, many in regional locations. This is the heart and soul of the policy of the Greens. This is what they want to do to Australia's defence industry.


I could go on and on unpacking the irrational, contradictory, confused and nonsensical Greens defence policy, but suffice to say that those with more than a passing interest in defence matters join as one to denounce any watering down of the executive powers of government as they pertain to national security. Those outside of the executive are literally dripping in an inability to understand the core issues without the available intelligence, knowledge and information at hand. Only the executive is capable of making considered, detailed and reasoned decisions about the application of force in the furthering of our national security and foreign affairs policy. If the Greens wish to be taken seriously on defence and national security, they should take seriously the need to formulate policies and not just thought bubbles, and they should think seriously about the repercussions of their thought bubbles within the wider context of Australia's national security and not the narrow interests of their political base.


In responding to this motion I do so with the full knowledge that it is not motivated by the welfare of our hardworking ADF personnel; it is not motivated by doing what is right by our ISAF and Afghan partners or by the 48 nations of the world that have joined together under a United Nations mandate to fight the insipid curse of separatism, terrorist elements, insurgency and criminal forces that all fuse together within wider Afghanistan to seek to do us harm. If the Greens came from a position of even a minimum degree of enduring interest regarding defence matters then perhaps I could take this seriously. If the Leader of the Greens had bothered like every other major leader of a party to visit our hardworking men and women and seek an understanding of what they are doing within the wider Middle East area of operations perhaps we could take this seriously. But carping from the sidelines, speaking of bringing men and women home with honour and drawing time lines arbitrarily in the sand does not fill us with that degree of confidence. If the Greens were serious about national security policy they would not have a position to end the ANZUS alliance, the bedrock of our security in the region.


There is bipartisan support for our ongoing engagement in Afghanistan. There is bipartisan support for a metrics based, command-led withdrawal from Afghanistan that is not based on arbitrary time lines but on thoughtful, considered judgments on the ground, on the degree of training and the standards we have achieved with the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police and on the degree of support the provincial reconstruction teams have provided in the region.


There was a time when we had 30 operating bases and patrol bases. We now man fewer than eight, with mobile mentoring teams being the order of the day. We have already commenced handing over significant areas, village by village, roadside by roadside, valley by valley, to the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police. The drawdown across the area is already occurring within a staged, set, metrics based environment that does not need people on the sidelines with no experience, no interest and no desire to see what is going on to get involved.


We take our responsibilities seriously, as do the other 47 nations of the world in partnership under a UN mandate in Afghanistan. We do not think casually about our involvement. We feel deeply for the wounded in action and those tragically killed in action and their families and loved ones left behind. War should never be entered into lightly nor withdrawn from on a whim. There is an executive with this House for a reason. It is called the government. It is designed to make sound, reasoned and sensible decisions, and it is the body who is best placed to make decisions on withdrawing forces. (Time expired)

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (21:11):  I rise to again voice my opposition, in the strongest possible terms, to Australia's continuing involvement in the war in Afghanistan. I do not dispute the claim al-Qaeda was responsible for the attacks on America on 11 September 2001. Nor do I dispute the claim that al-Qaeda was based principally in Afghanistan, so there was a legitimate need to invade that country if the terrorist organisation was to be brought to heel. In fact, I was an analyst in the Office of National Assessments at about that time and it was abundantly clear to me that al-Qaeda was anything but a band of terrorists hiding in a cave somewhere in Afghanistan. The reality instead was that al-Qaeda was so large as to deploy formed bodies of troops and was an intrinsic physical and financial part of the Taliban regime, controlling virtually all of the country by late 2001.


Hence I do believe we should have joined the international community in the invasion of that country, just as the international community, including Australia, should have moved quickly to rebuild the country in 2002. But of course the international community, including Australia, did not seize the brief opportunity to maintain the fragile peace while it poured in the billions of dollars of promised aid, preferring instead to cut and run and in the process create the conditions for the civil war we have battled ever since. Yes, it is a civil war. All the nonsense we continue to hear from the government and from the opposition about needing to stay in Afghanistan to rid the world of global terrorism is just that—nonsense. The fact is that Islamic extremism no longer relies on a single group and Afghanistan is no longer terrorism central. What we have instead is a transnational collection of violent individuals and groups, some acting alone and some connected, who collectively comprise the global Islamic extremist threat. Against this backdrop al-Qaeda is now irrelevant, its earlier roles of direct action as well as controlling and inspiring others now virtually redundant. In other words, there is simply no reason whatsoever for Australian troops to remain in Afghanistan any longer to keep us safe from terrorists. Nor is there any reason to remain in Afghanistan in solidarity with the United States, because the US is now set to get out sooner than later and, in any case, the bilateral relationship is more than strong enough to withstand us showing a bit of independence sometimes. If there were a reason to stay on in Afghanistan, surely it would be to make it a better place. But, regrettably, that is a pipedream. The dreadful reality is that Afghanistan will remain strife torn until foreign troops have left and the country has been allowed to find its natural political level. It was ever thus.


In offering my thoughts tonight I make no criticism of the Australian Defence Force. They are doing their job and doing it magnificently. In particular, my former wife, Brigadier Simone Wilkie, is said to be excelling. But regardless of whether Australian forces fight on for two months, two years or 10, Afghanistan will revert to chaos when international forces withdraw. This is set to be a chilling replay of the way the formidable successes of the Australian task force in Phuoc Tuy province were eventually swamped by the broader military defeat in Vietnam. If this is to be the case, to paraphrase US Senator John Kerry, himself a war veteran: how do you ask a soldier to be the last one to die in Afghanistan and how do you ask a soldier to be the last one to die for the mistake of staying on unnecessarily? God help the Australian politicians who have it within their power to end this war but who choose not to, for in their hands is the fate of our sons and daughters, and it is in their hearts they will need to live with John Kerry's questions.


In closing, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to put on the record the member for Moore's concern about the war in Afghanistan. He had hoped to express them himself tonight but is unable to.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (21:16):  I stand here with, I am sure, the vast majority of this House to affirm my support for our mission and our troops in Afghanistan. We know what Afghanistan was like leading up to 2001: the Taliban were running the show and they had invited al-Qaeda to Afghanistan. Whilst we heard from the member for Denison that Afghanistan should be allowed to go back to a natural political level, I am not so sure that, in the broad world interest, we want that country to be the home base for terrorism that it was and stands to become again if we drop the ball on this. Nor do we want Afghanistan to become again the socially and politically crippled and barbaric nation that it was before, when half a million people lived in Kabul and they had a terrible standard of living. Then, fewer than a million boys attended school in Afghanistan and now there are close to seven million Afghan children attending school, a third of whom are girls. That was not allowed under the old regime. We should be very careful about trying to step back from that sort of future. We should have confidence and not be like the member for Melbourne, who denigrates the Afghan people by saying that their troops and their police are just not up to the task.


It is not going to be easy and it has not been easy. As we know, there has been a cost involved with this. But we should be prepared to back those people. We should be prepared to back a developing democratic nation whose soldiers and police are prepared to lay down their lives, as so many do. Whilst there have been aberrations, a handful who have done the wrong thing by committing crimes and betraying their allies and their own people, the reality is that the vast majority—something like 330,000 by 2014—are the people we should stand behind and be prepared to back. They believe in their country and, whilst others in this place may not believe in that country, it is right for the majority of us in this chamber to stand by Afghanistan and believe in a better future for them. We have a duty to every girl in that country who was not able to attend school or have a job outside the home. It is the right thing to do. There are good things in this world, and they are always worth fighting for. We should not be backing away from this. Look at what happened in 2001. It is acknowledged, I suspect, by all people in this House that al-Qaeda based their terrorism in Afghanistan. That is what happened with September 11.


There is a better future and we must never allow the circumstances, the home base, that existed in Afghanistan to exist again. We must never allow a September 11 to exist. Also, we must always be on our guard against terrorism. The fact that it may take generations should not mean we should be scared of that fight. Sometimes we have got to get people out there and fight. That is the reality. We need to do the things that need to be done. Sometimes you just cannot turn the other cheek. Sometimes you have just got to pick up weapons and do what needs to be done. It is not just about the security of this country and the Western world; it is also about a better future for a lot of people in Afghanistan. It might happen in other places in the future. Again, we should be prepared to do what needs to be done in those cases.


There is always the hope that by 2014 we might see even better stability, social development and economic capacity in Afghanistan. That future will be delivered by democratic government supported by the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police, with as much support from friends and allies as is required. We should ensure that the home base for terrorism in Afghanistan is never again allowed to exist, we should be prepared to fight for as long as it is required and, certainly, beyond 2014 we should not be afraid to have our soldiers and our supporters in Afghanistan back a better future for the Afghan people.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (21:21):  Recent events have once again brought into sharp focus our role in Afghanistan, and I do not think anyone here is under the illusion that our task there is simple. Restoring stability to the nation of Afghanistan is a complex and long process and, yes, the incidents we have heard so much about lately do make our mission more challenging. I know Afghan President Hamid Karzai has, in the face of these unforgivable circumstances, made a number of statements in the last few weeks. But the important thing to remember here is that there is a commitment in place that has not been broken. President Karzai has spoken to US President Barack Obama, and both have recommitted to the strategy made by international partners at the Lisbon summit, where it was agreed to hand over the lead on security to Afghan forces by the end of 2014. Australia, too, remains firmly committed to this strategy.


We are continuing our important work in Oruzgan where we are training and mentoring the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army. More importantly, we are confident we can transition to Afghan-led security responsibility in the Oruzgan province by 2014—perhaps even earlier. Following that milestone, Australia will continue to have a role in Afghanistan, possibly through institutional training, a special forces presence, military advisory roles, capacity building and development assistance.


This transition process is extremely important to the future of Afghanistan and of the Middle East more generally. For the transition to be successful, the Afghan national security forces need to assume their security responsibility on a sustainable and irreversible basis. This will require some level of continued support from international forces. To withdraw would put this strategy in jeopardy.


Transition is a long process, which the Gillard government is committed to. We want to ensure Afghanistan has as orderly a transition as possible. We need to remember why we are in Afghanistan. We are there at the request of the government of Afghanistan and we operate as part of the United Nations mandated International Security Assistance Force. There are 49 other members of the ISAF who are working alongside us and we are making good progress. We have helped build up the Afghan national security forces from around 192,000 in late 2009 to around 300,000 today. While much of the focus on Afghanistan is on the military, one must not forget the broader mission we are engaged in. We are doing very important work in Afghanistan. We are doing good work.


I know this because in May last year I visited Afghanistan as part of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and I saw firsthand the important work Australia is doing. I gained a greater understanding of what we are there to do—to not only combat terrorism and stabilise Afghanistan but also nurture and grow much more fundamental human rights within the country. I gained a greater understanding of the great work being done by our serving men and women. Australia has done a lot of good in Afghanistan. We have helped build infrastructure—we have constructed training centres, roads, airfields and mosques. Better roads mean food can get to market and local economies can prosper. Alternative crops have been introduced to help stop the country's addiction to the poppy trade and we are giving young people skills so they can help build up their nation.


We have seen the beginnings of an education revolution within Afghanistan, where girls are going to school and getting an education for the very first time. Six million children now go to school in Afghanistan and we are still counting—and one-third of them are girls. In 2001, the number of children in school was around one million and none of them were girls. We are also teaching soldiers to read.


Despite what others might say or suggest, there continues to be universal support in the international community for the transition process in Afghanistan to go ahead. Australia's involvement in Afghanistan is important and our transition strategy is well in hand. It is something our troops have been working extremely hard to achieve for some years, and something we must continue to support, for the people of Afghanistan and for those soldiers from all nations who have lost their lives in trying to restore security and stability.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (21:26):  Last Friday I was lucky enough to join the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Dr Mike Kelly, to farewell Force Support Unit Six, or FSU 6, as they departed for Afghanistan. I was lucky that I was not asked to speak after Dr Kelly, because he said it all. He spoke about family, about respect, about love, about duty and about responsibility. At the morning tea afterwards, I spoke with a soldier who was about to leave his wife and two beautiful girls, in grade 6 and grade 3, for his third tour. I asked the girls if they were proud of their dad or if they were going to miss him. They said, 'Of course we will miss him, but we are very, very proud for what he is doing.' I asked him what he was doing and he said that he was about to leave on his third tour. He said that he was really looking forward to re-establishing ties in Afghanistan. He was really looking forward to seeing what he had started on his first two tours and to see how far down the track things had gone. He was really excited about catching up with the Afghans he had met, about the relationships he had made professionally and socially and about what they had done to their country.


Our troops are doing a professional job. They are doing that because they are professionals. They are there not to perpetuate war but to ensure that this country, Afghanistan, is given every opportunity to provide for itself. War is no longer two lines of soldiers shooting at each other. The members for Melbourne and Denison would do well to remember this. A friend of mine who came back from Afghanistan said:


There will be a form of democracy in Afghanistan, but it probably won't look too much like Australia's. It will be their form of democracy. It will be what they are prepared to do and what they are prepared to fight for.


We cannot do everything, but what we can do is make sure that every opportunity is given them to provide the best for their own country. I agree with the member for Canberra: withdrawal is a long and difficult process but it must also be orderly and ordered. We cannot draw a line in the sand arbitrarily and say that we shall be out of there by then, because we do not know what is going to happen. It is a fluid situation in Afghanistan and it has to be treated as such.


The people of Australia must bear with this parliament and trust our soldiers and the services that they are delivering. FSU 6 are deploying to three sites: Tarin Kowt, the United Arab Emirates and Oruzgan province. I appreciate what they are doing and how they are going about their work and I think everyone in this place would do well to remember that these people are going over there. To draw a line arbitrarily just to get a bit of press at the wrong time of the day, because you were not part of the leadership debate—

"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (21:30):  Slated as Australia's new air combat capability, the troubled Joint Strike Fighter program is beyond overdue. Service entry is expected, at the very minimum, to be more than six years later than anticipated and far too expensive. Adding insult to injury, the question concerning the aircraft's credibility as an effective air combat fighter in the expected time it would operate remains to be answered. The Defence Subcommittee hearing pertaining to the Defence annual report, held on 16 March, was a staggering event for those familiar with this subject. First was the admission by Air Vice-Marshal Kym Osley that, in terms of aerodynamic performance, the JSF was designed to have similar performance to a legacy F16 or F18 with air-to-air missiles and external fuel tanks. He stated that this was representative of how a legacy aircraft would be loaded for combat.


When legacy fighters enter combat, however, external fuel tanks are dropped, resulting in a significant reduction in drag. This means legacy fighters are superior in performance, when compared to the aircraft supposed to replace them, after they drop those tanks. The JSF will mark the first time in Australia's air combat history that a fighter replacing an older one will have inferior overall aerodynamic performance. Defence still contends that the overall capability of the JSF is superior and that it will defeat all known threats. Upon my inquiry about what threats had been evaluated and what models, apart from man-in-the-loop flight simulators, had been used, Air Vice-Marshal Osley refused to specify.


To get a handle on the assertions made by Defence, I worked through a step-by-step process on an eight-versus-eight combat. It was evident that this process was not going to end well for the JSF, so the 'we are getting into classified areas' get-out-of-jail-free card was pulled. I can inform the House that we were not even close to classified data. We were discussing actual combat firings of the JSF's main air-to-air missile—information in the public domain which demonstrates that, in a permissive environment, it has a probability of kill of approximately 0.5, meaning that its missile hits its target half the time. In reality, against a capable threat, the missile is only likely to kill the enemy one time in five.


Perhaps the JSF being a lousy air combat fighter is the actual reason for the classified card being pulled. The trade bible, Aviation Week and Space Technology, had a report called 'Raptor's Edge' in 2009. In this article, analysts from the USAF and Lockheed Martin, the company making both the F22 Raptor and the JSF, stated that, against Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters, the Raptor had a kill ratio of 30 to one and the JSF three to one. That sounds reasonable until you realise that the Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters are nearly 30 years old already. Against aircraft 30 years newer, such as the Su-35S, the PAK-FA and the Chinese J20, you can imagine the results are likely to be very different.


I made the point about the vulnerability of the JSF against these aircraft during the hearings. REPSIM, an analysis company with personnel praised by the Chief of Defence Force, has shown that against the Su-35S alone, the JSF would be shot down at the rate of 5 to 2—never mind the more capable, stealthy PAK-FA and J-20. The chief executive officer of the Defence Materiel Organisation, Warren King, also indicated that there were no thresholds in place, in terms of either schedule or cost, which would lead to the JSF decision being rescinded. This is staggering as it amounts to an open chequebook—we are going to aggressively purchase the JSF, come hell or high water, no matter what date the aircraft becomes available.


The simple fact is that the fighter pilot's holy grail is the ability to engage, destroy the enemy and disengage at will. With the JSF, the terms of the engagement will have to be accepted, even if highly disadvantageous. This does not bode well for the most important military capability of all—air combat.

 (Gilmore) (10:30):  Last week, in Parliament House Sydney, I was a very proud pollie as my constituent Brittany Joyce, from Nowra, was awarded the prestigious Tom Harvey Award together with a cheque for $2,000 from the Australian Youth Trust. It was presented on Commonwealth Day 2012, the theme of which was 'Connecting Cultures'. The award was presented by Her Excellency Professor Marie Bashir. I would like to record in our House today extracts of what Brittany had to say:


I am a 20 year old aged care nurse from Nowra; I don't see myself as special; I am just an average person dreaming of an above average future, for myself and everyone else. I believe in equality, and hope, and that everyone deserves a chance. I am passionate about making a difference and helping people.


I'd like to start by thanking those people who have supported me with this project; Sir Ian Turboss, Chairman of the Australia Youth Trust and the Commonwealth Day Council for awarding me this and making me feel like my project is worthy.


Joanna Gash, who saw my story in a local paper and believed in my project so much that she sought me out to nominate me for this award.


A big crazy loving family; especially my brothers and their partners, my mum and dad, who always let me dream. My gorgeous partner Bernie, who supports me in my dreams even though they are so different from the life that he imagined for himself before he met me.


I have always valued my family. I was raised with an open mind, brothers who took care of me, spoilt with love and encouraged to be creative, compassionate and unique.


I have lived in Nowra since I was 14, completed year 12 in November 2009. I started work in Osborne House Nursing Home as a Trainee Aged Care Nurse 4 days after finishing school. I love working with people and caring for them.


I have always wanted to travel, but had never been overseas, but I was definitely drawn to Africa. Jacinta and Antipas from Melbourne, have founded the 'Suluhisho Trust', a Kenyan based NGO that helps people living in poverty in the Kisumu area, encouraging people like me to volunteer and experience firsthand what it is like. In Kisumu, I met Mary and the kids.


Africa, to put it simply, is a beautiful chaos. Its like being inside a living organ-ism, there is constant movement and a sense of genuine togetherness. I spent 3 weeks staying at Mary's orphanage and working in local schools and hospitals. I was awed by the display of raw community everywhere I looked and the openness and trust between the locals and visitors.


Mary, the wonderful woman who opened the orphanage with her late husband, is an inspiration, and has become my personal hero. As a woman suffering HIV, and having lost her husband to the disease, Mary decided to start an organisation to support and educate local men, women and children with HIV. Here, people come together to learn their strengths and weaknesses, to share their experiences and help each other. Mary then opened the orphanage and now lives in the home with 22 children, including 2 of her own. These incredible people have nothing. No possessions—not even good health—but they are the happiest, most giving people I've met. To provide for Mary and the children I only needed to raise $550 a month, quite achievable! This provides food, clothing, education, medicines and a small amount for wages for Mary's staff.


I am continually amazed and elated by the support I have been given when people hear my story. My dream is to support people in finding their independence and in doing that find equality improve their way of life.


A truly amazing young Australian, Brittany has been sending $550 each month since August 2011. (Time expired)

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:58):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Let us cut to the chase in what has been the worst policy debate for Australian public policy in at least the past 20 years. The truth is that 148 of the 150 members of parliament in the House of Representatives agree that offshore assessment should be an option for executive government. 150 MPs recognise the status and worth of the Bali process as very good bipartisan work done in the regional Asia-Pacific forum. No MPs want lives lost at sea because the 43rd Parliament cannot resolve something that the vast majority of MPs want resolved. So I say to colleagues again: why can't we pass legislation through the House that 148 MPs, at least, support in principle?


I have asked all MPs to read and get to know the principles of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. They were circulated to colleagues last week. For me, they address the failure of the domestic policy debate in trying to deal with people smuggling via an asylum seeker and refugee debate. That will never provide a suitable answer for sustainable policy on people smuggling. Instead, we should look at the international bipartisan forum that focuses on people smuggling if we really do want to deal with this topic. The Bali process is it. Therefore, rather than questioning bilateralism within a humanitarian framework, we should be actively encouraging it, not just for Malaysia but for many creative and cooperative options. So long as there is a humanitarian backbone in any arrangement, so long as there is oversight by the parliament of any arrangement, we should be encouraging rather than discouraging such regional work.


This bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012, does it. It strongly encourages bilateral and multilateral regional agreements on people smuggling and does so within a recognised bipartisan, humanitarian framework. Yet, despite the support of 148 MPs in principle, we need to deal with the straw man in the room. I saw again today that Mr Abbott will not support anything offshore unless it is with UN refugee convention signatories only. This is not the position Mr Abbott and Mr Morrison took to the last election, and they have no mandate for this position. Worse, they are now arguing the complete opposite of what they took to the election and the complete opposite of what is on their own personal websites right now. In my view, they are all at sea on this key point of the importance of signatory status with regard to the UN refugee convention. I will read out several quotes from Mr Morrison's own website. Here is the first one, about the UN refugee convention:


The Convention provides no permanent rights to refugee status at all. 


Here is the second:


… the Refugee Convention is not infallible …


Here is another one:


A refugee in one jurisdiction is just as likely to be assessed as an economic migrant in another. 


And here is another:


Non-refoulement is the core protection provided by the Convention. This is now a welcome and generally accepted principle of international law, regardless of nation’s signatory status. It transcends the convention. 




Mr Morrison:
  True.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  I agree. I am hearing from Mr Morrison that it is all true. I agree with that. But let us not worry about onshore and offshore issues. Let us explore online and offline Scott Morrison and Tony Abbott. Online we see 'sensible Scott', who has just been saying he agrees—





Mr Morrison:

  The member for Cook!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Lyne needs to use people's appropriate titles.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  He has been talking about the principles within the refugee convention and their importance that transcends signatory status. Yet offline, for the press gallery, for talkback radio and for his leader, Tony Abbott, we see the complete opposite. If it is about a truth and values campaign that is being run pre-election and about who said what pre-election and post-election, this cuts to the heart of that position with regard to the coalition on migration policy. I raise this for two reasons. One is to expose the absolute front of the political positioning with regard to this topic. The second is an important one with regard to policy, and that is that online Scott Morrison—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member needs to use the member's title.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  has a sensible position and a position that strongly supports this parliament supporting my bill. The coalition does have ownership of the Bali process. It is a good process. It deserves to be supported. This bill puts the Bali process as the framework for allowing executive government to make decisions to deal with people smuggling in as humanitarian a way as we can, as per the member for Cook's very own website.

 (Cook) (11:04):  I am not surprised the member for Lyne would come into this place and seek to attack the coalition. He has done that on many occasions and he has shown more loyalty to the Prime Minister than at least 31 of the Prime Minister's own colleagues, including the member who is at the table today.



Ms Hall interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Shortland will resume her seat. The member for Cook has five minutes and he will be relevant to the bill or I will sit him down. The member for Cook has the call.




Mr MORRISON:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was just addressing the previous member's remarks and attacks on the coalition.


In August last year the High Court struck down the government's Malaysian people swap because of the failure of that arrangement to satisfy the human rights protections set out in section 198A of the Migration Act. Rather than seek to create a new and more objective test to ensure that human rights protections were maintained for offshore processing, the government simply sought to abolish them. The coalition rightly rejected this approach. Instead the coalition proposed an amendment after the High Court decision to insert into the act a new, more objective test for human rights protections—that any country to be designated an offshore processing country must be a signatory to the refugee convention.


The coalition's amendment to the government's bill provided a clear, objective and universally recognised standard of protection that does not require judicial interpretation. That was the position we adopted for good reason after the decision of the High Court. The member for Lyne claims that the bill before us, the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012, incorporates the coalition's amendments to the government's legislation. It simply does not. The coalition only had one amendment to the government's legislation and it is not included in this bill.


The member for Lyne's bill restates the government's bill by repealing section 198A and fails to replace it with a binding human rights protection measure that can be objectively determined, thereby constraining the scope for judicial review, which was a key purpose of our amendment. This is the only objective standard that creates legally binding obligations available to establish the presence of protections. Paragraph 117 of the High Court judgment on the Malaysian people swap makes this position very clear. It states:


What is clear is that signatories to the Refugees Convention and the Refugees Protocol are bound to accord to those who have been determined to be refugees the rights that are specified in those instruments including the rights earlier described.


Paragraph 125 also states:


A country ""provides access"" to effective procedures for assessing the need for protection of persons seeking asylum of the kind described in s 198A(3)(a)(i) … if it is bound, as a matter of international obligation …


The argument that the inclusion of nonrefoulement and orderly assessment provisions in section 198AB accommodates the coalition's amendment completely fails to understand the purpose of our amendment and indeed the High Court decision. This bill explicitly now states in section 198AB(6) that the protections proposed—or assurances, they are termed—are not legally binding. In addition, the selection of the Bali process as the alternative test to the UN refugee convention fails to understand the role and purpose of that forum. We should know; we introduced it. Participation in that forum creates no obligation on participating members, let alone obligations that are legally binding.


The member for Lyne's claim that this bill provides higher humanitarian standards than have ever existed in Australia before is completely false. The fact is that this bill would allow the Malaysian people swap deal to proceed. That is proof enough. However, as noted, the protections the member for Lyne advocates are not legally binding.



Mr Oakeshott interjecting—




Mr MORRISON:
  This makes them deficient to the provisions currently in the act that he proposes to abolish that were established by the coalition and that were used by the High Court to strike down the Malaysian people swap. They are also deficient to the coalition amendment, as the UN refugee convention creates legally binding obligations. There are other problems with this bill, and I will be inviting the minister to make his observations on those.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I do not think that is up to the member for Cook.




Mr MORRISON:
  I am sure that he will be equally concerned about the definition of 'party' within this to the Bali process. The definition is ambiguous and it creates further legal opportunities, I think, to create uncertainty around this issue. Secondly, the bill requires the rules of natural justice to apply. That is something the minister himself in his own bill around this matter sought to have removed. Thirdly, the bill establishes the designation of an offshore processing country as a legislative instrument.




Mr Oakeshott:
  You've flipped!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Lyne might be my first throw from the chamber.




Mr MORRISON:
  That means that that would completely put before the parliament complete discretion to enable the parliament to overturn any decision of an executive government, even if it were to accord with the requirement that it be a signatory to the convention.


This bill is no more than a carbon copy of the government's bill. Its attempt to rebirth the Malaysian people swap is no surprise. The member for Lyne is clearly doing the government's bidding, as always. (Time expired)

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (11:09):  I rise to indicate the government's support for the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012 moved by the honourable member for Lyne. I also indicate the government's intention to move some amendments based on legal and operational advice to improve the workability of the bill in practice. I welcome this move by the member for Lyne to find a way through the political impasse caused by the negativity of the opposition and their relentless opportunism. I am disappointed that the member for Cook is leaving the chamber because he does not want to be held to account for the inconsistencies in his contribution just a moment ago.


As the honourable member for Lyne indicated in his speech, 148 out of the 150 members of the House of Representatives recognise the need for offshore processing as an effective deterrent for dangerous boat travel to Australia. In fairness to the member for Denison and the member for Melbourne, while we fundamentally disagree with them, they have always held the position that there should not be offshore processing. But 148 other members indicate that they support offshore processing. But only those on the government side and some of the crossbenchers are prepared to put their vote where their mouth is by supporting either the government's legislation or the legislation moved by the honourable member for Lyne.


The opposition has stood in the way of legislation to allow offshore processing. It has ducked and weaved and introduced a spurious amendment designed solely and cynically to ensure that the government's arrangements with Malaysia cannot proceed. The member for Cook, in his remarks a few moments ago, said that we fail to understand the purpose of his amendment. We understand it very well: the purpose of his amendment is to stop the Malaysian agreement proceeding. Why? Because they are scared it will work. They are scared it will provide a deterrent for the dangerous boat travel to Australia. They are scared that a political issue for them will disappear.


We have heard from the honourable member for Cook and others about the importance of the refugee convention. I would be prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the opposition—that they had reflected on their position and reached a different position after reflection—if it were not for the hypocrisy shown by the fact that it remains their policy to turn boats around to a country that is not a signatory to the refugee convention, Indonesia. Just on the weekend we saw a very significant development in this field. It was the position of the opposition, up until the weekend, that they would turn boats around to Indonesia but that they would negotiate protections with Indonesia, presumably of a similar nature to those in the Malaysia agreement. They would negotiate. The Leader of the Opposition said that it would be fairly easy to negotiate these protections with Indonesia to ensure non-refoulement and other necessary treatment.


We saw the foreign minister of Indonesia in this building on Thursday describe the concept of turning boats around to Indonesia as impossible and ill-advised. He went on to say that that gave a hint of the approach that Indonesia would take to a proposal from the opposition should they ever form a government. What was the response of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Cook? Their response was to say, 'We don't care what Indonesia says. We'll do it anyway.' So much for negotiating protections; so much for negotiating some sort of mechanism to ensure that people are not refouled or that there is necessary and appropriate treatment for people returned. That has all gone out the window. They are going to turn boats around regardless of what Indonesia says.


This government believes in offshore processing because as part of a proper regional framework, through the Bali process—which ensures that the product that people smugglers choose to sell, which is permanent resettlement to Australia, is withdrawn—offshore processing can play a very important role in providing the disincentive for boat travel to Australia. This is very important. This saves lives. If this bill passes, it will save lives. That is how important it is. It will save the lives of people who are trying to get to Australia. It will enable us not only to implement the Malaysia agreement but also to say to people, 'We do not ask you to risk your life to get to Australia in order to provide you with a permanent visa.' We will be able to increase our refugee resettlement to Australia and we will be able to say to people, 'There is nothing moral or humanitarian about encouraging people to risk their lives to come to Australia.'


I am flagging that I will move amendments. The opposition says that this is a carbon copy and then points out the differences between the bill that I introduced in the House and the bill that the honourable member for Lyne has introduced. But I will be moving a handful of amendments which deal with the matter of assessing who is a participant in the Bali process—I will be moving that that be based on written advice from the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade—a safety valve to allow discretion for the minister, and some additional checks and balances to ensure that the bill is implemented appropriately. I commend the bill to the House. I commend the member for Lyne for his constructive approach, which is clearly different to the destructive approach taken by members of the— (Time expired)

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (11:14):  We need to realise why we are debating, yet again, measures in relation to offshore processing and in relation to stopping people smuggling. When the Labor Party came to office in 2007, they inherited a situation in which the previous Howard government had stopped people smuggling. We need to be very clear about that. We faced this situation at the turn of the millennium—2000-01—when the Howard government took tough but necessary measures that stopped people smuggling dead in its tracks. Once those measures were taken, the message went out loud and clear to people smugglers that Australia was closed for business. Once that message went out, and when the people smugglers tested the government and found that it did not buckle—the government stuck to its guns and insisted that Australia would remain in charge of who comes to Australia—the people smugglers got the message that they were not going to be welcome to practise their evil trade of bringing people into Australia illegally anymore. Once that message was sent, people smuggling stopped dead in its tracks, and the empirical evidence is impossible to argue.


From 2002 to 2007 we had in this country, on average, three illegal boat arrivals per year. Under this government we could have three in 48 hours. What happened once this evil trade was driven from business, was that the Labor Party thought they could come into office and make changes to that robust system of border protection without there being any consequences. So, when the Labor Party came to office, the then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, said that the dismantling of those tough measures—that is, offshore processing on the island nation of Nauru, and on Manus Island, PNG; temporary protection visas; and turning the boats back when it was appropriate and safe to do so—was his proudest day in office. That occurred in August 2008. From September 2008, people smugglers literally went back into business. From September 2008, one month after those changes were made, people smugglers again started to bring people to Australia illegally. And the situation accelerated, because the more success people smugglers have, the more the message goes back to the international community that Australia remains a soft touch and that people smugglers are going to be welcome to continue to ply their evil trade. Since that time, since August 2008, when the Labor Party made those quite frankly stupid decisions, we have had almost 16,000 people on almost 300 boats arrive in Australia illegally, courtesy of criminal gangs of people smugglers. That continues today and the problem continues to get worse and worse.


The Labor Party's response has been to adopt every possible policy prescription except one that actually works, and sadly the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012, which we are discussing today, brought in by the member for Lyne, is just a continuation of these failed policies. The idea that people want to see us 'compromise'—so-called—on offshore processing negates, I think, what the Australian people are actually looking for when it comes to people smuggling and people coming to Australia illegally. What the Australian people are looking for—what they tell me loud and clear when they raise this issue with me—is a solution. They do not want any more failed plans and they do not want any more of the gymnastics that we have seen from the Labor Party—adopting different positions but never actually adopting one that is going to work. They want the Australian government to adopt a position that is actually going to send the message loud and clear to people smugglers that Australia is no longer a soft touch and our borders are now closed. We will not do that until we adopt the full suite of measures that the coalition has used in the past to stop people smuggling. We need offshore processing but we need it on the island nation of Nauru or in another country which has adopted appropriate human rights protections—that is, a country that is a signatory to the UN convention on refugees—something that the minister, who just came in with his usual bluff and bluster, said not long ago was the right thing to do. In fact, he said it was morally imperative that we process people only in countries that have been signatories to that convention.


We also need to return to temporary protection visas. The product that people smugglers sell is permanent residence in Australia and when you undermine that you undermine that product. We also need to turn the boats back to Indonesia, from whence they came, when it is safe and appropriate to do so. (Time expired)

Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (11:20):  I have pleasure in rising to support this bill as it is to be amended by the government at later stages in discussion of the bill. This is an opportunity for this parliament to actually put its stamp on a solution to a problem and to have a solution to the problem that is apt for the second decade of the 21st century. To hear those opposite yearn for domestic policies of a decade ago without putting them in a regional or global context is sickening.


The member for Cook acknowledges that the Bali process was something put in place by a coalition government. The purpose, of course, of the Bali process was to handle the large influx of asylum seekers and to combat human trafficking in our region. Over 40 countries are members of the Bali process. International organisations such as the IOM and UNHCR are active participants. We are proud that this is a piece of policy, in an international sense, of Australia. Australia and Indonesia chair the Bali process; the steering committee has these two countries being joined by New Zealand and Thailand. What it does is in fact look at many of the issues that have been raised in this debate but, disappointingly, without great imagination by those opposite in the coalition.


One of the purposes of the Bali process is to assist countries to adopt best practices in asylum management in accordance with the principles of the refugee convention. Those opposite tell us that it is too hard to get involved, to sit down with the countries of the region and come up with a process that achieves that. Simply putting a signature on a piece of paper does not mean that that is going to happen. Look at Malaysia. Go to Malaysia. Understand how detention centres there actually operate. Understand how asylum seeker legislation actually operates, because there ain't much asylum seeker legislation.


The UNHCR, by de facto, are in charge of the processing of claims made by people who find themselves in Malaysia. They have gone out of their way to ensure that the dignity of these people is preserved, that they are given opportunities for economic development. Look at the actions of IOM in Sri Lanka, where they are involved in economic processes and projects to ensure that those that would leave a source country like Sri Lanka do not have reasons to leave that source country. We then look at what is happening in Malaysia and Indonesia, which are countries in transit. It galls me that a little over two years ago it was the President of the Republic of Indonesia that had to place on record statements that they have a greater understanding of the problems that confront Australia than the coalition can. He indicated the imperative of the Bali process, which recognises that people smuggling is a regional problem that requires a regional solution involving the origin, transit and destination countries working together. Two years after President Yudhoyono placed that on the record in his speech to the Australian parliament, we had to have the foreign minister of the Republic of Indonesia in a press conference in this place last week yet again remind the coalition of the importance of this cooperative attitude to the way in which we look at the problem of people smuggling throughout the region, and to look at it as a continuum.



In part, this is what this piece of legislation attempts to do. It attempts to recognise that the solution to this is putting in place regional processing centres. Under the agreement between Australia and Malaysia, that was what was to be achieved in Malaysia. This now enacts the legal niceties which would enable that to happen. It would enable that to happen in other places if, in fact, future governments decided that that should happen. That is what perplexes the Australian public. We have a piece of legislation that is being offered to the Australian parliament which would give this government the opportunity to put in place its agreement with Malaysia, and it would give any future government the opportunity to put in place any solution that they thought best fitted. I do not understand why we cannot continue to have this agreement. This piece of legislation enables the Australian parliament to deal with this in a positive manner. (Time expired)

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (10:58):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Let us cut to the chase in what has been the worst policy debate for Australian public policy in at least the past 20 years. The truth is that 148 of the 150 members of parliament in the House of Representatives agree that offshore assessment should be an option for executive government. 150 MPs recognise the status and worth of the Bali process as very good bipartisan work done in the regional Asia-Pacific forum. No MPs want lives lost at sea because the 43rd Parliament cannot resolve something that the vast majority of MPs want resolved. So I say to colleagues again: why can't we pass legislation through the House that 148 MPs, at least, support in principle?


I have asked all MPs to read and get to know the principles of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. They were circulated to colleagues last week. For me, they address the failure of the domestic policy debate in trying to deal with people smuggling via an asylum seeker and refugee debate. That will never provide a suitable answer for sustainable policy on people smuggling. Instead, we should look at the international bipartisan forum that focuses on people smuggling if we really do want to deal with this topic. The Bali process is it. Therefore, rather than questioning bilateralism within a humanitarian framework, we should be actively encouraging it, not just for Malaysia but for many creative and cooperative options. So long as there is a humanitarian backbone in any arrangement, so long as there is oversight by the parliament of any arrangement, we should be encouraging rather than discouraging such regional work.


This bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012, does it. It strongly encourages bilateral and multilateral regional agreements on people smuggling and does so within a recognised bipartisan, humanitarian framework. Yet, despite the support of 148 MPs in principle, we need to deal with the straw man in the room. I saw again today that Mr Abbott will not support anything offshore unless it is with UN refugee convention signatories only. This is not the position Mr Abbott and Mr Morrison took to the last election, and they have no mandate for this position. Worse, they are now arguing the complete opposite of what they took to the election and the complete opposite of what is on their own personal websites right now. In my view, they are all at sea on this key point of the importance of signatory status with regard to the UN refugee convention. I will read out several quotes from Mr Morrison's own website. Here is the first one, about the UN refugee convention:


The Convention provides no permanent rights to refugee status at all. 


Here is the second:


… the Refugee Convention is not infallible …


Here is another one:


A refugee in one jurisdiction is just as likely to be assessed as an economic migrant in another. 


And here is another:


Non-refoulement is the core protection provided by the Convention. This is now a welcome and generally accepted principle of international law, regardless of nation’s signatory status. It transcends the convention. 




Mr Morrison:
  True.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  I agree. I am hearing from Mr Morrison that it is all true. I agree with that. But let us not worry about onshore and offshore issues. Let us explore online and offline Scott Morrison and Tony Abbott. Online we see 'sensible Scott', who has just been saying he agrees—





Mr Morrison:

  The member for Cook!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Lyne needs to use people's appropriate titles.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  He has been talking about the principles within the refugee convention and their importance that transcends signatory status. Yet offline, for the press gallery, for talkback radio and for his leader, Tony Abbott, we see the complete opposite. If it is about a truth and values campaign that is being run pre-election and about who said what pre-election and post-election, this cuts to the heart of that position with regard to the coalition on migration policy. I raise this for two reasons. One is to expose the absolute front of the political positioning with regard to this topic. The second is an important one with regard to policy, and that is that online Scott Morrison—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member needs to use the member's title.




Mr OAKESHOTT:

It deserves to be supported. This bill puts the Bali process as the framework for allowing executive government to make decisions to deal with people smuggling in as humanitarian a way as we can, as per the member for Cook's very own website.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (11:04):  I am not surprised the member for Lyne would come into this place and seek to attack the coalition. He has done that on many occasions and he has shown more loyalty to the Prime Minister than at least 31 of the Prime Minister's own colleagues, including the member who is at the table today.



Ms Hall interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Shortland will resume her seat. The member for Cook has five minutes and he will be relevant to the bill or I will sit him down. The member for Cook has the call.




Mr MORRISON:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was just addressing the previous member's remarks and attacks on the coalition.


In August last year the High Court struck down the government's Malaysian people swap because of the failure of that arrangement to satisfy the human rights protections set out in section 198A of the Migration Act. Rather than seek to create a new and more objective test to ensure that human rights protections were maintained for offshore processing, the government simply sought to abolish them. The coalition rightly rejected this approach. Instead the coalition proposed an amendment after the High Court decision to insert into the act a new, more objective test for human rights protections—that any country to be designated an offshore processing country must be a signatory to the refugee convention.


The coalition's amendment to the government's bill provided a clear, objective and universally recognised standard of protection that does not require judicial interpretation. That was the position we adopted for good reason after the decision of the High Court. The member for Lyne claims that the bill before us, the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012, incorporates the coalition's amendments to the government's legislation. It simply does not. The coalition only had one amendment to the government's legislation and it is not included in this bill.


The member for Lyne's bill restates the government's bill by repealing section 198A and fails to replace it with a binding human rights protection measure that can be objectively determined, thereby constraining the scope for judicial review, which was a key purpose of our amendment. This is the only objective standard that creates legally binding obligations available to establish the presence of protections. Paragraph 117 of the High Court judgment on the Malaysian people swap makes this position very clear. It states:


What is clear is that signatories to the Refugees Convention and the Refugees Protocol are bound to accord to those who have been determined to be refugees the rights that are specified in those instruments including the rights earlier described.


Paragraph 125 also states:


A country ""provides access"" to effective procedures for assessing the need for protection of persons seeking asylum of the kind described in s 198A(3)(a)(i) … if it is bound, as a matter of international obligation …


The argument that the inclusion of nonrefoulement and orderly assessment provisions in section 198AB accommodates the coalition's amendment completely fails to understand the purpose of our amendment and indeed the High Court decision. This bill explicitly now states in section 198AB(6) that the protections proposed—or assurances, they are termed—are not legally binding. In addition, the selection of the Bali process as the alternative test to the UN refugee convention fails to understand the role and purpose of that forum. We should know; we introduced it. Participation in that forum creates no obligation on participating members, let alone obligations that are legally binding.


The member for Lyne's claim that this bill provides higher humanitarian standards than have ever existed in Australia before is completely false. The fact is that this bill would allow the Malaysian people swap deal to proceed. That is proof enough. However, as noted, the protections the member for Lyne advocates are not legally binding.



Mr Oakeshott interjecting—




Mr MORRISON:
  This makes them deficient to the provisions currently in the act that he proposes to abolish that were established by the coalition and that were used by the High Court to strike down the Malaysian people swap. They are also deficient to the coalition amendment, as the UN refugee convention creates legally binding obligations. There are other problems with this bill, and I will be inviting the minister to make his observations on those.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I do not think that is up to the member for Cook.




Mr MORRISON:
  I am sure that he will be equally concerned about the definition of 'party' within this to the Bali process. The definition is ambiguous and it creates further legal opportunities, I think, to create uncertainty around this issue. Secondly, the bill requires the rules of natural justice to apply. That is something the minister himself in his own bill around this matter sought to have removed. Thirdly, the bill establishes the designation of an offshore processing country as a legislative instrument.

They want the Australian government to adopt a position that is actually going to send the message loud and clear to people smugglers that Australia is no longer a soft touch and our borders are now closed. We will not do that until we adopt the full suite of measures that the coalition has used in the past to stop people smuggling. We need offshore processing but we need it on the island nation of Nauru or in another country which has adopted appropriate human rights protections—that is, a country that is a signatory to the UN convention on refugees—something that the minister, who just came in with his usual bluff and bluster, said not long ago was the right thing to do. In fact, he said it was morally imperative that we process people only in countries that have been signatories to that convention.


We also need to return to temporary protection visas. The product that people smugglers sell is permanent residence in Australia and when you undermine that you undermine that product. We also need to turn the boats back to Indonesia, from whence they came, when it is safe and appropriate to do so. (Time expired)

Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (11:20):  I have pleasure in rising to support this bill as it is to be amended by the government at later stages in discussion of the bill. This is an opportunity for this parliament to actually put its stamp on a solution to a problem and to have a solution to the problem that is apt for the second decade of the 21st century. To hear those opposite yearn for domestic policies of a decade ago without putting them in a regional or global context is sickening.


The member for Cook acknowledges that the Bali process was something put in place by a coalition government. The purpose, of course, of the Bali process was to handle the large influx of asylum seekers and to combat human trafficking in our region. Over 40 countries are members of the Bali process. International organisations such as the IOM and UNHCR are active participants. We are proud that this is a piece of policy, in an international sense, of Australia. Australia and Indonesia chair the Bali process; the steering committee has these two countries being joined by New Zealand and Thailand. What it does is in fact look at many of the issues that have been raised in this debate but, disappointingly, without great imagination by those opposite in the coalition.


One of the purposes of the Bali process is to assist countries to adopt best practices in asylum management in accordance with the principles of the refugee convention. Those opposite tell us that it is too hard to get involved, to sit down with the countries of the region and come up with a process that achieves that. Simply putting a signature on a piece of paper does not mean that that is going to happen. Look at Malaysia. Go to Malaysia. Understand how detention centres there actually operate. Understand how asylum seeker legislation actually operates, because there ain't much asylum seeker legislation.


The UNHCR, by de facto, are in charge of the processing of claims made by people who find themselves in Malaysia. They have gone out of their way to ensure that the dignity of these people is preserved, that they are given opportunities for economic development. Look at the actions of IOM in Sri Lanka, where they are involved in economic processes and projects to ensure that those that would leave a source country like Sri Lanka do not have reasons to leave that source country. We then look at what is happening in Malaysia and Indonesia, which are countries in transit. It galls me that a little over two years ago it was the President of the Republic of Indonesia that had to place on record statements that they have a greater understanding of the problems that confront Australia than the coalition can. He indicated the imperative of the Bali process, which recognises that people smuggling is a regional problem that requires a regional solution involving the origin, transit and destination countries working together. Two years after President Yudhoyono placed that on the record in his speech to the Australian parliament, we had to have the foreign minister of the Republic of Indonesia in a press conference in this place last week yet again remind the coalition of the importance of this cooperative attitude to the way in which we look at the problem of people smuggling throughout the region, and to look at it as a continuum.



In part, this is what this piece of legislation attempts to do. It attempts to recognise that the solution to this is putting in place regional processing centres. Under the agreement between Australia and Malaysia, that was what was to be achieved in Malaysia. This now enacts the legal niceties which would enable that to happen. It would enable that to happen in other places if, in fact, future governments decided that that should happen. That is what perplexes the Australian public. We have a piece of legislation that is being offered to the Australian parliament which would give this government the opportunity to put in place its agreement with Malaysia, and it would give any future government the opportunity to put in place any solution that they thought best fitted. I do not understand why we cannot continue to have this agreement. This piece of legislation enables the Australian parliament to deal with this in a positive manner. (Time expired)

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (11:25):  This is a very important motion which I am bringing to the House today, supported by a number of my colleagues from the coalition, because we do have a crisis right now—a crisis in the number of agriculture-related courses being offered, in the numbers of graduates, in the demands and needs of agribusiness in Australia and in the growing global food task that we are in danger of not being able to meet.


The Australian agricultural industry does have excellent career opportunities. There are over 100,000 jobs in the agricultural sector right across Australia, whether in horticulture or in other production sectors in animal husbandry or in cropping, whether in research and development or in the growing of markets for produce. There is a wide range of domestic and international jobs associated with the agricultural sector. Yet we have a situation in Australia today where there are fewer people working in agribusiness when compared to any other sector, given the size and the contribution of the sector to Australia's economy. There is a diverse range of career opportunities which require a whole range of skill levels.


We have an understanding of the growing food task internationally. Part of that global food task is the need for more refined foods and higher value foods. Australia is amazingly well-situated to provide much of the value for exports into that growing global food market, yet we have this crisis back home.


We also have to recognise that it is not just a matter of throwing dollars at increasing the numbers of places, or subsidised places, with registered training organisations, in TAFE institutions or at universities, although that is a very important part of the solution. I note that today—and I have no doubt that the speaker to follow me will stress this long and hard—the government has reannounced the commitment it made in the last budget to further education and training. The tragedy, when you look at what the government has committed to the area of agribusiness training and at what grants have been put into the system, is that virtually nothing has gone to this agricultural education sector. For decades now, it has been hugely ignored.


There is a skills deficit crisis in the agricultural sector. Across the nation, the agrifood industry is facing a critical lack of people. In 2012, the decline in Australian agriculture related graduate rates, the decline in the numbers of agricultural science and agribusiness academics, the decline in the levels of agricultural sector research and development, and the slowing rate of agricultural productivity growth are all indisputable and well-documented facts. 


On the other hand, the opportunities for agribusiness production and domestic and export sales are growing exponentially. We are in a situation where we could meet the demands; but we are starving the sector of trained personnel. The number of agricultural graduates produced nationally falls short of the calculated needs by a factor of as much as 6 to 1. In particular, there are very few graduates taking up the opportunity to take a higher degree by research in agriculture— these would be the innovators of the next generation. This is not altogether surprising, given that the postgraduate research scholarships on offer hover around the poverty line level of support, paying much less than a graduate salary, and there is also a focus on short-term projects funded by soft money, as many have observed. As a person in your late 20s, if you want to go into postgraduate research you really have to have someone else paying your way. In comparison with other sectors in the economy, agriculture has a far lower proportion of graduates working in it. It has also been found that when an agricultural enterprise employs relevant graduates they have measurable increases in productivity. If you can find yourself a graduate, you know that they are going to do more than earn their keep in a very short time. In a 2009 submission to the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council the Australian Council of Deans of Agriculture stated:


Maintaining the productivity of agriculture and helping the industry meet future challenges, including climate change, will require underpinning research together with strong professional input and a well trained production workforce. The low number of graduates and doctoral students entering agriculture puts this at risk.


We know the farm dependent economy represents about 12 per cent of the national GNP. The industry exports around two-thirds of what it produces and contributes in the order of 15 per cent to 20 per cent of export earnings to the national economy. Yet there has been a steady decline in the output of graduates in agriculture from universities, TAFEs and anywhere else you can find them over the last decade and that is despite the fact that jobs are going begging.


Why have we got this enormous disconnect between jobs available and future demand for the output of the sector and younger people prepared to go into this industry? Another dimension of this is the ageing population of the agricultural sector. What is the problem? The problem quite simply is a loss of a sense of a future in this industry sector. It has been hard hit by government policy, particularly in the last five years. Take, for example, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. We have just met with representatives of the National Irrigators Council a few steps from here and those irrigators right around the Murray-Darling Basin say to us: 'Give us a break. We can prosper in the agribusiness sector of Australia. We are some of the world's most innovative and highly productive rice growers. We still have the capacity to grow some of the finest wool fibre in the world. We do a magnificent job with our fruit and dairy production at low costs. Our competitors internationally are 40 per cent subsidised. Australia's highest level of agriculture subsidy never gets above four per cent. We with New Zealand are the lowest in terms of government support in the globe in a developed country.'


Farmers are being hit hard by the carbon tax costs coming down the line and by the taking of irrigation water for no justifiable or demonstrable environmental outcome. Farmers are environmentalists. The people who work in agribusiness are environmentalists—they have to be to survive—but when they are told that they will be the ones who will earn the green votes for Labor by transferring their water from the food and fibre production account to the environment in the Basin Plan with no demonstrable outcome for the environment then farmers lose heart. No wonder their sons and daughters, the younger generation of rural based people, who could be going to regional universities, TAFE colleges or RTOs, look at their parents working so hard, investing incredible amounts in assets—$2 million to $3 million to start a farm—look at the high risk in the sector, given this government's response to it, and say: 'It's not for us. We will go and earn a salary somewhere in the public sector. We will go across to the mining sector. Agribusiness is too hard for us to invest years in training and then expect a reasonable career.' This is a tragedy for this country. This really must be re-addressed.


The Australian population has to understand where food comes from. We have just seen amazing research which found that a lot of our children think that avocados are manufactured and that a dairy product is not something that comes from an animal. They do not know that socks are made of a fibre that is grown on a plant. There is this enormous disconnect between what our Australian population understands about their food security and their fibre, and who produces it and how. This has to change if we are going to have a future for agribusiness in Australia. Our universities have to be given a lot more support in terms of bursaries and cadetships. Our younger people have to be resold the notion that agribusiness is a magnificent sector and one with an enormous future that they have to grasp with both hands. We have to make sure that our smaller primary schools and secondary schools which have land attached to them—they often do—are developed for agribusiness studies. A whole range of jobs have to be done right now. The sector cannot do it by themselves. They need a partnership with state and federal governments. That partnership is going begging as far as the federal government is concerned, and I am sure that in a few minutes we will be told by the government's representative that it is all okay because a few hundreds of millions or a billion or so were thrown at it in the last budget. That is not good enough. We have to make sure that our training establishments have the resources to offer good courses and that the marketing of agribusiness is effectively and appropriately managed in Australia. It is not just a case of changing the name 'agriculture'; it is about making sure that the prospects for the sector are well understood and that we have our brightest and best men and women entering agriculture. That focus will probably need to be with our tertiary institutions in the regions.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (11:35):  I thank my birth mate, the member for Murray, for putting this motion forward. I agree with many of the sentiments of the member for Murray but I just do not agree with some of the political assessments that came from it. But I will agree with the member for Murray when she quite rightly mentioned that we have had decades of neglect and not necessarily neglect in just the last five years. There is no doubt that we very much need active, realistic partnerships with industry and with local, state and federal governments.


We recognise that Australian farmers do the hard work involved in producing, processing, handling and selling produce from something like 136,000 farm businesses across the country, 99 per cent of which are owned by Australians. The work generates something like $405 billion each year. This is a staggering figure. In addition, Australian farmers make a significant contribution to feeding people in a range of countries overseas and to global food security. In our own region, by 2020 half the world's population will be on Australia's doorstep, which represents an unparalleled opportunity for our farmers and the farm sectors.


More recently, positive news was put out by ABARES and by KPMG, in its Expanding horizons report. Most of the data clearly indicates that the Australian agricultural sector has for the first time in many years something positive to look forward to. We need—and I agree with the member for Murray—to encourage, nurture and support this vital industry.


The other thing we need to be careful of is the matter of people associating agriculture with farming—and there is nothing wrong with this. Farming is absolutely crucial but agriculture is more than just farming. The industry itself goes right across the board. It is like the food chain. One end is developing technologies and innovations that follow right through the whole chain of farming and agriculture, and these developments go right through to transport, to developing things in labs, to developing different species of plants or fibres or whatever else the case may be. This extends through to the transport system, to people providing for those on farms and to scientists—right across the board, as the member for Murray quite rightly pointed out.


So, when we talk about agriculture we are talking about exciting prospects. Yet, as the member for Murray quite rightly pointed out, in the Food fibre and the future ACER report, which was released recently, what was terrifying was not so much the trivial pursuit stuff about where yoghurt comes from. We have to be fair about this. In our day we had families related to people on the land so you actually visited the farm and had some idea of what farmers did and what was involved in farming. You saw a relationship between what happened there and what was going on in the supermarket shelves and what was happening in your house, because you actually did it on the spot. So, I can understand the trivial pursuit thing: where is yoghurt from—some kids thought cotton came from the moon—and so forth. What really upset me about this was the lack of appreciation by teachers and students of associating innovation and agriculture. I have just been doing some reading about the early New South Wales colony, and we would not have survived without innovation by those very early farmers. The whole history of Australian agriculture is a history of innovation. Yet in the Food, Fibre and the Future survey, barely the majority of students associated innovation with agriculture. There seemed to be no relationship. It was phenomenal. What made it even worse, when you analysed the figures, was that many students thought there was little relationship between science and agriculture, little development and change of inputs into agriculture for a productive outcome. It was extraordinary. I do not know what they think happens in our farming enterprises and in agriculture, but all I can tell you is that that survey was a worry.


How do we go about trying to correct some of this? That is part of what the Member for Murray has raised. This government is keen to do something about it in a practical sense. The National Farmers Federation is doing something, with its Blueprint for Australian Agriculture, and we are, with the national food plan, trying to develop with the industry. I attended a workshop recently hosted by the National Farmers Federation—a very good one with many industry representatives. One of the things that came out from that forum was that the industry needed to talk with one voice. 


Everybody in this chamber is very supportive of this industry. I know you are. I have listened to you over the years. You have come forward with terrific ideas. Irrespective of the politics, we need to get it on the agenda. When you have 100 representatives from different aspects of the industry and they are all asking for different things at times—yet when you really sift through it they are asking for similar things—you have to say to yourself that the industry has a responsibility to get itself organised so that it presents an appropriate image to the public, to the government and to itself about what it is and where it wants to be, particularly by 2050.  I do not know, colleagues, whether you have had an opportunity yet to have a look at the KPMG's Expanding horizons: key highlights, agribusiness in Australia 2011/12. It is worth a look. It looks towards trying to get some coherence in terms of industry, government and community about where agriculture and agricultural businesses should be in the future. That means working more collaboratively, having a coherent view and being able to present that.


One of the other things that tends to emerge from this—and I do not want to be too negative about this—is to do with the image of the industry. The industry has a responsibility in this regard—along with us; we are stewards equally with the industry, both the government and the representatives of parties that may form government. What is the image of the industry itself? The industry has been going through very difficult times for well over a decade. The problem is that what the public tend to get and the media tend to push is the negatives, the challenges, the problems. Yet when you meet and talk with farmers, farming organisations and representatives, you find energetic, enthusiastic, hard-headed, realistic, frank-talking people who tell it as it is. They often tell you how serious it is and then, when you dig deeper with them—excuse the pun—when you go beyond the surface, they also tell you how fantastic it is, what prospects are available, what opportunities exist. The ABARES materials, which we are all aware of now, clearly point out that agriculture has a fantastic future, not just here but in feeding the world.


I had the great privilege recently of leading a delegation into the ASEAN region, and some of the messages that came out of it were very positive, including, first and foremost, Australia's fantastic reputation for having innovative food and fibre manufacturers and producers. So take a pat on the back. We do not encourage or nurture that enough. The second thing that came through is the whole framework of food safety about our agriculture products, in particular, and the produce that we export. It is food security in the sense of not just being able to grow it but also certification. I know we overregulate; I know we get problems with this all the time. Australian food is safe and secure and we can develop and expand it—and they want it. We have a burgeoning middle class ready to buy premium product, and we need to get on that wagon. The third thing they said is, 'Why are you afraid of our investment? We want to co-invest with you; we want to be part of your production; we want to be part of your processing. Use our marketing techniques and our abilities and networks and come over here and train instead of us going the other way so we can participate in this with you.' So we do have terrific opportunities. I agree with the member for Murray. We all have to do a lot more about it, and that goes for the industries and training organisations as well.

Mr BRUCE SCOTT
 (Maranoa—Second Deputy Speaker) (11:45):  I want to congratulate the member for Murray for putting this motion before the House. It is one of those very critical issues that could be lost in the general discussion or the political thrust of this place, but let us hope it is not. Let us hope that people on both sides of this House will rise to the challenge that is before all of us.


This year has been designated the Australian Year of the Farmer, and there is no better opportunity than to keep a debate like this going every week in this place. Too often I hear people on both sides of the House talking about people in a derogatory way and saying, 'They're just farmers; that's over in cockies corner. Those people—who may come from leafy suburbs or from outer metropolitan areas—are fed by the Australian farmers each and every day and their families are fed by farmers each and every day. The importance of agriculture cannot be understated. If we do not look at the alarm bells that are now ringing and do something about making sure that we get a new generation moving into agriculture, we are going to find that in 30 to 40 years' time not only will we be flat out producing enough affordable food for ourselves but many parts of the world will find themselves in a situation of starvation. There are also many right now that are in a state of starvation.


Australian farmers—and there are 135,000 farms in Australia—do an extraordinary job, but too few of their children or relatives are taking up the challenge of agriculture in the future. Those 135,000 farms feed 60 million mouths every day: 22 million Australians—we produce almost 98 per cent of the food we eat in Australia, and fibre—and another 38 to 40 million people in many other parts of the world.


We are talking about jobs here in Australia, and that is what this motion is all about. Something like 1.6 million Australians are employed directly or indirectly in the agricultural sector. The parliamentary secretary who spoke before me spoke not just about working on the farm but also about the agricultural industry beyond the farm gate—the extension work, the agribusiness, the food technology areas. There are a whole lot of very exciting sectors that young people should be made more aware of as a career path. There could be no more noble an occupation than to be a food or fibre producer in Australia and to participate in the great challenge that the world is facing in meeting the need to feed the world in the years to come. It should start at school, as the member for Murray highlights in her motion. Where is it in the first year reading book when kids, at that very impressionable age, are starting to understand where food comes from? When I went to school, in the year 1 reader—it might have been the prep 1 reader—there were stories about visiting a farm and about the very basic forms of agriculture and food so that children young enough to be in their first year at school could start to learn about the source of the food in their lunch box or the food they had for little lunch or at home at night. It sounds very basic but we have to start there; it is all about education. The other thing is to make sure that in our national curriculum there is an opportunity to promote the importance of an agricultural career as a pathway to a very noble occupation in the future. The other thing I want to see is money invested in research and development. For far too long, not only in Australia but around the world, agricultural research has taken not second place or third place but is way down the end of the line when it comes to money being invested in research and development. There seems to be more money going into developing new and faster chips for computers, iPhones and all that other gadgetry than there is going into agriculture—so that we can meet this huge challenge that the world has in relation to feeding the world by 2050, when they say that we have to produce as much food in the next 40 years as we have produced in the last 1,000 years. It is a huge challenge. Do not quote me as being accurate on those figures, but it is of that magnitude.


I commend this motion to both sides of the House. In this forthcoming budget, let us make sure that there is more money for R&D for agriculture in this year of the farmer.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham—Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (11:50):  It is with pleasure I take this opportunity to speak on the motion moved by the member for Murray before the House today. I managed in my office to catch some of the contributions before I ran very quickly to get here to join the debate. I certainly acknowledge the great thought and commitment to this important area of industry that has been expressed by all of the speakers in the debate today.


It is certainly the case that the government agrees that the Australian agricultural industry does offer great opportunities for higher education and vocational education and training graduates. We acknowledge the importance of ensuring that key industries, such as the agribusiness sector, have the skilled workforce that they need.


While we agree with the spirit of the motion, we believe that agreeing to it as this time would be premature, and I will outline why we have that view. As members opposite would be aware the important issue is currently being examined across a number of inquiries. The Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations is conducting an inquiry into all aspects of higher education and skills training to support future demand in agriculture and agribusiness in Australia. As well, the Senate Select Committee on Australia's Food Processing Sector is due to report by 30 June 2012. Australia's Chief Scientist, Professor Ian Chubb, is leading a review of Australia's science, education, research and development outputs, which is set for publication in the first quarter of this year. The government is also developing Australia's first-ever national food plan, to ensure that the government's policy settings are right for Australia over the short, medium and long term. Once these inquiries are concluded, we will examine those findings closely in order to respond appropriately to them.


The government is aware that research by the Australian Council of Deans of Agriculture, for example, points to a shortfall in the number of university qualified graduates needed to meet the number of jobs in the agribusiness sector. We also understand that a decline in agricultural science enrolments is resulting in shortages of agricultural scientists and consultants, particularly for more senior positions and in remote areas.


The Labor government is committed to supporting up-skilling and participation in key industries, including this one. The government provided the University of Western Sydney with nearly $1 million to create an agriculture and food alliance with the University of Sydney. This alliance, among other projects, will build interest in agriculture among high school students. The previous speaker talked about the importance of teaching children at an early age to take a love for this particular area. It will also establish outreach programs in order to help increase student enrolments.


Nationally, a third of Australian universities offer places in agriculture related courses at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, with most universities offering related courses in business and science fields as well. The learning and training opportunities are there, and this government is making information available to help people make decisions about study and careers in agriculture. This includes the Job Guide, Australian Jobs and the My University website. The importance of getting new students into agriculture related courses is not lost on the government. Agriculture units of study receive the highest rate of government funding, $20,284 per Commonwealth supported place in 2012. The Labor government's higher education reforms will have a positive flow-on effect for participation in agribusiness education and training. As the government transforms the higher education landscape, agricultural science will be among the many disciplines benefiting from a boost to the number of enrolments around the country as well as improved access for regional students. The Australian agricultural industry offers a diverse range of careers requiring a wide range of skill levels, and agribusiness will be a beneficiary of the reform agenda. 


One of a number of challenges for all Australian governments under this reform agenda is to deliver a more responsive vocational education and training system which includes supporting growth in the system that is targeted to the areas of industry need. As part of the negotiation of the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development $1.7 billion is on the table for states and territories to work with the Commonwealth in transforming and reforming the training system, in particular to target it more effectively to meet the area of skills need by industries.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (11:56):  It gives me a great deal of pleasure to use this opportunity to support the member for Murray in this private member's motion. So much has been done recently in relation to investigating the situation, and reports will be written, and I would like to think that some of those reports will be heeded and actual budgetary amounts will be allocated to the problem. But more often than not that is not what we have seen, especially from this government, and I am sorry to say I cannot see the point of view of the opposite side that this is a shared responsibility. Since Labor came to office we have seen agricultural investment reduced from $3.8 billion to $1.8 billion and of course half of the $1.8 billion is funded at industry level. So it is all very well to say that both sides of politics have not done the right thing and made the investment, but the evidence is there for all to observe that never has funding been slashed to the point that it has in the last periods of Labor government. 


We need to do more. We need to realise that today an agricultural career is not seen as a sexy pursuit. It is not a case of there being bad press for agriculture; the reality is that in the big wide world of advertising and social media there is no press. That is what we are suffering. We are seeing cuts by government in spending, we are seeing an under-rating of the whole food task by the Labor government, and we need to prove with budget measures that we really do have an equal view of this issue. There is a lot being said today of a platitude nature and we need to see hard cash. When you take money out of the agricultural industry it does not matter where it hits, whether you take it out of quarantine inspections and therefore expose us to threats to biosecurity or whether you take it out of direct funding or whether you avoid putting it into tertiary courses and allow other courses to be better subsidised, and you have a situation where overseas paying students are paying full fees and they are all doing professional courses other than agriculture because their parents back home in Asia see agriculture as a peasant pursuit and do not value it highly. All these things are a problem.


In 2050 we are expecting a world population of nine billion. Australia needs to double its food production. We need to double our food production task today. To do that we are going to need an increased value of science and of quality of science. We need to be ever vigilant in relation to biosecurity, because it is no good simply looking at the current situation. As the world evolves we are being more and more exposed to biosecurity problems and we need the top performers, the top scientifically minded tertiary students, to devote their studies to agriculture, to science generally, and we need to make sure that we have got the best minds working into the future giving us good, solid biosecurity in this world. We need a government that is prepared to put money into customs inspections also, not take it away. We need to have a situation where we are making the investments that this industry is truly due. We have all manner of things competing with tertiary education for agriculture today. The professions are getting the status of being where young students with bright minds ought to go. It is an easy life. It is a clean life. It is a highly promoted life in the media today. Who reads on the front page about the goings-on of Farmer Brown back in the boondocks, as the city viewers would see it to be? No-one. It came to my mind while I was researching this that Sylvania Waters did more for the house construction industry than all manner of talking in parliament. Maybe we do need to see a future where shows like The Farmer Wants a Wife are a little more promoted, because we need to get the idea that there is a future for agriculture back into the minds of young secondary students so that they are prepared to take up tertiary education in the field.

Mr LYONS
 (Bass) (12:01):  I rise to speak on the motion put forward by the member for Murray, who, as we have just heard, spoke on the importance of career opportunities in the agricultural sector. With this year being the Year of the Farmer, it is a fitting topic for discussion. As I said when I spoke recently about this year being the Year of the Farmer, agriculture offers a special way of life for so many families around Australia. Some farms are handed down over generations. Other people are brought into farming life. It is estimated that approximately 319,800 people are in the agricultural workforce in Australia. Working in the agricultural sector is open to a wide range of people from different backgrounds who all have differing skill levels. Farming is not just about knowing how to work the land; it requires a high level of knowledge and includes many skill areas of science, innovation and business. It also requires a hardworking attitude and strong commitment and passion.


The agriculture sector in Australia is vibrant and has a strong future. With this in mind, we need to be growing our workforce in this sector to keep up with demand. With Australia producing so many quality items, the demand is sure to continue to grow. As a society we need to be strongly encouraging more people to consider careers in the agricultural sector. Figures indicate that there are not enough students graduating from quality tertiary institutions to meet the requirements of the industry. This is concerning, and that is why we need more students to consider working in the industry. The opportunities in the industry are enormous and it offers great rewards. To keep our nation clothed and fed, to grow and to sell wonderful fresh produce and importantly, to see their bumper crop being harvested and know that all of their hard work has paid off are the greatest rewards of a farmer.


As a nation we need to encourage new people into farming. The exciting career options for young people in the agricultural sector need to be constantly highlighted to ensure that our farming communities remain strong and resilient into the future. While a career in the agriculture sector may not be the first idea that crosses a student's mind, as a society we need to make this a consideration for people. Industry, government, farmers and education bodies should work collaboratively to encourage more students to actively consider a career in agriculture. Agricultural units also receive a high rate of government funding at university level.


We need to educate our children from a young age about farmers and their vital role in society. I have heard stories recently about children who do not understand where milk actually comes from. Recent studies have also indicated that many students, and even some teachers, are not aware of the importance of innovation, research and development in agriculture. This is concerning, as concepts such as this are the core of the farming industry. To research, create and develop farming practice and then put it into action is at the core of most farming enterprises. It is concepts such as these that students need to be taught in schools, so that the agricultural sector is more widely and better understood. Let us make sure that students understand that there is more to the industry than the image of negativity that is often shown in the media. Yes, there are hard times but there are also great rewards to accompany a special way of life. It is important that our children know, understand and can contribute as farmers to society. Let us start educating our children and our communities so that we can support our farmers and recognise exactly what they do for our nation—such as providing fresh produce for everyone to enjoy. Let us also encourage our youth to consider agriculture as a career. There are so many exciting career possibilities in the agricultural sector and they require a range of skills and an ever-increasing workforce to meet the increasing demand.


The agricultural sector requires inventors, innovators, adaptors and researchers—those who can battle the vagaries of nature and who are rewarded by the product of hard work. If we as Australians are to maintain our quality of life, we must encourage people to be educated and to work in the agricultural sector.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (12:06):  I am delighted to speak on this motion moved by my friend and colleague the member for Murray. Globally, agricultural commodity prices are expected to continue to remain strong. Rural exports increased 4.7 per cent in the December 2011 quarter. The gross value of Australian farm production in 2010-11 was $48.7 billion. There are approximately 134,000 farm businesses in Australia, and Australian farms produce almost 93 per cent of Australia's domestic food supply. It was indeed agriculture, not mining, that saved this country from the global financial crisis. 


The opportunities offered by the agricultural sector are enormous. Huge and increasing demand by our Asian neighbours provides Australia with a market on our doorstep. As these nations become more affluent, so their demand for the high-quality produce of Australia will grow. Unfortunately, far too many employment opportunities in the sector go begging. Australians are not seriously considering the benefits of working in the agricultural sector. And it is not just one-sided. I do not believe that the institutions that offer courses are truly stepping up to the plate. It is well known that it is expensive to offer courses in agriculture. It is expensive to take students to visit the areas where they might one day work in agricultural science. It is expensive to bring that expertise into a university, which is why the regional universities are so well placed to do this. But Hawkesbury Agricultural College was unable to offer a first-year program this year, as fewer than 10 students had enrolled. Unfortunately this is a growing trend. With Australia failing to graduate sufficient students to fill the available positions, 2.5 jobs go begging for every student that graduates.


The array of possible jobs on offer is incredibly vast. Agricultural college students learn about animal husbandry, weather patterns, environmental issues and farm management. There is a strong science focus, meaning that those who will work with our farmers of the future have incredible knowledge and expertise.

Ms LEY:
  My own electorate of Farrer is built on agricultural foundations: cattle; cereals; wheat; rice; grapevines, citrus, table grapes and other forms of horticulture; vegetables; and sheep. On the topic of sheep I should mention that the town of Booligal celebrates the annual sheep races on Easter Saturday and even provides the opportunity for you to hire a sheep for the day if you would like to. Deniliquin is also prime sheep country, close to the home of the original Peppin Merino sheep. A hundred and fifty years ago the Peppin brothers managed to breed a merino better suited to the hot and dry plains of western NSW, and they certainly succeeded.


Innovation, of course, is the key to the continuing encouragement and forward momentum of the agriculture sector. The main innovators apart from farmers—they do not need to go anywhere to be innovators, but many of them have completed agricultural science degrees—are the people who work with them in the local and state departments of agriculture. They are the people who need to have the technical training to enable them to bring to the innovation task the tools to really drive forward the agriculture sector in this country. That is why the workforce issues around our jobs in agriculture lead back to the planning issues, which are where the training task that has to be done by agricultural colleges, schools and universities is failing so very, very badly. I am very pleased that the member for Murray has brought this motion to the House today. As I mentioned in my remarks before the division, it is not easy for agricultural colleges to run courses, but I encourage them to do just that. Everywhere you look, you see courses in environmental science, and, important though that is, it is really not the whole answer. In rural Australia we have a plethora of environmental science courses, and I meet graduates when I attend university graduation ceremonies—many brilliant people are now very well trained in environmental science—but I wish that there were more agricultural science on offer. I hope that the current government can listen to the words that have been spoken on this motion. On our side of politics, with many members from rural areas, we are very, very committed to this task. We look forward to promoting agricultural graduates into the future. In this, the Year of the Farmer, we must do more to celebrate the agriculture sector.

Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (12:36):  I thank the member for Murray for bringing to the House this motion on the important role that agriculture plays in the Australian economy. I believe that it highlights what the Australian government is already doing to encourage young people to be involved in ag business as a career and to get people to invest in ag businesses.


Agriculture, of course, is a big part of Australia's history. For many decades, wool has been grown. A bit down the track after early settlement, in the 1800s, it proved to be easy to put wool onto ships and get it back to the mills of England. Further down the track, we got the reefer boats that could take frozen meat, and that market grew as well.


In my electorate of Lyons, in Tasmania, agriculture plays a big part in my constituents' lives. Tasmania has 68,300 square kilometres of land, and one-third of this is committed to agriculture. Tasmania's mild climate, clean water—




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from 12:37 to 13:16





Mr ADAMS:
  Before the suspension I was talking about the need for agricultural skill base in Australia and I was talking about Tasmania having a lot of great water and establishing the water advantage for Tasmania, with about 10 per cent of the amount of water that falls on Australia falling in Tasmania on about 1½ per cent of the landmass. The opportunities to use this is quite good, but we need high-tech agriculture, in irrigation technology, to take advantage of those opportunities.


In relation to the skill base, up at Smithton this government is establishing an agTAS trade college. That will provide great opportunities for young people in that region and other regions to get a skill base in this area. To encourage young people into agriculture we certainly need to have modern work practices and management needs to be modern in the way that they deal with young people. We know that young people want to have a continuing pathway into learning and they want to continue to be well aware of health and safety issues. So those things need to be high on the agenda.


The next generation certainly will not work like the old shepherds of Tasmania that I knew as a boy around the estates where I grew up—and those in the families referred to by Gwen Hardstaff in her book Cider gums and currawongs—working 12 hours a day, riding horses in weather, as those old guys did. So we need to be modern in the way that we look at it. Down in Tasmania the University of Tasmania have a great ag science facility which enables students to study agriculture, but we certainly do need to work on modern and innovative ways to assist the farming communities to deal with climate change and carbon capture and the latest direction in which farms are going. We need modern management techniques to make sure that people have the opportunity to move forward.


In my area the number of contractor workers in the ag area is growing, but they certainly need a skill base. In the poppy industry we have certificate I and II right through to the trades area. Of course, degree levels are very high in that industry—working in the process sector of the poppy industry. And they are always crying out for plumbers and electricians around the pivot areas and making sure that people are capable and competent to be able to keep those areas going. High-tech farming, with a high-level skill base, is what we will see in the future, and it needs to be recognised that the skill base in agriculture is growing. We certainly need to have that direction into the future.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (13:19):  It is particularly apt that we should be examining the future of agriculture during the Australian Year of the Farmer. It is estimated that by the year 2050 there will be nine billion people on earth. The recent ABARES outlook conference was informed that demand for agricultural products in that time will rise by around about 70 per cent, and the real value of food will rise by 1.3 per cent per annum—almost 80 per cent over that period. By 2050, it is expected that the value of agricultural exports will grow by 140 percent. That is the real value. It is clear that, far from the assumptions of the past, agriculture is not and cannot be a sunset industry. This is in complete contrast to the last 100 years, with the real value of agricultural production continually falling in real terms. In that period, farmers have survived and in many cases flourished by increasing productivity, not just yields. The increase in area farmed has been substantial, but the biggest gains in agriculture have been in productivity per person. Some of these efficiencies have been provided by technology and mechanical advancement, others by the vastly increased cropping intensity provided by superior agronomic practice and others again by technologies contained within the seed and the genetic makeup of the plants and the animals we grow. All of these advancements have been underwritten by good science. 


Well may we ask, what is the problem? Why is there a problem in agriculture if the future looks so bright? The problem is that the enormous advances of the last 50 years have always been as a result of the investment of the generation before. For instance, even today the best science in agriculture is being driven by the generation which is about to retire. It is the result of investment and recruitment of the 1970s and 1980s. The extremely tough times in agriculture in the last 20 to 30 years have diverted high school graduates away from agriculture. The repeated crises in the industry have led to lower wages than in competing industries and prospective students have voted with their feet. But here we are now, in 2012, on the verge of agriculture regaining much of its importance in the world. Our agricultural schools are struggling to fill courses and closing campuses. Entrance marks continue to fall. These are very bad outcomes not just for the industry specifically but also for the nation's economy. As I said earlier, agricultural products are quickly joining the list of world resources in short supply. Such shortages have driven the vast expansion in the resources sector generally in the last 20 years.


Governments have invested significantly in addressing the shortage of skills in the resources sector. It is perceived that Australia will not be able to fully exploit its opportunities unless we have a skilled workforce to meet demand. It is exactly the same position in agriculture. Australia will not be able to fully exploit its opportunities unless we have a skilled workforce to meet the demand. Yet, in the same time that governments around Australia have been reducing their commitment to agriculture, state governments have withdrawn funds for agricultural research and extension and closed a number of research farms and this federal government has slashed spending going to agriculture, including to land and water. The result drives a negative view of agriculture and a reluctance among young people to choose a career in the industry. Yet we know that the research breakthroughs of the 2020s, '30s and '40s will come from those who join the industry now. That is why it is time for governments collectively to lift their heads and look at what industries can realistically perform well in the middle of this current century. They will not be the areas where the real returns are predicted to keep falling. Our cost of production in Australia will inevitably see such industries fall victim to the emerging and well educated classes from the developing nations of the world. Agriculture, by comparison, will play to our natural advantage and it is imperative that governments take the blinkers off the last 20 years and understand that it is far from being a sunset industry—it is in fact a re-emerging industry—and for Australia's good management they must come on board and support agriculture.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (13:24):  As others speakers have noted, this is the International Year of the Farmer. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the importance of the farming sector to Australia and to the world, for that matter. I also thank the farming families of Australia for all that they do. I also, given that this motion talks about education, research and the like, acknowledge the good work that has been done for almost 100 years by the Waite Agricultural Research Institute, just out of Adelaide, and also the Roseworthy Agricultural College, which since 1883 has similarly been doing very good work. These are both colleges that the member for Murray, who has raised this issue, would like to see more students participate in.


This is an important issue and I certainly acknowledge that. It is important for the country. It is important for our economy and for our balance of trade. It is important for the families and the communities whose lives are dependent on the Australian agricultural production sector. I was reading the AgriFood Skills Australia annual report for 2010-11. I note within that report it says that the sector comprises 180,000 enterprises, employs 880,000 people and generates over $200 billion per annum for Australia's economy. Those are huge numbers, very important numbers.


Importantly, it is a sector with huge growth opportunities, producing an essential product in food and producing a product that Australia has the capacity to excel in. With some of South Australia's highest producing fruit and vegetable farmers located in the northern and north-eastern regions of Adelaide, I am acutely conscious of the sector's importance to the nation and to my own region. The Adelaide fruit and vegetable markets are located in my own electorate and I am very familiar with the activities there. I see the produce that comes into those markets; I see the level of activity that is created as a result of them and the flow-on effect that the agricultural sector has to the rest of our region, whether you are looking chemical manufacturers, irrigation suppliers, refrigeration mechanics and refrigeration manufacturers, packaging, clothing, transport, warehousing, retailing, food processing and so on. The list is endless of the community groups and sectors that rely on and benefit from a strong agricultural sector in this country.


In the brief time that I have available to me I want to make two points. In my view, the greatest threat to our agricultural sector comes from the unpredictable and extreme weather events that are confronting this country and the world, for that matter. I have to say, and I accept, that farmers have always been subjected to variable weather conditions. There is no question about that; there is no denying that. But in more recent times, consistent with scientific predictions, we have seen the incidents of floods, cyclones, droughts and bushfires increasing and the extremeness of those incidents also increasing as well as the frequency of them.


Whilst climate change is part and parcel of today's lifestyle, we are seeing it right here and now, when you look at the floods across the country that are occurring and the devastating effects that they are having on the sector as a whole. We saw it this year, we saw it last year and we saw it the year before. Those threats, in my view, pose the biggest risk to the future of the livelihoods of all of those agricultural people who depend on the land and on weather conditions. It was even more concerning when I read in a report that was only recently released by some of the climate scientists of Australia that in the future things are looking even more dire. Some of the comments they made were: 'Very significant reductions in average rainfall, increases in temperature and increases in extreme weather events across the major agricultural production zones suggest future decreases in production for agricultural commodities.' They went on to say, 'The area in which crops are likely to be viable will change significantly and Australia's food surpluses will likely shrink and potentially become negative in some years and in some scenarios.' That is what the climate scientists are saying, and those are certainly issues of concern. That brings us back to the question of putting more research into graduates so that they can better adjust to the changing climatic conditions, and I think that is one of the good reasons why we need to do that. Another point, which I do not have time to elaborate on, is that in recent decades we have, in my view, missed out on huge opportunities in the agricultural sector by not allowing to value add to the food that is produced in this country. All too often we are sending food offshore to be processed and, in turn, repackaged and then we are receiving it back in this country. We need to support those industries, which could do that on our own home ground. (Time expired)

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (15:59):  I rise this afternoon to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. I would like to say at the outset that this is a bill which I have spent considerable time thinking about, and I have had great difficulty in coming to a position as to whether or not this is the right way to go. On balance, I have come to the conclusion that the provisions in this bill are the right way to go, and, along with my fellow members on the coalition side, I will be supporting this bill.


The bill creates an adult category for computer games, a category that is legally restricted to persons 18 years of age and over. As you would be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, an R18+ category currently applies to other forms of entertainment, like films and some magazines, but at the moment it does not apply to computer games. The highest classification level for computer games is currently 'mature accompanied', or MA15+. MA15+ games are not recommended for people below the age of 15 and are legally restricted for such people. The only thing which this bill does is create an R18+ category for computer games.


The reason I have had difficulty in coming to a decision on this bill is in part that there are two conflicting principles which arise here from my perspective. On the one hand, I am a firm believer in liberalism and individual responsibility, which would lead me to say that, yes, of course we should have an R18+ category and we should have those games come into Australia. On the other hand, however, I abhor some of the violence in our society and am concerned that more violent games coming into our community may exacerbate that.


Let me briefly touch on those principles and outline some of my other reasoning for supporting this bill on balance. As I said, a core principle which guides the decisions of many of us on this side of the chamber is the principle of individual responsibility and liberalism. I am a firm believer in this and I am a firm believer that people have the right to take responsibility and to do things they want to do without the government interfering, unless those activities are going to harm other people. That is a principle which John Stuart Mill articulated many years ago and it is a fundamental principle which guides a lot of thinking on this side of the chamber. We are not saying that everything should be completely unfettered, but we are saying that, if there is doubt, then the government should step back, rather than step in, and allow people to take responsibility for themselves and to have freedom of choice. They are very important principles.


From that perspective, then of course we would allow the R18+ category and we would allow games which presently might be prohibited from coming into this country because we only have an MA15+ category. On that basis, we would say that the people who are using these games are adults—indeed 75 per cent of all people who play video games are adults, with an average age of 32—and they are sensible people and they are sensible enough to decide for themselves whether or not they want to play a particularly violent game or a game which has a large amount of nudity or sex or whatever in it.


On the other hand, I have a concern—and it is a concern which many people in this chamber and across our community have—about the level of violence which is in our community presently. While there is no research which says that there is a direct link between violence in video games or films or other media and violence which is propagated out in the community, I am sure that, at the very least, violent films, games and magazines change people's perceptions of what is acceptable and contribute to a changing of the culture in our community. My concern is that, if we have additionally violent games coming into our community, that will exacerbate that culture and may indeed lead to greater violence down the track. Those are the two conflicting principles we have to grapple with in relation to this bill—on the one hand, a very strong principle in relation to individual responsibility, freedom of choice and liberalism and, on the other hand, the principle of not wanting to exacerbate any culture of violence that may exist in our community presently and on which video games could have an impact. On balance I have come to the conclusion that the right thing to do is to have the R18+ rating. So I support this bill, in part because I think that if ever it comes down to a balance between individual responsibility, liberalism and something else, we should err on the side of liberalism. That is the first point.


The second point is in relation to the evidence suggesting that having the R18+ classification may be beneficial in reducing the propensity for violent games to be used by minors. That is because of the argument, which is quite forcibly put, that some of the games that presently come into this country are games which, in other countries, would not be allowed to be used by people who are between the ages of 15 and 18. But, because in this country we have only a 15+ rating, these games get slightly edited and are then able to be used by minors from the ages of 15, 16 and 17. I will give you two examples of that. The first example is Grand Theft Auto IV, which is the latest in the adult Grand Theft Auto series. The publishers, Rockstar, self-censored the game for Australia, making minor cosmetic edits regarding sex acts and blood spatter. It is now available for sale to children in Australia aged 15 and up, while it is still being restricted, even in edited form, to adults in other countries who are 18 years of age or over. Similarly, the game called House of the Dead: Overkill was not refused classification. I understand it has excessive violence and a high amount of profanity and it is still available for children aged 15 and over. Meanwhile, I understand that overseas rating agencies have classified the game for adults only. It may be the case that having games with an R18+ classification, which may not be appropriate for people who are 15, 16 and 17, may mean less access to such games because they would be properly classified as 18+ years of age. I think that is also an important part of this bill in front of us.


I will conclude by going back to the core principles I looked at in this bill—on the one hand the principle of individual choice, liberalism and individual responsibility and, on the other hand, a concern that we have too much violence in our society and that any additional violent games may exacerbate that. As I said, on balance, I have come to the conclusion that liberalism, individual choice and individual responsibility should be paramount in this instance. I trust that the people who use these games will be 18 years of age and older and that it will not be distributed to minors, although that is a very difficult thing to police, and that, in passing this bill, it will bring games into line with other forms of entertainment such as films and magazines.

"Neville, Paul, MP",Nats,2012-03-19,"



Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (16:09):  I rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. The bill envisages creating a new category of R18+ for video games and the like, which currently do not have such a classification. By nature I am opposed to censorship, especially censorship of the media. But I accept that in all areas of the media, and in particular in the field of film, video and games entertainment, there is a need for a community standard to be set.


As honourable members are aware, in the film and video field and on television we have the classifications of G, general exhibition; PG, parental guidance required; M, mature; MA15+, where there is supposed to be a form of adult supervision; and, finally, R18+, which of course does not apply to television films—they stop at MA15+. But in all other things there is an R certificate. The proprietor of a theatre is required never to sell a ticket to an R certificated film to a person under 18 years of age, just as the owner of a video shop is required never to sell an R certificated video to a person under 18 years of age. I support that.


I have had a long history in the entertainment business. I worked for the Arts Council in Queensland, when it separated from New South Wales. That was my first major job. And I spent a substantial portion of my life as a manager, supervisor and owner of theatres. I lived through the era of the introduction of the R certificated film. It was very hotly contested in the community at the time. I, for one, thought it was a good thing because the R certificate allowed adults to see adult material in an adult context. In the theatres I managed in the weeks it was first introduced I put a policeman on special duty. In those days you could hire a policeman for special duty. I wanted to send the message out to the young people that we were fair dinkum and were not going to let in anyone who was under 18 years of age. In fact, I remember turning away the daughter of my wife's best friend, who was 17 years and nine months old. Everyone thought I was being a bit tough. But I wanted to send the message out to everyone, friend and foe alike, that if we were going to have this new form of entertainment it was going to be fair dinkum. I got caught at times. I have no doubt some little toerags got under my radar. I remember one day I came up to this lovely girl with flaxen hair, long plaits and ribbons and I thought, 'Dear, oh dear.' I said, 'Listen, my dear, you are not seriously telling me that you are over 18.' She looked me straight in the eye and said, 'Mr Neville, my name is Marylou 'so and so'. I have a Bachelor of Teaching, with Honours, and I have been teaching for two years.' So I was put back in my place very promptly. She looked every bit of 15. So, I do not doubt that from time to time people get under the radar, but that is not an excuse for not having good controls. I am equally keen to see that the introduction of R certificated films should never become an excuse for the liberalisation of the X certificate or the reintroduction of NVE, or non-violent erotica, classification that the previous coalition government rejected. If you apply that to this games regime, nor should the R18+ certificate be a signal to the pornography industry that there is going to be even further liberalisation. I for one would strongly oppose that. 


I like the questions posed in the classical English definition of pornography: does it tend to deprave or corrupt; is it a danger in the hands of the young or the unwitting; does it grievously offend community standards? If material cannot meet that test it should not come in. I have a friend who works for Blue Care and counsels young people who, amongst other things, have been subjected to child abuse. He tells me one of the classic tools of grooming a child for paedophilia is hardcore, X certificated films. The industry should not see this R certificate games category as a foot in the door for going further. It should be to allow adults in an adult context to view material or in this case to play games for their own entertainment, free from children under 18 years of age.


People have grown up with games, and the average age of game players is now 32. A high proportion of game players, we are told as much as 75 per cent, are adults. I am not reflecting on our censors in Australia and I am not reflecting on those who have made genuine efforts to modify R-certificate material from overseas to bring it into the MA18+ category, but I suspect that over the years games on the margin have, because of the inability to classify them at a higher level, got through. Games that cannot be seen by children overseas in that 15- to 18-year age group can be seen in Australia. I think the introduction of this new category gives the censors a clear line in the sand, and parents and others will know that to a certain point it is legitimate but beyond that point it is hands off. It is very important because in other countries there are 17-years-of-age and 18-years-of-age rules. The EU, the UK and the United States have all taken this matter in hand. It is appropriate that Australia should be doing likewise.


It is important that adults be able to see material in an adult context. It is some years old now, but there was a film called Don't look now, starring Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie. It was the story of a young couple that had two young girls, one of whom drowned. It was about the impact that had on the family. The father restored old buildings, including cathedrals, and worked in Venice. In the film the husband and wife, after many years of grieving in Venice, have a sex scene. It was in context, it was between husband and wife, it was tasteful and it showed the eventual relief of the grief that had dogged them for the time since they had lost their daughter. I think something in that context is not going to offend any adult but it is not something to which you expose some young person, especially one in the impressionable years of the middle teens. So it is with games. Games are a very important medium. I have seen one report that says up to 90 per cent of homes have games machines of one sort of another. Inevitably kids have access to these and, also inevitably, they play games that are brought into the home, some by the kids themselves and some by the parents. As I have said, some games getting through to the 15- to 18-year-old age group were probably classified as R certificate overseas and are being seen in Australia.


I also think that, while with our censorship we look at things like explicit and gratuitous sex, violence, drug taking and extreme violence, sometimes one that gets under the radar—and it should not—is demeaning of women. I remember that when we had the NVE debate here we were given a sample film to have a look at. I might add that those who saw it did not stay in the room more than two minutes. It was quite obvious what it was: pornography dressed up. I thought the wrenching back of a girl's head while she was being demeaned added a touch of sickening flavour to something that purported to be a new and enlightened form of classification.


So I repeat my plea to the government and the censors that this become a new line in the sand, a standard whereby adults can see adult games in an adult context free of the prying eyes of children and, equally, parents can, with a lot more relaxation, know that films, especially those in the G, PG and perhaps M classifications, according to the age of the children, are reasonably safe for their children to see. I think it is also good that with our classifications—although we do not do a lot of classifying in the printed field—we have uniformity in cinema, in videos and now in games that the public can look to with some confidence. For that reason I support the bill.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (16:24):  I rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. I would like to concur with the previous words of my colleague the member for Hinkler in the overview of the content of his speech, about the protection of the innocence of our youth, the protection of women and the protection of those who are vulnerable in our society. We are shifting to an animated society. The quality of animation that is not only portrayed today in video games but is starting to evolve in movies is becoming so life-like that an inherent social disconnect may potentially occur in an innocent mind in detecting what is good and what is evil, what is acceptable and what is not, and what is socially unpalatable. There are few topics capable of provoking such irritation, fear and wrong-headed moral panic as video games. It is a remarkable thing, really, when you consider that electronic games are nothing new.


The first pinball machine was invented in 1937 and it was not long before slot machine manufacturers saw their potential and began developing pinball machines that gave payouts based out on the player's score. At the time the authorities viewed these machines as a dangerous combination of youth recreation and gambling and were quick to crack down on them. In 1939, the new mayor of New York successfully passed bans to make pinball machines illegal in his city, and the ban remained effective until 1976. From the moment they appeared, electronic games sadly had a bad reputation as a corrupting influence on the youth.


Stand-up cabinet arcade games appeared in the mid 1970s and quickly drew the rage of authorities, who were concerned that the lure of electronic games was impacting on school attendance. In the early eighties I went to a boarding school, so we had access to neither pinball machines nor other electronic games. The concern about the negative impact of arcade games was so great that opponents of the new games parlour scheduled to open in Connecticut in 1983 charged that the store owner would mesmerise their youngsters, rob them of their lunch money, provide them with a centre for illicit drug trafficking and cause a downfall in youth baseball, music lessons and scholastic aptitude tests.


In the mid-1980s the video games market took its first steps out of the arcade and into our family living rooms. The introduction of personal computers and video game consoles like the Nintendo entertainment system brought video games into the perceived safety of the family home, away from any atmosphere stereotypically considered to be a haven for smoking, drug use and any other antisocial or harmful behaviour. It was at this point that the debate took on its modern form, shifting away from concerns about physical safety and gravitating towards claims of psychological harm. Previously, concern had been that the arcade games lured youth away from school and into smoky dens where they could be corrupted by other kids. Once games were in the home environment, parents began to worry about the psychological effects of the games themselves, and that is essentially where we still are today.


This debate is about the need for an R18+ classification to stem the belief that the exposure to video games has the capacity to damage our kids—a perception that I support. The academic literature on this point, however, is inconclusive at best, but to mitigate the possibility it seems eminently sensible to restrict access to violent or adult themed games to adults. It is hardly an outrageous idea. After all, we already do it with films and magazines; why not have censorship at that level for these games? Opponents of the R18+ classification would agree that video games are an entirely different beast to film because consumers are actively participating rather than being passive observers. Again, the academic research on this point is largely inconclusive.


But, moral panic aside, there is little doubt that Australia's current classification system as it applies to video games is failing and failing badly. Within the current system the highest legal available classification category for computer games is MA15+. Games which are considered unsuitable for persons aged under 15 are theoretically refused classification. In practice, though, it is not so cut and dried. A very small number of adult theme games are refused classification. The majority are simply released within the MA15+ category. Some of them are edited to earn their lower rating—most are not. Let us look at some examples. The prior evidence I have put down has been given to me by one of my staff, because I have absolutely no idea—I have never seen these games. But when I questioned him as to the imagery—here is a man who is married—he was quite explicit that it is not something you would want your small children to see. He did give an overview. One game he mentioned was Fallout 3, which was initially refused classification by the Classification Board for realistic depictions of drug use. After some minor edits it is now available to children aged 15 and up. Even with these changes, Fallout 3 is still rated 18+ in Britain, New Zealand and across Europe. In the US it is rated 17+. In Australia, however, it is legally available to kids as young as 15 simply because we lack the capability to restrict adult games to adults only.


Australia can do better when it comes to classifications. When we are not meeting the benchmarks of other nations; we need to step up as legislators and protect the innocence of our children. My staff member then went on to give me another example with Grand Theft Auto IV—an example that was given by a prior speaker from the coalition. Grand Theft Auto games are famous for their adult themes. The game's publisher, Rockstar, made a few cosmetic edits to the overseas version, primarily regarding sex acts and blood splatter. The game is now legally available to children aged 15 and up. In other countries it is restricted to adults. Another game called TheHouse of the Dead: Overkill is a shooting game, which combines Tarantino levels of blood and gore with almost constant profanities. Nevertheless, it is available to 15-year-old kids in Australia, whereas overseas it is restricted to adults.


With the realistic animation that exists in these video games, I reiterate the point of the disconnect with the social responsibility of protecting the innocence of our youth. This is a real concern. You can see that under our current classification system games that would be classified as R18 in most Western countries are frequently released in Australia as being suitable for our 15-year-olds. That is where the madness lies. Not only does the current system failed to allow adults to choose, it also falls short of protecting minors from potentially harmful or disturbing content. Contrary to what some would have you believe, the lack of our R rating makes it easier for children to access adult content—not harder. It makes it confusing for parents who are trying to do the right thing. Legislating to allow R18+ categories will give consumers information, a clear choice and more confidence in the games they buy for themselves and their kids.


Furthermore, Australia is something of a cradle of creativity when it comes to video game development. We have got 25 major development studios with exports of over $120 million worth of products sold each and every year. It is worth remembering that video games are not some type of fringe hobby for children and nerdy teenagers, they are in themselves bigger than Hollywood. Of Australian households, 88 per cent own some kind of device for playing video games. The average age of the Australian gamer is 32, and 75 per cent of Australian gamers are 18 or older. I do not have anyone in my house with an average age of 32. What I have in my house is me, my wife and my daughter, who is in grade 11 and attends boarding school. We do not have a gaming machine. As I alluded to earlier, I have never seen these games before. I am lucky enough, coming from a rural precinct, that the form of entertainment we as a family choose to give our daughter is horses and the benefit of having pets—a cat and a couple of dogs. She owns a Wii machine so she can play baseball and golf and whatever. But those types of tools very rarely get picked up in our household. I understand that coming from a rural precinct this is not the template for the average Australian, but it does go to building social and behavioural patterns. I am also cognisant of the current benefits of gaming machines in acting as potential babysitters. With social and financial pressures on households, the gaming machine can often be used as a babysitter or as a form of entertainment. I encourage those families who pursue that line of entertainment for their children to be mindful of what their children are watching. With those figures in mind, it is evident that certain games are intended for adults and it is only common sense to suggest that they should be restricted to adults.


In conclusion, I support measures that protect the innocence of our children, particularly the children of Wright. I speak in support of this bill as I have spoken in support of a number of bills. In fact, last year when the parliament rose, I asked the Parliamentary Library to give me figures on how many bills we had actually supported as a coalition. I was quite surprised to learn that the coalition have supported 78 per cent of all bills that have come before the House. When you classify the cognate bills with the main bills, you see that only around 13 per cent of the bills before the House did not have our support. I support this bill and reject the claim by the government that all we ever do is get up and say no, no, no. The facts speak for themselves. In supporting this bill I hope to protect our youth.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (16:36):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012, which, as you are aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, establishes the R18+ classification for computer games under the Broadcasting Services Act. The need for this bill arises because today there is no such classification, anomalously, for video games even though there is such a classification for many other forms of content, including television, movies, magazines and so on. In effect, when it comes to video games, there is a missing rung in the ladder which exists in the case of other forms of content, and that has created a problem. Indeed, it is interesting to reflect that what we have seen here is the law of unintended consequences in operation. There was not originally an R18+ rating for computer games, I understand, because of concern about the nature of this medium and the kind of material that people might be exposed to and therefore a degree of conservatism was exercised in comparing video games to other media. As my colleague has just articulately explained, that has led, in effect, to the unintended consequence that a measure which was designed to produce greater protection, particularly to children, has ended up producing less protection. Something that all legislators could reflect on from time to time is the way that such unintended consequences can emerge.


In the brief time that I have available to me, I would like to make three points. Firstly, this bill will provide better information and better protection to members of the Australian community as they consider their entertainment choices; secondly, there is strong public support for the bill; and, thirdly, the need for policy action in this area is consistent with the broader degree of public concern in relation to online content, which the coalition is addressing through having established the Online Safety Working Group. Let me turn to the first point, which is that this bill will achieve an outcome of better informing and better protecting Australian consumers as they consider their entertainment options. This measure was supported nationally at a meeting of state and territory attorneys-general last year. The key issue which the bill addresses is the problem that, because of the missing rung, the consequence in effect is that many games, which in other jurisdictions are classified so that they cannot be seen or are not supposed to be seen by people under the age of 18, end up attracting an MA15+ classification in Australia. The reason for that, of course, is the regulator has only one option available to it right now in respect of video games if it reaches the conclusion that those games contain content which raises serious issues as to the suitability of that content for children and young people. The only option today, should the regulator decide that the game does not merit a classification of MA15+, is to refuse classification. Clearly, to refuse classification means that the relevant game is not available to Australian consumers at all, whether or not those consumers have children in their household, and it denies adults the opportunity to make a choice which they ought to have available to them. So clearly it is highly problematic that there is a missing rung in the ladder, and it is therefore sensible to establish in the classification framework for video games a rung in the ladder which is analogous to that which is available for the classification of content in other media.


As we have heard, one of the unintended consequences of the current regulatory arrangements is that games which in other countries are rated the equivalent of R18+—that is to say, they are given a rating such that they are not available to be sold to those under the age of 18—in Australia have, in a number of circumstances, been rated MA15+ either in the version which in other countries is rated such that it can be seen only by those over the age of 18 or with very minor modifications. As you heard from the previous speaker, a number of games fall into this category. He and I have spent many happy hours together playing Fallout 3, Grand Theft Auto IV and The House of the Dead: Overkill—which is one of my personal favourites. We did say to ourselves as we were doing this that we were somewhat surprised that it was rated MA15+. It seemed to us, not having completed the OFLC classification training, that it was surprising that the version that we were playing was not rated R18+. I should say that in our household we have a number of games which are played enthusiastically by one teenage member. While I cannot say I have spent a lot of time playing those games myself, I have seen enough of them to recognise that there is a significant issue here as to how classification should be carried out. The animation quality of these games is quite extraordinarily high, the devices that people are playing them on in their homes have very high resolution, and the classification issues that are raised are every bit as material, significant and real as in other media—movies, for example.


The important point which must also not be forgotten here is the importance of ensuring that adults are free to make choices about the media they wish to consume. As has been pointed out in this debate, gaming is a very popular activity for adults. Adults should be free to choose to see content which they consider meets their entertainment needs, and it would be very unfortunate if the regulatory arrangements were such that, because of the absence of an appropriate rung in the classification ladder, content which adults may wish to see is in effect denied them because the regulator does not have a sufficiently finely graded set of tools such that the regulator can grant a rating of R18+ so that appropriate protection is afforded to children—those under the age of 18—but at the same time the product is available for consumption by those over the age of 18 who have made the choice as an adult to do that.


I do emphasise that the coalition does not support censorship. What we do support, as a very strong principle, a principle of the highest importance, is that consumers are fully informed as to the content of the material that they are going to be seeing or interacting with and that they are therefore able to make a fully informed decision as to whether they will consume a particular product and whether they will acquire and play a particular game, just as they should be able to make a fully informed decision as to whether, if they go to see a particular movie, it is going to have content of the kind that they are expecting or content of a kind that may come as a surprise.


I think that is a principle that is well accepted and understood in the Australian community, which brings me to the second point, which is that there is clearly strong public support for the establishment of an R18+ classification for computer games. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that when it released a discussion paper on this topic it received 54,000 submissions, 98 per cent of which supported the introduction of an R18+ category. There has been extensive consultation on this issue, the public have had a wide opportunity to express their views and there has been wide interest in this issue. The expression of views is strongly supportive of the principle that consumers should be fully informed as to the content of games or other media that they are going to be consuming and consistent with the principle that the establishment of an R18+ classification makes good sense because the absence of that classification, as has been explained to the House by a number of speakers, has led to some unintended and undesirable consequences, including material being given an MA15+ rating when, on a more considered view, it probably ought to have been given an R18+ rating and, alternatively, material which ought to be available to adults to make a choice to consume should they wish to do so, not being available to them under the current classification arrangements.


This bill demonstrates the importance of sound public policy settings in relation to the availability of content through a whole range of channels, including online channels, to consumers. Internet and online technologies are changing our world comprehensively, and the challenge for regulators is to keep up with those changes. I referred earlier to the extraordinary quality of the computer graphics and the high resolution of these games and the extraordinary improvement in the quality of the devices that people are able to view and play these games on and the wide range of locations in which they are able to do so—not just in the home but on a portable device, on a portable computer and so on.


These are issues on which the parliament, the government and the regulatory system in this area must be continually vigilant. The coalition strongly believes in that as a principle, and that is why we have established an Online Safety Working Group, exploring the whole question of content in the online world and particularly how to ensure the safe delivery of content for people under the age of 18. We have focused in our work on protecting children, particularly on ensuring that parents, schools and others with responsibility to care for children have available to them the tools to ensure that those in their care are adequately protected and are not using the internet, online channels, to engage with material which may be inappropriate. Providing informative and comprehensive ratings of games is one very important way to give effect to that principle.


In evidence that the Online Safety Working Group has received already, we have learned about the pervasiveness of the consumption of games amongst people under the age of 18—as well as, of course, amongst adults. The policy issues that raises are significant, and clearly one of those issues is ensuring that parents, who typically—not exclusively, but typically—will be making a consumption decision in relation to games for their children, particularly their younger children, are well informed and are able to assess very readily the suitability of the product for their child.


One of the issues when it comes to online consumption, online activity, by children is that it is often the case that children are better informed about the devices, the products and the tools, than their parents are. A complication in this area is that everything is converging, so devices like the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox are not just gaming devices but also internet access devices. Many parents do not have a very clear idea of the capabilities of these devices, just as many parents, I would suggest, may not fully appreciate that when they give their 10- or 11-year-old a WiFi-enabled iPod—and the research I have conducted suggests that that was the Christmas present du jour in the Christmas just gone—they are giving their children, including 10- and 11-year-olds, unfettered access to the internet and everything that it has to offer, good and bad.


So the challenge for regulators and governments in this area will be a continuing one. In the case of gaming and in the case of the internet more broadly, these technologies offer many benefits: tremendous entertainment, which is enormously engaging and very professionally delivered, and a tremendous resource to access information and to engage in e-commerce, telemedicine, distance education and all of these good things. But, just as the roads are very useful facilities but we need to take proper care to ensure public safety on the roads, we also need to ensure that we take proper care for public safety when it comes to the internet and when it comes, amongst other things, to the gaming world. So the legislation that is before the House this afternoon has the coalition's full support, because we believe it achieves the objective of delivering better informed consumers and protecting those who appropriately need to be protected.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (16:51):  I thank all members for their contribution to the debate on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. This is an important reform—some 10 years in the making. It will create an R18+ category for computer games. As members who have participated in this debate are aware, currently the highest legally available classification category for computer games is MA15+. This reform will bring the classification categories for computer games into line with existing categories used to classify films and make the Australian classification regime more consistent with international standards. As many members have said in this debate, this has been the subject of extensive public consultation over recent years. There is a very high level of public interest in this issue and public support for the introduction of an R18+ category.


When the Attorney-General's Department released a discussion paper on the introduction of an R18+ classification category for computer games in 2009 they received 58,437 submissions in response. Of those, 98 per cent supported the introduction of an R18+ category. Let me take this opportunity to thank the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, who have conducted a short inquiry into this bill. The committee recommended that the bill be passed, noting the extensive public consultation that has already occurred on the introduction of an R18+ category for computer games. The bill also has the support of state and territory attorneys-general, who agreed to this reform at the Standing Council on Law and Justice meeting in July of last year. Following the passage of this legislation through the Senate, the states and territories will pass their own complementary legislation to ensure that R18+ computer games are appropriately regulated. Subject to this occurring, the national scheme will commence on 1 January next year. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (15:59):  I rise this afternoon to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. I would like to say at the outset that this is a bill which I have spent considerable time thinking about, and I have had great difficulty in coming to a position as to whether or not this is the right way to go. On balance, I have come to the conclusion that the provisions in this bill are the right way to go, and, along with my fellow members on the coalition side, I will be supporting this bill.


The bill creates an adult category for computer games, a category that is legally restricted to persons 18 years of age and over. As you would be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, an R18+ category currently applies to other forms of entertainment, like films and some magazines, but at the moment it does not apply to computer games. The highest classification level for computer games is currently 'mature accompanied', or MA15+. MA15+ games are not recommended for people below the age of 15 and are legally restricted for such people. The only thing which this bill does is create an R18+ category for computer games.


The reason I have had difficulty in coming to a decision on this bill is in part that there are two conflicting principles which arise here from my perspective. On the one hand, I am a firm believer in liberalism and individual responsibility, which would lead me to say that, yes, of course we should have an R18+ category and we should have those games come into Australia. On the other hand, however, I abhor some of the violence in our society and am concerned that more violent games coming into our community may exacerbate that.


Let me briefly touch on those principles and outline some of my other reasoning for supporting this bill on balance. As I said, a core principle which guides the decisions of many of us on this side of the chamber is the principle of individual responsibility and liberalism. I am a firm believer in this and I am a firm believer that people have the right to take responsibility and to do things they want to do without the government interfering, unless those activities are going to harm other people. That is a principle which John Stuart Mill articulated many years ago and it is a fundamental principle which guides a lot of thinking on this side of the chamber. We are not saying that everything should be completely unfettered, but we are saying that, if there is doubt, then the government should step back, rather than step in, and allow people to take responsibility for themselves and to have freedom of choice. They are very important principles.


From that perspective, then of course we would allow the R18+ category and we would allow games which presently might be prohibited from coming into this country because we only have an MA15+ category. On that basis, we would say that the people who are using these games are adults—indeed 75 per cent of all people who play video games are adults, with an average age of 32—and they are sensible people and they are sensible enough to decide for themselves whether or not they want to play a particularly violent game or a game which has a large amount of nudity or sex or whatever in it.


On the other hand, I have a concern—and it is a concern which many people in this chamber and across our community have—about the level of violence which is in our community presently. While there is no research which says that there is a direct link between violence in video games or films or other media and violence which is propagated out in the community, I am sure that, at the very least, violent films, games and magazines change people's perceptions of what is acceptable and contribute to a changing of the culture in our community. My concern is that, if we have additionally violent games coming into our community, that will exacerbate that culture and may indeed lead to greater violence down the track. Those are the two conflicting principles we have to grapple with in relation to this bill—on the one hand, a very strong principle in relation to individual responsibility, freedom of choice and liberalism and, on the other hand, the principle of not wanting to exacerbate any culture of violence that may exist in our community presently and on which video games could have an impact. On balance I have come to the conclusion that the right thing to do is to have the R18+ rating. So I support this bill, in part because I think that if ever it comes down to a balance between individual responsibility, liberalism and something else, we should err on the side of liberalism. That is the first point.


The second point is in relation to the evidence suggesting that having the R18+ classification may be beneficial in reducing the propensity for violent games to be used by minors. That is because of the argument, which is quite forcibly put, that some of the games that presently come into this country are games which, in other countries, would not be allowed to be used by people who are between the ages of 15 and 18. But, because in this country we have only a 15+ rating, these games get slightly edited and are then able to be used by minors from the ages of 15, 16 and 17. I will give you two examples of that. The first example is Grand Theft Auto IV, which is the latest in the adult Grand Theft Auto series. The publishers, Rockstar, self-censored the game for Australia, making minor cosmetic edits regarding sex acts and blood spatter. It is now available for sale to children in Australia aged 15 and up, while it is still being restricted, even in edited form, to adults in other countries who are 18 years of age or over. Similarly, the game called House of the Dead: Overkill was not refused classification. I understand it has excessive violence and a high amount of profanity and it is still available for children aged 15 and over. Meanwhile, I understand that overseas rating agencies have classified the game for adults only. It may be the case that having games with an R18+ classification, which may not be appropriate for people who are 15, 16 and 17, may mean less access to such games because they would be properly classified as 18+ years of age. I think that is also an important part of this bill in front of us.


I will conclude by going back to the core principles I looked at in this bill—on the one hand the principle of individual choice, liberalism and individual responsibility and, on the other hand, a concern that we have too much violence in our society and that any additional violent games may exacerbate that. As I said, on balance, I have come to the conclusion that liberalism, individual choice and individual responsibility should be paramount in this instance. I trust that the people who use these games will be 18 years of age and older and that it will not be distributed to minors, although that is a very difficult thing to police, and that, in passing this bill, it will bring games into line with other forms of entertainment such as films and magazines.

"Neville, Paul, MP",Nats,2012-03-19,"



Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (16:09):  I rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. The bill envisages creating a new category of R18+ for video games and the like, which currently do not have such a classification. By nature I am opposed to censorship, especially censorship of the media. But I accept that in all areas of the media, and in particular in the field of film, video and games entertainment, there is a need for a community standard to be set.


As honourable members are aware, in the film and video field and on television we have the classifications of G, general exhibition; PG, parental guidance required; M, mature; MA15+, where there is supposed to be a form of adult supervision; and, finally, R18+, which of course does not apply to television films—they stop at MA15+. But in all other things there is an R certificate. The proprietor of a theatre is required never to sell a ticket to an R certificated film to a person under 18 years of age, just as the owner of a video shop is required never to sell an R certificated video to a person under 18 years of age. I support that.


I have had a long history in the entertainment business. I worked for the Arts Council in Queensland, when it separated from New South Wales. That was my first major job. And I spent a substantial portion of my life as a manager, supervisor and owner of theatres. I lived through the era of the introduction of the R certificated film. It was very hotly contested in the community at the time. I, for one, thought it was a good thing because the R certificate allowed adults to see adult material in an adult context. In the theatres I managed in the weeks it was first introduced I put a policeman on special duty. In those days you could hire a policeman for special duty. I wanted to send the message out to the young people that we were fair dinkum and were not going to let in anyone who was under 18 years of age. In fact, I remember turning away the daughter of my wife's best friend, who was 17 years and nine months old. Everyone thought I was being a bit tough. But I wanted to send the message out to everyone, friend and foe alike, that if we were going to have this new form of entertainment it was going to be fair dinkum. I got caught at times. I have no doubt some little toerags got under my radar. I remember one day I came up to this lovely girl with flaxen hair, long plaits and ribbons and I thought, 'Dear, oh dear.' I said, 'Listen, my dear, you are not seriously telling me that you are over 18.' She looked me straight in the eye and said, 'Mr Neville, my name is Marylou 'so and so'. I have a Bachelor of Teaching, with Honours, and I have been teaching for two years.' So I was put back in my place very promptly. She looked every bit of 15. So, I do not doubt that from time to time people get under the radar, but that is not an excuse for not having good controls. I am equally keen to see that the introduction of R certificated films should never become an excuse for the liberalisation of the X certificate or the reintroduction of NVE, or non-violent erotica, classification that the previous coalition government rejected. If you apply that to this games regime, nor should the R18+ certificate be a signal to the pornography industry that there is going to be even further liberalisation. I for one would strongly oppose that. 


I like the questions posed in the classical English definition of pornography: does it tend to deprave or corrupt; is it a danger in the hands of the young or the unwitting; does it grievously offend community standards? If material cannot meet that test it should not come in. I have a friend who works for Blue Care and counsels young people who, amongst other things, have been subjected to child abuse. He tells me one of the classic tools of grooming a child for paedophilia is hardcore, X certificated films. The industry should not see this R certificate games category as a foot in the door for going further. It should be to allow adults in an adult context to view material or in this case to play games for their own entertainment, free from children under 18 years of age.


People have grown up with games, and the average age of game players is now 32. A high proportion of game players, we are told as much as 75 per cent, are adults. I am not reflecting on our censors in Australia and I am not reflecting on those who have made genuine efforts to modify R-certificate material from overseas to bring it into the MA18+ category, but I suspect that over the years games on the margin have, because of the inability to classify them at a higher level, got through. Games that cannot be seen by children overseas in that 15- to 18-year age group can be seen in Australia. I think the introduction of this new category gives the censors a clear line in the sand, and parents and others will know that to a certain point it is legitimate but beyond that point it is hands off. It is very important because in other countries there are 17-years-of-age and 18-years-of-age rules. The EU, the UK and the United States have all taken this matter in hand. It is appropriate that Australia should be doing likewise.


It is important that adults be able to see material in an adult context. It is some years old now, but there was a film called Don't look now, starring Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie. It was the story of a young couple that had two young girls, one of whom drowned. It was about the impact that had on the family. The father restored old buildings, including cathedrals, and worked in Venice. In the film the husband and wife, after many years of grieving in Venice, have a sex scene. It was in context, it was between husband and wife, it was tasteful and it showed the eventual relief of the grief that had dogged them for the time since they had lost their daughter. I think something in that context is not going to offend any adult but it is not something to which you expose some young person, especially one in the impressionable years of the middle teens. So it is with games. Games are a very important medium. I have seen one report that says up to 90 per cent of homes have games machines of one sort of another. Inevitably kids have access to these and, also inevitably, they play games that are brought into the home, some by the kids themselves and some by the parents. As I have said, some games getting through to the 15- to 18-year-old age group were probably classified as R certificate overseas and are being seen in Australia.


I also think that, while with our censorship we look at things like explicit and gratuitous sex, violence, drug taking and extreme violence, sometimes one that gets under the radar—and it should not—is demeaning of women. I remember that when we had the NVE debate here we were given a sample film to have a look at. I might add that those who saw it did not stay in the room more than two minutes. It was quite obvious what it was: pornography dressed up. I thought the wrenching back of a girl's head while she was being demeaned added a touch of sickening flavour to something that purported to be a new and enlightened form of classification.


So I repeat my plea to the government and the censors that this become a new line in the sand, a standard whereby adults can see adult games in an adult context free of the prying eyes of children and, equally, parents can, with a lot more relaxation, know that films, especially those in the G, PG and perhaps M classifications, according to the age of the children, are reasonably safe for their children to see. I think it is also good that with our classifications—although we do not do a lot of classifying in the printed field—we have uniformity in cinema, in videos and now in games that the public can look to with some confidence. For that reason I support the bill.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (16:24):  I rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. I would like to concur with the previous words of my colleague the member for Hinkler in the overview of the content of his speech, about the protection of the innocence of our youth, the protection of women and the protection of those who are vulnerable in our society. We are shifting to an animated society. The quality of animation that is not only portrayed today in video games but is starting to evolve in movies is becoming so life-like that an inherent social disconnect may potentially occur in an innocent mind in detecting what is good and what is evil, what is acceptable and what is not, and what is socially unpalatable. There are few topics capable of provoking such irritation, fear and wrong-headed moral panic as video games. It is a remarkable thing, really, when you consider that electronic games are nothing new.


The first pinball machine was invented in 1937 and it was not long before slot machine manufacturers saw their potential and began developing pinball machines that gave payouts based out on the player's score. At the time the authorities viewed these machines as a dangerous combination of youth recreation and gambling and were quick to crack down on them. In 1939, the new mayor of New York successfully passed bans to make pinball machines illegal in his city, and the ban remained effective until 1976. From the moment they appeared, electronic games sadly had a bad reputation as a corrupting influence on the youth.


Stand-up cabinet arcade games appeared in the mid 1970s and quickly drew the rage of authorities, who were concerned that the lure of electronic games was impacting on school attendance. In the early eighties I went to a boarding school, so we had access to neither pinball machines nor other electronic games. The concern about the negative impact of arcade games was so great that opponents of the new games parlour scheduled to open in Connecticut in 1983 charged that the store owner would mesmerise their youngsters, rob them of their lunch money, provide them with a centre for illicit drug trafficking and cause a downfall in youth baseball, music lessons and scholastic aptitude tests.


In the mid-1980s the video games market took its first steps out of the arcade and into our family living rooms. The introduction of personal computers and video game consoles like the Nintendo entertainment system brought video games into the perceived safety of the family home, away from any atmosphere stereotypically considered to be a haven for smoking, drug use and any other antisocial or harmful behaviour. It was at this point that the debate took on its modern form, shifting away from concerns about physical safety and gravitating towards claims of psychological harm. Previously, concern had been that the arcade games lured youth away from school and into smoky dens where they could be corrupted by other kids. Once games were in the home environment, parents began to worry about the psychological effects of the games themselves, and that is essentially where we still are today.


This debate is about the need for an R18+ classification to stem the belief that the exposure to video games has the capacity to damage our kids—a perception that I support. The academic literature on this point, however, is inconclusive at best, but to mitigate the possibility it seems eminently sensible to restrict access to violent or adult themed games to adults. It is hardly an outrageous idea. After all, we already do it with films and magazines; why not have censorship at that level for these games? Opponents of the R18+ classification would agree that video games are an entirely different beast to film because consumers are actively participating rather than being passive observers. Again, the academic research on this point is largely inconclusive.


But, moral panic aside, there is little doubt that Australia's current classification system as it applies to video games is failing and failing badly. Within the current system the highest legal available classification category for computer games is MA15+. Games which are considered unsuitable for persons aged under 15 are theoretically refused classification. In practice, though, it is not so cut and dried. A very small number of adult theme games are refused classification. The majority are simply released within the MA15+ category. Some of them are edited to earn their lower rating—most are not. Let us look at some examples. The prior evidence I have put down has been given to me by one of my staff, because I have absolutely no idea—I have never seen these games. But when I questioned him as to the imagery—here is a man who is married—he was quite explicit that it is not something you would want your small children to see. He did give an overview. One game he mentioned was Fallout 3, which was initially refused classification by the Classification Board for realistic depictions of drug use. After some minor edits it is now available to children aged 15 and up. Even with these changes, Fallout 3 is still rated 18+ in Britain, New Zealand and across Europe. In the US it is rated 17+. In Australia, however, it is legally available to kids as young as 15 simply because we lack the capability to restrict adult games to adults only.


Australia can do better when it comes to classifications. When we are not meeting the benchmarks of other nations; we need to step up as legislators and protect the innocence of our children. My staff member then went on to give me another example with Grand Theft Auto IV—an example that was given by a prior speaker from the coalition. Grand Theft Auto games are famous for their adult themes. The game's publisher, Rockstar, made a few cosmetic edits to the overseas version, primarily regarding sex acts and blood splatter. The game is now legally available to children aged 15 and up. In other countries it is restricted to adults. Another game called TheHouse of the Dead: Overkill is a shooting game, which combines Tarantino levels of blood and gore with almost constant profanities. Nevertheless, it is available to 15-year-old kids in Australia, whereas overseas it is restricted to adults.


With the realistic animation that exists in these video games, I reiterate the point of the disconnect with the social responsibility of protecting the innocence of our youth. This is a real concern. You can see that under our current classification system games that would be classified as R18 in most Western countries are frequently released in Australia as being suitable for our 15-year-olds. That is where the madness lies. Not only does the current system failed to allow adults to choose, it also falls short of protecting minors from potentially harmful or disturbing content. Contrary to what some would have you believe, the lack of our R rating makes it easier for children to access adult content—not harder. It makes it confusing for parents who are trying to do the right thing. Legislating to allow R18+ categories will give consumers information, a clear choice and more confidence in the games they buy for themselves and their kids.


Furthermore, Australia is something of a cradle of creativity when it comes to video game development. We have got 25 major development studios with exports of over $120 million worth of products sold each and every year. It is worth remembering that video games are not some type of fringe hobby for children and nerdy teenagers, they are in themselves bigger than Hollywood. Of Australian households, 88 per cent own some kind of device for playing video games. The average age of the Australian gamer is 32, and 75 per cent of Australian gamers are 18 or older. I do not have anyone in my house with an average age of 32. What I have in my house is me, my wife and my daughter, who is in grade 11 and attends boarding school. We do not have a gaming machine. As I alluded to earlier, I have never seen these games before. I am lucky enough, coming from a rural precinct, that the form of entertainment we as a family choose to give our daughter is horses and the benefit of having pets—a cat and a couple of dogs. She owns a Wii machine so she can play baseball and golf and whatever. But those types of tools very rarely get picked up in our household. I understand that coming from a rural precinct this is not the template for the average Australian, but it does go to building social and behavioural patterns. I am also cognisant of the current benefits of gaming machines in acting as potential babysitters. With social and financial pressures on households, the gaming machine can often be used as a babysitter or as a form of entertainment. I encourage those families who pursue that line of entertainment for their children to be mindful of what their children are watching. With those figures in mind, it is evident that certain games are intended for adults and it is only common sense to suggest that they should be restricted to adults.


In conclusion, I support measures that protect the innocence of our children, particularly the children of Wright. I speak in support of this bill as I have spoken in support of a number of bills. In fact, last year when the parliament rose, I asked the Parliamentary Library to give me figures on how many bills we had actually supported as a coalition. I was quite surprised to learn that the coalition have supported 78 per cent of all bills that have come before the House. When you classify the cognate bills with the main bills, you see that only around 13 per cent of the bills before the House did not have our support. I support this bill and reject the claim by the government that all we ever do is get up and say no, no, no. The facts speak for themselves. In supporting this bill I hope to protect our youth.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (16:36):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012, which, as you are aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, establishes the R18+ classification for computer games under the Broadcasting Services Act. The need for this bill arises because today there is no such classification, anomalously, for video games even though there is such a classification for many other forms of content, including television, movies, magazines and so on. In effect, when it comes to video games, there is a missing rung in the ladder which exists in the case of other forms of content, and that has created a problem. Indeed, it is interesting to reflect that what we have seen here is the law of unintended consequences in operation. There was not originally an R18+ rating for computer games, I understand, because of concern about the nature of this medium and the kind of material that people might be exposed to and therefore a degree of conservatism was exercised in comparing video games to other media. As my colleague has just articulately explained, that has led, in effect, to the unintended consequence that a measure which was designed to produce greater protection, particularly to children, has ended up producing less protection. Something that all legislators could reflect on from time to time is the way that such unintended consequences can emerge.


In the brief time that I have available to me, I would like to make three points. Firstly, this bill will provide better information and better protection to members of the Australian community as they consider their entertainment choices; secondly, there is strong public support for the bill; and, thirdly, the need for policy action in this area is consistent with the broader degree of public concern in relation to online content, which the coalition is addressing through having established the Online Safety Working Group. Let me turn to the first point, which is that this bill will achieve an outcome of better informing and better protecting Australian consumers as they consider their entertainment options. This measure was supported nationally at a meeting of state and territory attorneys-general last year. The key issue which the bill addresses is the problem that, because of the missing rung, the consequence in effect is that many games, which in other jurisdictions are classified so that they cannot be seen or are not supposed to be seen by people under the age of 18, end up attracting an MA15+ classification in Australia. The reason for that, of course, is the regulator has only one option available to it right now in respect of video games if it reaches the conclusion that those games contain content which raises serious issues as to the suitability of that content for children and young people. The only option today, should the regulator decide that the game does not merit a classification of MA15+, is to refuse classification. Clearly, to refuse classification means that the relevant game is not available to Australian consumers at all, whether or not those consumers have children in their household, and it denies adults the opportunity to make a choice which they ought to have available to them. So clearly it is highly problematic that there is a missing rung in the ladder, and it is therefore sensible to establish in the classification framework for video games a rung in the ladder which is analogous to that which is available for the classification of content in other media.


As we have heard, one of the unintended consequences of the current regulatory arrangements is that games which in other countries are rated the equivalent of R18+—that is to say, they are given a rating such that they are not available to be sold to those under the age of 18—in Australia have, in a number of circumstances, been rated MA15+ either in the version which in other countries is rated such that it can be seen only by those over the age of 18 or with very minor modifications. As you heard from the previous speaker, a number of games fall into this category. He and I have spent many happy hours together playing Fallout 3, Grand Theft Auto IV and The House of the Dead: Overkill—which is one of my personal favourites. We did say to ourselves as we were doing this that we were somewhat surprised that it was rated MA15+. It seemed to us, not having completed the OFLC classification training, that it was surprising that the version that we were playing was not rated R18+. I should say that in our household we have a number of games which are played enthusiastically by one teenage member. While I cannot say I have spent a lot of time playing those games myself, I have seen enough of them to recognise that there is a significant issue here as to how classification should be carried out. The animation quality of these games is quite extraordinarily high, the devices that people are playing them on in their homes have very high resolution, and the classification issues that are raised are every bit as material, significant and real as in other media—movies, for example.


The important point which must also not be forgotten here is the importance of ensuring that adults are free to make choices about the media they wish to consume. As has been pointed out in this debate, gaming is a very popular activity for adults. Adults should be free to choose to see content which they consider meets their entertainment needs, and it would be very unfortunate if the regulatory arrangements were such that, because of the absence of an appropriate rung in the classification ladder, content which adults may wish to see is in effect denied them because the regulator does not have a sufficiently finely graded set of tools such that the regulator can grant a rating of R18+ so that appropriate protection is afforded to children—those under the age of 18—but at the same time the product is available for consumption by those over the age of 18 who have made the choice as an adult to do that.


I do emphasise that the coalition does not support censorship. What we do support, as a very strong principle, a principle of the highest importance, is that consumers are fully informed as to the content of the material that they are going to be seeing or interacting with and that they are therefore able to make a fully informed decision as to whether they will consume a particular product and whether they will acquire and play a particular game, just as they should be able to make a fully informed decision as to whether, if they go to see a particular movie, it is going to have content of the kind that they are expecting or content of a kind that may come as a surprise.


I think that is a principle that is well accepted and understood in the Australian community, which brings me to the second point, which is that there is clearly strong public support for the establishment of an R18+ classification for computer games. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that when it released a discussion paper on this topic it received 54,000 submissions, 98 per cent of which supported the introduction of an R18+ category. There has been extensive consultation on this issue, the public have had a wide opportunity to express their views and there has been wide interest in this issue. The expression of views is strongly supportive of the principle that consumers should be fully informed as to the content of games or other media that they are going to be consuming and consistent with the principle that the establishment of an R18+ classification makes good sense because the absence of that classification, as has been explained to the House by a number of speakers, has led to some unintended and undesirable consequences, including material being given an MA15+ rating when, on a more considered view, it probably ought to have been given an R18+ rating and, alternatively, material which ought to be available to adults to make a choice to consume should they wish to do so, not being available to them under the current classification arrangements.


This bill demonstrates the importance of sound public policy settings in relation to the availability of content through a whole range of channels, including online channels, to consumers. Internet and online technologies are changing our world comprehensively, and the challenge for regulators is to keep up with those changes. I referred earlier to the extraordinary quality of the computer graphics and the high resolution of these games and the extraordinary improvement in the quality of the devices that people are able to view and play these games on and the wide range of locations in which they are able to do so—not just in the home but on a portable device, on a portable computer and so on.


These are issues on which the parliament, the government and the regulatory system in this area must be continually vigilant. The coalition strongly believes in that as a principle, and that is why we have established an Online Safety Working Group, exploring the whole question of content in the online world and particularly how to ensure the safe delivery of content for people under the age of 18. We have focused in our work on protecting children, particularly on ensuring that parents, schools and others with responsibility to care for children have available to them the tools to ensure that those in their care are adequately protected and are not using the internet, online channels, to engage with material which may be inappropriate. Providing informative and comprehensive ratings of games is one very important way to give effect to that principle.


In evidence that the Online Safety Working Group has received already, we have learned about the pervasiveness of the consumption of games amongst people under the age of 18—as well as, of course, amongst adults. The policy issues that raises are significant, and clearly one of those issues is ensuring that parents, who typically—not exclusively, but typically—will be making a consumption decision in relation to games for their children, particularly their younger children, are well informed and are able to assess very readily the suitability of the product for their child.


One of the issues when it comes to online consumption, online activity, by children is that it is often the case that children are better informed about the devices, the products and the tools, than their parents are. A complication in this area is that everything is converging, so devices like the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox are not just gaming devices but also internet access devices. Many parents do not have a very clear idea of the capabilities of these devices, just as many parents, I would suggest, may not fully appreciate that when they give their 10- or 11-year-old a WiFi-enabled iPod—and the research I have conducted suggests that that was the Christmas present du jour in the Christmas just gone—they are giving their children, including 10- and 11-year-olds, unfettered access to the internet and everything that it has to offer, good and bad.


So the challenge for regulators and governments in this area will be a continuing one. In the case of gaming and in the case of the internet more broadly, these technologies offer many benefits: tremendous entertainment, which is enormously engaging and very professionally delivered, and a tremendous resource to access information and to engage in e-commerce, telemedicine, distance education and all of these good things. But, just as the roads are very useful facilities but we need to take proper care to ensure public safety on the roads, we also need to ensure that we take proper care for public safety when it comes to the internet and when it comes, amongst other things, to the gaming world. So the legislation that is before the House this afternoon has the coalition's full support, because we believe it achieves the objective of delivering better informed consumers and protecting those who appropriately need to be protected.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (16:51):  I thank all members for their contribution to the debate on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (R 18+ Computer Games) Bill 2012. This is an important reform—some 10 years in the making. It will create an R18+ category for computer games. As members who have participated in this debate are aware, currently the highest legally available classification category for computer games is MA15+. This reform will bring the classification categories for computer games into line with existing categories used to classify films and make the Australian classification regime more consistent with international standards. As many members have said in this debate, this has been the subject of extensive public consultation over recent years. There is a very high level of public interest in this issue and public support for the introduction of an R18+ category.


When the Attorney-General's Department released a discussion paper on the introduction of an R18+ classification category for computer games in 2009 they received 58,437 submissions in response. Of those, 98 per cent supported the introduction of an R18+ category. Let me take this opportunity to thank the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, who have conducted a short inquiry into this bill. The committee recommended that the bill be passed, noting the extensive public consultation that has already occurred on the introduction of an R18+ category for computer games. The bill also has the support of state and territory attorneys-general, who agreed to this reform at the Standing Council on Law and Justice meeting in July of last year. Following the passage of this legislation through the Senate, the states and territories will pass their own complementary legislation to ensure that R18+ computer games are appropriately regulated. Subject to this occurring, the national scheme will commence on 1 January next year. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (18:29):  I rise this evening to acknowledge the thousands of Australians who were detained in internment camps during World War II or were subject to other forms of discrimination and deprivation on the basis of their migrant heritage. I have brought this motion to express heartfelt regret that in those circumstances we misjudged and mistreated a minority of our fellow citizens while in the thrall of fear and prejudice and, in so doing, subjected many good people to suffering. More than that, I want to recognise and pay tribute to the fact that those people who were interned, including more than 1,000 Italian internees in Western Australia, put aside the suffering inflicted on them and, in the return to peace, renewed their profound contribution to the rich and diverse multicultural Australia that we now all share.


I cannot think of a better example of this than Tom D'Orsogna, a resident of Fremantle, who at 21 years of age was interned in Fremantle Prison. The food was poor and strictly rationed, and the general conditions of internment affected the health of many internees. But, upon his release, Tom D'Orsogna simply got on with his life. He opened a small butcher's shop on Stone Street in Fremantle, and today his smallgoods business employs 450 workers and has an Australia-wide presence and reputation for excellence.


Before I go further, I want to thank all the members who are contributing to this debate this evening, and I want to particularly acknowledge the advocacy and leadership of Peter Tagliaferri, the former Mayor of Fremantle, a longstanding and active member of the Western Australian Italian community and my good friend. Peter's grandfather and father were interned during the Second World War, and he grew up in a community dealing with the effects of that policy and with the prejudice that underwrote it.


The situation at the outset of World War II was so starkly different from today as to be virtually impossible to hold in one's imagination. There was a sense that the most basic order of things was being torn apart and that destruction, chaos and tyranny were spreading inexorably across the world's map. Whole nations had been invaded, defeated and annexed, and the idea that Australia too might experience invasion and subjugation, as Poland, France and China had done, was very real. It was in those circumstances that Australia put in place security measures under the provisions of the National Security Act 1939-1940. Internment of people designated as 'enemy aliens' or 'naturalised persons of enemy origin' was a key part of that policy.


While I am not here to say that the people who believed those measures necessary were bad people, I am here to say that the measures themselves were wrong. Thousands of migrant Australians whose lives were enmeshed in the social and economic fabric of their communities had their houses ransacked and their menfolk seized and put in prison out of fear that they might collaborate with our enemies. Between 1940 and 1943 nearly 9,000 people of Italian, German and Japanese descent were interned. That included more than 20 per cent of Australia's Italian population and an astounding 97 per cent of all people originating from Japan, including women and children.


Internees were stripped of their rights, their dignity, their liberty and their family. Those not interned were subject to restrictions on movement and property. Of course, the families who lost their fathers, sons and brothers also lost their livelihood and personal security. At the same time as we acknowledge the wrong that was done through internment, we should recognise and celebrate the remarkable fortitude shown by women and families within migrant communities who kept their households and children afloat in a time of terrible uncertainty, hardship and loneliness.


I bring this motion for debate because the internment policy should be better remembered as part of Australia's World War II history but also because I represent an electorate whose Italian community was one of the worst affected. It is a community that continues to be such a deeply intrinsic part of Fremantle's character, its flavour and diversity, and its distinctive joie de vivre—or should I say its sense of la bella vita?


I want to thank Tony Piccolo, the member for Light in South Australia, for raising this matter in the South Australian parliament last year. Mr Piccolo highlighted the practice of housing prisoners of war together with internees. This caused the death of one internee who was killed in a fight for expressing his support of Australia's cause. He died in defending his country even while his country had turned its heart against him.


One of the terrible things about war is the way it pushes a tide of fear and intolerance through any civil society, freshening prejudice and turning what might be a latent discrimination into measures that can amount to real cruelty. This certainly occurred in Australia in the early 1940s through the harsh and summary internment of migrant Australians. It was a self-inflicted wound. It caused suffering to our fellow Australians and to the communities from which they were torn. I believe it is right that we express our regret for those policies and our admiration for the people who endured them and, through their courage and forbearance, transcended them.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (18:34):  It is with much pleasure that I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Fremantle. I congratulate the member for Fremantle for moving this motion and bringing it before the chamber but also for bringing before the chamber a very sad part of our history that unfortunately gets forgotten. It is left out of the history books quite a lot. The motion sincerely acknowledges the experience of enemy aliens who were interned in Australia during World War II and the severe and detrimental impacts that that policy had on the families and communities involved. I speak to this motion as a proud daughter of Italian migrants with a degree of personal experience, as my grandfather was interned at the Loveday Camp, near Barmera, in South Australia. I will relay some of that experience later on.


In both world wars Australia interned not only civilians from a number of enemy countries but also civilians brought to the country from elsewhere, including British and Dutch possessions in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as seamen and passengers from any merchant ships impounded in port or intercepted at sea. This was common international practice, with internment of enemy civilians occurring in most countries that were engaged in both world wars. The rationale behind that was that their presence, supposedly, posed some sort of threat and security risk to our great nation. History will show that that particular theory was deeply flawed. It was discriminatory, ethically wrong and logically unsound. Indeed, as the motion notes, many of the persons interned were born in Australia, Australian residents or British subjects. These people in turn became known as 'enemy aliens'. According to the research that I have gleaned from the Parliamentary Library, during the high point of internment in Australia, in September 1942, some 6,780 persons were held in custody, including 1,029 Germans, 3,651 Italians and 1,036 Japanese civilians.


I think it is fair to say that the group that was severely impacted by the policy was the largest group, the Italian-Australian community. During the period of the policy nearly 17,000 people were interned. Nearly 5,000 of them were Italo-Australians and over 2,000 of them were from Queensland. It is a very sad part of our history and a very sad part of history for many Italo-Australians. 


The process of internment, as the member for Fremantle spoke about, was very harsh. It was disrespectful and undignified. Many families were separated and divided. They had to endure the spectacle of being dragged from their homes, in front of their neighbours and families. They were interned not by individual assessment of the supposed risk they imposed but because they had a certain cultural and heritage background. Quite often their homes would be ransacked and destroyed, leaving emotional and traumatic scars. We should acknowledge not just those who were interned but also the women and children, as the member for Fremantle spoke about, who were left to fend for themselves after their husbands or their fathers had been taken.


Last week I went to a Co.As.It. International Women's Day lunch where Anna Barbi spoke of the experiences of her and her husband being taken away from their property in Far North Queensland. She was forced to go back and live with her family. There was no way that she could continue the family farm. The banks foreclosed because the farm was no longer productive.


I also had a grandfather interned in South Australia. I want to pay tribute to him. In the whole time I knew him when he was alive he never spoke of the camps, but he was interned for about three years. Again, he was working in Far North Queensland when he was taken. He did become the camp cook, which later led to him opening a restaurant. It was a very sad period for many Italo-Australians in this country.


In conclusion, it is absolutely right that the Commonwealth parliament acknowledges what the enemy aliens went through and expresses its regret at the suffering and the damage that was caused. I am very proud to support the motion that has been put forward today by the member for Fremantle.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (18:39):  I congratulate the member for Fremantle on moving this motion not only to outline the specifics of the Second World War incarceration but because it represents a broader international problem. After the Second World War, Stalin deported hundreds of thousands of Chechens, Volga Germans and Crimean Tatars. In Czechoslovakia the government expelled hundreds of thousands of Sudeten Germans. This is symptomatic of societies that distrust their citizens in times of conflict. I do not want to cover extensively the Second World War situation—other members have—but there are some very worrying historical patterns in this country. In the First World War, because we had doubts that King Constantine would stay onside with the allies, every Greek family in this country was investigated by the precursor of ASIO, who went to their neighbours and asked them about their loyalty. In the Riverina, particularly, in both world wars the large number of German settlers were very heavily persecuted and the names of towns were changed. I had the opportunity in my political career to discuss this with Tim Fischer, a previous National Party member from the Riverina, whose own family endured these kinds of circumstances. It was not here of course. In the United States, although they only incarcerated one per cent of Hawaii's huge Japanese population, 100,000 Japanese in the United States were incarcerated. It was only Reagan's apology in 1998 that put some end to that.


Similar events occurred in this country. Sir Henry Bolte was probably one of the toughest politicians this country has ever produced and was famous for hanging Ronald Ryan. If you go to this country's National Archives and listen to his oral history, he said that throughout his political career he always dreaded that the Australian people would find that he was of German extraction. In the Riverina, in Mildura, and in the Albury area we incarcerated two Lutheran ministers because they might have been pro Nazi. One of them, unfortunately, was a Lutheran convert from Judaism. A person active in Sydney's Jewish community, Josie Lacey, tells the story that, when she arrived here as a Jewish refugee, she and her family were so distrusted that they were not allowed to live on the coastline near Bondi or Vaucluse. They were moved out to Wentworthville because they might otherwise communicate with German submarines.


My local Guilford chemist is of Italian extraction and told the story that throughout the Second World War his father was forced to work for the Catholic Church from Monday to Friday, basically for nothing, and only come home on weekends. We have a situation in this country where, in times of conflict, minorities are doubted and there is no respect for their citizenship of this country. Amongst the 7,000 incarcerated during the Second World War, 1,500 were nationals and were actually British citizens.


There are other things I had not heard about. One thing I came across when reading about this resolution was an incident that I was previously unaware of. At Cape Bedford in Northern Queensland, because the local Lutheran pastor was a German, they moved 250 Aboriginal Australians to Cooktown and Cairns because we could not trust them because they had a Lutheran pastor. Of those people, 28 died in the first month because of the change of temperature and climate and, eventually by March 1943, 60 of them had perished. We pride ourselves on multiculturalism and, of course, we are a world leader. But these are things we should be very careful of. As I say, in times of frantic nationalism and patriotism, these kinds of mentalities and situations arise.


Another incident in this country happened in Broken Hill, where rioters burned down the German club and a large number of other properties connected with Germans. It is a situation that is very damning. The major writer in this area is Klaus Newmann author of In the Interest of National Securityand another article on Wolf Klaphake entitled, A Doubtful Character. Another incident is that a person, who was an inventor, was victimised by the German Nazis and managed to get to this country. However, he fled and got to this country to be liberated and then we incarcerated him because he might have been a Nazi sympathiser.


The dimensions of this are that people were ostracised by their neighbours, by the people that they went to school with and by their friends, they were marginalised in society and not trusted, their lives were basically torn asunder and careers that they might have aspired to were destroyed. All of these are things that are very integral to the resolution that the member for Fremantle has moved. I recommend it very strongly to the House and congratulate her endeavour in an important issue.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-03-19,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:44):  I rise tonight to acknowledge the many people who were interned in Australia during World War II. Many of those interned were dinky-di Aussies who had contributed greatly to Australia. Last month the South Australian parliament unanimously accepted a bipartisan motion, moved by Labor member for Light, Tony Piccolo, to acknowledge the internment of Italian civilians living in Australia during the Second World War. I acknowledge the member for Fremantle's motion and accept that, in many cases in many ways, it was wrongful internment. As the Australian government established a war economy it also began to take steps to neutralise what was considered the potential threat posed by resident aliens. The Australian War Memorial noted that, at the time:


Australians were gripped by an irrational panic about the potential for the tens of thousands of foreign nationals resident in Australia to become saboteurs or spies.


The decision was made to introduce severe restrictions on the aliens and, in some cases, to imprison them in internment camps. The internment of aliens was considered to be a last resort, and women and children were not allowed to be interned. The process of arrest and internment was usually peaceful but, as the member for Brisbane pointed out, it was unfortunately often not the case. Authorities sought internment only if there was a reasonable case and evidence against an individual enemy alien, such as evidence which linked them to participation in or membership of the Nazi or fascist movement. People tied to the movements responsible for the war in Europe made Australians feel understandably apprehensive. They believed that by interning them they were reducing the potential threat they posed to the protection of Australia, our internal security and peace of mind for the wider population. 


I acknowledge the disruption these migrants faced and stress which it placed upon their families. To many, it seemed unfair, and it was unfair that they were being persecuted for their beliefs, often on evidence they felt was incorrect. Others could not understand why they were being segregated because of who they were and their place of origin—their heritage. However, we must acknowledge that a decision was made to protect the wider community based on the information at hand. In my electorate of Riverina, Griffith has a strong Italian community, with about 60 per cent of the city claiming an Italian background. Many Italians moved to Griffith post-World War II to join family who were already resident there or because they were aware of the Italian community that was already established. The Italian influence in Griffith expanded the fruit and vegetable range and also significantly increased the number of wineries and the range of wines produced, with nationally and internationally recognised wineries including De Bortoli and Casella wines. 


It is important that we acknowledge parts of our history which are not necessarily elements which we find acceptable or palatable today. Many would deem the internment of people as xenophobic and based on irrational panic. However, we must also look back through the eyes of the people of the time to ensure that we do not unfairly judge them for actions they felt were being undertaken to protect Australian citizens and to help prevent war arriving in Australia, possibly from within. I accept the member for Werriwa's mention of the change of name of Holbrook, from Germanton, to avoid the obvious connotations and connectivity. 


Lobbyist Steve Carney was in the House this afternoon and spoke of the two Italian prisoners of war who worked on the Purlewaugh property of his father Arthur during the Second World War. 'Hard workers, good people' was how he described these men. Indeed, many Italian migrants and POWs and people of Italian heritage contributed mightily to this country during these difficult, torrid and worrying times. They were also desperate years, and those in authority did what they felt was necessary to safeguard our people and our security. That is, after all, the key role of government. It was then and it remains more so than ever today. However, I do commend the member for Fremantle for her motion and I commend it to the House.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-03-19,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (18:48):  I too rise in support of the member for Fremantle's motion, which, according to the motion itself, is drawn from a motion moved in the South Australian parliament by the member for Light, Tony Piccolo. There were 18 internment camps during World War II, including Yanco, Hay and Cowra in New South Wales; Nangwarry and Loveday near Barmera in my own home state of South Australia; Gaythorne in Queensland; Dhurringile, Murchison and Tatura in Victoria; and Harvey and Northam in Western Australia. People suspected of being of German, Italian or Japanese background were targeted and persecuted by ordinary members of Australian society. There were stories of vandalism, sackings and personal assault. It would have been a terrible time for many people of German, Italian or Japanese background—many of whom had been here, in some cases, for a couple of generations or more. The government did not intern all people of German, Italian or Japanese background. Curtin acknowledged that this would not increase our security. Of those in Australia during that period, 33 per cent of German background, 15 per cent of Italian background and 97 per cent—almost every single person—of Japanese background were interned through the war, irrespective of the level of threat they represented. Internees were grouped in camps along cultural or national lines. People of German descent were interned together irrespective of their political views and we would have had many Germans who were anti-Nazi at the time and, in fact, were advocating in Australia against Hitler. Likewise those of Italian background. I suppose they were grouping communists, anarchists, fascists and the apolitical all into one.


We know there were many people of Italian and German backgrounds who were against the fascist movement in Europe, but this would not have made any difference. Mistakes and errors in judgment were made in my own electorate where I have many Italians and many people of Greek background who held Italian passports because, as a result of their islands—mainly the islands of Rhodes and Kos—being made up as a protectorate of Italy after the breakup of the Ottoman empire in 1921, were interned even though Greece was an ally. Even though they were clearly Greek, they held Italian passports and it took months of negotiations to release them.


Recently I launched a book in South Australia, The story of a community: a short pictorial history of the Greek Orthodox community in South Australia. The Greek community at the time of the war decided to make special badges saying 'We are Allies' and they would wear them in the city so that they would not be abused by people who thought that they were the enemy. The internment in November 1942 of a known antifascist campaigner, Francesco Fantin, with fascists at the Loveday site in South Australia's Riverland epitomised the injustice and absurdity of the practice of internment. He was a long-standing and active opponent of Italy's fascist regime. Fantin was put in a camp with supporters of Mussolini's fascist state and it led to him being killed. Born in 1901, Francesco Giovanni Fantin left Italy as an antifascist immigrant in 1924. In 1927 he established the antifascist Matteotti Club in Melbourne and the Mourilyan Italian Progressive Club in Queensland. He was overlooked in the first round of internments in 1940 but was arrested in 1942 as an enemy alien. In the internment camp at Loveday in South Australia's Riverland, Fantin continued his political activity and was organising with other antifascists sample donations of sheepskins which they sent to Russia, which at the time was a key ally against Hitler and Mussolini. The fundraising in the Loveday camp proved provocative to the interned fascists who targeted and murdered him on 16 November 1942.


The internment regulations were considered by civil libertarians to be draconian. The onus of proof against internment was placed on individuals to show that they were not enemy aliens and should not be interned. In the years of internment, 7,000 Australian residents were interned and a further 5,000 civilians interned from overseas. These included people from mainland Europe, including people of Jewish background, and people from the United Kingdom, Dutch, British and French colonies in the Pacific and South-East Asia. Prisoners of war were also imprisoned with these interns. There were a number of constituents in my electorate who were interned in World War II but as far as I know they all have passed away.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (18:53):  I rise to support the member for Fremantle and to thank her very much for her motion, which is detailed, personal and entirely appropriate. History records that in the interests of national security the Australian government interned thousands of men and women during World War I and World War II. It is fair to say that they thought they were doing that with the best of policy intentions, but it is also fair to say that there were many, many voices that spoke against it at the time—voices of reason, voices of compassion.


History has shown that the policy was wrong. Those present, at the time, should have told them the policy was wrong. Most of those who were interned were classed as 'enemy aliens'—that is, they were nationals of countries at war with Australia. The reasons for establishing these camps and interning foreign nationals were apparently threefold: first, to prevent residents from assisting Australia's enemies; second, to appease public opinion; and, third, to house overseas internees sent to Australia for the duration of the war.


Somehow we as a nation at the time lost sight of the fact that when Australians sailed off to war in November 1914 from Albany four ships sailed: two cruisers and one other ship escorted by a Japanese warship crewed by Japanese sailors. Somehow we forgot that Australians of Chinese descent have served Australians in every war from the Sudan in 1885 through to Iraq in 2005. In fact, the earliest Chinese-Australian serviceman is Sergeant John Joseph Shying who served with the New South Wales contingent in the Anglo-Egyptian War in the Sudan in 1885. Shying's grandfather Mak Sai Pang came to Sydney in 1818. He married Sarah Ferguson in 1823. Sarah was a free settler who had come to Australia with her convict mother. Christopher Shying, another family member, served in the 1st AIF.


Many Chinese men and citizens of other nations stormed the beaches of Gallipoli. It is one of the great enduring factors of us as a nation that we are one of the great multicultural nations on earth. In April 1915, with the Federation just 15 years young, the great thing about Australia's ill-fated assault on the Gallipoli Peninsula is that it was done by Australians, many of whom were not born here. They were Geordies, Italians, Chinese and Japanese—the force that assaulted the peninsular was made up of men from all different nations. That is why it is disappointing that ostensibly through the First and Second World Wars the government of the day, albeit with the best of intentions, fell back on a sense of unease and established a range of internment camps.


These camps were established across the country, from Cowra in New South Wales to Enoggera in Queensland, Harvey in Western Australia, Hay in New South Wales, Holsworthy and Liverpool in New South Wales, Loveday in South Australia, Rottnest Island in Western Australia, and Tatura and Rushworth in Victoria. In World War II, internees were often held in smaller camps before being transferred to larger ones—Bathurst in New South Wales in 1939, Long Bay from 1939 to 1941, Orange in New South Wales in 1940-41, Parkeston in Western Australia and Dhurringile near Murchison in Victoria.


The aim of internment was to identify and intern those who posed a particular threat to the safety or defence of the country, notwithstanding that many of their own countrymen were fighting beside Australians from other lands who had come to call our country home. As the war progressed the policy changed and Japanese residents were interned en masse, again forgetting our history as our soldiers sailed from Albany en route to World War I. Most internees during the First and Second World Wars were nationals of Australia's main enemy during respective conflicts. Their only crime was to have been born in or associated with the country with which we found ourselves in conflict. In the latter years of World War II Germans and Italians were interned on the basis of nationality alone, rather than any particular threat that authorities may have believed had been posed. Over 20 per cent of all Italians residing in Australia during World War II were interned.


That is why I think it is important that the member for Fremantle brings the motion for debate and discussion within the halls of parliament today. It is an important motion. We should not run from our history or hide from it. We should not try to reinvent it or re-interpret it. We should accept it and understand it. If we are wrong we should apologise for it. As a nation we should embrace and move forward together with a shared view of our future.


Debate adjourned.

"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2012-03-19,"



Mrs GASH
 (Gilmore) (21:00):  I well remember several elections ago when my Labor opponent was lambasting me about Gilmore's dubious honour of having the highest unemployment rate in the country. Since then we have since improved considerably, but I might say that record was achieved at the same time that the state Labor government was hitting us with tough new environmental rules. The Shoalhaven, particularly, was swamped with new national parks and reserves as well as many other environmental constraints. Especially restrictive was the legislation severely limiting development within one kilometre of coastal strips, including around any waterways that flowed into the coast.


The new environmental regime effectively discouraged many direct and some indirect investment opportunities for our future. While some of Bob Carr's more pragmatic Labor successors have since back-pedalled on that philosophy, his damaging legacy remains. New South Wales would not have lost a federal seat to Queensland if it were not for the fact that so much of the population decided to desert New South Wales during the Carr term of government simply to escape a state in obvious economic decline. So there is an element of irony around Gilmore's boundaries being expanded to take in the southern areas of what once was the safest Labor seat in the country, Throsby.


In Gilmore we did not have the luxury of a buffer of extensive industry infrastructure nor the diversity of interest to shift costs in response to any economic downturn. Whilst it may have come as a relief for New South Wales residents to finally see the end of Labor in 2011, they still have to live with Labor incompetence in Canberra. I am indebted to my colleague Malcolm Turnbull who coined the zinger phrase 'Morris Iemma comes to Canberra' to describe Labor's election to federal government. How prophetic a statement was that? Peter Hartcher, of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote on 23 May 2008:


This instantly conjures the full horror of the NSW Labor Government in all its rotten, dysfunctional incompetence. And it reminds everyone that that nice man, Kevin Rudd, is actually a part of the same crew that produced the nightmare in NSW.


Have we moved on since then? I doubt it very much. Last year, BlueScope Steel announced massive job cuts in Port Kembla. Just last week, another 56 jobs went from nearby OneSteel. If that is not enough, local manufacturers now face a new crisis, with the Gillard government trying to force through new shipping reforms that could see local jobs slashed because of an increase in shipping costs and delays in gaining access to vessels. The Illawarra Mercury had this to say last week: 'The Illawarra is suffering through its worst manufacturing crisis in recent memory. Fifty-six further jobs are to go, our region is suffering and we are in crisis. There is no other word for it, and anybody says it is not is not living in the real world.'


The article goes on: 'There are many closures happening every day, every second day. There are reductions of staff happening everywhere.' On reading this, I thought, 'Great. The member for Throsby is finally concerned about job losses in his electorate and my adjoining electorate of Gilmore.' But, no, it was the AWU branch secretary, Wayne Phillips, saying the words. It is not often that I agree with a union rep. However, to his credit, as a solution to this ongoing problem, the member for Throsby, a member of the government, said that he had set up a group within the Labor Party to agitate for more action around this particular issue. He talks the talk, but is he going to walk the walk? Job losses do not seem to be a high priority for the government members from the Illawarra, and the member for Throsby has even put time aside so he can pursue his own distractions.


Labor provokes and encourages class warfare, especially through their workplace legislation. They play the politics of envy and resentment. Industrial disputes are on the way up and business is expressing concerns at the way the Fair Work Act is not working. Business is reluctant to hire, retail is in the doldrums, manufacturing is in decline and investment confidence is zero. There is a palpable lack of confidence in the government, as there was in the New South Wales Labor government in its dying days. They just cannot seem to get anything right, so, when the distractions no longer work for Labor, where will they turn? Perhaps they can toy with the idea of censorship, strangling free expression and free comment. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy toyed with the idea of censorship for the internet, but what was the real agenda? Perhaps censorship is the real purpose of the Finkelstein inquiry. As the Australian commented:


The Finkelstein report is worrying because its recommendations could stifle the media.


People are worried about where this government has put us and worried about where it is taking us. The polls are showing it, depressed retail spending reflects it and the media is replete with reports warning Labor not to rely on the mining profits for its salvation. The silken reassurance of ministers that 'She'll be right' ring hollow. One cannot help but feel that with Bob Carr now in federal politics it is deja vu for New South Wales residents. Gilmore does not have the economic resilience to weather an economic downturn that events across the globe are indicating is a real possibility. Neither is the government in a position to splash money around like it did in 2008 and beyond.


I have serious doubts that the mining industry will be our economic saviour, because worrying reports are emerging that potential investors may start looking in other places because it is too expensive to do business in Australia. Our local manufacturers are just hanging on against the high Australian dollar and soon-to-come burden of the carbon tax. It has been reported that China's steel output will be halved over the next three years, which signals an overall slow in demand in their economy. It is not a good forecast for our economy, so closely linked as it is to that of China. Already the price the government have put on carbon is almost double world standards, yet the government remain bloody-minded towards accepting world parity. Hanging onto a price that is over double that of the global market makes us uncompetitive. We need opportunity, not more taxes and certainly not more regulation.


The government also said they were going to look after regional Australia. Last year, we tried to impress on the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government the importance of fast-tracking the extension of Main Road 92 and the upgrade of the Princes Highway. Both are vital infrastructure projects whose importance grows with the speed of the population, which in the Shoalhaven has been at a rate of about 2,000 persons each year over the last five years. So what did Gilmore get in regional funding from the government? Zero. After looking at the distribution of the first round of regional funding, $140.5 million had gone to Labor electorates and Labor-supporting Independent electorates; $58.1 million went to coalition electorates or Western Australian National electorates. Over 73 per cent of the funding had been directed to shore up Labor. Yet the Shoalhaven's growth rate is way ahead of the growth of necessary local infrastructure, which is simply not keeping pace. There is a single crossing at the Shoalhaven River for road vehicles, as we do not have a railway line south of Bomaderry to the Victorian border. Another will soon be needed to cope with the growing traffic volumes.


As proof of the government's sincerity in this year's budget, I would like to see some serious funding commitments to help the people of Gilmore—budget commitments like funding for local transport infrastructure, including the Princes Highway, and funding for mental health. We want to see the marina project at Shell Cove get a $10 million kick-start and funding for a national disability trust. We need more skills and trade schools for those not going on to tertiary education, as was promised. And where is our GP superclinic that was promised two Christmases ago? We want to see the funding support for a scoping study into the development of Huskisson and Ulladulla boat harbours and, of course, money to help finish the Dunn and Lewis Bali memorial facility. These are all vital projects for the job creation program in a region that has a 10 per cent unemployment level.


Somebody recently said that, as a government, Labor seems to make a good opposition. It was the respected Dick Warburton who said: 'Labor’s obsession with redistributing national income, rather than protecting jobs and growing wealth, is coming back to bite us all in the form of job insecurity and unsustainable pressure on many previously strong industries.'


Gilmore just wants a real chance at opportunity, not the obstruction and frustration of failed policies of successive Labor governments. We need infrastructure projects that deliver real growth opportunities—projects which do not fail or go bankrupt, taking many of our local subcontractors with them; projects which will pay the mortgage and grocery bills for all the residents of Gilmore and reduce the threat of relying on welfare benefits.
