"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-12-07,"—My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. Isn't it the case that the contract for `GST start-up funding assistance' determining the legal obligations for charitable organisations stipulates that this funding is to be paid in progressive instalments up until July 2000? Minister, doesn't this arrangement provide the government with extra leverage to demand that charities favourably comment when each instalment is paid—that is, not just once, but two or three times over the period of the grant?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Charitable Organisations</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-12-07,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Isn't it true that the demand for favourable comment from charities in return for Commonwealth funding is unprecedented? Minister, this obligation has never been imposed on charities before, has it?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Charitable Organisations</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-07,"—This is typical of the overall low standard of the opposition. Senator, it may have been of help to you if you had listened to the Treasurer this morning when he was speaking with Fiona Reynolds on the AM  program.
—A very good interview.
—Yes, it was an exceedingly good interview, and I will share with you what he said on this matter because if you had heard him I doubt whether you would have asked the question. The Treasurer said:
The whole objection—
the thrust of your question—
. . . was that people didn't disclose that they were being funded. So we put a clause in a contract requiring them to disclose. And what the contract says is, if you are running a seminar explaining GST, you must acknowledge that you've received a grant from the Commonwealth to do it if that is the case.
All we are trying to do is to make it clear to people that there is Commonwealth funding. Let me draw your attention to a comment by Mr Raper, the ACOSS President. Mr Raper is not someone who is traditionally noted as coming out—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! There are senators on my left interjecting and shouting. If you have some comment there is an appropriate time to debate it. You should not sit and shout all through question time.
—Mr Raper, the President of ACOSS—
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—Senator Schacht, I have just addressed you on the matter of behaviour.
—Mr Raper is not noted for being supportive of the government on this GST package. The Treasurer indicated that Mr Raper feels totally at liberty to criticise the policy. The Treasurer went on to say:
All it says is, if you are running a seminar, if you decide to run a seminar on tax compliance and the Commonwealth government has funded that seminar, then you should disclose that.
The truth of the matter is that I have not noted any charities that are loath to come out and make comments on government policy.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. I never asked the minister about the Treasurer, I never asked the minister about Mr Raper and I never asked to be read long extracts from their speeches. I asked him a direct question that required a simple answer about the contractual terms the government is insisting on that charities sign up to in order to get public funding to help them convert to the GST.
—There is no point of order, Senator Cook; you are making a speech.
—The point of order is that the answer is not relevant to the question. Will you direct the minister to answer the question and not evade it?
—There is no point of order.
—I was going to speak on the point of order, but as you have ruled Senator Cook out of order I will not bother to. Senator Cook asked about the contract which charities are signing. My answer refers in detail to the contract which charities are 
 signing and I am throwing Senator Cook's comments into an appropriate perspective. I urge Senator Cook to listen very carefully. It is always wise to listen to what the Treasurer says.
—What's the purpose of it?
—Why don't you listen to the answer—or else, Senator Murphy, you would be better off going back to fly-fishing.
—Senator Kemp, direct your remarks to the chair.
—It is true to say that Senator Murphy is more successful at fly-fishing than asking questions and making policy comments in the Senate. That is the point I am making. Before I was so rudely interrupted by Senator Cook, I was saying that the fact of the matter is that charities are making comments on the GST and on a wide range of issues. We are always happy to consult with charities. As I have said so often in the past, we are a consultative government. The interpretation that you are putting on this contract, Senator, is entirely fallacious.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Charitable Organisations</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-07,"—I would have to check this but my understanding is that there have been similar clauses which have been included in contracts in the past. That is my understanding, Senator. But the whole nub of your question goes to whether charities are loath to comment on the GST. The short answer to that question is that charities are not loath to comment on the GST—you only have to look, Senator Cook, at the newspapers this morning and the newspapers yesterday. I think it is true to say that charities are quite happy and confident to comment on the GST; and I refer of course to the comments by Mr Raper, who is the President of ACOSS. So there we are: the question is fully answered in detail. I have been more than kind to you, Senator Cook.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Charitable Organisations</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1999-12-07,"—On 25 November, Senator McKiernan asked me a question in relation to some comments of Chief Justice Murray Gleeson and whether unrepresented litigants were dealing with state or Commonwealth laws. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator McKiernan asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 25 November 1999:
(1) Does the Minister believe that High Court Chief Justice Murray Gleeson is correct when he said that the Howard government's cutbacks to legal aid are causing problems of `substantial practical dimensions' which are threatening the efficiency of the Australian courts and their ability to deliver justice?
(2) Can the Minister indicate whether all of the unrepresented litigants were dealing in matters of state law or commonwealth law and why they were unrepresented?
Senator Vanstone—I referred the honourable senator's questions to the Attorney-General, who has provided the following supplementary information to the answers I provided at the time.
(1) Chief Justice Gleeson's remarks referred to the presence of unrepresented litigants in the court process.
The Government does not consider that there is empirical evidence to support the claim that there has been an increase in unrepresented litigants due to the Commonwealth's changes to the legal aid funding arrangements. Recent reports which indicate a different view rely on limited anecdotal evidence to support their claims.
There are a number of reasons why people may not be represented in court. People may choose to represent themselves, or they may fail  to meet legal aid commission means and merit tests. Consequently, it is unlikely that those litigants would have qualified for legal aid funding in those circumstances, in any case. 

The Commonwealth has maintained funding for legal aid in Commonwealth law matters at 1995-96 levels. The data available to us from legal aid commissions does not enable us to reach any conclusions regarding levels of self representation. However, the Government considers this is an important area which would benefit from more thorough research. The Australian Law Reform Commission is looking at this issue as part of its reference on the adversarial process with a discussion paper to be released early next year. In addition, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Finance have commissioned the Justice Research Centre to conduct research in the area of self funded litigants and is expected to report early next year. The Family Law Council also intends undertaking a project on litigants in person in the family law context and has formed a committee for that purpose.
(2) Information concerning whether matters before the High Court involving self represented litigants arise under Commonwealth or State law is not available from the legal aid statistics collection and would have to be sought directly from the High Court.
However, Commonwealth funding for legal aid services has not generally been used to support High Court litigation. Commonwealth legal aid funds are provided to assist those who are in most need, particularly for resolving disputes in relation to family law matters.
In any case, because of the diversity of factors which may determine whether or not a person is represented the information sought would not alone provide evidence of a link between self representation and changes to the Commonwealth's legal aid funding arrangements.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Legal Aid: Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1999-12-07,"—Pursuant to notice given at the last day of sitting on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I now withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2 standing in my name for six sitting days after today for the disallowance of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 3), as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No. 202 and made under the Customs Act 1901.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Withdrawal</title>,Notices,2,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-12-07,"—The reason why I have proposed this matter of public importance today is that there is great concern about this issue in the dairy industry and amongst dairy farmers. Last week I attended three meetings on this, as well as being here for sittings of the Senate. 
 One of my representatives attended another meeting and I have further requests for meetings in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. There is significant concern in all of those states—and in fact in every state of Australia—about this matter. The meetings which I attended included Victoria. I say that because it has been very interesting to listen to some of the rhetoric about this issue which says that all of the farmers in Victoria are behind deregulation. Certainly in the meetings I attended the concern was about half and half—half of those present supported deregulation and half did not. A rough poll taken by Channel 9 at a meeting in Shepparton showed about 55 per cent of the audience against deregulation and about 45 per cent in favour. We know of course that the Victorian government itself will be entering the debate in the sense that there will be a plebiscite in the next couple of weeks for which a question has been prepared. The plebiscite will be taken amongst Victorian dairy farmers.
Today I want to look at the various recommendations of the report and put them into the context of the rest of the report so that people will understand how they have come about. Then I hope to convince the Senate and perhaps put pressure on the government to respond to those recommendations, because I believe they are critical to this whole debate about deregulation. The package which the government has announced is inadequate, and without implementation of the recommendations of our report, I believe, the action for deregulation will indeed mean disaster for the Australian dairy industry.
The first recommendation urges the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, to call as a matter of urgency a meeting of state agricultural and regional development ministers to determine a framework and a time frame for the coordinated deregulation of the dairy industry. I believe that the Commonwealth has not taken sufficient action in this regard. Whether that is the fault of the Commonwealth or the states has been a matter of great debate, but I certainly support the recommendation of the committee that this meeting be called. It 
 should have been called by now, and it must be called as soon as possible.
The concern I have is that the states are acting independently of one another and, in some cases, acting independently of the Commonwealth. That Victoria is moving to a plebiscite illustrates that. Farmers in other states would also like to have some kind of plebiscite, so there is a need for a national approach. Certainly in the meetings I attended in Victoria, there was a small—and I want to emphasise the word `small'—but vocal minority who were saying, `We don't care about the rest of Australia. We're going to benefit.' I am sure that that is not a universal or even a majority opinion, but it was said strongly. I was very disappointed in that because I believe the dairy industry in Australia is a national industry and must take account of the concerns of all the states.
There is division not only between the states but also within the states. That was particularly clear to me in Victoria, where there is a tremendous amount of bitterness between farmers, depending on which side of the debate they are on, and even between regions. With that and with the divisions between the states, there is an urgent need for all of the states and the Commonwealth to come together to address these issues. There is need for a unified industry and, particularly, for solidarity amongst farmers. If there is not that solidarity, then I believe they will be picked off one by one to their own detriment and to the detriment of this country.
The report, as background to this recommendation, suggested that there are winners and losers. Under the current regulation, under the system we have at the moment, the winners are the farmers, who get a decent return for their work and investment, and the consumers, who have a regulated and guaranteed year-round supply of milk and a price which is not only reasonable but, as has been pointed out on many occasions, below the cost of water.
—So you are against deregulation?
—I am against deregulation. Hadn't I made that clear?
—You hadn't said.
—I will get to that.
—Order! Senator McGauran, you are on the speakers list, so wait your turn.
—Under the current system, the other lot of winners in this whole issue are regional economies. One of the big concerns expressed in our report is the effect of deregulation on regional economies where the main income is dairying. We can refer to the studies done in the Bega Valley and in one of the shires in Western Australia, the name of which I cannot quite remember at the moment. Perhaps Senator Crane might be able to tell us.
—Try Boya.
—Right. They have shown a significant loss for regional economies following deregulation. It is this whole issue of winners and losers which makes it absolutely critical that we pick up recommendation 1 of that report and that this meeting is held as soon as possible.
Another concern in the report was the shift of control and income away from farmers to processors, manufacturers and the large retailers. One of the things which the report said was that the market or commercial pressures will force deregulation. I have made clear that, although it was a unanimous report, I had a reservation at that point. I do not believe that deregulation is inevitable, and I want to return to that a little bit later in this speech.
The other recommendation supported this initial one. Recommendation 2 pointed out that there could be penalties from the National Competition Council if there is any delay in deregulation. I do not agree with that proposition and neither does the committee. Recommendations 3 and 4 pointed out that where there is a loss of quota, as there is in three states, this is a loss of real property and that, where there are regional impacts, these also should be compensated. So we are worried that the package does not address the issue of the loss of quotas or the issue of regional impacts. We recommended that the 
 ACCC monitor the effects on consumers and farmers. That is critical.
Finally, in recommendation 6, having heard claims during the hearings of some of the accountability and transparency processes within some of the large cooperatives, we recommended that an inquiry into the operations and accountability mechanisms of cooperatives be undertaken. I have already begun to do some work in that regard.
Let me finish with a couple of concerns. I am concerned about the Victorian plebiscite because I believe the question which has been posed to farmers is a very loaded question. We warned about that in our report. We said that you should really have a national, professionally prepared survey, not a single question which is too easy to bias. Is deregulation inevitable? No, it is not. It is only a lack of political will to stand against commercial pressures which will make it inevitable. I want to say that it is about time that we realised that in this place we represent people; we do not manage on behalf of powerful corporations. What is the point of standing for election to parliament or to a peak body unless we are prepared to represent the people whom we say we stand for? I urge the government to act now before we lose another one of our primary industries unnecessarily.

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1999-12-07,"—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance relating to the deregulation of the Australian dairy industry and to address the recommendations of the committee, of which Senator Woodley was the chair and of which I and other senators in the chamber, including Senator O'Brien, were members. Senator Calvert attended a number of hearings, as did Senator McGauran.
I found the contribution of our chair somewhat of a contradiction, in that he combined his personal views with the findings of the committee. I do not think there are any of us here who do not support the motion. Certainly the government supports it. It is rather interesting that we have before us an MPI put by the Democrats that we support. The problem I have with Senator Woodley's contribution is that the report made it quite clear that— 
 whether or not we liked it, and whether or not we had a personal view—deregulation of the dairy industry was inevitable. There were a number of reasons for that, but the most important one, when talking about national pools or DMSS schemes, is that the dairy farmers themselves, particularly in the outlying states, did not support a return to either of those schemes, and there is no viable alternative.
It needs to be understood that, if all the states decided not to deregulate, milk would flow from the various business operations across state borders, whether it be from cooperatives or from businesses. The impact of that would be to deregulate the price at the selling point, so the impact would be there regardless of what the states did. The important thing is that there is agreement between the states and the Commonwealth to implement the Commonwealth package and some of the other issues in our report. I quickly wish to deal with those issues. The first recommendation says:
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Government call as a matter of urgency, a meeting of state Agriculture and Regional Development Ministers to determine a framework, and a timeframe, for the co-ordinated deregulation of the Dairy Industry.
The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, has arranged a meeting on 22 December of all state agricultural ministers to determine a framework and a time frame for the coordinated deregulation of the dairy industry. This is the fourth time in the last five months that there has been an endeavour to put together such a meeting. The date is 22 December, which is the day after the Victorian poll result will be announced, and it reflects the urgency and priority that the minister has placed on this issue.
Had the Victorian poll been earlier, the meeting would have been held earlier, but it was deemed by the various state ministers and the federal minister that it would be better to hold that meeting after the poll result was known, and that arrangement is in place. The second recommendation says:
That should administrative arrangements not be in place in time to make the first payments by 1 July 2000, that appropriate compensatory arrangements are factored into the payments schedules, in order that dairy farmers do not suffer any more financial hardship than is presently envisaged.
The government's response to that is that it plans to have the administrative arrangements in place in time to make the first payments by 1 July. Of course, this is dependent to a degree upon the outcome of the ministers' meeting on 22 December, but I have been informed that they will go into that meeting with strong goodwill.
Senator Forshaw interjecting—
—Senator Forshaw smiles. I have been informed that it even includes the New South Wales minister. At least we are getting cooperation from New South Wales. I believe that the only thing that would delay that process would be if it were held up in the political process here, and I do not believe that will happen. Recommendation 3 says:
That the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia consider the issue of quota entitlement and any form of compensation that may be appropriate for the resumption of quota entitlement, including the possibility of using the NCP payments as compensation.
As we all know, this is an issue for the states, but I can tell you that at this point in time the minister for agriculture in Western Australia has invited the dairy industry there to prepare a submission to him dealing with that particular issue. I hope there is similar action taking place in New South Wales and Queensland, but I do not know at this point whether that is the case. Maybe some other people in the debate can assist us in terms of that particular discussion.
The fourth recommendation of the committee says:
That regional adjustment packages for rural and regional communities affected negatively by deregulation be developed by both State and Commonwealth Governments.
This is a matter on the agenda of the ministers' meeting. There has been communication between the minister's office and the various state ministers' offices to address that particular aspect. Hopefully, some guidelines will flow from that and subsequent meetings 
 of officials. We move over the page to recommendation 5:
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in accordance with subsection 17[1] of the Prices Surveillance Act  monitor costs and prices in the dairy industry so that dairy farmers are not unfairly burdened with the cost of the proposed levy.
I am informed that Minister Truss has proposed that the ACCC be resourced to monitor milk prices during the deregulation process and to deal with the substance of this particular recommendation from the committee. Finally, recommendation 6 says:
That an inquiry into the operations and accountability mechanisms of cooperatives be undertaken.
The government asked what purpose such an inquiry would serve our commercial operations. However, the minister has made it clear that this is a separate issue from deregulation and certainly something that he is prepared to have a look at.
Basically, I have gone through the recommendations that were made by the committee and, might I say, without apportioning blame, that at long last we will get the meeting which I think everybody here would liked to have seen happen a month or two ago but for some reluctance by some of the participants. Then the decision of the new Victorian government to have a plebiscite delayed it further. If they work diligently and cooperatively, it is my view that in fact they can deal with the issues in the time that is allowed.
Finally, in answering particular aspects of this MPI, it is worth noting that the committee report was tabled in parliament with the unanimous support of the whole committee—ourselves, the Labor Party and the Democrats. That underscores the constructive nature of the inquiry we held. It was not an easy inquiry. In fact, it was very difficult. People who are used to situations that they have lived with for a long time find it hard to cope with the deregulated environment, with the new world.
The Senate needs reminding—as I have done in a number of meetings that I have addressed in a number of states since the inquiry—that it was the Kerin plan and then the Crean plan which inevitably led to this 
 particular day with the huge emphasis on the development of our export market. The reality is that export market production has now overtaken domestic market production and commercial pressures have brought this day upon us when the dairy industry will be deregulated, regardless of what individual states do. I do not criticise that. I think that is something that we must accept. There was a certain amount of political driving from within the industry itself and also from within this parliament to bring about this day. There are going to be some enormous adjustments and the structural adjustment package will be absolutely crucial for some towns—I mention particularly Harvey, a town just north of Bunbury in Western Australia where the committee held hearings. They have other problems with the restructuring of the forest industry in that part of Western Australia. We as a government, along with the states, need to be responsive to what is required to deal with those adjustments.
Having said that, this package of the federal government that is worth some $1.8 billion is still on the table. It is funded through a consumer levy. What happens in terms of the regional projects, the regional submissions and the regional restructuring is something that will have to be determined in a joint operation between the Commonwealth and the states.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-12-07,"—The matter of public importance which the Senate is discussing today states:
The need for the government to implement without delay the recommendations of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References 
 Committee's report into the deregulation of the Australian dairy industry.
As Senator Crane has just pointed out, the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee brought down a unanimous report into the dairy industry and specifically the potential deregulation of that industry. The committee comprised representatives from the government, the opposition and the Democrats. Therefore, it is almost impossible—it is impossible—to do anything today other than to support the sentiments contained in this matter of public importance.
Obviously, we support the recommendations of that report. Senator Crane in particular went into some detail in his remarks regarding each of the recommendations. I point out that, in the process of producing a unanimous report, there was obviously a need for some compromise on the part of the various groups or parties represented on the committee. The overriding consideration of the committee was that we believed it was important to produce a report that was fair and accurate, with an emphasis on endeavouring to promote a resolution to the deregulation issue. We believed that objective would be far better achieved if we were able to reach a consensus rather than just using the issue for partisan political purposes.
As the report notes, the dairying industry is our third most important agricultural industry in terms of export earnings and its importance within the community for consumers, farmers and producers. Obviously, the recommendations of the report are supported by the opposition. It follows that we believe the government should move with the quickest possible haste to implement those recommendations. We also have to take the opportunity today to remind ourselves once again of the reasons why we have got into this situation and why it is that, only six months or so before the domestic market support scheme ceases to operate, we still do not have a national agreement on the future of this industry, in particular, the future regulation of the industry. I believe the reasons for that rest—and the committee's report supports this—with the failures of the previous Victorian government and indeed of the current 
 federal government to do what they should have done to bring about a national strategy, a national plan.
—We didn't criticise the Victorian government, nor did we criticise the federal government; you are doing that.
—Senator Calvert wants to interject. I will come to these issues in more detail, but let us remember the position. The reason why deregulation was put on the agenda was that the previous Victorian Liberal government said that they would deregulate their industry irrespective of the views of the farmers, of the cooperatives, or of the governments in the other states. That is what they said. They said, `We don't care about the views of the industry in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania or Western Australia.' They said they would unilaterally deregulate. Because they are the major milk producing state in this country, it was clear that such a unilateral decision would have vast ramifications for the other states. Further, such a unilateral decision in an industry which has been progressively restructuring over a number of years—going back to the days of the Crean plan and, before that, the Kerin plan when Labor was in government in the 1980s—was bound to upset the orderly progression if all the players did not agree to a totally deregulated industry.
What has happened since is that the Victorian Liberal government have lost office. Labor are in power and they are carrying out their electoral promise to give the dairy farmers in that state an opportunity to vote on whether or not they support deregulation, and particularly whether or not they accept the package that has been negotiated by the industry. Our view is that history would have been different if, first of all, Victoria had not unilaterally made that decision but had been prepared to continue to press their case within the forums of COAG and ARMCANZ—that is, the meeting of all the state and federal ministers for agriculture—to try to reach a national position. That is also the responsibility of the federal government.
Senator Crane says this is a states issue. It is a states issue, we know, because it is the states that regulate the milk industry, particu 
 larly in the market milk sector, through the use of quotas and so on. That has been the history for a long, long time. It is what has in the past guaranteed the security of income and the viability of dairy farmers. But we know we live in a different time now. Through the demands of the World Trade Organisation for increased competition and greater, freer trade, through the need to improve our exports in this industry where there are great opportunities, and also through the principles of national competition policy, this industry has had to face those issues, like many others, and to look at restructuring and deregulation.
As Senator Boswell knows and as we all know, words like competition policy and deregulation are not very popular out in rural and regional Australia—whether we are in office or whether the current government is in office. They are not popular because we know that they have had and will have major impacts on regional communities and on the industry. But it is the responsibility of a federal government to take the lead on these issues. It is no good saying, `These are state issues—you have to solve them'. If this is being driven, as we know, by things like national competition policy, then the emphasis is on this being a national industry. We are looking for a national solution. We are looking for national benefit through greater export income for the national economy, and therefore there has to be leadership from the national government. We have not seen it from this government and, unfortunately, we are still not seeing it.
I have to be critical because the government have said that they have picked up the package that has been developed by the industry—a package which is designed to assist dairy farmers to restructure or to exit the industry if that is their choice—but they have then said, `You can have it if you can get all the states to agree'. Then they have dropped the bundle and done nothing about trying to advance that process. Senator Crane announced today that there will finally be a meeting, on 22 December. We welcome that. But a responsible minister who was doing his job, knowing the deadlines that have to be 
 met—such as the end of June next year—would be in there pushing those states, whether they are Liberal, Labor or National Party states, to reach a consensus. He would not be washing his hands of the issue by saying, `We will put the package on the table, but it won't operate unless all states agree,' and then basically doing nothing. And that has been the situation: a failure of national leadership.
In the remaining couple of minutes, I want to turn to a couple of other issues. One of the key recommendations of the committee is the need to look at the impact upon regional communities. There is nothing in this package about this issue, and we have heard nothing from this government about how they intend to address it. It seems as though they think this can be left to the states as well. That is where this government really needs to act, and act quickly, because I have been advised that there are people already making decisions in parts of Australia—certainly in my state—to get out of this industry because, in their view, deregulation is inevitable and it is coming. I heard what Senator Woodley said. He does not believe it is inevitable.
We do not know what the result of the plebiscite will be in Victoria. We will know in a couple of weeks. That is one issue, but this government has to have a policy position as to how it will react, whichever way that vote goes. If the vote is yes for deregulation then it is inevitable—the other states have said they will follow. We already know that the major food supermarket chains are looking to further deregulation in terms of how they might be able to seize a greater share of the market against their competitors, particularly in the state of New South Wales. But if the vote were to go the other way—
—Which it won't.
—Senator Boswell said that it won't, but the issue here is that this government does not have a fall-back position. It does not have a strategy about how it is going to address the issues that will arise between the result of that ballot and June next year. If the vote were by some chance to reject deregulation, there will still be big problems on the table. That will not solve the issue. We know that in many ways 
 that could well complicate the issue even more.
The Labor Party's concern is that you cannot just treat this issue, one, as a states issue and, two, as one where `We'll just let the chips fall where they may.' You have to address the issue of the impact upon regional communities. You also have to address—as this package does not—the issue of the impact upon share farmers. That issue has been raised a number of times now. We still do not have any indication as to how those people will be treated. Frankly, this government and this minister can do a lot better.
We are keen to see these recommendations implemented. If one thing was clear out of the report, it was that the senators on this committee from the states of New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland and Western Australia were able to get together and bring down a bipartisan, unanimous report. Hopefully, this government can get all those states into the cart and get them to reach an agreement on this most important issue.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Dairy Industry: Deregulation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,13,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1999-12-07,"—I also rise to speak on this matter of public importance. If we read the matter of public importance straight and cold and not try to twist it as the previous speaker did just to gain political advantage, this side of the House can easily answer the matter of public importance and on many points agrees with it.
Senator Forshaw did not address the matter of public importance. He took every possible opportunity to criticise this government's approach to a very complex issue, not at all recognising that the final decision is a state's matter. We have played our part with regard to the compensation package—a very generous compensation package—but Senator Forshaw is worried about what the federal government is going to do if there happens to be a `no' vote in the state of Victoria. The point is that, if there happens to be a `no' vote, the responsibility is with the Premier of Victoria. That is where the responsibility will lie for the ultimate decision as to whether the country deregulates. It is a Victorian decision. It begins there and basically ends there, Senator Forshaw.
As the Senate would be aware, the Victorian dairy farmers are going to make that decision in the coming weeks—they have received their ballot papers. They will be voting for or against the deregulation of their industry. Current trends show that is somewhat of a fifty-fifty position. That is how close it is. Unless there is a very strong `no' vote, on 1 July 2000 the Australian dairy industry will be facing deregulation. It is because the Victorian dairy industry is the largest and most competitive that they will have the final say in this major change. The Victorian dairy industry produces some 63 per cent of Australia's milk. In 1996-97 they recorded 5.622 million litres from 8,203 dairy farmers milking 1,238,000 cows.
It is worthy to note that this will be the largest restructure undertaken in primary industry. The change facing the dairy industry dwarfs all other deregulations and readjustments in the rural sector, such as in the tobacco industry, the citrus industry or the pig industry—which we have all heard of in the last couple of years. It perhaps also dwarfs the abolition of the wool floor price scheme in 1990. It is also worthy to note that the Australian dairy industry is recognised not only as Australia's most efficient rural industry but also as one of the most efficient rural industries internationally. It is in fact the fourth largest agricultural exporter—made up of some $2 billion worth of exports and exporting some 50 per cent of its product. It is made up of 14,000 farms—90 per cent being family farms. The dairy industry has more family farms than any other rural sector. It is the bastion of the family farm.
Like all rural industries over the past 20 years, dairying has undergone great change in order to keep pace with new technology, rising costs and static returns. From this change, the number of dairy farms has declined from over 30,000 in 1974 to 14,000 to this date. Even the herd sizes have increased from, on average, 77 in 1975 to 149 in 1998. Of significance is the improved herd genetics as well as the advances in pastoral management and supplementary feeding regimes, which have seen the average annual yield per cow increase.
That is the very good state our current national industry is in. Now that the industry is moving into a new phase, it is very important to understand the current state of the industry. It is an industry which is very efficient and which is going along very well at present. More particularly, it represents the family farmer. I cannot think of another rural industry that is more the quintessence of the family farmer.
Deregulation brings with it, firstly, the ending of the Commonwealth Domestic Market Support Scheme in July 2000 and, secondly, in my state, the abolition of the Victorian government intervention in the market milk arrangements. When these two support schemes are lifted, Victoria will immediately start trading across the border and most particularly in the lucrative Sydney markets. That is what deregulation is all about: this massive Victorian industry that has become bottled up will be able to start trading across the border where presently it cannot.
But there will be a social cost to this deregulation. The New South Wales Bega Valley, for example, has reported that it will lose some 30 per cent of its dairy farmers. Victoria also will have to bear a cost: it will not be immune to deregulation. It could lose as many as 2,000- to 3,000 of its own farmers. If we are to lose so many farmers in what is already an efficient industry, why are we doing this? Why is it inevitable? Why does the industry itself support deregulation? It must be noted that this decision for the state of Victoria will be made by its farmers in a ballot. It will be their decision. Whatever opinions we in this parliament have for regulation or deregulation, it will now be very much in the hands of the Victorian farmers. The push for deregulation, it is believed, will ultimately open up the competition between the states and bring down the price of milk for consumers.
Given that time is against me, I would like to respond quickly to the Senate committee's recommendations. The government is responding, in full, to that Senate committee. There will be a meeting after the ballot. There is no point having a meeting before the ballot, Senator Forshaw. On 22 December there will 
 be a meeting of all state agricultural ministers and our federal minister. That is when the action will start happening. We have in place a package. We know how we are distributing that package. We will have a meeting with the state ministers on 22 December. All other recommendations in that report have been met. I should add that most of them are state issues.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-12-07,"—I am pleased to say that the opposition has no problems with the proposition advanced by the Australian Democrats because the findings that the Democrats want the government to implement arise from an inquiry of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee. It was the Labor Party that initiated that inquiry. The Labor Party proposed to this chamber that the committee be authorised to undertake such an inquiry. Going back in history, it was the Labor Party that pursued the issue of the future of the dairy industry. It tried to look at how we could have a viable, productive, sustainable dairy industry for the future.
Senator Crane and Senator Forshaw have referred in their contributions to the Kerin plan and the Crean plan. You would have to be extremely short-sighted, as a government taking office in 1996, as the coalition government did, not to notice the history of the dairy industry, not to notice the steps that were being taken towards deregulation, not to notice that legislation was in place which would have had the effect of sunsetting the Domestic Market Support Scheme for the dairy industry on 1 July 2000. In March 1996 when this government took office it knew that the underpinnings of the regulated industry would disappear on 1 July 2000. No crystal ball was needed to know that that would occur. Of course, the DMSS is a scheme which currently sees a transfer of money from what are known as the regulated states, in particular New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, into the states that are predominantly not reliant upon market milk, particularly Victoria where 63 per cent, approximately, of Australia's milk production takes place. My state of Tasmania has a much 
 smaller production but a very efficient dairy industry exists.
What was happening under the DMSS was a transfer of money which was, in effect, a payment from the regulation states to Victoria and Tasmania to say, `Look, don't challenge our regulation under the Constitution. Let's leave things as they are and let us work out our arrangements.' Coexisting with that we had a national competition policy system which required the states to review their arrangements. But nothing happened. Minister Anderson and Minister Vaile did nothing in relation to the dairy industry. As I said at the outset, it was the Labor Party that commenced the Senate's inquiry into this matter, which I think has drawn to the attention of the Australian parliament the potential plight of the dairy industry come 1 July 2000 when the Domestic Market Support Scheme will end. I have not heard one member from the government in this chamber or in the House of Representatives say that they propose to extend the scheme. I am not saying that we are advocating that, but there is no such proposition. It is a given. The DMSS will end on 1 July 2000.
Frankly, with the transfer of money ceasing and pressures coming from the large cooperatives in Victoria to end the DMS scheme, there really is no alternative for the state of Victoria, whatever happens in the ballot. They will lose millions of dollars in income. The net benefit to the industry is $93 million. The overwhelming benefit flows into Victoria. That will disappear. Victorian dairy farmers will find themselves in an inferior situation if circumstances continue as they are now.
But of course they will not. An article in the Australian Financial Review of 16 November postdates the Senate committee's decision. I will read into the Hansard a couple of passages from it. It is headed `Milk deregulation—it's already here'. The article says, for example:
The regulated price paid to Tasmanian farmers for milk used in flavoured milk drinks was cut by a third earlier this year, from 100 per cent to 67 per cent of the farm-gate return for plain fresh milk.
The move was forced on the Tasmanian Dairy Industry Authority by milk processors, who argued that if the price wasn't reduced, they would bring 
 the product in from South Australia, where the cost of milk used in flavoured drinks was much lower.
The article further states:
In the lead-up to deregulation of all post-farm-gate controls on pricing and supply, on 1 July last year, Woolworths had put out a tender to supply milk to all its NSW stores which had been won by National Foods.
Similarly, Coles linked up with the Dairy Farmers group. Then Franklins put out a tender and Victorian manufacturing co-op Murray Goulburn chipped in with an offer neither of the other two could match because of their higher sourcing costs in NSW. The price cut followed.
That is exactly the reason why the committee said that it does not matter what is decided in Victoria. It does not matter whether Victorian dairy farmers actually vote against their own self-interest and say that they want to keep deregulation. In the end, the commercial pressures on the industry, which will be driven by the supermarket chains and the processors, who can do better by trading across state boundaries in some cases, will break down regulation. They will ensure that there is deregulation in the industry. If that happens, and it happens without a package, the overwhelming evidence that the Senate committee received is that there will be a much harsher effect on dairy farmers right around the country. That is on average, of course; some will do well and some will do a lot worse.
What the Dairy Industry Council have been saying for years is that there has to be a restructure and deregulation but only with a restructure package. What did they do? They worked on a package alone. They did not have the assistance of Minister Anderson or Minister Vaile. They presented a package to the minister in April this year and they got a response in September. It was a variation on their original proposal. I am advised by people in the Dairy Industry Council that the government's position was, `We've done our job. You go and sell it to the states.'
It is that understanding the committee had when it said that it was now a matter for the federal government to drive this issue. It was not good enough for the federal government to leave the matter in the hands of the industry. This is, after all, as Senator McGauran 
 said, one of the most important rural industries in Australia. It is a huge export industry. We produce so much milk that we have to export 50 per cent of it. We cannot possibly consume what we produce here.
The alternative to not having an export driven industry is to basically cut the industry in half. If we cannot sell the nearly 50 per cent of our production that we now export—and production is growing like topsy, quite frankly—prices will continue to fall. I put on the record that the evidence before the committee is that production in the industry, given that at the same time there was a move towards deregulation, has gone from about 6½ billion litres of milk in 1991 to a projected 11½ billion litres next year. This is in an environment where the industry and governments have recognised that we are all driving towards deregulation yet people are increasing their production. I do not know where the signals are coming from. Some of the evidence was that they were coming from cooperatives, who thought they would be well placed, with high production in their area, to drive down costs.
At the end of the day, there will be dairy farmers who pay a price because of deregulation. That is why we have to try to smooth the bumps a bit. That is why the committee came up with these recommendations, including that there is a need for a package. It has to be worked out with all the states. If all the states do not agree, there will not be a package. There will, however, be deregulation and it will be a very bumpy ride for some areas. That is also why the committee said that there should be regional adjustment packages, because some regions of this country will be worse affected than others. That is why I say that this government should have been driving this process for this important national industry well before September this year, when it came out and said that it would support the dairy industry package. I could say many things about this issue. I am pleased that the Labor Party initiated this inquiry. I am pleased that there is bipartisan support for this proposition.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-12-07,"—This is an interesting debate today. I 
 am quite surprised that it has come on, because all the parties that were members of the committee, including the government, agreed with the recommendations. I have listened to the opposition try to make politics out of this. I must admit that I have heard what Senator O'Brien said at the conclusion of his speech. This is an export driven industry. It is a great industry. One of the great industries of this nation has always been the dairy industry. The men and women of Australia who are involved in it work seven days a week.
I wonder how many people debating this issue here today have milked a cow. I have. I started milking cows when I was 15 and had left school. I hand-milked them. I am proud to say that at the age of 16 I was a steward at the Royal Hobart Show in the dairy section. I went on to become chief dairy steward there. I held that position for many years. I got to know the great dairying families in Tasmania, including the Bennetts, the Geards, the Joneses, and the Millhouses. Through my connection as a show councillor, I knew some great dairy industry people whom Senator McGauran would know in Victoria. They include the Vallances in Bacchus Marsh and Jack Ray, a former ringmaster at the Royal Melbourne Show. So I do know a little about the dairy industry. I know that back in 1956 the late Neville Lucas showed a Tasmanian cow that won the champion cow at the Royal Melbourne Show. It was a very fine effort.
We are talking about an industry that has always had the same problem. In the springtime, you get a lot of grass. You get a lot of milk, and what do you do with it? The industry has restructured into an export industry. As Senator O'Brien said a little while ago, it is an export industry and it is an export driven industry. Being such, we have to be able to compete on the world market, like other industries that have had to restructure—like the wool industry, the fruit industry and every other rural industry that you can think of. I am pleased Senator Boswell is here because I know he is a great advocate for the rural people of Australia. He has seen all these things happen with the sugar industry.
When this happens, you can always guarantee that whoever is in government is going to 
 be criticised by the opposition. We have heard the opposition here today sticking their boots into the government because they reckon the government should be driving the situation. Well, that is not the way it should be. In this particular case, it is being driven by the industry because they are the people who know what it is all about. They know what they want. They know how the industry operates. They are the ones who are pushing for deregulation. There is no doubt that there are people who are going to lose out. Senator O'Brien will remember we had evidence in Deniliquin. Producers on one side of the river are producing market milk and producers on the other side of the river are producing town milk, and one group were getting twice the amount of money of the others. At the end of the day, we had evidence that people who were into export were quite happy with the price the way it is and with the projection of price levels becoming lower.
For those people who have quotas and who have bought quotas, it is going to be quite a big drop in income. I agree wholeheartedly with the matter of quota entitlement. I think Senator Forshaw touched on this one. If those people who sacrificed and worked hard to buy quotas for milk do not get compensation for those quotas, I think they will have been hard done by. They are people, like anybody buying shares or similar things, who wanted to build up their family business and spent money to buy quotas. Unless they are compensated, I think it most unfair. The proposals put forward by the committee, after a lot of inquiry, are matters that this government should be supporting. There is no doubt the government welcomed the approach by the dairy farmers.
As I said earlier, it is an industry driven proposal, and the government has not sought to interfere as it has in other areas. I think it would be fair to say that interference in the wool industry by past governments has not served the interests of the wool growers over time. In hindsight, it has not been the best thing for the industry. I think the industry know better. They are the ones who know how things work and they are the ones we should be taking notice of. Nevertheless, the government has committed itself to being 
 ready to implement the structural adjustment package. It is worth $1.7 billion. It is now up to the states to decide what they wish to do. As we found during the inquiry, there is no doubt that there are some areas of Australia where it is easier to produce milk than others. It is fair to say that Victoria and Tasmania are two of those areas.
We were privileged to see some of the highlights of the modernisation of the industry. The manufacturing plant we visited south of Melbourne, where we saw probably the most environmentally friendly milk processing plant in the world, was certainly an eye-opener to me. As we know, a fair percentage of milk is water. The water is extracted from the milk to allow the milk to be exported overseas as powder. The powder is stored so that it can be released to the market whenever it is needed, so it smooths out the bumps and the hollows of the industry. All that water was used in places around the property.

I will read the report for the record, because this is a very important matter, as you would know, Mr Deputy President Sherry, being a Tasmanian yourself.
The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee is undertaking an inquiry into the effectiveness of the legal and regulatory regimes governing the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and the need to ensure transparency, consistency, scientific rigour and the highest standards of protection of the environment, the local fish population and the fishing and recreational fishing industries of Australia.
The reference specifically requires the committee, in the course of its inquiry, to have particular regard to the administrative procedures and decision making processes involved in the July 1999 AQIS import risk analysis to allow the importation of salmon products into Australia and the potential consequences of that decision for those involved in the salmon farming industry and other stakeholder industries.
The committee considers that the reference, while requiring particular assessment of the decision on salmon imports, is of significantly wider impact. The issues include:
.	 the WTO process and the respective roles played by AQIS and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in that process;
.	 whether sufficient consideration was taken of developments in the science since the 1996 IRA and the most recent assessment;
.	 how AQIS undertakes its import risk analysis process, including the methodology used by AQIS in the development of the IRA, 
 and any impact that the shortened time frame had on that process; and
.	 the development of the appropriate level of protection and the roles of the respective agencies in the determination of the ALOP. These issues are complex and require detailed consideration.
The committee also understands that the OIE, the international animal health organisation, is holding an international conference in February 2000 on risk analysis in aquatic animal health. The committee considers that the findings of this conference may be of assistance in its consideration of the risk analysis issues.
For these reasons, the committee has made this report an interim report and seeks to present a more considered report next year.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-12-07,"—When the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1999 [No. 2] was debated in the House, one of my colleagues described it as a waste of a chance to do something better, with some downright bad ideas thrown in too. That is not a bad summation of what is a fairly mediocre bill that we believe is in some senses premature. However, as a result of amendments moved by the Labor Party in the House and accepted by the government, we are now in a position where we can support the bill in its current form.
I note for the information of senators that this bill is identical to the ANZFA Amendment Bill No. 1 introduced by the government into the Senate in March 1999. Labor had reservations about that bill when it was first presented. We referred the bill to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, of which I was a member, and the report was tabled in August of this year. For the government's own reasons, they have chosen to reintroduce the bill into the House. After the initial debate in the House, we are pleased that the government have accepted a number of Labor's amendments and suggested improvements to the original bill, bringing it to a form that we can now support.
The bill proposes a range of changes to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1981. Firstly, it implements some recommendations from the national competition policy review of the ANZFA Act in 1998. Secondly, it is a partial response to some of the recommendations of the Blair review handed to the government over a year ago, in October 1998. Broadly, that review recommended a move toward greater self-regulation in the food 
 industry. Although the Blair review made 27 recommendations, this bill contains a full or partial response to only about six of those. The general debate about the regulatory framework should have occurred, we believe, before this bill was brought on. It does appear that aspects of the bill are therefore slightly premature. We continue to look forward to a more comprehensive review of our food regulatory structure in light of the Blair report. However, we have this bill before us and it is that with which we must deal.
There were a range of comments and approaches taken during the Senate inquiry into the original bill, and I think that was a most useful process. The Australian Consumers Association provided criticisms of proposals to downgrade requirements for informative food labelling and for the objectives to which the authority must have regard in developing food regulatory measures. The ACTU called for ANZFA to be scrapped and replaced by an entirely new regulatory authority with a genuine consumer focus. There were criticisms of the broad cost recovery proposals and the implications of fee for service approaches to the priorities of ANZFA, and there were some fears expressed that the bill's call for equivalent standards was code for continuing the trend for Australia to adopt the lowest common denominator around, whether for pesticide residues, herbicides or meat content. So there was a range of views put, but I think it was a useful process.
Labor's amendments to the bill which were accepted by the government cover a range of the concerns raised in the Senate inquiry process. Currently the ANZFA Act provides only for the development of food standards which are enforceable in state jurisdictions by reference to the Food Standards Code. I wish to make a couple of comments about codes of practice and standards, but I suggest that any senator who wants more information about this change should look at the research note published by the Parliamentary Library last week, which gives a good summary of the issue. The bill establishes a mechanism for the development of non-binding codes of practice as a supplementary form of food 
 regulation. Current references in the act to standards are replaced by the words `food regulatory measure', covering both standards and codes.
The major concern about the use of codes of practice is that matters which are currently subject to binding food standards could and would be transferred to the less enforceable codes of practice. This would greatly reduce or remove the requirements on industry to abide by the regulations. It was observed that such codes appear to have no legally binding effect on industry and no enforceable jurisdiction. It remains Labor's firm view that a code of practice in the area of food regulation must not be permitted to substitute for a standard containing measures that protect public health or consumer safety. It should be used to articulate industry best practice in processing.
After giving careful thought to this proposal, Labor will cautiously give it support, recognising that codes of practice are already developed to help with the administration of the act. By bringing them into a statutory framework, statutory consultation requirements are introduced which are not currently required. Labor, though, places the government and ANZFA on notice that we will be closely monitoring the use of that procedure.
Given the large amount of work that Labor members and senators have put into improving this bill over a number of months, from the Senate inquiry process onwards, I want to spend a couple of moments recounting in a little more detail the other improvements that Labor have made to the bill. I also wish to place on record Labor's thanks to all those involved in the protracted discussions around the improvements, including the government, but in particular ANZFA officials for their assistance. Labor's amendments to the proposed new objectives have greatly improved the bill. We could not have supported the bill had those objectives remained in the government's preferred form.
The government has now accepted Labor's suggestion that public health and safety and consumer interests must be clearly paramount in the objectives. I note that the government did not agree with that approach originally and opposed it in the majority report of the 
 Senate inquiry. The government wanted people to enjoy `equivalent public health protection in relation to food throughout Australia and New Zealand'. It is Labor's view and that of witnesses to the Senate inquiry that this language of equivalence is less than ideal, and we welcome the government's support for those consequent amendments. The WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures does not require a lowest common denominator approach to harmonisation. It merely encourages harmonisation and requires standards that exceed the international benchmarks to be based on a scientific justification or an appropriate risk assessment. Other improvements to the objectives include changes to ensure that public health and safety and consumer confidence remain a priority and that consistency can be an objective but only where it is clear that the price for the harmonisation will not be a lowering of our standards. Consumer information—primarily through labelling—will be a key objective for ANZFA in setting standards.
Another Labor amendment will create a three-year rolling work program to give more certainty to stakeholders and to ANZFA and to facilitate government funding arrangements. Labor listened to organisations such as the Australian Food and Grocery Council, who argued that this ought to provide better capacity for the authority to manage its resources. Labor's amendments will also ensure that ANZFA is required to give public notices in a range of situations. The authority will be required to give notice by way of public announcement when holding an inquiry to consider a draft standard or a draft variation of a standard.
Through these amendments we hope to ensure that ANZFA is accountable and open to public scrutiny. It is important that the wider community—outside of those very few people who, for reasons best known to themselves, are regular readers of the Commonwealth Government Gazette—is able to have input into inquiries and proposals. The government has maintained that there is a need for a fast-tracking proposal to allow minor variations to standards to be effected by the ANZFA board without requiring a vote by 
 the full ministerial council. I very closely questioned officials regarding this proposal at the Senate inquiry and I was not satisfied with the assurances provided. Labor's amendments aim to ensure that such variations or approvals are limited to non-contentious matters that are not objected to by consumer or public health bodies.
Of course, there is only so much the parliament can do to ensure the spirit of this power is not breached, and I hope the government will approach the issue honestly. By that I mean that, if concerns are raised about a proposal by consumer or health groups, the matter will still be referred to the ministerial council for decision, even if the Commonwealth government itself rejects those concerns.
In relation to a range of amendments deleting or modifying requirements for the costs of a regulatory measure to be weighed against the potential benefits in terms of public health, I state clearly that Labor does not support any unnecessary regulation. However, we have moved these amendments to make it unequivocally clear in the act that public health is priority No. 1.
If some of the amendments sound technical or complex, I can assure senators that the issues surrounding cost recovery were by far the most complex to negotiate to a point of broad acceptance by Labor, the government, industry and a range of consumer and public health stakeholders. After these discussions, the government has accepted Labor's amendments to the government's original proposals for cost recovery. Cost recovery will be limited to applications with an `exclusive commercially capturable benefit', or to progress things through the three-year work program faster. Any refund of application fees has been limited to `the sum not expended from the charge as is calculated in accordance with the regulations' by ANZFA for processing the work. Labor has also made provision for a non-refundable application fee.
I understand the government agreed in the negotiations over this bill that there would be further consultation on the regulations that relate to this particular section of the act. We look forward to participating positively in that 
 process and ensuring that fees and any refunds issued are absolutely transparent. The independence of this particular public regulator, affecting the food supply on which the entire population depends, can never be compromised.
Cost recovery in food regulation that is too broad undermines the importance of a public regulator prioritising public health and safety and consumer information. The government cannot shirk its responsibilities to properly fund ANZFA by getting the industry to foot the entire bill.
On the issue of resources, I note in passing the confused state that the authority and the government seem to be in regarding ANZFA's funding needs. In the Senate estimates last week, Mr Lindenmayer, ANZFA's Managing Director, admitted that the workload would not taper off in 2000-01 as the government had claimed in the May budget estimates. In fact, it was admitted that the authority was going to ask for an extra $3 million this year from the health budget. That is a pretty big underestimation of the workload and related costs. It is not only Labor, though, that has noticed the lack of resources at ANZFA. The Australian Food and Grocery Council said in their submission to the Senate inquiry on this bill that they continue:
. . . to have grave concerns with a food regulatory system which is inadequately funded to meet its public good function . . .
In summary, the government's approach contained in this bill is disappointing. For population health and safety reasons, and to ensure consumer and market confidence in Australia's food supply, food regulation must be underpinned by a wider vision than just the accepted need for a uniform national regulatory framework to support industry efficiency. No-one can fully understand the government's real agenda for food regulation until they give a comprehensive response to the Blair review. Deregulation of food regulations must proceed with great caution at any time, and even greater caution is required when one is unsure about the government's real agenda and direction.
We keep getting different information about when the policy response will occur. The 
 government has had the Blair report for over a year now with no comprehensive response forthcoming. Of course, we accept that, given our constitutional situation, it is a matter that has to be discussed and negotiated with state governments. Surely, though, the public are entitled to be involved in that process. Why not put out some options or an issues paper now to generate a broader public discussion? Still, Labor will be happy to participate in the debate when it is eventually brought on and we will do what we can to encourage broad community involvement in that discussion.
Labor supports an accountable regulator that puts consumer and public health interests first at all times. We have improved this bill so it does not detract from the status quo, and it certainly improves other aspects of the current act. Currently ANZFA is charged with public health, consumer and industry, trade and commerce functions. Elsewhere in the world these functions are often split to avoid the problems that can arise—particularly with conflicts of interest—when simultaneously addressing consumer health and industry issues.
We have decided at this time not to pursue proposals which have been made in some quarters to remove all trade and commerce functions from the authority. The case for bigger changes and an alternative model were not, in our view, made out at this time, and in any event it is beyond the scope of the bill.
Labor's amendments have improved the bill to the point where we can now support its passage. I congratulate all those involved in negotiating the bill to this more acceptable form. We look forward to a more comprehensive response to the Blair report and a sensible, widely based discussion and debate about the food regulatory model that would best serve Australia in the future.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-12-07,"—The Australian Democrats have concerns with the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1999 (No. 2). The bill contains some identical terms to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1999, the first one, which was referred to the Senate Community 
 Affairs References Committee, to which Senator Evans referred. That was referred for quite comprehensive consideration. The committee handed down its report on 12 March this year, and the Australian Democrats did submit a dissenting report. Senator Bartlett and I outlined in that report some of our concerns—some of which are outstanding, even given this bill in its new state.
At the turn of the century and the millennium, people are considering an ever increasing number of issues and potential risks when buying their foods. These concerns can range from medical health risks to environmental, social, political and economic issues. This development means that new challenges and expectations have arisen for our food regulatory system. Food, of course, is an integral part of the social and cultural make-up of any society. As we embrace technological innovations and face the new millennium, our community requires greater autonomy in selecting foods and greater levels of testing. Our community requires greater information than ever before to determine which methods of food production they wish to embrace or encourage, which companies they wish to support and what additives they wish to ingest. The community needs to be able to avoid known allergens and, in the case of genetically modified foods, potentially unknown ones.
The bill in its current form does not go far enough to protect the wider interests of consumers and industry. The Democrats maintain that generally consumer and industry interests cannot be adequately represented together under the one food regulator. In many cases consumer and industry interests are conflicting and the ANZFA is put in a difficult position between a rock and a hard place somehow trying to reconcile the two. Unfortunately, underfunded and underresourced consumer groups are usually the parties whose concerns are less represented by the ANZFA at the end of the day.
However, there is one aspect in which consumer and industry interests are synonymous: consumer confidence. If consumers do not have confidence in their food regulatory system, they will not buy the product, in par 
 ticular novel food products such as GM foods and nutriceuticals. The comprehensive community attitudinal survey published only yesterday, commissioned by Biotechnology Australia, concluded that Australian consumers had a general appreciation and knowledge of the potential benefits of biotechnology for the production, say, of medicinal components, clothing fibres and the like. However, the overwhelming majority of the Australian public did not support genetically modified foods and required equal information about the possible risks of biotechnology as well as information about the benefits of its application.
That is not to say that genetically modified foods are necessarily or intrinsically bad or that biotechnology can be put in the evil or saintly basket, if you like; it is just to say that consumers have these fears and we must address them. People have concerns about this burgeoning industry and they must be given information and thus consumer choice. As the incredibly complex relationship between food, health and medicine continues to intensify, consumers are requiring greater testing and information about their foods. We as legislators, in addition to industry and of course the ANZFA, must recognise and provide this for the Australian community.
The new objectives for the authority make inroads into addressing such concerns. I acknowledge that the objectives as amended specifically include the goal of a high degree of consumer confidence in the quality and safety of food produced. I maintain that this must be achieved by the ANZFA's first and foremost objective in relation to public health and safety. I acknowledge that proposed section 2A calls for `a high standard of public health protection throughout Australia and New Zealand' and that proposed section 10.1 states that `the protection of public health and safety' is the highest priority objective in developing food regulatory measures. Of course the Australian Democrats support these objectives although we maintain that the interpretation of these objectives must recognise the intersectoral and multidimensional nature of public health and safety.
Public health and safety has been defined as an improvement in physical disease preven 
 tion at both a community and individual level. It is a set of comprehensive long-term community considerations in addition to short-term individualistic concerns and measures which are sustainable, social, ecological, educative and economic in focus and practice. The bill works in part towards such an understanding of public health. However, we believe that further improvements are required to strengthen the authority's educative and consultative operations.
The Biotechnology Australia community attitude report, which I mentioned previously, found that the public relies on the mainstream media, largely television and newspapers, for its information about biotechnology. This is clearly an inadequate situation. I believe that the Australian community is a bit more sophisticated than suggested by a debate at a level, say, that labels GM foods as Frankenstein-like. The government must set the standard and provide balanced, equal information to which industry and consumer groups can contribute in the public domain. When it comes to GM foods, the ANZFA has a responsibility to provide equal, balanced information on the technology itself and the food products that are produced by biotechnology.
Another concern that the Democrats stated as problematic in respect of the objectives of the bill was the unqualified promotion of consistency between domestic and international food regulatory measures. We were concerned that they would, or would have the potential to, lead to the lowest common denominator for food standards. Debate about international standards and international consistency has come at an opportune time, with the demonstrations and debate in Seattle for the third biennial meeting of the ministerial conference of the WTO pretty much fresh in all our minds. Australia is obliged under the WTO to be consistent with international standards wherever a standard is developed.
An exception is made when it can be demonstrated on good scientific principle that a change would undermine the protection of public health and safety in Australia. This, with the qualification of the bill's objective for consistency between international and 
 domestic food standards without reducing the safeguards applying to public health and consumer protection, assists in overcoming many of the concerns that international consistency objectives would lead to standards of the lowest common denominator.
Another area of regulatory concern which the Democrats outlined in our dissenting report to the Senate committee was the regulation of nutriceuticals, particularly for the future. We are looking at a not-too-distant future when nutriceuticals are anticipated to hold an unprecedented area of supermarket shelf space. These functional food products with health and safety and preventative medicinal claims will be a means by which to achieve product recognition in a market that is vying for product differentiation. The Democrats maintain that such products, due to their human health claims and potential health benefits, should be under the jurisdiction of the Therapeutic Goods Administration. We must, as responsible legislators, be forward thinking and proactive in providing measures now to effectively set standards for the biotechnology and the food science advances of the future. We cannot afford to have a repeat of the lack of recognition that surrounded genetically modified foods when they first hit our shores in 1996.
The bill provides a new definition of food, delineating between the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the ANZFA. As my colleague Senator Bartlett and I stated in the dissenting report to the committee, all foodstuffs which claim health benefits due to the inclusion of one or more nutritional components and are demarcated from other products on the supermarket shelves should undergo independent scientific testing to back up those health claims. I am aware that the ANZFA and the TGA do consult over the definition of foods and drugs. We need a clear demarcation determined outside the reach of the industry interests and government.
The other proactive undertaking which we feel is required for the responsible use of nutriceuticals is linked to the public educative activities of the ANZFA. The Australian public should be made aware that isolating one or two substances from a food or a group 
 of foods and adding it to a breakfast cereal and the like is not likely to mimic the effect of eating the whole food with its full complement of phtyochemicals intact. Unfortunately, the Democrats are not in a position to transfer responsibility for nutriceuticals to the TGA under this bill. We do support through the objective under section 10 of the bill to provide adequate information relating to food to enable consumers to make informed choices. That is something we have talked about for a long time. This should include balanced information about the possible health benefits of nutriceuticals. Consumer groups and health professionals have also registered concerns regarding the ability of consumers to extract information from food labels and nutritional panels that are on food products. There is a need in the community for a new education regime specifically targeted towards understanding Australian food standards and extracting information from the food labels.
Another common criticism of current regulation of foods is the lack of scientific testing and activity under Australia's food regulator. I believe that to be an effective food regulatory body the ANZFA must broaden its scientific base. It must be able to independently assess food applications and their safety to become a body which supports and facilitates innovation in food science and nutrition. I believe there is a great opportunity for Australia in the area of scientific research and development. Collaboration between the CSIRO, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the like should be encouraged. We certainly do not suggest otherwise.
The United States Food and Drug Administration provides a good example of facilitating development in this area. The FDA, through the Centre for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, undertakes similar premarket approval of food to that of the ANZFA. It regulates genetically modified foods and has also recently revamped food labels to make it easier for consumers to get nutritional information about the foods that they are eating. In addition to these roles, it has a special office that is dedicated to special research skills and support and also facilitates the 
 administration of the Joint Centre for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition with the University of Maryland. The link with the university is designed to ensure the critical science based foundation which independent research institutions provide to establish sound food safety policy—in addition, of course, to facilitating the innovation, research and development of food science.
I am not suggesting that Australia should mimic the food regulatory regime of the United States. However, considering the upcoming debate regarding the Interim Office of Gene Technology and the assessment and interaction of differing government agencies and departments under the office—and, additionally, the Innovation Summit that we have heard quite a bit about, which is coming up in February next year—I suggest that further consideration of interaction between research and regulatory endeavours should be undertaken. There is much to be gained in the areas of consumer health, food science and nutrition education by their simultaneous pursuit.
At present, self-regulation is used in part to address nutrient claims on food labels and in advertisements. Currently codes of practice have been developed under the ANZFA with industry bodies. In Australia to date, relevant industry bodies have developed most codes of practice, despite persuasion by industry bodies. This is a concern for two reasons: firstly, the close liaison between the ANZFA and industry in developing such codes puts into question the extent to which such regulatory measures represent consumer concerns; and, secondly, the lack of regulatory clout that voluntary codes of practice have. The Parliamentary Library Research Note No. 17 addresses the differences between codes of practice and standards. The paper notes conflict between the 1995 code of practice on nutrient claims in food labels and advertisements, which was intended `to provide a basis for voluntary self-regulation of nutrient claims by industry'.
On the other hand, the ANZFA nutrition labelling and standard proposal—proposal 167, `Nutrition Labelling'—states that it cannot be established if the standard proposal 
 was developed, in part because the code of practice did not achieve the required outcome. Self-regulation is not appropriate for Australia's food regulatory system. It asks:
How can a consumer know whether the codes of practice are achieving desired outcomes or indeed whether or not they are in place in all situations that suggest them?
It concludes:
Increased use of codes of practice could generate more questions than answers.
The Democrats maintain that self-regulation and voluntary codes cannot stand alone to ensure public health and safety when it comes to food production and consumption. Codes of practice are not a substitute for food standards. The Biotechnology Australia community survey additionally found:
The public regard regulation and provision of information on biotechnology by the government as preferable to self-regulation by industry, particularly in relation to GM foods.
I think that similar conclusions can be drawn for the wider food regulation. When it comes to ensuring pathogen free foods and low levels of pesticides and other pollution contaminants, I believe that industry, like consumers, deserves enforceable food standards to protect the whole industry and consumers alike against the possibility of, say, the one Garibaldi amongst many smallgoods manufacturers. Many South Australians would be aware of that particular crisis.
Although the Democrats have not acted to prevent implementation of the ANZFA's proposed cost recovery provisions, we have several concerns regarding their operations. While the Democrats support charging those who profit from approval of foods—that is, those who have an exclusive, capturable commercial benefit—we hold reserves about its application. Cost recovery was deemed as undesirable by both consumer and industry interests in submissions to the Senate inquiry. I note that Coles supermarket stated that cost recovery may lead to distortions in setting the working programs. Such concerns are legitimate and must be kept in mind when the newly proposed three-year forward plan schedule for the assessment of food products is operating.
The Democrats consider the general shift of food regulation to voluntary codes with concern. Industry managed codes of practice should not be considered as a general alternative to standards. When it comes to consumer health and safety, the Australian community deserves statutory measures—nothing weaker. As we stated in our dissenting report, the South Australian Garibaldi smallgoods food poisoning and the estimated $2.5 billion cost per annum to the community for food poisoning should be ample impetus to establish codes of practice as an extra precaution and not as a substitute for food standards.
The use of voluntary codes of conduct are of more concern when considered in conjunction with the decrease in regulatory powers of the ANZFA. The Democrats regard the general substitution in the bill for food standards to food regulatory measures with concern. Industry managed codes of practice should not be considered as a general alternative to standards. When it comes to consumer health and safety, the Australian community deserves statutory measures.
Presently the ANZFA does not have the ability to implement or enforce food standards. Each food standard is referred with the ANZFA's recommendation to the Australia New Zealand Food Council, which approves, amends or rejects recommendations completely or in part. The Food Council is a vital review mechanism which assists in maintaining the ANZFA's accountability. The use of the ANZFA for food regulatory issues of minor significance, rather than the Australia New Zealand Food Council, undermines public input into the regulatory process, and I will be moving amendments that we believe satisfy some of these concerns.
The integral role that the Australian and New Zealand health ministers played in the labelling of genetically modified foods is a very important example of the role that the council plays. It may be argued that the issue of labelling of genetically modified food would not have been considered by the ANZFA as an issue of significance to the public and therefore more so to the health ministers. However, was it suitably significant when the words `substantial equivalence 
 yardstick' were first bandied about by the ANZFA several years ago? I would argue that public awareness of this issue has grown, particularly in recent times, and may have been deemed less significant when food regulators were first considering its regulation.
Public debate is a metamorphosing phenomenon. It is undulating, if you like. It is for the ANZFA to determine what is of minor significance, which is undefined in the bill. Is that what is going to happen? Is it up to them? At what stage of public debate will significance be determined? The removal of the Australia New Zealand Food Council in any circumstances undermines the accountability of the ANZFA and therefore public confidence in our regulator, which in turn is detrimental to the food industry.
The bill extends the ANZFA's powers to make food regulations independent of the council in certain circumstances. The bill allows for the ANZFA to implement regulation in situations which are considered to be of less significance, though what is `lesser' is not actually specified. Such decisions by the ANZFA will become regulation within 28 days of the decision if the council, the ANZFC, does not object. As we stated in our report, the ANZFA will be required to undertake public consultation as it deems appropriate. However, that 28-day window leaves little time for the community interests to be able to come together and to effectively lobby before that decision is implemented.
That being said, I also recognise that the current system is inappropriate as decisions can be postponed by the council, as was the case with the decision in relation to genetically modified foods. Such postponement, which allows the health ministers to pursue a non-labelling position without appropriate approval for an extended period of time, is not acceptable.
The Democrats stand by our commitment stated in the report that we cannot support the increased regulatory powers of the ANZFA as it restricts another avenue for public input into the decisions about the food regulation process. We believe in accountability, and we believe in transparency. I will be moving amendments shortly that will reflect our 
 views. I anticipate that we will see more legislation dealing with food regulatory issues. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-07,"—Firstly, I want to commend Senator Stott Despoja and the amendments being brought forward by the Democrats. The Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1999 No. 2 is very important legislation. One aspect of it allows me to raise in the Senate—and it is raised far too infrequently—the overall economic ramification for Australia of not getting right the regulation of food. Australia has a golden opportunity to become the organic food producing country of at least the Asian region, if not the world. But there is little evidence that this government will take us in that direction.
Compare that with the situation in Denmark, where $500 million of assistance for organic food production, with the objective of the whole country converting to organic food production in 10 to 15 years, has been announced. That is not just because of public pressure from people who are more and more concerned about the additives and contaminants that may be in their tucker but because the market for organic food produce is growing far faster than the rest of the food market.
Right around the world there is an increasing consumer predilection for food known to be free of pesticides, genetic modification and other potential contamination or abnormality. It is something the Howard government must take into account. Across the way in New Zealand—where, I am happy to tell the Senate yet again, on the further counting in the national election vote there today, the Greens have crossed the threshold to take six seats in the national parliament—the Leader of the New Zealand Greens in the last parliament, Jeanette Fitzsimons, who has now won her seat in Coromandel, has been pushing for a long time for a royal commission on genetic engineering. Keep in mind that we are dealing today not just with an Australian matter but with the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill.
Part of the reasons for parliamentarian Jeanette Fitzsimons pushing for a royal commission into genetic engineering, or a 
 summary of it, is that genetic engineering raises ethical issues about combining genes from different life forms which could never combine in nature. It is about putting animal genes into the food of vegetarians, about manipulating human genes in combination with genes of other life forms and about the patenting of life form by business for profit and the ownership of our food crops by multinational corporations.
The same applies in Australia. She also points to the risk and uncertainty of introducing foreign genetic material into our food which is unknown. The ecological effects of cross-fertilisation of other forms of genetic pollution between genetically engineered crops and other crops or weeds or wild native species is at this stage a matter for guessing. On economics, Jeanette Fitzsimons comments:
The fastest growing world food market is the demand for certified organic produce.
I have just mentioned the case of Denmark recognising and acting on that. Ms Fitzsimons further says:
In the long term it will not be possible to market our produce as organic if there is widespread growing of genetically engineered organisms. We must choose between these two paths and there are profound economic implications which have not been evaluated.
And then points out:
None of these issues has been dated in any suitable public forum.
She suggests that there should be a royal commission. That is a path Australia should be taking as well. In the meantime there should be a moratorium on the onrush of genetic engineering as far as foodstuffs in Australia are concerned. Such a moratorium would put further growing of genetically engineered organisms on hold. It would prevent the further importation of GE food until the royal commission had reported its findings and the government had responded with policy decisions. It would buy valuable time to learn from overseas experience before repeating it here.
 Senator Stott Despoja might just look at amendment No. 3, which she has brought before the Senate. That excellent amendment reads, `In developing food regulatory meas 
 ures and variations of food regulatory measures, the Authority may also have regard to the following'. I would suggest that we use the words `Should also have regard to the following,' and then, `(in descending priority order):' I would include the precautionary principle. Senator Stott Despoja has a list of other very important matters, such as the need for standards to be based on risk analysis using the best available scientific evidence and the promotion of fair trading. But I would recommend that the precautionary principle be brought in there.
Why do that? Because we are talking here about food. There are other enormous potential impacts from genetic engineering on nature, but we are talking here about an issue that directly affects all of us every day of our lives, and it will do so into the future. It is affecting what goes into our children's mouths. It is affecting, potentially, the health  of people right round the nation. So, should we be cautious about that at least? Of course we should. Ought it not be that people who want to have genetically engineered food should have to show that is safe before they put those foodstuffs on the supermarket shelves? I think so. Should it be left to the public to discover that it is not safe when years down the line epidemiology discovers there is a new pattern of harm to public health before we hold the inquiry and remove the foods from the supermarket shelves? I do not think so, and I do not think most Australians would think that. So, in the absence of any real thoroughgoing inquiry into genetic engineering, which is so much a matter of contention in the public's mind, we need to build a precautionary principle into the regulations by which people are directed to assess food coming onto the market in Australia.
Let me reiterate the importance of the organic option, which is the option to genetic food, and indeed to the growing of foods with pesticides, herbicides and all other manner of chemical intrusion. Let me quote from Mr Scott Kinnear of the Organic Federation of Australia, from a media release a month ago, when he condemned the intervention by the Prime Minister in the GE labelling debate in this country on the grounds of cost and trade 
 related issues. Mr Kinnear said that those grounds are `sure to anger consumers'. He said:
As a result people will continue to seek organic foods to avoid eating GE foods. We have experienced exponential growth in organics over this last 12 months and with this latest delay, we expect this to continue.
He criticised the KPMG report that the Prime Minister brought out as being `manipulative and unethical'. As Senator Stott Despoja has just said,, there is far too little public access in the arena of decision making here, and there is not much evidence that this legislation is really going to improve that. We all know in this place that the big corporations, with their lobbyists and lawyers, have a huge advantage over the consumer interest. They are paid to be here to tweak the ears of politicians, not least ministerial ears, to have their way. But they have a different motivational priority from consumer groups. The big corporations' bottom line is profit. The consumer groups are looking after the public interest. The best way to get to the best result for the Australian people when you are in that situation is to ensure that you have a thoroughgoing public inquiry that sets the benchmark, that comes up with all the information and then sensibly makes recommendations as to the way forward. It is then up to us as elected representatives to decide in the public interest how we will proceed.
That is why I applaud the position of the New Zealand Greens, who have asked for a royal commission. This is a serious matter. It is fundamental and it affects every one of the 19 million Australians as well as our New Zealand cousins across the way, and I could not let this opportunity on this bill pass without flagging the need for such an inquiry. I have an ulterior motive of an economic variety. We Greens are so often criticised unfairly and wrongly as not wanting to see economic progress, but I believe that Australia's future—and as a Tasmanian I particularly believe this—is with clean, green produce, organic produce.
The organic industry in Australia is very different from the big food producers and from conventional production. It is very much more oriented to family and small businesses, 
 it is very much oriented to job creation, and it keeps its profits here in Australia. I think that advantage should be seen for what it is and built upon. I think it would be a terrific exercise for government and for the Labor opposition to start with the question, `Is the organic alternative a good one for Australia?' and investigate it while we still have the opportunity to take it up.
As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, once genetically engineered crops are grown and the genes move into adjacent natural plants—weed plants, for example—you do not get them out. Decision time is now; it is not later, after some unforeseen trouble or disaster strikes. It is a decision which I think we should be making in the light of good information. Denmark has made its decision. Australia, on the other side of the planet, should follow suit. The big parties should at least be looking into why Denmark is going in the direction of totally organic produce within the next five to 10 years, why that government has decided to put half a billion dollars into promoting that end, and why Australia should not follow suit when organic produce is the fastest-growing area of the food market. It seems like commonsense and it seems like a real opportunity, which should come as a result of a thorough inquiry—a royal commission, no less—and not just to protect the interests of consumers in Australia. If I am correct and if many experts in the field are correct, it is an opportunity which would lead to an enormously important part of Australia's economic prosperity in the next century.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-12-07,"—I had anticipated there were going to be other speakers; however, I thank senators for their contributions. I note that this legislation was returned to this chamber yesterday, 6 December, and a second reading speech, which set out a lot of detail, was incorporated in the Hansard . I also note that this matter has been before the parliament for a considerable time. It was introduced back in March of this year, and it was reviewed very comprehensively by a Senate committee, which reported on 12 
 August. Subsequently, it was given a very comprehensive dealing in the House of Representatives, and the government agreed to a number of important amendments that were put forward by the Australian Labor Party. Therefore, the government anticipates that we will secure the support of the opposition this afternoon because of the arrangements and discussions that took place between the government, the minister, and the Labor Party.
This bill amends the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 in four major ways. It creates objectives for the act and clarifies the role, functions and regulatory objectives of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority; it provides the authority with more flexibility and efficiency in its consultation and decision making processes; it enables the authority to more effectively protect public health and safety and prevent misleading or deceptive behaviour; and it allows the authority to charge for services in certain circumstances.
The bill will also enable the implementation of important reforms to food safety, and it is the first phase in improving the consistency of food related legislation across Australia. I would stress that point to Senator Stott Despoja and to Senator Brown, who said in their contributions today that they look forward to future arrangements that will be made. When I say that this is the first phase in improving legislation, they can be assured that the government is very closely aligned to a number of issues and is looking at the need for close attention in that regard.
The bill has been examined by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, chaired by Senator Susan Knowles, which recommended that the bill proceed. Some community groups have raised concerns about the cost recovery proposal—that this ought to be subject to greater transparency. As Dr Wooldridge indicated in the House of Representatives, it is the government's intention that this be transparent and that ANZFA be fully accountable. A commitment has been given that ANZFA will consult with key stakeholder groups in developing the appropriate regulations.
This bill is the result of careful consideration by ANZFA and of consultation by ANZFA with key stakeholders. The opposition, as I mentioned earlier, proposed amendments in the House of Representatives which were broadly in line with the government's policy intent and, as a result, they were accepted. I am confident that the bill, as amended, will meet the needs of consumers and industry alike. The bill emphasises ANZFA's role in ensuring the protection of public health and safety and in protecting consumers from misleading or deceptive behaviour. The bill will also ensure consumers have enough information about food to enable informed choices to be made.
Finally, the bill will benefit all stakeholders by ensuring that government appropriated money is used for the primary purposes of public health and safety protection and protection of consumers whilst ensuring that applications of direct financial benefit or urgency to industry are assessed in a timely manner. I thank senators for their contributions and for their indications of support, and I thank the Labor Party for its support in the House of Representatives after the amendments were adopted.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-12-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I have moved to take note of the report of the Department of Health and Aged Care on the operation of the Aged Care Act 1997 to enable me to refute today a press release that 
 was put out by Mr John Anderson, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Deputy Prime Minister of this country. Doing this might seem a bit strange, but it is in relation to the Commonwealth regional health services program, and the provision of aged care in rural areas is a very important issue. In this press release, Mr Anderson accuses me of making remarks in the estimates committee on 1 December in relation to this program. While saying that the Labor Party is lost and does not understand the needs of country Australia, he quotes me as saying:
My dealings with rural communities suggest that when you mention the words `health' or `medical' they think hospital, hospital beds, doctor. To try and get them to make the quantum leap beyond that, to think about a range of allied health professionals and ancillary services that can be provided in a centre which do not involve beds, is almost like trying to pick the winner of next year's Melbourne Cup . . . They do not know them. They do not understand them. They do not know what they are. When you talk about occupational therapists, they think you mean a basket weaver.
He accuses me of making a major misjudgment and having a poor opinion of my constituents. Firstly, I would say to Mr Anderson and to anybody who wishes to challenge me on health issues that I am a registered nurse and I am a member of both colleges of nursing in this country. So, if you want to challenge my credentials on health, feel free, but I have professional—
—You should have known better.
—Senator McGauran, I suggest you read the Hansard  because, like Mr Anderson, you are taking things out of context. I will read into this Hansard  the actual quotes because the department agrees with my point. Mr Anderson has had the hide and temerity to take parts of two questions and combine them and not tell the people of Australia what the department's answer is. Along with Senator Crowley, Senator Denman and Mr Blazow from the department, we were discussing this particular program. I asked:
What educative program has been undertaken to ensure the community in Blanchetown—
which was one of the pilot programs—
understands the role of allied health workers and professionals such that they are able to utilise them fully? My dealings with rural communities suggest that when you mention the words `health' or `medical' they think hospital, hospital beds, doctor. To try and get them to make the quantum leap beyond that, to think about a range of allied health professionals and ancillary services that can be provided in a centre which do not involve beds, is almost like trying to pick the winner of next year's Melbourne Cup.
I then went on to say:
Have you undertaken some sort of program to actually educate a community as to what the range of health services can actually mean beyond hospital and doctor?
The reply from the department was:
We do have multipurpose services in the regional health service centres. We do have a consultation process. A lot of the negotiation is actually done by our state office people and state government people. We do have some funding in both this year's initiative and last year's initiative for community planning money which we will be using to help communities employ professionals to provide them with advice of that character.
They then go on:
As part of the negotiations and as part of the agreement with them, we were actually entering into a contract and really working with them over a period of time in terms of looking at expanding the range of services. In a lot of communities—you are right—they think in terms of either the GPs or in terms of hospitals. I am not sure whether they do not think of the others, but it is just that the other two have priority.
Then you can take the remainder of the bit I have been quoted from, to which Mr Blazow then says:
That is true. In Blanchetown I think people are talking about the full range. I think in fact what has been discussed is a physio service.
I then said:
That is a problem that everybody—state and federal health departments—has in getting that information out. They are not doing it.
Mr Blazow said:
Sure. That is specifically why we give additional funding for community planning, to help communities at risk with those sorts of issues.
It is quite obvious that Mr Anderson did not—
—What is your argument? 
—I am speaking to a report, Senator. This is the reason why Mr Anderson is totally out of the ballpark, out of character and out of all reasonable behaviour in selectively misquoting this and then going on to make aspersions about me and my relationship with rural areas. I absolutely condemn the minister for this sort of a practice. This is not the practice of a professional politician, and I am most astounded that Mr Anderson has stooped so low as to behave in such a manner. This is not the manner of behaviour that I expect from the Deputy Prime Minister of this country.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-12-07,"—In speaking to the report of the Department of Health and Aged Care on the operation of the Aged Care Act 1997, the first thing that must be said is that I am glad that the minister finally got around to it. The accountability report demanded of her under the act is 15 months late, but we do congratulate her for finally getting around to it. The report last year was not tabled. There was no excuse and no explanation given. When we raised it in the House of Representatives and questioned her about her failure to table the reports for both last year and this year, she said that it was `on the way'. Finally, a month or so later, we did get it—because we insisted on getting it—but the government had no intention of providing the report on the operation of the Aged Care Act, because it was embarrassed by what it shows. It shows a record of failure. The aged care reforms introduced in 1997 have failed the Australian public. They have failed to meet the financial targets, and they have failed to meet the needs of older Australians. The government has been very hesitant to release the information that makes that very clear.
The opposition took the opportunity last week to table its own report, in the absence of the government meeting its statutory obligations, because we knew that the government was not at all keen on letting the Australian public know what was happening in aged care. The government's report—finally released—attempts to gloss over what is happening in aged care. It is almost as important for what it leaves out as for what it 
 includes. There are some very misleading graphs. There is a glossing over of what is occurring in aged care in Australia.
If you want evidence of that, it was in yesterday's announcement on coalescence when, after 11 months, the government finally responded to the report of the Productivity Commission that it in fact commissioned. In doing so, it responded to one of the 18 recommendations of the Productivity Commission. The government finally got around to issuing a two-page press release, which was supposed to be its formal response to the Productivity Commission, which had so definitely found that the government's plans for coalescence in aged care were inequitable and unjust. The government's two-page press release—with a nice graph at the bottom that had nothing at all to do with the subject—was taken to be its formal response to that Productivity Commission report.
What we have seen yesterday afternoon and today is the sector expressing their dismay at the inadequacy of that report and at the failure of the Minister for Aged Care to properly deal with the issues raised. They have rejected the government's thinking that throwing $150 million at the problem will shut the sector up.
There are real underlying problems in aged care in Australia, brought about by the failure of the aged care reforms introduced in 1997. The government will not silence the sector, and they will not satisfy the needs of older Australians unless they respond to those genuine problems that exist in the sector. Trying to hide the reality by producing this report—eventually—will not help.
Throwing money at the coalescence issue to try to solve the problem will not address the real underlying problems that are at the heart of their propositions for funding of aged care in Australia. There are fundamental issues that the government has not addressed and has not responded to. The sector and older Australians will not accept that sort of response. They want something much more fundamental and comprehensive and something that admits that many of the aged care reforms have failed.
It is interesting that in this report the statistics on waiting times, which show a 30 per 
 cent increase over the last two years, have mysteriously been omitted. You will not find them in the report, but waiting times for an aged care bed in Australia have gone up by 30 per cent. Often that means an extra three or four weeks for people to find a nursing home bed in Australia. That is because the government has not kept up with the supply needed to service the ageing in our population. Those statistics mysteriously are not in the report. I would have thought, given the statutory requirement to report, they would have been included.
There is a range of other interesting statistics that are not included, but senators will find them in the opposition's report. They are not the opposition's statistics but ones we have gleaned from estimates processes and other processes. This report seeks to gloss over the failures of their aged care reforms. It is like so many other things in aged care; they are stuck on the minister's desk for months. We do not get any activity to address the real issues of concern about providing services to the aged in Australia. The aged care reforms are failing. They are not meeting their financial targets. They are not meeting the needs of older Australians, and it is only because the opposition insisted on holding the government accountable that we have at least finally got the report, albeit 15 months late. Inadequate as it is, I welcome it as a start in holding the government accountable for the failure of the 1997 aged care reforms, and we can now hope to start to address the real problems.

Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Aged Care Legislation</title>,Documents,21,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1999-12-07,"—Tonight I would like to talk about a great victory for regional Australia and the cause of regional development. This victory is the decision by the government to end the fringe benefits tax on all employer 
 provided housing in remote areas. In other countries that have a fringe benefits tax, such as Canada, the USA and South Africa, exemptions have been made for remote areas so as not to discourage regional development. However, when Paul Keating introduced the Australian version of the fringe benefits tax in 1986 no exemptions were made for remote areas, and the result has been an unmitigated disaster for regional development. That the ALP has no understanding of the needs of regional Australia could not be more clearly demonstrated than by the refusal of the Hawke-Keating government to agree to any changes in the fringe benefits tax for the remote areas of Australia. This refusal was maintained by the previous government in spite of the devastating impact that the FBT had had in reducing the populations of towns with the closure of small businesses and the loss of jobs, not to mention the introduction of fly-in fly-out work force operations and the well-documented negative impacts this practice has had on regional development.
 Other non-commercial bodies, such as local government, found themselves liable for FBT, which meant that local levels of service suffered and fewer people were able to be employed. It was not as though the Hawke-Keating government was not informed about the adverse impact of the fringe benefits tax on remote areas. Almost from the time of its introduction, the negative impacts were pointed out to the then federal government by chambers of commerce, mining companies, small business proprietors, regional development commissions, local government authorities and bodies such as the North Australia Development Conference on behalf of interested groups in Far North Queensland, the Northern Territory and the north of Western Australia.
 One of the strongest voices of protest about the devastating impact of the fringe benefits tax came from the Liberal Party organisations in the Kalgoorlie electorate. I was closely involved with the Kalgoorlie north division, representing the people in the Kimberley and the Pilbara areas of Western Australia, which very early on called for remote area exemptions from this iniquitous 
 tax and were joined by similar calls from the Kalgoorlie central division in Carnarvon and the Gascoyne and the Kalgoorlie south division, based in Kalgoorlie and the Western Australian Goldfields.
 As I stated in my first speech in September 1996, the impact of the FBT has been felt across the whole of Northern Australia and the pursuit for FBT exemption on all remote area housing has been a major battle for small business. It was also in my first speech that I referred to a significant independent study that was to be carried out by the Pilbara Development Commission and which was finally released in 1999. It confirmed the adverse impacts that the FBT was having on economic development in the Pilbara.
Senator Murphy interjecting—
—Wait and see; you will see that it does. The report was jointly prepared by BSD Consultants, the Centre for Regional Economic Analysis of the University of Tasmania and McKessor Tieleman and Co. The report found:
. . . the present system of FBT in Australia has had a significant negative impact on the development of the Pilbara since the introduction of this tax in 1986.
Economic modelling results indicate that without FBT (and assuming an increase in income tax to compensate for FBT) the gross output of the region would have been 3.4% higher than under the existing system, over 670 additional jobs (supporting 1400 residents) would have been created, and an additional $14.5 million would have been invested and over $413 million in additional consumption expenditure would have been incurred.
This is the equivalent of an additional $50,000 for every retail establishment in the region. It is estimated that FBT cost business enterprises the equivalent of four jobs per establishment.
Well done, Paul Keating! These findings strongly indicate that regional development has suffered substantially through the introduction of the FBT, and it was certainly no overestimation when the current chairman of the PDC, Mr Piercy, recently described the decision by the federal government to exempt all employer provided housing from FBT as a major economic breakthrough for remote Australia. 
 As a result of the FBT, the mining industry introduced fly-in fly-out operations, which have had a quite devastating effect on the development of new towns. It has meant, for example, that no new towns have been built around mining operations that have been established since this tax was introduced. Had the FBT been in place in the 1960s, none of the new towns which were constructed in the Pilbara, such as Newman, Tom Price, Paraburdoo or Pannawonica, would have been built, and no doubt the new port towns of Karratha, Dampier and Wickham would have been much smaller centres than they are today.
The impact of FBT on local government in remote areas was also quite devastating. Because local government has to provide subsidies to attract employees, they found themselves liable for large amounts of FBT. For example, the Port Hedland town council had an FBT bill of around $300,000—money which could have been better spent on community services and the employment of more staff.
It is very clear when you look at these facts that FBT has had a very negative effect on the development of regional areas. Mr Evan Adermann, a coalition MP in 1987, said that the FBT:
. . . takes no account of businesses destroyed, jobs lost and further massive costs to business in paperwork and unproductive time spent in the calculation and remission of this stupid tax.
He further stated:
If the (ALP) Government ceased for a little while from courting big business magnates and had a look at the way small business in Australia has been sold out, it might begin to see the awful cost of its actions.
Unlike the ALP, the Howard government has listened to the voice of regional Australia with respect to the adverse impact of the FBT on regional development, and it has taken steps to relieve the situation.
In 1997 the Howard government exempted the pastoral industry from FBT on housing. In 1998 remote area housing for the mining industry was also exempted from FBT, and now this exemption has been extended to include all employer-provided housing in 
 remote areas from 1 April 2000. It has been estimated that the extension to include small businesses and local government authorities will provide a $15 million boost to employees in Australia's remote areas and will therefore assist in job creation.
In conclusion, I would like to express my thanks to the many organisations and individuals who have lobbied the federal government over many years to have the fringe benefits tax in remote areas removed. As I said in the beginning, the end of fringe benefits tax on employer-provided housing is a great victory for regional Australia and for the cause of regional development. The Howard government has abolished FBT for remote area employer-provided housing because it recognises the importance of regional development, and in abolishing FBT it has removed a major disincentive to regional development.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Fringe Benefits Tax: Remote Area Housing</title>,Adjournment,22,1,speech
