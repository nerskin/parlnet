"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-11-12,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of the Wool International Amendment Bill 1998  be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 25 November 1998.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES OF MOTION</title>,<title>Wool International Amendment Bill 1998</title>,Notices,0,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1998-11-12,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 100th Inter-Parliamentary Conference held in Moscow from 6 to 12 September 1998. I am pleased to table the report of the delegation to the 100th IPU conference held in Moscow and, in so doing, there are several matters that I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate.
Firstly, as honourable senators will be aware, the IPU is the international parliament of parliaments, providing a forum for delegates from 138 sovereign states to debate current economic, social and political issues and to advance democracy and human rights. For several years, Australia has been strongly committed to the aims and objectives of the IPU. In keeping with this commitment, Aus 
 tralian delegations have taken a leading role in the work of the IPU and have been elected to positions of responsibility within the union. In this regard, the report I have tabled recognises this contribution and, in particular, the contribution of retiring members of parliament, including the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair, the Hon. Bob Halverson OBE and the Hon. Clyde Holding, all of whom contributed outstandingly to the IPU. I must admit that all of them were greatly missed at this last conference in terms of the friendships and the contributions that they have clearly made over so long.
Secondly, the report records how usually the delegation comprises both senators and members but that because of the calling of the election and under IPU rules Australia was represented by senators only. I had the honour to be appointed leader of the delegation. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the contribution of my colleagues Senator Gibbs and Senator Chapman.
Thirdly, although reduced in numbers, we were mindful of the significant contribution that previous delegations have made to the IPU. We were determined that this contribution be maintained as much as possible. Accordingly, we met on a number of occasions to plan and coordinate our various commitments to ensure that this goal was achieved. As indicated in the report, the highlights of our contribution are as follows. The Australian delegation submitted a memorandum and draft resolutions on strong action by national parliaments in the year of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to ensure the promotion and protection of all human rights in the 21st century. Senator Gibbs participated in the debate on human rights. The Australian delegation submitted a memorandum and draft resolutions on water and the means required to preserve, manage and make the best use of this essential resource for sustainable development.
Senator Chapman, coming from South Australia, participated exceedingly well in that debate. He also chaired with distinction the drafting committee on water. I was a member of the drafting committee on a supplementary item on the agenda, which concerned action 
 to combat the consumption and illicit trafficking of drugs and organised crime. Senator Gibbs also participated outstandingly in the meeting of women parliamentarians. Senator Gibbs made a wonderful contribution. I was a delegate to that forum but, because of our reduced numbers, Senator Gibbs took my position there. Like Senator Chapman, she certainly made an outstanding contribution. I addressed the plenary session during its general debate.
I also commend to the parliament the nomination of the Speaker of the House of Representatives to participate in the work of the preparatory committee of the IPU to formulate proposals for a conference of presiding officers at the UN in the year 2000, including a solemn act for reforming the IPU for the new millennium. I consider that this nomination is consistent with the commitment and contribution that Australian delegations make to the IPU. The point does need to be made that only a very few countries are included in it. To have Australia as one of them certainly reflects the outstanding contribution that Australian delegations have made for so long.
Fourthly, the delegation report refers in detail to the proceedings of the conference, the council and the executive committee. I commend these to the Senate. The report also includes the final text of resolutions adopted by the IPU on human rights, water, drug trafficking and the human rights of parliamentarians. I also commend these to the Senate. Fifthly, the Presiding Officers have recently referred to women parliamentarians the IPU survey on women in politics. I encourage my colleagues in both houses to participate in this worthwhile research.
Finally, as honourable senators will be aware, there is always a number of people who assist us with our work. The report rightly records the appreciation of these people by the delegation. However, on behalf of the delegation, I extend our appreciation to His Excellency Geoffrey Bentley, the Australian ambassador in Moscow, and his staff, including Mrs Marion Pydde and Ms Julie Heckscher, for the excellent assistance they provided to us. They were absolutely first 
 class in their support of the delegation in every way.
A report such as this would not be complete without acknowledging the contribution of the delegation secretary, Neil Bessell. Mr Bessell's contribution, as all of us who work with him in the Senate know, is always outstanding. On this occasion, with a small delegation having so much work to be done, the superb standard for which he is well known was certainly upheld. Our foreign affairs adviser, Mr Hugh Borrowman, was his usual highly professional and knowledgeable self. He was always prepared to contribute with every piece of advice ever needed. I certainly extend a very grateful thanks to both Neil and Hugh. I commend the report to the Senate and move:

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,1998-11-12,"—In supporting the remarks of Senator Knowles, I firstly congratulate her on the leadership she provided in what turned out to be a small delegation at this year's IPU conference.
—What about the election campaign?
—It was indeed a very happy delegation. Senator Carr raises the issue of the election campaign. Even though I was able to devote only three weeks instead of four to that campaign because of my responsibilities as a member of this delegation, it was still enough to thrash your mob in South Australia, in which we won nine out of the 12 seats and all three of the Senate seats we currently hold.
—Order! Senator Chapman, I invite you to address your remarks to the report.
—Thank you, Madam President. I am sorry that I allowed myself to be provoked by Senator Carr. I had to set the record straight. As I was saying, Senator Knowles did an extremely good job as leader of our delegation. She referred to the issue of water, which was one of the major issues debated and discussed in policy terms at the conference. As she mentioned, I did have the privilege of chairing the drafting committee 
 on the issue of water, and developing a policy statement in relation to water as a sustainable resource.
The point that I want to make is that Australia did submit a memorandum and also a draft resolution for that policy discussion. We were among a number of countries that submitted draft resolutions. In its wisdom, the drafting committee selected the German draft as the basis from which to work to finalise an appropriate policy position on this issue. However, I am very pleased to report that, although we were working from the German draft as a base, virtually all of the items contained within the draft resolution put forward by Australia were incorporated into the final resolution. They were either directly lifted from our draft resolution in terms of the words or with some slight variation on the words but retaining the same essential policy matters and policy propositions.
That, I believe, reflects very favourably on the respect in which Australia is held and the regard in which our knowledge of the issue of water is held because of the nature of our country and the experiences we have had in water development and water conservation. That was a highlight of the conference. The regard in which Australia is held with regard to its expertise in water stands us in good stead in terms of dealing with this issue, not only domestically but also contributing to international deliberations and, indeed, to the growing international technology on water conservation and water development.
So I wanted to reinforce the very welcome remarks of Senator Knowles in relation to the overall matters that were of importance at the IPU conference, but particularly to reinforce the regard in which Australia is held as far as water issues are concerned.

Let me give some background to the proposal for a Senate inquiry that stands in my name on behalf of the opposition before the chamber today. Mr Howard as Prime Minister has been an abject failure when it comes to being frank and up-front about his intentions with the tax system. It is worth remembering in the context of this debate that in December 1995 Mr Howard said on Newcastle radio, in reference to the goods and services tax:
No, it's not on the agenda—full stop, just not there, vamoose, kaput.
They were Mr Howard's words. A year and a half later, in mid-1997, Mr Howard, who had become a born again tax visionary, was on the AM  radio program, but with a very changed tune. He said:
I want to share this great adventure with the Australian people. I want to share with the Australian people the task and the challenge. 

`The great tax adventure', to use his words, which he wanted to `share' with the Australian people, then became even more exciting, even more all encompassing. In March of this year, in a breathless speech he made to the Liberal convention in Brisbane, he said:
It will be historic and significant beyond the experience of any other economic reform that has been undertaken in the time I have been in politics.
Look at the status. It went from `kaput' and `vamoose' to the most `historic' and `significant' economic reform since Mr Howard's first participation in politics. That is quite a substantial shift in rhetoric. I think everyone would have to acknowledge that that is a significant change. That is why the Australian people, this parliament and the Senate should never take Mr Howard's statements about tax reform at face value. It is why whatever Mr Howard and the government say about tax should be taken with a huge grain of salt. It is why this parliament, but particularly the Senate, should look behind the intentions of what the government is up to. You cannot take Mr Howard at his word.
There is a need for a high level, thorough and comprehensive Senate inquiry into the government's tax proposals. The Australian people would expect the opposition, they would expect the Labor Party, to propose a thorough inquiry into all aspects of the most significant economic shift since the mid-1960s—the complete rewriting of the tax system.
Mr Howard released his tax package with great fanfare and enormous expenditure of taxpayers' money, public money. But immediately that was done, he attracted a great deal of criticism regarding the unfairness of the rebates and the inadequacy of the compensation measures. Australians were bombarded with scales of tax rebates. We had visions of smiling families—who can forget them?—through the government advertising campaign. But the government's level of debate when asked serious questions was found wanting.
I want to remind the Senate of what the Deputy Prime Minister of this country said on the Face to Face program on 17 August this year. Mr Fischer was asked the following 
 question by Glenn Milne—and I would ask senators to concentrate on this:
How can a package that gives a single income person on seventy-five thousand dollars a year an eighty-six dollars a week tax cut, and someone on twenty thousand dollars a year a ten dollar a week tax cut, be described as fair?
That is the question; quite a reasonable one from Mr Milne. You know what Mr Fischer's reply was—his usual judicious, informed and thoughtful reply? This was what Mr Fischer said:
Well, I don't believe in communism.
That was his response. This is the standard of the public debate that Mr Howard talks about. We have from Mr Fischer, `Well, I don't believe in communism.' There is a bit of a gap here in Mr Howard's credibility. He had a $17 million tax advertising promotion campaign, probably the most significant, extensive and historic rort in Australian political history, certainly in federal politics. That campaign played down the goods and services tax. It promoted reform to the tax system—a fairer tax system, et cetera—but played down the GST. The GST was hidden in a publicly funded soft sell about tax rebates for Australian families. It was so one sided in its political message that it fell over. Do not forget that was an unprecedented expenditure of public money—
—Order! There is far too much audible noise and there are too many meetings taking place in the chamber. Could senators please give their attention to Senator Faulkner.
—Thank you for that deliberate and very partisan intervention, Mr Acting Deputy President. We had a five-week election campaign. The Prime Minister talks about a seven-week election campaign, because in those two weeks prior to the formal five weeks of the campaign over $17 million of public money was spent on advertising. Election campaigns are probably not the most conducive times for the most rigorous analysis of a most historic and significant reform. At times in election campaigns even rhetoric tends to get in the way of fact. So the government's claim that this was where the 
 nuts and the bolts of their tax package was thrashed out is laughable. To suggest that it was thrashed out as part of the public debate the government knows is an absurd claim.
There is no doubt that this tax package is deeply flawed. It is deeply unfair. It is not an adventure at all for ordinary Australians; it is a nightmare. For the poor, the sick, the disadvantaged, the people struggling to get educated, those looking for jobs, the normal small business people with moderate earnings, the families who earn less than $50,000 a year, the pensioners and the self-funded retirees, this tax proposal is a nightmare. These are the very people Mr Howard and his government have no care and concern for whatsoever. That is why we say there is a necessity for a Senate inquiry, and that inquiry has to be thorough. It has to expose the unfairness of the government's proposals, and we need to take the responsibility here, which Mr Howard will not take, to protect Australians who are less well off.
The motion that I moved today on behalf of the opposition will ensure a thorough going and wide ranging inquiry into the government's proposals. It will cover such matters as the government's modelling and assumptions. It will cover the effects on low and middle income families. It will cover the impact on employment, inflation, interest rates and investments, and the adequacy of measures to prevent the GST from rising above 10 per cent. It will also cover the issue of ensuring that consumers benefit fully from the abolition of existing taxes.
It is well known that the Labor Party's preference was for a Senate select committee. That was our initial preference. We believed and we still believe that this would be the most practical and the most effective way to conduct this particular inquiry. A select committee facilitates appropriate representation of all parties. Under our proposal we asked only that the opposition have a third of the representation. It would enable all minor parties, Independents and major parties in the Senate to be represented. It would have explicit powers to call and examine witnesses and documents. It would be appropriately resourced, and it would have the capacity to 
 hold hearings outside Canberra if and when required.
In the opposition's proposal we wanted to be flexible about timing. We said the committee should report before the end of June, and in discussions we have had with minor parties and Independent senators we have indicated quite clearly that we were flexible about that issue. A select committee has the capacity to draw together the traditional functions and responsibilities of legislation committees and references committees. It has that advantage.
Let me stress that our overriding objective here is and always has been to achieve a thorough parliamentary scrutiny, and that has been what this government has been trying to avoid from day one. Let us not lose sight of the fact that this, again, according to the Prime Minister, is such a historic and significant reform. What would it say for the role of parliament in our system of government if parliament were to have no role in scrutinising such—in the words of the Prime Minister—a significant reform? What would it say for the role of the Senate in the federal system of government if the Senate were to have no role in reviewing such a reform? What would it say for the impact and the effects on so many people in our society in this country if parliament did not take seriously its responsibility for a thorough and high level inquiry?
This proposal will have far-reaching consequences on all segments of our society, on everyone in this country, and the government does not want to afford anyone the opportunity of having a real say—but we will insist they get that opportunity. We will ensure, or try to ensure, that people do have the possibility of seeing this chamber of the federal parliament seriously address these issues. We are determined to try to use the processes of the parliament, and in particular the processes of this chamber, to that end.
We have never been wedded to a particular approach, a particular blueprint for achieving what we think is the necessary scrutiny of the proposals which the government has before the parliament. As I have said, we maintain that a select committee is the most sensible and manageable way to go. But we have had 
 discussions with other parties in the Senate, and I have to say that we have come to accept that our proposal for a single select committee does not have the necessary level of support.
So we have modified our original proposal in the terms that are now before the chamber. That has been done in the spirit of trying to ensure that we maximise the prospects of consensus among non-government senators in this chamber. Instead of a select committee, we are now proposing to refer the government's new tax system to the Economic References Committee. We accept the view that that particular committee does have the advantage of having been already constituted, obviously, and it is also resourced by the Senate for this type of inquiry. In addition, we have taken on board in our proposed terms of reference many of the areas of concern which have been highlighted by the Democrats and Greens—areas such as impacts on the environment, remote communities and small business, implications for the delivery of Commonwealth services and local government, and alternative taxation measures available to government.
We acknowledge, as I have said, that our preferred reporting date of on or before 30 June might have been construed by some as being beyond the time frame desired by a majority of senators. Accordingly, again in the interests of encouraging a consensus among non-government senators, we have nominated a reporting date of the last sitting day in May.
We also acknowledge that the Democrats and Senator Harradine want to make more use, a fuller use, of the existing committee system, as I have said. But we do not believe that the Democrat proposal is manageable. We do not believe it would produce as coherent and comprehensive an inquiry as the one that the opposition proposes. Our final clause in the motion before you states:
That, in the event that matters related to these terms of reference are referred to other References Committees, the Economics References Committee shall take into account the reports of any such committees in completing its own report on this reference.  

We believe that does cover other interests. Engaged on this task, you now have the government already proposing two, albeit limited, references committee hearings and the Democrats proposing at least seven references committees.
We say there is a need for a single body, whatever that body may be, to encompass, bring together all the various pieces of the government's mosaic. It does not make sense to us to have individual committees beavering away at individual pieces of the mosaic in isolation from other committees. So, in our view, this is a job for one committee. I have no idea why the government does not see fit to support this proposal, why an appropriately constituted, appropriately staffed and resourced single committee cannot do this job effectively in the best interests of the parliament and the public.
We also believe there is a chance that the Democrats's proposal really will turn into a logistical nightmare. How will seven separate references committees cope with running simultaneous inquiries into references which are inextricably interrelated? It is not possible to separate neatly all the various impacts and implications of the government's proposals.
There are many professional organisations, community groups and individual citizens who will be wanting to put their views to a number of committees who may well be sitting simultaneously in different parts of the country. Will the government put under this proposal eight different submissions to the eight different proposals? I do not think the government has thought any of this through. And what will happen to the other inquiries that references committees are undertaking? We do not think it proper that those simply be shoved to the back of the queue to accommodate the government's—what was once a never-ever, but now pressingly urgent—GST proposal.
I have to say that there are also implications for the resources of the legislation committees which, as senators know, share secretariat resources with the references committee. We are concerned that this has the potential to bog down the whole Senate committee system, with committees travelling everywhere 
 and hugely drawing on the Senate committee budget.
For those reasons, we do not support the Democrats's proposal. We think there are substantive reasons, but we have talked about these differences at length with Senator Lees and Senator Murray and others on behalf of the Democrats. But, as for the government's proposals, they are entirely half-baked, as senators know. They are really a belated attempt to define a lowest common denominator here. They are confined to impacts on just food, health and education; they ignore a huge range of other impacts and issues of concern to millions of Australians. And they are shoehorned, just like the Vos committee, into an impossibly tight and unrealistic time frame.
I have never been really able to understand why Mr Costello does not understand what I believe is the bottom line politics of this. Mr Costello should understand: no parliamentary inquiry—no GST. Of course, all these propositions might go down because the government has taken a new approach to the tainted vote of Senator Colston, but we believe a comprehensive multifaceted reference to the Economics References Committee is the way to go. That will best ensure that the Senate's, the parliament's, and the public's  wished are adhered to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-11-12,"—I wish to begin by speaking about process. As we have seen over the last few days, three different terms of reference were put on the table—one by the opposition, one by the Democrats and one by the government. I think everybody in this place except the government rejected the government's terms of reference as completely inadequate and little better than what the Vos committee is doing already. Indeed, their use of the Senate legislation committee is an automatic process that we cannot stop if they still want to go ahead with it later.
Obviously, there are a few facts in this place that we have to acknowledge. We felt that we should try to get some consensus. The first thing we have to acknowledge is that nobody has the numbers—something that the House of Representatives members do not 
 quite seem to have grasped as yet. The government can move its motions all day, every day and it will not get support if they are just supported by the government—as can we, and as can the Labor Party, the Greens or Senator Harradine. We need to get consensus to get anything through this place.
Secondly, once this committee process starts, we will be looking, I hope—if we actually get some agreement on this starting today—at February, March and April as pretty intensive working periods for these committees. People actually have to get on together. Senators have to spend time together. If we are dragging one party kicking and screaming to the table—they do not want to be there; they do not want to cooperate; they feel hard done by—then it does not lead us to a situation where we actually have good working relationships which will have to last under that much pressure for that period of time.
So, yes, I did ask yesterday if we could have another day. But, unfortunately, that was interpreted by the Treasurer last night as us caving in to the government, about to agree to what they put on the table, so our phones run hot today with all those people out there—particularly our members—concerned that we have collapsed and are just going to agree to whatever the Treasurer wants. I just want to assure you at the beginning of the debate today that is not the position. The position was that quietly, behind the scenes, we were sitting down, with various people talking to different senators. People such as Senator Brown were writing us letters, we were talking to Senator Harradine, and having discussions with the opposition and with the government on three particular issues: firstly, the content of the material if there was to be an inquiry—what were actually going to be the issues; secondly, the structure—which committees, how many committees; and, thirdly, the timing.
As far as the content is concerned, the ALP had some specific issues. It was not going to go beyond its bottom line. The government had a long way to go, but I am very pleased to say they last night agreed to the position we had reached with content, which we were able to roll into the amendments I am about 
 to move—which I will now call `the omnibus amendments'. All parties are basically happy with the contents of these amendments, although I note another circulated amendment by which the opposition actually wants to take out and rephrase a couple of clauses, which we have agreed to.
We worked very hard with Senator Harradine, who had quite a bit of content to put in, and I congratulate him on that. They are things we probably should have thought about ourselves. They broaden some of the references to the necessities of life, rather than just looking at food, and some other specific examples of treatment of charities, et cetera. Senator Harradine has had some input there, and I thank him for that.
Overnight, we amended our original amendment to take into account Senator Harradine's and Senator Brown's concerns. I just want to acknowledge the letter from Senator Brown and just refer him back now to the amendment that I am about to move to the Labor Party's motion, to assure him that we had all the matters that he has raised. In particular, he has asked that we go beyond food and books and look at items such as health and non-profit organisations. That was already in the community affairs reference. Other environmental concerns that he and Senator Margetts had can be covered in the environment committee under option (o).
As far as content is concerned, we seem to have agreement; certainly as of last night I thought we had agreement. But when we come to the structure, I realise we still have many people who are not particularly happy. But, again, we have got to the point where I think the ALP are going to reluctantly accept this amendment. I know they are still not happy with that. I acknowledge their concerns about the use of Senate time. I acknowledge that they have a range of other issues they wish to refer to committee. But, looking at the breadth of the changes that this government has within its package—remember, we are not looking at a new tax; we are looking at a new tax system—and considering this is the first real look we have had at our tax system since before World War II—before many of us, or indeed most of us, who are in this chamber at 
 the moment were actually born—I think it justifies a thorough committee hearing.
My colleagues last night at about 7 o'clock agreed to reduce our seven references committees back to four, and I understand the ALP has agreed reluctantly to accept an increase from one references committee up to four. The government last night also indicated, again reluctantly—I think we are still talking at a few cross-purposes here—that four committees was workable, even though it was not their best option. But, again, we had reasonable agreement.
 I will just run through this amendment and explain how we will be using the committees. The ALP wants an overarching committee, and that will be the Senate Economics References Committee. That committee will have the other three references committees—the Community Affairs References Committee, the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee, and the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee—reporting to it.
Can I just pause briefly on the environment committee. It is absolutely essential that we look at parts of the package other than just the GST. I remind people again of the government's words: it is a tax system. Changes to diesel fuel treatment and the actual cost that is going to mean for diesel fuel will have major impacts on the health of Australians, particularly many low income families in the capital cities who are often living around some of the major freeways and expressways. That is not an issue we can simply push to one side and hope we can roll into an economics committee. The environment committee is where the expertise is, and that is where we want to send it.
We are still having some difficulties with timing. After the Treasurer's comments last night, I do not feel that we can agree to any further adjournment. I think that will again be seen as the Senate caving in. We are not caving in; we are actually trying to work for some consensus. The ALP has come some two months back and one month back on their original request for the end of this process—for the final report. The overarching 
 committee will now report a month earlier at the end of May. The other three committees which will feed into the economics committee—the environment committee, the community affairs committee and the education committee—will finish a month earlier, at the end of April. We have also agreed to that change—bringing it back to April—which will hopefully assist the government.
However, I am well aware of the fact that the government is still working on the timing. I am not sure where we are going to get to with that today but, as far as the Democrats are concerned—from what we have heard so far in discussions—it is particularly unfortunate that the government believes we can all expect the community to give up Christmas and work through what is a holiday season in this country. The economic rationalists might like us to work seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year, but I think we have all agreed that what may be a perfect economic world is certainly not a perfect social world. I think it is unrealistic when many of those presenting submissions are going to be charities and not-for-profit organisations—the Surf Lifesaving Association, the Royal Lifesaving Association, the tourism industry and many other organisations and businesses—whose busiest time of the year is actually through Christmas.
They may, hopefully, be able to start work in December, which is why we wanted to get this committee process going now. Many of the bigger organisations have the bones—the outline—already prepared, hoping we could get the Senate references up. But many organisations are saying to us, `If you get it up this week, then we will start our modelling. We will then go back to many of our smaller organisations—our smaller branches or our smaller clubs—and ask them for their figures and look at how the GST, in particular, will affect them and look at how the fringe benefits tax changes will affect them.' I think it is unrealistic of the government to suggest we report in January—that basically all the community reports be in by January. If you are looking at a reasonable period of time, you are going to need at least four weeks of activity in December and a couple of weeks next year for them to finish those 
 submissions. I am sorry I am not quite up to date as to where the government's negotiations are this morning from thereon.
—Yes you are. You are right up to date.
—But as far as which weeks, I do not remember the single sheet of paper you sent around to us. Is that still in operation?
—Yes. You have four weeks.
—So you are looking at four weeks of hearings in February? I will leave you to explain later on in terms of the timing. We put it to our party room this morning and it was roundly rejected, and I am not able to support you on the floor today. I go back to the timing that other senators have brought their references back to: the end of April and the end of May. I would be happy to listen to your arguments as to how many weeks you believe you need to negotiate and discuss because, hopefully, we can get back to negotiating and, hopefully, that will be done as much as possible at a Senate level.
As far as what we hope to achieve out of this, I think one of the most important things—as well as, obviously, content—is to actually give the community the opportunity to participate, to actually give the community their chance to be heard. It was not just a quick reference to a few letters yesterday, Senator Kemp, when I asked you the question about how the government is actually getting its message across and where the detail is. There are lots of examples in my mail of letters to ministers not having been answered in three, four or five weeks. We are expected to know the answers, yet the detail in many instances—the treatment of charities, the treatment of pensioners who get their pensions from Britain, and the list goes on and on—is simply not in your documents. I also have copies of letters that you have sent back to constituents advising them to go and spend $11 or $25 and buy themselves a copy of your tax package, and I think that is particularly unreasonable for pensioners.
So one of the aims of this committee process is to actually give the community the 
 time to participate, which they did not get with Vos, and to feel that they have actually been heard. If you try to drive through this place a tax system that the community does not accept, it will not be to the benefit of all Australians. It will not be in any of our interests to see people stop spending, to pull back into themselves and their family units and wait for the dust to settle. We need an open process that the community can see working, that they believe in and where they have an opportunity to have their questions answered.
That is not to put to one side the genuine concerns of many industry groups, the genuine concerns particularly of the charities and the genuine concerns of many in the health area—the pharmacists and those who are involved with the sale of a range of products under the Therapeutic Goods Act. I will not go through all the details here, but where the lines are drawn on health and education is particularly important to many businesses. Some of the details on the treatment of aged care and child care will be revealed when Vos reports tomorrow, but there is a long way to go before we have a community understanding that this is an open process and that they have the opportunity to participate.
So I hope if the government is determined today to somehow push a very short time frame through this Senate, that it remembers that Australians out there are concerned about a new tax system, they are not happy about a new tax system and they need more than just a few weeks over Christmas to get submissions in.
I will close by saying that I hope the amendment I will move to Senator Faulkner's general business motion No. 1 will be successful. We do not know whether it will because negotiations effectively came to a halt this morning. But hopefully my amendment will be successful and we will actually get going on this committee process. I move:

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-11-12,"—I rise to speak on the motion moved by Senator Faulkner. Let me say from the outset that the government will not be supporting that motion. We went to an election on a tax reform. It was the central election issue. The Labor Party could not stop talking about our tax reform. They did not want to talk about theirs too much as it fell in a heap fairly early on.
Tax reform was the major election issue. That is what voters went into the polling booths on, and the government won the election. Therefore, we believe, and I think the Australian community expects, that the government will deliver on its promise. There are elements in this Senate concentrated on the Labor Party's side who are determined to try to force the government to break that promise. Let me make it quite clear that we are determined to proceed to ensure that we can deliver to the Australian people what we went to the election on and what we achieved a mandate on.
The government's position on an inquiry is clear. We have been returned to office with a mandate. However, we understand and we recognise that there is a disposition in the Senate for an inquiry. You do not have to be a genius to count the numbers in this chamber. We made it clear in a press release that was issued by the Treasurer that it is unlikely that we will achieve our goal of passing the legislation by 1 July 1999 unless the government agrees to an inquiry being held. So we have recognised that there will be an inquiry in the Senate.
What is fair and reasonable for that inquiry? What are the key principles on which one would want to have a fair and reasonable inquiry? The first one is to give people time to put submissions to that inquiry. That is the first one. The second one I put to the Senate is that there must be time for those submissions to be considered. The third element I put to the Senate is, having met those two criteria, there must also be time for the government to have the legislation debated properly and passed in the Senate to meet the government's deadline of 1 July 1999—a promise that we gave the Australian people, a commitment that we gave the Australian people. That is the dilemma that is before this chamber.
Where does the Labor Party stand? Essentially, the Labor Party is opposed to the tax reform measures that we have brought forward. It will do anything in its power to attempt to defeat those tax reform proposals. The Labor Party refuses to recognise the election result. So, as Mr Beazley said in a startling statement of frankness, it will work any parliamentary manoeuvre that is available in order to defeat the government's election promise. This is essentially what the Labor Party motion is about. No-one in the Labor Party is going to change their mind as a result of the inquiry. They are really not the slightest bit interested in an inquiry.
The Labor Party is interested in delaying and attempting to cause confusion. That is what the Labor Party is interested in. The Labor Party has dealt itself out of serious debate with its attitude and its shameless refusal to accept the result of the election. So the views of the Labor Party are quite clear. The Labor Party wants an inquiry only in order to delay consideration by the Senate of these bills. It does not come to this issue with clean hands.
I listened very carefully to the comments made by Senator Lees and the Democrats. I listened carefully to the views that she put, some of which I agree with and some of which I do not agree with. I agree with the fact that there have been productive negotiations in recent days. I hope those negotiations have been useful in helping the Democrats to understand the government's position. Equally, the Democrats have put their views to us.
We listened carefully when Senator Lees said that she was also prepared to negotiate further. I personally welcome that comment of Senator Lees and, as soon as both of us have a time to leave this chamber, I will certainly make myself available to see whether we can move this matter forward. I am not confident that we can move this matter forward in the chamber at the moment, only time and the votes will tell whether that is the case. I am not confident but, nonetheless, I welcome the comment that she is prepared to discuss this further with the government to see whether a consensus can be reached.
 At the start of my remarks, I indicated that there were perhaps three broad issues that had to be considered. Is there time for submissions to be called? The truth of the matter is, if this inquiry is set up by the Senate today, submissions could effectively be advertised tomorrow or on the weekend. Depending on the timetable set by the committees, this would certainly give many weeks—four, five or six weeks—for groups to put submissions to the Senate committees. After Christmas, the committees will have a chance to consider these submissions.
Again, the government has put down a position in its motions. We understand that the Democrats are not happy with that. We will look at further proposals there. But the government's bottom line is that we believe it is possible to set up an inquiry which on the one hand provides extensive time for people to put submissions in, and Senate committees typically make allowances for those groups who find it hard to meet deadlines. I do not think that would be any problem for the particular Senate committees which will be calling for submissions.
Equally, the government has indicated that we will work with the Senate to make sure that there is extensive time available for the hearings of the committees. I think Senator Ian Campbell has indicated that we would look at the parliamentary sitting times to make sure that space is provided for very extensive hearings by the Senate committees. We have also put down that the government needs time to make sure that these bills can be properly considered in this chamber and, hopefully from our position, passed by this chamber.
We believe that, if people come to the table with goodwill, we can meet all those three criteria. If people do not come with goodwill, if people have other agendas, then that is a different matter. But if the issue is to give people a fair time to put in submissions, if the issue is to give the Senate committees enough time to properly consider the issues which are before them and if the issue is to ensure that the government has sufficient time in its program to have the legislation considered by 
 the Senate, we believe that this Senate can achieve those three criteria.
We will, as I have indicated, be quite happy to speak to the Democrats, Senator Harradine, Senator Colston and even the Labor Party and the Greens if they wish to see how we can achieve those goals. I have no doubt they can be achieved, but it requires people to recognise we have to look where the centre of gravity is in this place. The government is very keen to get its bills passed. Senators wish to have proper and extensive consideration of these bills before Senate committees. Although the government does not see a need for that, it recognises there is a disposition in the Senate to do that and the government will cooperate so that the Senate can achieve that goal. The final thing is to make sure that people can put submissions to the committees. I say to Senator Lees and other senators that I have no doubt that we can achieve that. It will require a lot of work.
The one thing I was inclined to agree with Senator Faulkner on was that this is going to tie up the Senate committee structure for a considerable period of time. If you look at the time Senate committees have had for consideration of important bills that have come to this chamber—and I did some quick research last night—the most extensive inquiry done by a Senate committee on a bill was 16 weeks on the euthanasia bill. We have proposed three committees and the Democrats have proposed four committees—they have come down from seven. The time available for committees to consider the bills would be three or four times more what has ever been done before in this chamber. So if people want an extensive inquiry, that can be easily achieved.
As I said, the government will try to ensure, within reason and within the constraints of its own program, that the Senate and those committees have time to properly consider the matters before them. So very extensive time can be provided for these committee hearings, vastly in excess of anything which has ever been done before in this Senate that I am aware of. We can do that and still meet the criteria that the government has put down on 
 the need to provide plenty of time in this chamber for these bills to be considered.
I think the basis is there. If people come to the table with goodwill, it would surprise me if we could not reach agreement that would meet the demands of all parties in this Senate chamber. Certainly I hope in the next few hours, maybe days, that I and my colleagues will work to see whether that can be achieved.
I understand the Democrats went to the election and said they were not opposed to a GST. The Democrats had some queries about a GST in relation to food, but they were not opposed to the broader principle that the government was putting forward. The Democrats come with a position that we do not agree with, but it is a position that certainly was put by them to the people. We are happy to have those issues fully explored by the Senate if they feel it is necessary because we believe the results of such an inquiry will vindicate the government's position.
The government arrived at its policy position after a year of intensive discussion and negotiation with many groups. I can remember the extensive work of the Gibson committee in drawing in a very wide range of submissions from all groups in the community.
—That went into a black hole somewhere.
—No, it was done in good faith, Senator Lees, and as a result we were able to go to the election with the most comprehensive tax reform package which has ever been put before the Australian people and we won that election on the basis of that tax reform package. We are determined to proceed with the mandate, but if what you want is an extensive inquiry, I believe that can be accommodated. If what you want is reasonable time for people to put in submissions, that can be accommodated. If what you want is plenty of time for the Senate committees to hear the evidence, that can be accommodated. We can achieve all that and at the same time provide plenty of time for the Senate to consider the legislation that goes before the public.
I think you will find, Senator Lees, that with reasonable notice—and, as I said, we could put the notice out almost immediately—the vast proportion of groups will be able to meet any reasonable deadline for the submission of their views. Of course, as I said earlier in my remarks, Senate committees have procedures which can deal effectively with those who cannot.
We can provide plenty of time, but the Senate does not want to get itself in a position where it is not prepared to work. Senators are not prepared to work over this period. Senator Lees, it is now 12 November. There is plenty of time before Christmas for work to be done, for notices to be issued and even for hearings to be established early, if that is the wish of the committee. Equally, there is time, given a reasonable break over the new year, if people wish that, for the Senate committees to resume as well. This is very important. You are correct in that there will be lots of people who wish to put views to this committee. I do not think the Senate should say, `Well, we think tax reform is very important. We've got to have the biggest inquiry ever, but we really can't get moving until perhaps late in January or early in February.' I think that would put senators in a very odd position.
We believe that we can achieve a consensus, we can achieve a position at which the reasonable demands of all groups in the Senate can be achieved. We are not too far from it, to be quite frank, Senator Lees. The next few hours will determine whether that is the case or not. As I say, we are happy to discuss with all parties in the Senate to see whether we can reach an appropriate consensus which allows people time to put their submissions in, which allows the Senate committees plenty of time to conduct hearings and which provides the government with plenty of time to ensure that the bills can be properly debated in this chamber and passed by the 1 July deadline. We believe all that can be achieved. It is not achieved at the moment with the motion that has been put down by Senator Faulkner and it is not achieved by the amendment Senator Lees has put down.
In relation to Senator Lees's amendment, just to illustrate one of the dilemmas we have, clause (4) says that not only are we to have the final committee reporting by 30 May but also the consideration of any legislation implementing the government's proposals for this taxation reform be postponed. So not only do we get the 30 May deadline, you then say `until after presentation of all reports required by this resolution, and until after presentation of the Government's responses to these reports'.
The truth of the matter is that the government gets four or seven reports by 30 May. The government has then to consider in detail all these reports, and the legislation cannot even be debated then, Senator Lees. Typically, what happens is that committees put their reports down and these reports are considered in the debate. But, in this arrangement, you have not even given the government that usual precedent which is followed in this chamber.
Senator Lees, Senator Harradine, Senator Brown, Senator Margetts and the Labor Party, I think further discussion is required. We are happy to have those discussions. As I said, I believe we can achieve a consensus if all parties come to the table with goodwill.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-11-12,"—Before the chamber is a motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, and an amendment moved to that motion by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Lees. I wish now to move an amendment to Senator Lees's amendment to Senator Faulkner's motion. I will do that at the conclusion of my remarks. My amendment to Senator Lees's amendment to Senator Faulkner's motion is circulated in the chamber. I do need to say one or two words about the structure of this amendment.
The amendment by the Australian Democrats is a quite comprehensive and extensive amendment. With respect, we think there are ways of making it even more comprehensive without losing any of the point or merit of some of the elements of that amendment. If those changes were accepted, it may well be 
 that the opposition would be in a position to support the final amendment amended in this way.
My amendment goes to paragraph (e) in paragraph (3) of the reference to the Economics References Committee and proposes to delete the introduction to (e) and replace it with a new introduction which would read:
(e)	 options for improving the effectiveness and fairness of the tax system and reducing inequitable or unreasonable tax avoidance and minimisation, including consideration of alternative areas for tax generation, either where there are current tax concessions or where Australia's taxation system does not address major tax potential.
My amendment would replace an introduction which introduces a series of points set down in (i) to (vii) which itemises types of alternative areas of tax generation or types of current tax concessions or efforts to address major tax potential. The reason I think this is a more satisfactory amendment is that, in my understanding of the narrow interpretation of the Democrats proposal, if you introduce a concept and then set dot points, you in fact tend to limit the meaning of that concept to the dot points that you have introduced. By removing the dot points and explaining more widely and more effectively the idea of the wide range of this inquiry, you encompass all of the dot points that have been mentioned and any others that might arise as well or some that were not thought of in the heat of drafting. Therefore, you open the potential for a wider canvass of views and a wider examination than the amendment may have allowed by virtue of itemising a series of issues.
If that is not gobbledegook and is understood, and I trust it is—I see beaming smiles from some of my Democrat colleagues which suggest that at least the point is understood—then they can see that no merit is lost by these changes—in fact merit is enhanced by them—and that the changes might be acceptable. The further part of my amendment seeks to remove paragraphs (i) and (k) on page 3. Paragraph (i) deals with the restoration of the 150 per cent tax concession for R&D and paragraph (k) deals with capital gains tax, 
 including the implications of the suggested 30 per cent cap on the CGT rate.
Those changes are consistent with the explanation I have just given. The changes suggested by my amendment enable those things and more to be encompassed. Again, nothing is lost. I think more is added, and the text is improved. For those reasons, I recommend the changes to the chamber and trust that there might be, in an act of shaking hands across the chamber, consensus and agreement that they might constitute reasonable terms of reference for a Senate inquiry into the GST. I commend the amendment to the chamber in the expectation that that is so.
On the general subject of this inquiry, the issue has been canvassed substantially, and I believe persuasively, by speakers in this debate bar the government, which has defended its position and, while indicating to the chamber support for a Senate inquiry, rejected essentially the approach taken by the opposition and the Democrats. In terms of the government proposal for a shortened reporting time for the inquiry, Senator Kemp said, `The vast majority of groups'—meaning community groups and potential organisations or entities that would submit to an inquiry—`can meet our deadline,' which is a shortened deadline for February. I do not believe that that is true.
If you look at the Vos committee, which is a committee the government has set up to look at elements of the GST, and the time frame in which that committee has to operate, you can see a window on government thinking about what reasonable time looks like. The Vos committee will be in existence for 17 days. According to the ABC radio yesterday, it has attracted some 250 submissions. The committee has 17 days to deal with 250 submissions. There are 408 hours in 17 days. If the committee sat 24 hours a day, it would have 1 hour and 38 minutes for each submission of the 250 submissions made. In that 1 hour and 38 minutes, the committee members would have to read the submission, understand the submission, analyse its contents, come to a conclusion about it, extract from it any main points, balance them against other submissions that they had read or intend to 
 read, reserve time at the end for a conclusion, and then reserve further time to write their conclusion.
If you put it in that context, perhaps it is physically achievable and perhaps Mr Vos has powers that transcend those of normal human senators in the ability to do this at such a rapid clip. I do not necessarily pretend that he cannot do it, but I do think it is unreasonable and fantastic to argue that that can lead to a balanced consideration in the national interest of matters of this weight and importance so fundamental to the taxation structure of Australia and the wellbeing of ordinary Australians. I mention that because that is the best example I have to hand of what the government thinks is a reasonable deadline for a committee that it has set up to deal with the momentous matters contained in this debate.
If you go back to the actual circumstances of how we came to have an election on the GST, you will remember that the Prime Minister announced the great tax adventure in May 1997, and in August 1997 the committee to review the taxation structure of Australia was set up. It was a committee set up in Treasury. It was a secret committee. It had a chairman, which we later adduced by inquiries through the estimates process. It never kept minutes. It never kept records. Its membership was indefinite. We know that the senator representing the Treasurer in this place, Senator Kemp, was not a member of it and not privy to it, at least not initially. It sat for 460 days before it brought down its report.
Government consideration of these matters—a process internal to government and hidden from public view—took 460 days before the committee produced its report. When the report was produced to the accompaniment of a $17 million advertising campaign paid for by the taxpayer, Australians had two weeks to absorb the detail before they were in the midst of an election campaign. Election campaigns are a bit like war in the sense that often the first casualty in an election campaign is truth. Certainly, a casualty in an election campaign is space for objective calm analysis because parties are con 
 tending for the ultimate prize and there tends to be often—and this as an observation—a degree of exaggeration in the way in which parties put their arguments in an election context. While in this election campaign that may not have been true of the Labor Party, it certainly was true of the government.
After 460 days to incubate and prepare the ideas and a $17 million campaign over two weeks to present them, the government now tells us that it has a mandate to introduce legislation along these lines. That does spark a debate—and we have had one over the last couple of days in this chamber—about the meaning of the word `mandate'.
Senator Kemp talks about a deadline, as he did a moment ago in this debate. Apparently, according to Senator Kemp, the deadline is 1 July 1999. I do not recall a deadline actually being voted on in those terms. The deadline is one invented by the government and imposed on itself to encourage the public to believe there is urgency here and that they have to get the legislation through by that time for whatever reason.
The allegation of a deadline is attended to by intimations that tax cuts may not be made and other benefits that the government alleges are contained within its package will be withheld, disturbed or degraded to some extent if this deadline is not met.
I am always sceptical of self-imposed deadlines for negotiating purposes. There is often no such case and I do not believe there is one on this occasion. If the issue of a deadline is put alongside the issue of a mandate, a reasonable question for the citizens of this nation to pose to a government is, `If you claim a mandate, why don't you wait until the Senate that was elected at this election is able to take its seat and exercise the mandate that we, the people, gave both houses of parliament, and not just take the view that, simply because the government is formed in the lower house, that is the sole chamber in which these matters must be determined?'
This is a classic debate for the Senate—the role of the Senate versus the House of Representatives. I am unable to read the position of individual senators on this matter and I make no allegations or observations about it, but 
 what is different in the debate about this legislation is that government believes that it has—and it is a belief in the mind of the government—a far better chance to rush this legislation through before 1 July than it might have after 1 July. Its deadline is convenient for that type of caper, and this is all about that; it is not about proper examination of the basis for major tax change.
Let me add one observation on the question of mandate. Nearly 52 per cent of Australians, in voting in the House of Representatives on a two-party preferred basis, voted against the party that was proposing a GST. Sure, the government was elected, but that is because the vote went their way in a number of borderline constituencies.
If the election was a referendum on the GST rather than an election, the referendum would have been lost. There were only two states in Australia in which the government had a majority on a two-party preferred basis, that is, South Australia and Queensland. In every other state, and in the two territories as well, if this was a referendum on a two-party preferred basis, in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia the referendum would have been defeated. And, for the record, in the ACT and the Northern Territory it would have been defeated as well.
If this last poll had been a referendum on a GST, we would not be debating the matter; it would have been disposed of by the people by expressing their will in the terms which I have described. It would not have commanded a majority of the total vote and it would not have commanded a majority of the vote in a majority of the states, and both conditions are necessary to carry a referendum.
A number of matters have been put to the public in the argument about a goods and services tax and its economic impact. They have been presented almost as slogans or mantras in the belief that, if you repeat a concept often enough, people will come to believe that it has a certain truth or permanence to it, whether it is true or not. There is no doubt that that was done on the government's side in this election campaign—no doubt whatsoever. Some of those are imminently challengeable and many of them 
 are nothing like what was said in the sloganeering way in which it was put.
For example, an area that I am familiar with and which falls within the bounds of my own shadow portfolio is trade. It was argued that there would be a massive boost to Australia's trade prospects if a GST was introduced and if charges were taken from the backs of exporters and export was zero rated. It was argued, therefore—and on the face of it, it seems true—that Australia would have a competitive advantage in that the costs of goods in foreign markets would be lower. Presumably, as a consequence of that, we would be able to win more market, sell more goods and create more jobs. That was the image presented.
That is good enough so far, but of course it goes a lot further. When you travel the whole distance and look at the ongoing economic impact, nothing like that conclusion is reasonable in a debate in which reason is the centrepiece rather than political opportunity.
Let me explain why. First of all, that debate does not account at all for fluctuations in the exchange rate. We know that the Australian dollar is valued by the international market to reflect the market's view of the competitiveness of the Australian economy. As every economist I have consulted on this point says, of course, if our goods become a bit cheaper, then the dollar will go up to compensate. The international market equates the price of our goods to the competitiveness of the economy and increases the dollar to offset that competitive advantage. So there might be an immediate short-term advantage, which will be washed out of the system reasonably quickly by changes in the exchange rate.
That is not my view, although it is a view I hold, but it is a view held by many eminent economists. It is a view attested to by the deputy chairman of the government's own task force and a former staffer of the Treasurer when he wrote a paper on the exchange rate impact of a goods and services tax in Australia and concluded that there was essentially no real value in making the change—a gentleman by the name of Mr Matthew Ryan.
 It is also the view attested to by the International Monetary Fund when they did a world survey of goods and services taxes to assess what the competitive advantage to nations introducing GSTs will be. We never heard very much about any of that in the election campaign. The IMF concluded that there is no essential value of such a tax in trade terms. What we heard in the election campaign was that there would be a massive windfall.
 One of the advantages that this inquiry can bring is to get to the bottom of this argument, to present impartially and clearly the argument, so that the real economic impact—if there is one—can at least be understood. That is one element that I think an inquiry would be justified on. It is one advantage that this process can bring to enlighten public debate and understanding on this measure. I conclude my remarks on that point. I have foreshadowed an amendment. I now formally move it. It was not my intention to ask you to take it in separate parts. I ask you to put it as one. Therefore, I move:
(1)	 Omit paragraph (e) of the reference to the Economics References Committee in paragraph (3), substitute:
(e)	 options for improving the effectiveness and fairness of the tax system and reducing inequitable or unreasonable tax avoidance and minimisation, including consideration of alternative areas for tax generation, either where there are current tax concessions or where Australia's taxation system does not address major tax potential.
(2)	 Omit paragraphs (i) to (k) of the reference to the Economics Reference Committee in paragraph (3).",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-11-12,"—I want to commend Senator Cook first for that contribution. It made a lot of sense. If that is evidence of the debate that is going to follow in the Senate further down the line, then we can look forward to a lot of enlightenment on the impact of the GST on the Australian community as a whole. Just following up on what Senator Cook had to say, it is true that, in politics, timing is crucial.
There are three alternatives as to when this debate on the GST and the inquiry could take place. The first and best time for it was 
 before the election. We knew—all of us—12 months ago that the government was moving to a GST-oriented election. Seeing that, the Greens called in a consultant to see if there could be a green GST, meaning a GST which is socially just and environmentally sound. The consultant, Dr Louise Crossley, went to look at world experience—the best way to answer that question—and the resounding answer was that a GST in Australia at this time can neither be socially just, no matter how it is fiddled with, nor can it be environmentally enhancing.
 On the basis of that, we went to the election with our homework done, rejecting the GST, but moreover putting forward the better alternative now being adopted in European countries and being moved towards by the Blair government in Great Britain of European-style eco taxes. I am glad to see that the parameters of the proposed inquiry from the Democrats have been widened, amongst many other things, to allow a very clear look at that as an alternative. That was the best time—before the election—for this inquiry to have taken place, for the community to be involved and for the community to be aware of the ramifications of a GST. However, that did not happen—except with us Greens doing that consultancy—as far as I can see, and the electorate was asked to vote on the matter.
The next best time, as Senator Cook pointed out, for this inquiry to take place therefore is when the representatives of this place elected by the electorate on the issue of the GST are also in place; that is, after 1 July 1999. It is extraordinary that the government—and Senator Kemp in his submission—has said there is a deadline of 1 July 1999. That ought to be the starting point. That is when the people's elected representatives will be here in full.
 The third alternative is to hold the inquiry between the election when the people have voted—and, as Senator Cook has pointed out, the majority indicated a position against the GST—and 1 July. And here we are with the worst of the three alternatives. The timing is wrong, wrong, wrong. However, I am not going to be able to alter that timing.
 Having made it clear that the Australian Greens are totally opposed to the GST package, we are left in the position then of saying, `We have done our homework but it appears that other entities of the Senate have not and certainly the people have not been given that opportunity to be consulted, so we move to an inquiry.' There seems to be a consensus or there seems to be a majority feeling that that inquiry should take place before 1 July.
 Our job therefore is, in seeing that, to help to make this inquiry as productive as possible. It was on the basis of that that I made it clear to the Democrats who are moving for the inquiry that there was no point in doing so with a closed mind, that they and indeed all of us should be open to the outcome of that inquiry and the input from the Australian people. We need to go beyond Senator Lees's concern that the community must feel it has been heard and to actually implement and ensure measures that protect the community interests. She and I will be in agreement here that that means in particular the interests of those who have it hardest in the Australian community. That is why I stood out for a condition being that the Democrat position of supporting a GST, provided food and other items were exempted, be open to change.
If this inquiry is going to have meaning and the Australian community is really going to believe there will be a dinkum outcome, the option of both supporting the GST but, more importantly, rejecting it in toto has to be there. I am pleased to have heard that the Democrats have agreed to that. Indeed, in the note I sent Senator Lees two days ago, I asked her to confirm it in writing. The transcript of some comments made in the media would be adequate for fulfilling that desire I have.
—I have not agreed to that.
—Senator Lees now says that she has not agreed to that.
—Not your interpretation of that.
—That creates some concern with me. I want the matter cleared up before I vote on it. That is why I want it from Senator Lees in writing. I ask Senator Lees to 
 listen to it. I want in writing what she does mean by that. I do not want to misinterpret what Senator Lees has said. It is up to her to clear up that matter. I will make my decision based upon the written version she gives me.
I believe that the government would not have won this election except for the blunting of the threat of the GST by the Democrats' position. When the Democrats said, `We stand for a gentler, kinder, more compassionate, food exempting GST,' the tide turned against the election campaign. Until that point, there was a much greater concern in the Australian community about the impact of a GST. The government got home because the Democrats said, `We'll look after this GST and make sure it's socially just.'
Having done that, there is an enormous responsibility on the Democrats to ensure that it is socially just. I say again that, in the Greens' assessment of world practice, it cannot be socially just. My conclusion is that a proper, thoroughgoing inquiry will lead to the Democrats changing their point of view to reject this GST package.
I am also pleased that there has been an increasing emphasis put on the ability of the inquiries to look into the environmental impacts. It is not just the GST, although that has environmental detriment built into itself, which I speak of here. The package, which ought to have taken into account the environment and made sure that there were incentives built into it for those who do the right thing by the Australian environment, does quite the reverse. It gives incentives to polluters. The Australia Institute, in an independent assessment, has found that the rebate—the incentive given to those who use petrol and diesel fuels—of $3½ billion plus per annum will lead, on a national basis, to an extra five million tonnes of greenhouse gases being produced in this country. On top of that, some 2,000 plus tonnes of carcinogens will be put into the environment as a result of the increased use of diesel fuels.
This is no light matter. The New Scientist reported some time ago that in Britain alone some 10,000 Britons a year die of cancer due to the carcinogens coming out of diesel exhaust pipes. You can translate that to the 
 approximate thousands of Australians who die because diesel is a major polluter of urban environments. This package is an incentive to increase that toll. It is a very important consideration. An inquiry which does not address it is an inquiry that will not look after the interests of the unsuspecting populace in terms of the detriment to the environment, their health and their longevity.
I could speculate that, at the end of the day, after all the inquiries have been held and after all the energy has been put into this by the Australian community, the outcome may simply well be another deal between Senator Harradine and the government. It is a good thing Senator Harradine spoke with the disabled people the other day outside this place, because they are concerned about the impact of the GST. But I have very worried recollections of what happened to the rights of the indigenous people after an interaction between Senator Harradine and indigenous people outside this parliament earlier this year, where they lost so much of their interests in a compromise between Senator Harradine and the government on that occasion.
The political reality—I do not aver from this—is that Senator Harradine and Senator Colston will strike a deal with the government some time in June, as things stand. My only appeal to the Independent senators is that, in the process of enjoining this inquiry, they make it dinkum. They need to listen to what people have to say in the inquiry. They need to act, as we all must if we are genuine representatives of the people, in the interests of everybody who will be affected by the GST. In particular, that means those on low incomes, the most powerless and those who have the most to lose by this remarkably important change in which the community is not only taxed but wealthy entities in the community get multibillion dollar breaks out of the government's tax package.
I will watch the rest of this debate with great interest. I will do what I can on behalf of the Australian Greens to continue to see that this is a dinkum inquiry—that it doesn't just make everybody feel good, but brings a result which will soften the impact of a very 
 threatening GST package on the wider Australian community.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-11-12,"—Poor Senator Brown. He can't help himself. He is constantly reflecting on the bona fides of parliamentary colleagues. He did it to the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees, and he has again done it to me. If he wants his colleagues to have any regard whatsoever to what he says or, indeed, to his credibility, the least that he can do is acknowledge the goodwill and good faith of colleagues and not presume the worst. It behoves the Senate to deal with these matters on their merits and not bring to them the sorts of prejudices we have heard from Senator Brown.
In respect of the native title legislation, Senator Brown's contribution to that debate showed that he knew very little about the whole issue of native title. Have a look at it. Read through what he said during that debate. I must admit that there were not too many people who knew the ramifications of the native title legislation, let alone the common law rights of indigenous Australians. The outcome of that debate was an honourable, fair, just and workable outcome. What Senator Brown clearly wanted was a stalemate, where indigenous Australians were not able to access their rights—let `em go. Don't get a workable solution.
Are you suggesting that the Queensland government's proposal that was passed last night—I don't suppose you knew that it was passed last night, but I am continuously updating myself on what is happening as a result of the legislation—is not going to mean a better, more rapid, more just application of principles so that the indigenous people can get their rights quicker than they would have otherwise? Is that what you are saying?
—Yep. Rights.
—Oh, really? I don't know how many other people would say it. That is not what the Labor Party is saying.
—I know.
—Oh, you know. Did you know that it passed last night 
 through the Legislative Assembly of Queensland?
—Of course we did. Where is the goodwill you are talking about, Brian?
—Well, if you did know you wouldn't have said what you said.
—I also know what they are doing in Western Australia.
—Yes, and I know what they are doing in Western Australia, too. I am sure that that matter, which is currently being debated in the Legislative Council, will show the Court government that they couldn't get away with what they were proposing to get away with. Even if they tried to get away with what they were trying to get away with it wouldn't have been accepted in this chamber. The Northern Territory proposition is absolutely laughable. I should imagine that the relevant minister in the government would certainly not tick what the Northern Territory has tried to do.
Bear in mind that these procedures were put in place by the Senate and the parliament in general. Let me just say this in respect of statements that have been made about what the government might or might not hope for if this measure is debated by 30 June. The government has no reason to believe that it would be better off having this legislation voted upon in the Senate before 30 June as against after 30 June. I have said nothing publicly or privately to the government which would indicate that to it. In fact, everybody knows that I have had a view about the GST for many years that such a proposal would be regressive. Even before this election I have indicated that I oppose a GST on the basic necessities of life where that discriminates against those least able to pay. That is pretty clear.
Then I heard what Senator Brown said: `Why not leave this until after 1 July when the senators who were elected at the last election take their place?' He is falling into the same trap of the argument on mandate. Are you saying that that is the mandate? They are saying that is a mandate. You are saying it is a mandate. Do not bring it in until after 1 July because we do not have a mandate for 
 it. You are falling into the government's trap. We are not saying that the government has a mandate for this. What we are doing is proposing to exercise our rights and our duties to form the functions which we as a Senate should perform. Those functions are particularly functions of review of legislation that the government brings before us.
But surely it is the executive government's right to bring legislation before us. Whether or not they think they have a mandate for it, they have a right to bring legislation before the parliament. They have a right to do so whenever they choose. But we also have a right—indeed, a duty—to examine that legislation or the policies behind that legislation and to do so in a thorough manner. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees, is one which I believe would provide the Senate with an opportunity of thoroughly examining the issues relating to the tax reform package, including the GST. I am pleased that the Democrats took on board some suggestions that I made, and I referred to a couple of them. I think it is important to deal not only with the issue of food but also with the basic necessities of life, such as food, clothing, shelter and essential services. I think it is important to examine the effect of taxing those basic necessities of life.
For some considerable time I have been seeking papers from Treasury, as have Senator Lees and Senator Margetts. We were given the no treatment by Treasury mainly. I have been seeking that information for some considerable time. Besides the assumptions, calculations, predictions, estimates and modelling which underpin the government proposals for taxation reform, I am pleased to see that Senator Lees has included the economic theories that may well be behind those matters. Because they would be very revealing I am sure.
I am a bit disappointed that the amendment differs somewhat from the proposal by Senator Lees which is in the Notice Paper—namely, that it is reducing the number of committees from seven to four. I would like to make a comment on the effect that the GST and the whole of the package are going 
 to have on the states and their finances. This is a very important matter. The state premiers are very concerned about the issue, and they are meeting this afternoon and tomorrow here in Canberra. The original proposal states:
The effects of the Government's taxation reform legislation proposals on state and local government administration, including:
. . .              . . .             . . .
(d)	 the implications for future federal-state financial relations of not extending the GST to the necessities of life . . . and any adjustments to the proposed arrangements which would be required to federal-state financial relations . . .
I am particularly interested in whether the proposal really discriminated against or between the states. I am glad it is there, but the problem with reducing the inquiry to four committees is that the Finance and Public Administration References Committee will not get a guernsey to look at these particular areas for which it has expertise. Again, at some stage I hope that the Finance and Public Administration References Committee will be the committee that will deal with the matters that were proposed originally by Senator Lees in the notice of motion that appears in yesterday's Notice Paper .
Also, I believe it would be quite desirable for the rural and regional affairs committee to deal with that particular area because of its expertise; there are a number of terms of reference that would be better dealt with there. I also think it is very, very important for the legal and constitutional affairs committee to look at the matters which were originally in the document put forward by Senator Lees—and I quote:
The effects of the taxation reform legislation proposals on legal and constitutional matters, including:
(a)	 the constitutionality of the proposed mechanism for future changes to the GST, including whether such changes would present a significant hurdle to future increases, or reductions if deemed necessary to stimulate the economy . . . 
That is relevant because of what is happening in Japan at the present moment.
I do express a bit of disappointment that the full resources of the Senate committee system, 
 that all of the Senate committees, are not going to be brought to bear to focus on this matter so as to provide the Senate with reports and to consider the submissions from the public. Nevertheless, in order to not waste time, I propose to support the amendment that has been moved by Senator Lees.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-11-12,"—This debate is about the unfairness of the GST. The government wants to pretend that this is a fair package. This is about whether or not the government will continue to run and hide from that fundamental fact. This is about whether or not the government will agree to genuine scrutiny of the GST package—genuine scrutiny.
What we saw before the election was a tax package described as `the biggest change in Australian taxation history' dropped on the community. Then, two to three weeks later, we saw an election called. At that time those opposite ran from scrutiny. They have no runs on the board when it comes to whether or not the Australian community, the parliament, people in this chamber get a chance to actually test their bona fides. What we have seen for the last two or three weeks is a position consistent with the one those opposite had before the election: they do not want anybody to have a good hard look at the facts.
All sorts of lies and untruths have been told about this package. Those opposite claim that the GST package, this tax reform, will lead to more jobs—well, it will not. They say that it will lead to the end of the black economy—well, it will not. They say that it will improve our national savings rate—well, it will not.
The part of this debate I find the most offensive is the misleading of the unemployed people in this country. Those opposite want to pretend that the GST can create jobs. There is no country in the world—not one—where the introduction of the GST has led to a reduction in the rate of unemployment. But that is the big lie that this government keeps trying to tell those poor struggling Australians who are out there battling to find a job.
We have seen the employment figures today: 7.9 per cent—the rate has barely moved; three more years, and the rate has 
 barely moved. That is what this mob are promising us again—no change.
—Tell us about full-time jobs, Senator Connroy.
—That is exactly right, Senator Stott Despoja: there are no full-time jobs being created in this country. But those opposite want to keep pretending that is what is happening.
Then they want to tell you about the national savings rate—something that this country needs to address; very important for a better balance of payments; very important for foreign debt; very important for whether or not this country can sustain its living standards. They say that the GST will increase the national savings rate.
But even their own Treasury department, when questioned, had to admit that there is not, again, one country in the world where, when a GST has been introduced, there has been an increase in the savings rate—again, not one. But you will still see them out there peddling this lie to ordinary Australians, making them believe, giving them false hope that this package is about making a difference on those issues.
The strongest argument those opposite claim they have had, apart from jobs, is that it will make those bludgers who are not paying tax pay tax. It will fix up the black economy. I am telling you: the GST ain't going to make Kerry Packer pay tax.
But what happened overseas in Canada when they introduced the GST? There were actually a couple of extra jobs created—I have to correct myself—when they introduced the GST in Canada. But where were they all? In the tax office. What has happened with the Canadian experience and all over Europe is that there has been a massive increase in the black economy—not a decrease, a massive increase in the black economy. It only makes sense. If you increase the amount of goods on which is paid an indirect tax, if you increase the total on indirect tax, there is a greater incentive to avoid it. It is perfectly rational behaviour to have an increase in the black economy when you introduce a GST.
Those opposite try to pretend that the GST will stop all those bludgers out there, but the only place you will see more jobs from a GST will be in the tax office. We have seen some heroic assumptions in their package. They did not want the opposition, the Democrats, the Greens or any of the eminent economists around the country to have a good look at this because, when you stand it up, even if you give them the best case scenario and pretend all their other assumptions are true, the famous 1.9 per cent—which today we have seen was a lie—has been shown by their own studies to be a fabrication.
If you believed that the 1.9 per cent was true, you had to believe in the Easter Bunny. You did not need secret Treasury documents that were held back until after the election to see that pensioners were going to be worse off, to know that the story they were trying to tell on the unemployed and single parents and people in those positions at the lower end of the spectrum were going to be worse off; you did not need the Treasury documents. It stands out: how on earth can 1.9 per cent be right?
But they pretended for the entire election campaign. They spent $15 million of your money to pretend that 1.9  per cent—remember the advertising campaign?—was the real figure. They knew it was not. They misled the Australian community, and Senator Kemp has been part of that. You are walking out of the chamber now, Senator Kemp, because again you do not want to face the scrutiny of this chamber. Senator Kemp, 1.9 per cent is a fraudulent figure. You know it, and you have been exposed.
We saw the WST lampooned during the election, but who ended up looking like the buffoon? There was the Treasurer and his teddy bear. Where is the teddy bear, Senator Alston—the one that Mr Costello was going to carry around with him every day of the campaign, the one that was coming down in price? Why did he suddenly lose his teddy bear? He lost his teddy bear because it became apparent very quickly that in actual fact the claim about the WST and the fall in the price of that teddy bear after the introduction of the GST was not true for the very simple 
 reason that WST is levied before the mark-up, before the profit margin is put on. So, when this became apparent, when people in the industry said, `We had better let Costello know that that teddy is actually not going to go down in price,' he had to lose the teddy bear. The hunt is on to find the teddy bear; this government now wants to hide that teddy bear because it is an embarrassment.
We have seen all sorts of allegations from this government about its modelling. This debate is about this parliament, the Australian community and those economic experts around this country who have stood up before and after the election and said, `Some of their assumptions are heroic, some of them are disgraceful and cannot be sustained with any intellectual rigour whatsoever.' The government withheld these papers. Even if you give them the benefit of the doubt about the 1.9 per cent and say, if you average it out, 1.9 per cent works, you have got serious economic forecasters, economic modellers, in this country saying they have used false assumptions, they have not put fair dinkum assumptions in there.
You have even had in today's paper the head of the government's retirement income modelling unit, Phil Gallagher, defending the documents released yesterday, saying they are a credible way to estimate the impact on low income earners. They are a very credible way. Surprisingly enough, in 1991, when this lot put up Fightback, guess which figures they used? The HES figures, the household expenditure survey figures. In 1985, when this country had a genuine debate about tax reform, when we had a summit, when we had debate right across the community for many months and full disclosure of Treasury documents, what figures were used? The HES figures, not some concoction by the government on a few bodgie bits of advice to Treasury—`Come on, find a decent figure that is not going to make it look as bad for us.' You have got the government's own people saying, `Just a minute, no, we do not think it is wrong.'
They have given the Vos committee 17 days. It was a joke. The Vos committee said it was a joke. They have been dragged kick 
 ing and screaming to this point today. They have said, `We do not want an inquiry.' Two weeks is all the Australian community got to have a good hard look at the assumptions in the Treasury modelling, two weeks before the government called the election. They have spent all that money—over the top—in the lead-up to the election in a couple of weeks. There has not been any fair dinkum scrutiny.
What we have seen is a tax package, as George Megalogenis says today in the Australian, that promotes, at best, if you give them the benefit of the doubt, a one per cent increase for pensioners—if you want to give them the benefit of the doubt, and I do not—yet will give a 10 per cent increase to people who earn more than $50,000. Is that fair? Is that equitable? Absolutely not. This chamber has every right to expose that through the committee process being proposed today. It is absolutely right to demand scrutiny. Why should 52 per cent of the tax cuts that this government is giving—over half—go to people who earn what I do? Why should I be part of the group that will get half of the total tax cuts when the pensioners in this country are going to get almost nothing—and that is if you are being generous.
I pose this question to people in the gallery and to members of this chamber: do you really believe that when the WST is taken off, the 22 per cent and the 32 per cent is removed, all those shops out there are going to drop their price from 22 per cent to 10 per cent, from 32 per cent to 10 per cent? Do you really believe that? If you do, you believe in Santa Claus. I certainly do not.
What does the government say to us? They say, `We have got Alan Fels and the ACCC. They are going to make sure there is no unfair profiteering.' Alan Fels would have to be in every single supermarket every single day to make sure that we do not get ripped off. I am not prepared to believe that Alan Fels could possibly do it—even if he had a doubling of his budget, even if he had nothing else to do in this country but to look at supermarket prices to stop profiteering. With the best faith in the world, he could not possibly do it. But this government wants you to believe, just because Alan Fels has been 
 put in charge of the issue, that the profiteering that will take place can be stopped. The chamber should vote for Senator Faulkner's motion and Senator Cook's amendment, because the Australian community deserves the right—
Senator Calvert interjecting—
—Don't you start, Senator Calvert. The Australian community deserve the right to have look at this package—the biggest ever tax reform in the history of Australia, according to the government—but they are only allowed two weeks. I urge the Senate to support Senator Cook's amendment and Senator Faulkner's motion, and I urge the Australian community: when you get the chance, put in a submission to these hearings. Do not be shy, come forward and put in submissions.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-11-12,"—The starting point in this debate has to be the fact that we are not entering into a discussion on the GST cold. The GST was certainly the centrepiece of the 1993 election campaign; so there has been a long history in this country of opportunity for people to scrutinise the implications of the proposal.
Senator Conroy, of course, lets the cat out of the bag in a comprehensive fashion—I suppose revealing his relative inexperience in this jurisdiction. To concede as he did that this is about an unfair tax package is simply confirming what we all know, and that is that Labor does not have the slightest interest in any sort of sensible examination of a proposal. What Labor is interested in is exposing what it sees as the reasons not to support a GST. In other words, it wants to have a re-run of the election campaign.
Mr Howard did also, of course, announce more than 12 months before the election that the GST would be something we would take to the last election. It was, from then on, the centrepiece of the campaign and it remained so. What that means is that there are many organisations in the community who have had every opportunity to look at the implications. Certainly, since 3 October it has not been a matter of `whether'; it has been a matter of 
 `how'. Again, they have had every opportunity since 3 October to be putting together submissions, examining, engaging consultants and doing what that silly Senator Brown told us he did some time back, and that was to get the Democratic candidate in the last federal election, Crossley, to go around the world—
—A Green candidate.
—A Green candidate. Sorry, you are absolutely right. It was someone called Crossley, who I think claims to have a PhD, so presumably she charged them for the exercise. She went around the world. So why would there be a need, in those circumstances, for any further work to be done by Green groups? They have crawled all over this exhaustively. Of course, Senator Brown—and once again it is cat out of the bag stuff—started off by congratulating Senator Cook, who is basically adding on an amendment to examine alternative tax systems and alternative revenue raising proposals.
If you could ever imagine a better way of having an endless, ongoing, post-millennium discussion about tax reform, that is probably the best way of doing it; so Senator Brown's congratulations make it clear where he stands. He then went on to criticise the Democrats for not having an open mind—having told us that, as far as he is concerned, the Greens are totally opposed to a GST. It is ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous; and Senator Harradine was perfectly correct in objecting not only to the flawed logic but to the systematic way in which Senator Brown tries to verbal people on a regular basis. It is just appalling, and I can well understand Senator Lees's howls of anguish on that front.
The important thing to remember is this: having gone to the election, having had 12 months notice and having this matter subjected to exhaustive examination, one of the things we are entitled to—just putting aside mandate theory for a moment—as Senator Harradine did say, is the right to bring legislation before the parliament. Senator Harradine is partially correct: we also have a right to have legislation considered and voted upon by the parliament within a reasonable period of time. The time that elapses from 3 October to 30 June, for example, is pretty close to nine 
 months. If a government duly elected in the face of trenchant opposition, with a high risk strategy and a very controversial tax proposal as the centrepiece of its campaign, cannot have that proposal voted on within a period of nine months, then there is something seriously wrong with the democratic process in this country.
What we say is that the starting point is that you should absolutely commit to ensuring that, one way or another, we do not run out of time—in other words, that we are able to be absolutely certain before we embark on any committee process that, at the end of the day, there will be a vote. I accept entirely that Senator Harradine has given the government no reason to believe that his vote before 30 June would make us any better off, but he has said that we have no reason to believe that the government would be better off having its legislation voted on before 30 June. I am as much concerned about our right to have it voted on—good or bad, yes or no—as simply about outcome, because even if we lose we have got a right to bring it back to a subsequent parliament, post 30 June. But our right surely is not to have the thing filibustered to a point where, 12 months down the track, after it being the centrepiece of our campaign, and all that flows from that, it cannot get through the parliament. Then you are making the process unworkable.
If you look at what we think is a much more critical element than simply which matters ought to be under consideration by the committees, Senator Harradine says that it has been cut back from seven committees to four and that he would rather have more. I am not averse to that, much and all as we would argue that you really only need one committee, a legislation committee that can do the job that the Senate charged legislation committees with—and that is considering legislation—and it could go over every aspect of these bills. But, accepting Senator Harradine's point that he wants particular emphasis in a range of important areas, every time you increase the number of committees, you are spreading the burden and therefore reducing the total time that the Senate itself needs before it reports back. It seems to me 
 there is a trade-off there. If you have more committees, you need less time in a chronological sense than you would otherwise. Of course, what is being proposed—
—That is very strange mathematics—very strange.
—I know that simple logic is normally beyond you, so I am not expecting you to agree with me; but I just want this to be understood. There are four major pieces of legislation that are very useful precedents in terms of the duration of committees. With the Telstra (No. 1) legislation, the committee was in existence for just under 15 weeks; with Telstra (No. 2), it was just under eight weeks; with workplace relations in 1996, it was 12 weeks; with the euthanasia debate, it was 16 weeks.
If you were to establish the committee today, then you would have something in the order of 16 weeks, if you went through until early March. So you would be pretty much breaking the record just by having that as a report date. If you accept the fact that you have got four committees meeting simultaneously in tandem, then you can effectively say you have got four times that. So you have got 16 months worth of committee process running.
Even if we accept that the GST is more significant than those other pieces of legislation—and that is in the eye of the beholder—it just seems to me to be totally out of proportion to suggest that somehow we should go on and on. Labor wants it to go on and on to the point where we never get to a vote.
What concerns us about the Democrats' time frame is that you get to the end of May and then you have to get an assessment of the separate references committees and then you have to get a government response. It is not difficult to envisage a situation in which some would claim that the government response was not adequate, that it did not amount to a response, and that, therefore, we still should not commence the debate. Time is running out, and it is almost inevitable in those circumstances that you simply would not get to a vote on this legislation. Just in passing, let me remind the Senate that we also have the budget legislation, Telstra and a range of 
 other matters that are certainly entitled to consideration during that same period of time.
 You would be left with maybe a couple of weeks in June to consider, debate and vote on what you regard as the most important legislation. I will give two examples of how easy it is to ensure that the debate could go on and on in this chamber. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 was debated in this chamber for nine weeks. The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 was debated in this chamber for 11 weeks.
I can well recall in the debate on the Telstra bill Senator Schacht, who was handling it for the opposition, being told time and again by his own colleagues to cut it short, and by his standards he probably did. He has a constitutional incapacity to say anything in a reasonable length of time. He is always wanting to add more and more but, by his standards perhaps, he was reasonably restrained.
—You should talk.
—I responded. I did not seek to extend the debate. All I am saying is that it is so easy to have these things go on and on. With the best will in the world, if Senator Harradine, the Greens and the Democrats all signed a pact under seal that they would not ask a single question during the committee process, there would be nothing to stop this mob doing it endlessly. If you can take 11 weeks on the Telstra legislation without really trying, just imagine how long it would take if you set your mind to it. In other words, your approach gives them carte blanche to ensure that this package of bills could not possibly be voted on before 30 June next year.
That is a travesty of justice. It is an outrage and an offence to the whole parliamentary process to think that the centrepiece of a government's election campaign—on which it had given formal notice 12 months before and which was, in some respects, a re-run of an exercise conducted five years ago, on which every interest group has had every opportunity over many months to look at the implications and to raise them during the campaign—should nonetheless mean that we are not entitled to have a vote within nine 
 months of that seminal election event. That is the nub of this whole debate.
Our starting point is that we do not see a need for more than one legislation committee. We accept the reality that there are enough people around here who take the view that there ought to be a committee process, and that is pretty commonplace in the Senate, so it is then a matter of how many and how long, and that is where we are at. If it is a question of a choice between those two, there is no doubt about what is of paramount importance to us. The ultimate critical event is that there is time available—not just, `We think that four weeks is good enough or eight weeks is good enough.'
It is crystal clear, if you look at those two precedents of workplace relations and Telstra, that even three months would be a risk, unless you nailed it down, unless you were able to give an absolute commitment that you would ensure that a vote occurred, not just at the 11th hour of the 11th day and not after the Senate had sat night and day for three months straight. You ought to allow a sufficient period of time.
If we took the end of February, which is sort of a mid point between what we formally have on the record and what we have had some discussion about, we would have four months. As I have pointed out, that would allow a committee process of about 15½ to 16 weeks, which is pretty close to the record period of time. You are multiplying that by four. You could extend that a bit if you liked but, at the end of the day, you must acknowledge that you need something like three months at least in order to ensure that not only this legislation but also budget legislation and other critical bills are given a fair chance. This legislation, in particular, should be given a guaranteed chance of being voted on otherwise the whole game is a charade.
If that is really what it is all about, that you effectively want to have the legislation delayed forever and a day, in the old days that would have been a failure to pass—and I think you would be getting perilously close to that situation. Labor make no bones about it. That is their position. Whether the Governor-General would take the same view of other 
 parties in the Senate would be a matter of judgment. But, given what I have said, I would be confident that, if you were to allow anything like only a month or two, it would be perfectly clear what the ultimate objective was if you did not have it surrounded by guarantees and if by one mechanism or another you did not commit to ensuring that a vote could occur—and there is absolutely no confidence that that could be the case based on the motions that have been put down to date.
Even a delay in establishing the committees today will effectively mean waiting another 10 days. There is no reason why that needs to occur. If we got the committees up and running today, we could call for submissions at the weekend. There are any number of people who would be ready to put in their submissions. In fact, Senator Cook pointed out that the Vos committee had 17 days and managed to attract 250 submissions. They did not have any difficulty in putting those submissions together in a very short space of time. All those submissions could be considered by the committees. We could have hearings in December, which is a month or more away in terms of an appropriate committee date, and we could start to make some real progress on hearings.
Of course you do not need to hear from every submittee. We all know that there will be many individual submissions. There will be an orchestrated campaign run by the trade union movement with its usual unlimited resources to run political campaigns on these matters. There will be hundreds of submissions about the inequities and the perfidiousness of the proposal in terms of its impact on the trade union movement. I think you would need deal with that only in a very short form because it will be utterly repetitious. So a lot of the submissions can be boiled down to critical areas. By allocating them out to various committees, you are able to make very significant progress.
You could have five or six weeks of hearings set aside, even to the point of forgoing debate in the Senate. In other words, the Senate would not sit for the periods for which we had otherwise scheduled sittings in Feb 
 ruary to enable the committees to have top priority. So we are bending over backwards. I make the point again that all these dates that have been put down have been irrespective of the sitting pattern; in other words, they have been ambit claims effectively because they have not looked at what time might be available. Once we take a decision to forgo some weeks of sittings, we make it that much easier for the committees to get on with their work. There is goodwill on our side. We are prepared to be reasonable, but it has to be on the basis that at the end of the day there is more than adequate time available to ensure proper debate and consideration and a vote on this legislation without prejudice to budget legislation and other critical bills.
There is no doubt that there would be a high-powered secretariat established. There would probably need to be a number of them so the whole committee process will be brought to bear on this exercise. I would have thought that even most of the non-profit organisations and other charities to which Senator Lees refers would have organised their arguments well before this point in time, certainly since 3 October. Clearly you will need to look at particular elements of the legislation as we always do, but at the end of the day most of this discussion is not about the fine print, the detail. As far as Labor is concerned, as Senator Conroy obligingly told us, it is about an unfair tax proposal. So we know the extent to which detail will be considered by the Labor Party and no doubt the Greens, who are implacably opposed to the package.
So there will be ample opportunity. I think it is reasonable to expect people to be working on these matters in December; after all, this parliament has sat until as late as 23 December in years gone by. We have just had a month or more off after the election. The public does expect us to be prepared to work during January. To set a closing date for submissions that is so far out that it just happens to coincidently ensure that everyone is able to have a good six, eight, nine weeks holiday just after you have had a month off and been back in the parliament for two days 
 I think will be very poorly received by the community at large.
So if we are all fair dinkum, there are ways in which you can ensure that justice is met and that every opportunity is available, but at the end of the day there is a sufficient period of time in order to enable this legislation to be voted on. That is our bottom line. We are not prepared to countenance what is essentially a charade of saying, `The last week in May and then further consideration by the committees and then awaiting a response from the government and then, presumably, a response from others.' There is no guarantee of anything in any of that.
It would be a very simple matter for a majority of votes in this parliament to ensure that the debate never got under way. As we all know, every vote is critical. You need only an equality of votes to block the passage of legislation or the continuation debate. Without those sorts of guarantees then it seems to me you are simply embarking on an exercise which everyone can predict will result in no GST tax reform package being properly considered, supported or voted down by the end of June next year. Whether or not you think that is a critical date, just ask yourselves: is nine months after an election a reasonable period in which a government should be entitled to expect that the centrepiece of its campaign will be considered by both houses of parliament?",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-11-12,"—I am sure the Senate will be pleased to hear that I do not intend to take much of its time. I have a couple of things. Firstly, I was very pleased to hear Senator Brown say that he does not want to misrepresent what the Democrats say. That will make a really delightful change for all of us and I look forward to it.
Secondly, the government seems to be particularly concerned about a government response being required as part of Senator Lees's amendment to this motion before the bills can be considered. I am sure the current government remembers that in June 1996 it committed itself to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation. I have got the 
 list here of all the government responses to committee reports for the first half of this year and there have been only two since then. Ignoring the two responses since then, which I will not mention, there were 31 responses received, one of them was within the three-month response time which the government has committed itself to—and that was two months and two weeks—30 of those 31 took more than three months, 28 took more than six months, 16 took more than a year, five took more than two years and two took more than three years.
One particularly interesting response is the final response to Off the record: shield laws for journalists' confidential sources, a report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Senate Standing Committee. I did not remember this one, which is really no surprise because the final government response to that has not been received yet and the report was tabled on 10 October 1994. So it is so far more than four years out of date and we still have not had a final response to that one.
So the government does not really have its act together on government responses. I understand that the relevant government departments get those responses together well and truly within the three months in general, but the ministers do not seem to be able to sign off on them within those three months. It would be very good practice for the government to have a government response ready to go within three months after the committees have reported. I am sure that this would not be a great difficulty for the government because there are several people within Treasury and Finance who are very au fait with this legislation and who could quite easily monitor what is going on in the committees because they will have several officers who will be covering absolutely everything that is going on in those committees. They will be able to draft responses for the government as we go along.
We should keep in mind that there are three response times in Senator Lees's amendment as well. This would not be a hardship on the government. In fact, it would be extremely good practice for the government. By the end of it, perhaps it would be able to get a final 
 report together for the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report which is more than four years old.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-12,"—I do not know how many senators in this chamber or people in the community watched a drama series recently on the rise of fascism in Britain which portrayed the rise of the influence of Moseley in Britain. One thing I do recall from that drama series was that, when Moseley was on the hustings at one particular point, he said, `I don't know who will win this election, but the one thing I hope is that whoever wins is given the right to govern.' I would have to say that that is probably very indicative of what is happening with parliamentary democracy in Australia. There is an assumption—I would say very close to a fascist assumption—that, somehow or other, the way executive government and party politics in Australia has developed means that the electorate, the community, the public and the parliament lose all ability to have a say once one party crawls over the line in any way, shape or form.
That is not the way the constitution of Australia is written. The way the constitution of Australia is written is that we are all charged as parliamentary representatives to represent our electorates. We are all charged to represent our principles, and obviously those principles we have represented to our electorate. The right to govern was never in the Australian constitution, never has been and is not in the Australian constitution. The right to form a government is there, but it is basically about good governance. It is not about autocracy. It is not about winner takes all. It is not about abusing the democratic process. That is what I believe is happening in this whole debate.
Although we have heard Senator Alston say in his contributions on several occasions that the coalition—he says the coalition, but you would have to say the Liberal Party, and it was not even a full coalition, as we well know—went to the people with the GST as their centrepiece, you might be excused for saying that that was the only policy that they went to the people with. However, they are going to come in again and again every time 
 the Senate wishes to represent the views of the community, the views of the electorate, and say, `We have a mandate for this, that and the other.'
Remember that any time the Senate wished to review or amend any piece of legislation before the last election they spat the dummy. They said, `We are the government. We have the right to govern. We have a mandate.' So it does not really matter. They went with one aspect to the election. The opposition went with the opposite, but we have this concept that whatever executive government want they have the right to demand, whether or not it is what the Australian people want, whether or not it is good for the Australian people, and whether or not we even know what it is. The answer is that we do not. We have not seen the legislation. It has not been presented to the House of Representatives. The legislation does not exist.
We are being told that we are being outrageous for asking for full public scrutiny for legislation that does not even exist—not just in the Senate but in the House of Representatives. We have a committee still looking to see what health is, what education is, how you define where the limits are and how you can do this in a way that can be imposed by law or regulation. We do not even know what the legislation looks like yet.
Senator Alston also said that every interest group has had every opportunity over many months. As I say, we have not seen the legislation. What a load of nonsense! That could not be further from the truth. The firm position of the Greens (WA) is and was that the government has got it the wrong way around. If they want tax reform, then get groups in the community, interest groups and people with knowledge and acumen together to form the basis of a tax reform to get the interest groups and the community's involvement at the earliest possible stage. But that is not what the government did. They said, `We know it all. We've got an idea and we are going to put it to you, all or nothing.'
If you recall, before the election the Prime Minister said again and again and again that tax reform was not spelt G-S-T. He and the government said on many occasions, includ 
 ing in this chamber, that you cannot and should not consider that the GST is the whole package. They said that you cannot look at a GST without looking at the package of what business tax is doing and what income tax is doing. What we are being asked to do—what the government is insisting on—is to vote on and consider the GST without the business tax package, without the income tax package. They have already gone back on their very basic, most important claim that you cannot consider the GST outside the context of business tax changes and income tax.
So here we go, already. Yes, we are going to deal with a GST and we are going to isolate it out from the business tax. How can we look at fairness? How can we look at workability? How can we look at equity issues and the impact on employment and the impact on regions without looking at what the business community have literally been given months to look at—that is, their own tax proposals? They have been given, because it is going to take them such a long time, an extension. So they cannot do it by May. They have to do it after we look at it in the Senate.
 This is an outrage. The government are saying that tax reform for them does equal a GST. They want to take a reductionist approach, and they want to use this as a means of abusing the Senate—and I do mean abusing the Senate. I do not know how long it will take, and I do not know what mechanism the government will use, but I think the rhetoric has been there for the last few months—obstructive Senate, abuse of power. I think very soon the government, and potentially the opposition, will move to get rid of the influence of the minor parties in the Senate, to get rid of the voice of the community, to get rid of the voting system that allows the community—industry, small business, regional Australia, local government, farming groups, community interest groups, environment groups, you name it—to have a say within our democratic process. I believe that we will see some move within a relatively short time.
Today we have already heard Senator Alston talk of double dissolution triggers. The last contribution but one was about setting up 
 potential double dissolution triggers. If the government is going to spit the dummy to that extent—`we want everything we want, despite the fact that the majority of the people of Australia voted for parties that opposed a GST, or we will threaten to go to another election'—I wonder what kind of anti-small party package might be included in any such move. I wonder what collusion there could be in bringing about the changes we have seen in Tasmania.
I wonder where the changes will be and when they will try to stop the community from having a say through the democratic process and through the ability of small parties in the Senate to speak outside the shackles of party discipline. That is the travesty we are seeing today. The flawed concept of mandate, as Mr Howard very rightly put it a few years ago, is the flawed concept of parties voting as one vote outside any concept of representing their electorate, outside any concept of representing the community and outside any concept of the fact that in the parliament we are presented with little bits of information by little bits of information. We can never know all there is to know about the legislation if the legislation has not been presented, and it has not.
How many times have we seen proposals put to the electorate, put to the parliament, and they have changed significantly from when they have been proposed to when we are asked to vote on them? How many times have we seen elements put into legislation that are thoroughly distasteful and odious? Quite frankly, we have seen it on many occasions. When the Labor Party were in government they did the same—omnibus packages of legislation. The coalition have done it on several occasions.
We have not seen the legislation. We do not know what is going to be in it. Even if the vast majority of the community were relaxed and comfortable about the idea of a GST—and, quite frankly, that is clearly and provably not true—we would all be wondering how it would work. We would all be wondering how the details of the legislation and the details of the regulation would lead to an outcome. We would all be wondering how it would be 
 implemented. We would all be wondering how the safeguards would be implemented. We would all be wondering what the compensation packages would do in reality. We would all be wondering what real people would suffer. We would all be wondering what the impact would be on small businesses and other communities.
This debate is about the tax package. Do you know what I find is the most extraordinary thing about this whole debate? Here we debating the GST as if it were the most important thing in the Australian parliament. Obviously, I believe it should have proper scrutiny. Senator Harradine talked about a vote that took place in the Queensland parliament last night. There was more than one vote in the Queensland parliament last night. There was, I believe, a unanimous vote—all parties and independents—in the Queensland parliament for changes to the national competition policy.
The Australian community is not only worried about the impact of a major tax change but also worried about the real impact that the national competition policy is having on a daily and weekly basis on their mode of operation, their continued programs, and their ability to operate. This area got almost no debate in this parliament, except for those people representing minor parties and Independents. There was collusion between the two old parties, and a decision was made which is only now beginning to hit the Australian community as to the wide ranging and future implications. The Queensland parliament voted unanimously that the national competition policy had to be changed.
I want to know where this debate was during the election campaign. If we are going to talk about mandates, who ever put the concept of national competition policy to the Australian electorate? Who ever put the concept of global free trade to an Australian electorate? On a daily basis, these are the issues that are having a comprehensive and sometimes devastating impact on just about everyone in the Australian community—rural community, regional community, local government, industry, health, education, you name it.
Where is the debate? Where is the outrage from the opposition side? Where was the debate during the election campaign? Where was the so-called mandate, if you ever agreed with the concept of mandate? Where was the moral or electoral authority to devastate the whole way the Australian community operates and hand power to big business? Where was that mandate? Where was that authority? It did not exist. It did not exist then and it does not exist now.
Here we are talking about a major tax issue—and I agree it is a major tax debate, which has wide ranging implications—yet major changes affecting the Australian community were really not debated at all. I was abused at the time for even suggesting amendments to the national competition policy. Changes were made within this chamber and almost no amendments were agreed to in the national interest, the public interest. It is a nonsense that has been perpetrated on the Australian public.
We have to put this whole debate within the context of what is really happening in the Australian community. The context is that democracy in Australia has reached a very low point. It has reached the point where the real issues and implications for the Australian people are ignored. The big issues are not even debated between the major parties. Issues like global free trade and the Multilateral Agreement on Investment are passed by on an ongoing basis. Therefore, we get a sham argument; a sham debate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-11-12,"—Firstly, I signal to the Labor Party that the Democrats accept Senator Cook's amendment to our amendment, and from the point of view of formality, we should record that. I wish to speak only briefly, because most of the points that need to be made have been made.
The government is quite right, in that an election did return the government. But an election has two functions: not only to return the government, in which there are realistically only three parties competing—the National Party and Liberal Party in coalition and the Labor Party—but to return the parliament. In returning the parliament, there are dozens of 
 parties and independents competing and the parliament reflects the totality of that contest.
Those two sets of people returned have two entirely different jobs. The government and executive have the job of putting forward their agenda and proposals, and the parliament has the job of reviewing and amending those proposals. Unfortunately, in the lower house they do not have the numbers to do that, but if Labor did have the numbers to do that, the legislation which reached this Senate would be in an entirely different form to that which reaches here at present. The job primarily falls on the Senate to do that review and amendment job.
The government needs to accept that, whilst the end of this process may be a package on their tax system which is not entirely acceptable to them, it will result in a package which is a lot more acceptable to the Australian people.
Of course, the will of the people as expressed on 3 October will be delayed before its full expression on 1 July. But we recognise, as does everybody else here, that we still have to get on with the job and deal with what is before us. In a sense, we have to put that consideration aside.
One of the matters raised is the issue of a tax system versus a tax. The Labor Party quite rightly contested the election on the primary ground of the government, which was on the GST. We all know that the GST is but one component—and an important component—of an entirely new tax system. This Senate review process, which the Labor Party, ourselves, other minor parties and independents agreed with—and which was belatedly joined by the government—is designed to look at the new tax system, not just the GST.
The Australian Democrats will approach this review process on this basis. When the review is completed and when the amendments go through to the legislation that will be before us, we will then make a decision in terms of the totality of that package as to whether we vote for or against the government's total package as amended.
We expect that within the legislation discussion there will be shifting alliances of govern 
 ment, minor parties, independents and Labor, depending on the issue that is before them. I do not know yet where Labor will stand on the final income tax cuts that go through, on the diesel and other excise issues or on the poverty trap issues. And quite rightly so, because they have not seen the legislation and have not had the opportunity to have the detail of those things put before them. Their views may well coincide on some matters with the government's and on other matters they may not. We do know that Labor is utterly opposed to the GST and that is a legitimate position, but they might have a cooperative view with the government on other matters within the tax proposal.
To vilify Labor in this debate as being automatically obstructionist, automatically opposed and not acting in the national interest is quite wrong. They have legitimately said, `Let us look at the entire tax proposal. You know our views on some core issues, but we do want to be able to contribute to the total approach and review.' Indeed, that is our approach as well.
I am distressed that the government has arrived at consideration of the Senate committee at such a late stage. I will contrast the attitude of the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer with those of another minister who, on the Monday after election—Monday, 6 October—rang me about his program and said, `Look, I know you are opposed on a number of these things, but it falls into your portfolio area. Would you discuss with me what is to come up?' Neither I nor my leader, as far as I am aware—but certainly not I, as the taxation spokesperson—was ever rung or contacted by any government figure to say, `Let us discuss the possibility of a Senate committee.'
You might certainly be opposed to a Senate committee, but if you know the numbers in the Senate, you would certainly have up your sleeve that if there is going to be one, you would try to influence the shape of it. It was not until we put out our terms of reference two days ago that the government finally came to talk to us.
Now I would suggest that is the wrong way to approach the Senate and to approach the 
 realities of the numbers. Labor had clearly signalled they wanted a review and so had every other participant. We think a review is desirable. I would hope that, as this process develops, the government with regard to the tax issues will become far more forthcoming and cooperative in terms of dealing with the committees that are going to handle this matter.
I would stress that the Democrats began the process of development of their recommendations weeks and weeks ago, and we have consulted widely to do so. We are particularly grateful for the input and contribution from Senator Harradine. We were aware of the needs of the Greens and Labor, and that has been very helpful. But up until two days ago, as far as we were concerned, the government's position on the Senate inquiry was none—not at all—and they were not interested. So, of course, we did not talk to them. I regret we have now got to this stage where the easy resolution of this matter has been forced to a considerable debate.
With regard to the length of time that is to be taken, I would remind the Senate that the government itself took 14 months to arrive at its new tax system. We know that with other inquiries, as Senator Bourne has outlined, they take a great deal of time. We do not consider six months as a lengthy time to address a new tax system.
The final point I would make with regard to this tax review that we are discussing is I believe that the result of this will be, to some extent, similar to the result of the industry reference review, and that is that process of careful examination of a very thorny area of policy resulted in a great contribution to ourselves, to Labor, to the government's view of where they should be going in terms of industry policy.
We do not hold the view that the government have all the answers on tax. We are hopeful that Labor as the alternative government in opposition will use this process to flesh out and develop their own theories and policies on tax as well as using it as a mechanism to respond to the government's view, because you, like us and like them, are as 
 interested in this tax system as is the whole of Australia.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-12,"—If I can speak in reply to this very important debate on the nature of the Senate committee inquiry that this chamber may determine and I suppose the more fundamental issue of whether this particular matter is of such significance that a Senate committee is warranted. We have before the chair the proposal that I have moved on behalf of the opposition, which I have already commended to the Senate and, I hope, argued persuasively is indeed the best way for this particular chamber to proceed.
 We also have before us now an amendment moved to this proposal by Senator Lees. In essence, Senator Lees is proposing now an overarching inquiry by the Senate Economics References Committee, which will deal first with an examination of the assumptions and modelling behind the government's tax proposals. Then that initial inquiry by the Senate Economics References Committee will inform four separate, more focused, specialist inquiries conducted by four of the Senate references committees—the Community Affairs References Committee; the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee; the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee; and also the Economics References Committee itself.
 Under Senator Lees's new proposal, the plan is that reports from those four references committees will again, if you like, inform the third phase of the Senate Economic References Committee's work. The proposal is that that particular references committee complete its work by reporting by the last Thursday in May. To that particular amendment from Senator Lees, Senator Cook has moved an amendment on behalf of the opposition, which again I commend to the chamber, to make a very significant improvement to those terms of reference that are before the chamber via Senator Lees's amendment to my substantive proposition. 
So the time has come for the Senate to make a decision about the nature of the committee inquiry it will conduct, if, in fact, it sees and deems fit to conduct any committee inquiry at all. The government has made its position clear: it does not want scrutiny; it does not want a parliamentary committee inquiry into this issue. I do not think Australians can trust Mr Howard and Mr Costello on this issue. You cannot trust them on their intentions. We have had a recent injection of Mr Costello into this particular debate. I noticed that poor old Mr Costello, the Treasurer, has been unfavourably compared to—of all people—Mr Reith because of his lack of negotiating skills for the government in relation to the Senate. What an indictment of Mr Costello to be unfavourably compared to Mr Reith. But, as I said earlier, Mr Costello has to remember this: this is not a threat—
—Who was the negotiation on workplace relations with? Senator Kernot. Where is she now?
—As far as I know, Senator Harradine, I am very pleased to say she is the member for Dickson in the House of Representatives. That is exactly where she is, and every Labor senator is delighted to see that former Senator Kernot was elected.
I think Senator Harradine understands because this is the view that Senator Harradine himself has put so strongly in the public debate over the last couple of days. The message does not seem to have sunk in to Mr Costello and the government. This is what Senator Harradine and others are saying, and Mr Costello perhaps should remember it: no proper inquiry; no GST. That is your message, Senator Harradine—who interjects in the chamber.
Mr Howard says that his so-called reform is a great tax adventure and the greatest economic reform of his whole time in politics. But Mr Howard is trying to force, using the vote of Senator Colston, some form of shotgun inquiry. That is a mechanism, of course, to deal with as little of the substance of the government's intentions as possible. The opposition will not sign up to a Howard-Colston shotgun inquiry. You cannot trust this government on this issue. You cannot trust a 
 government trying to shoehorn an issue as important as this through the Senate with no appropriate level of Senate scrutiny and investigation. We say that a Senate committee inquiry has to be broad ranging, it has to be thorough and it has to be conducted at a higher level. That is why we believe our proposal before the chair is the best way of achieving that outcome. Of course, if the government was fair dinkum about decent reform, it would also endorse and support a broad ranging inquiry, but it is not.
I want to debunk Mr Costello's fundamental argument—parroted in here again by his liegeman, Senator Alston, during the debate—that there is no point in having a Senate inquiry because the Labor Party has made up its mind on the issue of the GST. You have to have a memory in this business. You have to remember what others do. I recall that in 1994 Mr Costello, a member of the then Liberal-National Party opposition, had responsibility for the Labor government's employee share ownership legislation. I want to remind the Senate and coalition senators what Mr Costello said at that time. Let me quote this to the Senate. Mr Costello said:
We are going to vote against the Government's proposal to extend fringe benefits tax to employee ownership schemes. We will defeat it in the Senate and we will initiate a Senate inquiry to have a look at the whole matter . . . 
That was Mr Costello's approach on that legislation at that time, and he has the hide to turn up here to this debate and hypocritically argue that the Labor Party should not support an inquiry if we intend to vote against the legislation.
But, of course, there has been another development in the Senate today that will possibly have an impact on the votes on the motion and the amendments that are now before the chair, and I think it is worth placing this on the public record. In this chamber this morning for the first time since March 1997, the government has accepted the tainted vote of Senator Colston. As a result, the balance of votes in the Senate has been changed quite drastically.
This morning, the Senate dealt with two motions which were determined and negatived 
 on the vote of Senator Colston voting with the government. The first motion was one standing in the name of my colleague Senator Bolkus for the production of documents on the approvals process for the Jabiluka mine and Jabiluka mill alternative—I think most senators would agree that this was a very important question before the chair. That was negatived because the votes were equal, with Senator Colston voting with the government. A motion standing in the name of Senator Margetts, proposing an order for the production of documents by Senator Kemp relating to an interim report by the Ralph review, was also negatived as a result of an equal vote in the Senate this morning.
This is the first time since March 1997 that the government has accepted Senator Colston's tainted vote. We now face a Howard-Colston axis on matters of public policy. Mr Howard and Senator Colston are joined at the hip. Do not forget that, in April last year, Mr Howard was finally forced to cut Senator Colston loose when he said:
Now what we have done has been measured, responsible, correct. What I am announcing this morning is a very, very clear measure to the people of Australia that, until this matter is cleared up, we are not going to accept Senator Colston's vote.
He said he would not accept that tainted vote until the issues, the charges, relating to Senator Colston were resolved. They have not been resolved. Mr Howard did not canvass this issue at any time during or before the federal election. He made this announcement at the commencement of the new parliament. As I say, this is an outrageous decision, a decision that smacks of nothing but political opportunism from the Prime Minister.
His original decision to reject Senator Colston's vote had nothing to do with the principle of the presumption of innocence and his backflip on that matter has absolutely nothing to do with the principle of the presumption of innocence either. Mr Howard made clear when he made his statement in 1997 that, in relation to Senator Colston's vote—when he was forced into that position by public and parliamentary pressure from the Labor Party—it was a matter of asserting higher standards. Of course, now those higher standards have evaporated on the third day of 
 the sitting of this new parliament—the third day of the sitting of parliament in Mr Howard's second term.
Mr Acting Deputy President, I cannot say what the likely fate is of either of the two amendments or the substantive motion that stands in my name, as a result of the decision by Mr Howard to accept the tainted vote of Senator Colston. I can acknowledge that the Australian Democrats, the Greens senators and Senator Harradine have worked hard to try and reach an acceptable compromise position in relation to the process that a GST inquiry would follow. It is not our preferred position—the amendment that Senator Lees moves is not the preferred position of the opposition. Our position, as you know and as I have outlined before, is for a cleaner, better sort of inquiry that is wide-ranging in its effect and would lead to a better outcome. But we, along with others, have worked hard to try and reach an acceptable compromise in relation to the nature of the Senate inquiry to deal with this very important issue.
As far as the opposition is concerned, we have moved from our position of having one references committee. We would have preferred a select committee in the first instance, for the reasons I outlined previously, but we have moved from one references committee that would have carefully, closely and thoroughly examined this issue to now the amendment before the chair where four references committees will be involved. But, importantly, there will be an overarching role and responsibility for the Economics References Committee, which is something that the Labor Party does welcome. The government itself argued for no inquiry, and then came and laid on the table yesterday a proposal for three inquiries. And I know the Democrats preferred seven references committees and another committee—a total of eight committees—and have come back to four references committees looking at this particular issue.
So there has been compromise around the chamber. What we cannot say, as a result of that compromise, is that the proposal that stands in Senator Lees's name will necessarily be accepted by the chamber. Of course, if other non-government senators see fit to 
 support this particular position, then quite clearly this can be sunk by the votes of the government and Senator Colston. Even if all the other non-government senators combine, the Howard-Colston axis can sink this inquiry. As I said, it is quite clear from voting patterns in the Senate today that Mr Howard and Senator Colston are joined at the hip.
We believe Senator Colston's vote should not be accepted by the government. We believe that Mr Howard should have maintained the position he was forced to accept in early 1997. We believe that if there was to be a change, Mr Howard should have been honest enough to announce it, either before or during the election campaign, so Australians might have taken that into their consideration as they cast their vote for the House of Representatives and Senate on 3 October. Of course he did not because Mr Howard is not serious about asserting parliamentary standards.
The Labor Party is serious about having the best possible inquiry into the GST proposals of the government. We are serious about a thorough and high-level inquiry. But we are also serious about ensuring that we work towards trying to achieve a consensus position as we know our preferred position will not be accepted by a majority of senators in the chamber. It is for those reasons that the opposition will support the amendment that stands in Senator Lees's name with, of course, the amendment that has been proposed by Senator Cook. I commend Senator Cook's amendment to the chamber.

Let me give some background to the proposal for a Senate inquiry that stands in my name on behalf of the opposition before the chamber today. Mr Howard as Prime Minister has been an abject failure when it comes to being frank and up-front about his intentions with the tax system. It is worth remembering in the context of this debate that in December 1995 Mr Howard said on Newcastle radio, in reference to the goods and services tax:
No, it's not on the agenda—full stop, just not there, vamoose, kaput.
They were Mr Howard's words. A year and a half later, in mid-1997, Mr Howard, who had become a born again tax visionary, was on the AM  radio program, but with a very changed tune. He said:
I want to share this great adventure with the Australian people. I want to share with the Australian people the task and the challenge. 

`The great tax adventure', to use his words, which he wanted to `share' with the Australian people, then became even more exciting, even more all encompassing. In March of this year, in a breathless speech he made to the Liberal convention in Brisbane, he said:
It will be historic and significant beyond the experience of any other economic reform that has been undertaken in the time I have been in politics.
Look at the status. It went from `kaput' and `vamoose' to the most `historic' and `significant' economic reform since Mr Howard's first participation in politics. That is quite a substantial shift in rhetoric. I think everyone would have to acknowledge that that is a significant change. That is why the Australian people, this parliament and the Senate should never take Mr Howard's statements about tax reform at face value. It is why whatever Mr Howard and the government say about tax should be taken with a huge grain of salt. It is why this parliament, but particularly the Senate, should look behind the intentions of what the government is up to. You cannot take Mr Howard at his word.
There is a need for a high level, thorough and comprehensive Senate inquiry into the government's tax proposals. The Australian people would expect the opposition, they would expect the Labor Party, to propose a thorough inquiry into all aspects of the most significant economic shift since the mid-1960s—the complete rewriting of the tax system.
Mr Howard released his tax package with great fanfare and enormous expenditure of taxpayers' money, public money. But immediately that was done, he attracted a great deal of criticism regarding the unfairness of the rebates and the inadequacy of the compensation measures. Australians were bombarded with scales of tax rebates. We had visions of smiling families—who can forget them?—through the government advertising campaign. But the government's level of debate when asked serious questions was found wanting.
I want to remind the Senate of what the Deputy Prime Minister of this country said on the Face to Face program on 17 August this year. Mr Fischer was asked the following 
 question by Glenn Milne—and I would ask senators to concentrate on this:
How can a package that gives a single income person on seventy-five thousand dollars a year an eighty-six dollars a week tax cut, and someone on twenty thousand dollars a year a ten dollar a week tax cut, be described as fair?
That is the question; quite a reasonable one from Mr Milne. You know what Mr Fischer's reply was—his usual judicious, informed and thoughtful reply? This was what Mr Fischer said:
Well, I don't believe in communism.
That was his response. This is the standard of the public debate that Mr Howard talks about. We have from Mr Fischer, `Well, I don't believe in communism.' There is a bit of a gap here in Mr Howard's credibility. He had a $17 million tax advertising promotion campaign, probably the most significant, extensive and historic rort in Australian political history, certainly in federal politics. That campaign played down the goods and services tax. It promoted reform to the tax system—a fairer tax system, et cetera—but played down the GST. The GST was hidden in a publicly funded soft sell about tax rebates for Australian families. It was so one sided in its political message that it fell over. Do not forget that was an unprecedented expenditure of public money—
—Order! There is far too much audible noise and there are too many meetings taking place in the chamber. Could senators please give their attention to Senator Faulkner.
—Thank you for that deliberate and very partisan intervention, Mr Acting Deputy President. We had a five-week election campaign. The Prime Minister talks about a seven-week election campaign, because in those two weeks prior to the formal five weeks of the campaign over $17 million of public money was spent on advertising. Election campaigns are probably not the most conducive times for the most rigorous analysis of a most historic and significant reform. At times in election campaigns even rhetoric tends to get in the way of fact. So the government's claim that this was where the 
 nuts and the bolts of their tax package was thrashed out is laughable. To suggest that it was thrashed out as part of the public debate the government knows is an absurd claim.
There is no doubt that this tax package is deeply flawed. It is deeply unfair. It is not an adventure at all for ordinary Australians; it is a nightmare. For the poor, the sick, the disadvantaged, the people struggling to get educated, those looking for jobs, the normal small business people with moderate earnings, the families who earn less than $50,000 a year, the pensioners and the self-funded retirees, this tax proposal is a nightmare. These are the very people Mr Howard and his government have no care and concern for whatsoever. That is why we say there is a necessity for a Senate inquiry, and that inquiry has to be thorough. It has to expose the unfairness of the government's proposals, and we need to take the responsibility here, which Mr Howard will not take, to protect Australians who are less well off.
The motion that I moved today on behalf of the opposition will ensure a thorough going and wide ranging inquiry into the government's proposals. It will cover such matters as the government's modelling and assumptions. It will cover the effects on low and middle income families. It will cover the impact on employment, inflation, interest rates and investments, and the adequacy of measures to prevent the GST from rising above 10 per cent. It will also cover the issue of ensuring that consumers benefit fully from the abolition of existing taxes.
It is well known that the Labor Party's preference was for a Senate select committee. That was our initial preference. We believed and we still believe that this would be the most practical and the most effective way to conduct this particular inquiry. A select committee facilitates appropriate representation of all parties. Under our proposal we asked only that the opposition have a third of the representation. It would enable all minor parties, Independents and major parties in the Senate to be represented. It would have explicit powers to call and examine witnesses and documents. It would be appropriately resourced, and it would have the capacity to 
 hold hearings outside Canberra if and when required.
In the opposition's proposal we wanted to be flexible about timing. We said the committee should report before the end of June, and in discussions we have had with minor parties and Independent senators we have indicated quite clearly that we were flexible about that issue. A select committee has the capacity to draw together the traditional functions and responsibilities of legislation committees and references committees. It has that advantage.
Let me stress that our overriding objective here is and always has been to achieve a thorough parliamentary scrutiny, and that has been what this government has been trying to avoid from day one. Let us not lose sight of the fact that this, again, according to the Prime Minister, is such a historic and significant reform. What would it say for the role of parliament in our system of government if parliament were to have no role in scrutinising such—in the words of the Prime Minister—a significant reform? What would it say for the role of the Senate in the federal system of government if the Senate were to have no role in reviewing such a reform? What would it say for the impact and the effects on so many people in our society in this country if parliament did not take seriously its responsibility for a thorough and high level inquiry?
This proposal will have far-reaching consequences on all segments of our society, on everyone in this country, and the government does not want to afford anyone the opportunity of having a real say—but we will insist they get that opportunity. We will ensure, or try to ensure, that people do have the possibility of seeing this chamber of the federal parliament seriously address these issues. We are determined to try to use the processes of the parliament, and in particular the processes of this chamber, to that end.
We have never been wedded to a particular approach, a particular blueprint for achieving what we think is the necessary scrutiny of the proposals which the government has before the parliament. As I have said, we maintain that a select committee is the most sensible and manageable way to go. But we have had 
 discussions with other parties in the Senate, and I have to say that we have come to accept that our proposal for a single select committee does not have the necessary level of support.
So we have modified our original proposal in the terms that are now before the chamber. That has been done in the spirit of trying to ensure that we maximise the prospects of consensus among non-government senators in this chamber. Instead of a select committee, we are now proposing to refer the government's new tax system to the Economic References Committee. We accept the view that that particular committee does have the advantage of having been already constituted, obviously, and it is also resourced by the Senate for this type of inquiry. In addition, we have taken on board in our proposed terms of reference many of the areas of concern which have been highlighted by the Democrats and Greens—areas such as impacts on the environment, remote communities and small business, implications for the delivery of Commonwealth services and local government, and alternative taxation measures available to government.
We acknowledge, as I have said, that our preferred reporting date of on or before 30 June might have been construed by some as being beyond the time frame desired by a majority of senators. Accordingly, again in the interests of encouraging a consensus among non-government senators, we have nominated a reporting date of the last sitting day in May.
We also acknowledge that the Democrats and Senator Harradine want to make more use, a fuller use, of the existing committee system, as I have said. But we do not believe that the Democrat proposal is manageable. We do not believe it would produce as coherent and comprehensive an inquiry as the one that the opposition proposes. Our final clause in the motion before you states:
That, in the event that matters related to these terms of reference are referred to other References Committees, the Economics References Committee shall take into account the reports of any such committees in completing its own report on this reference.  

We believe that does cover other interests. Engaged on this task, you now have the government already proposing two, albeit limited, references committee hearings and the Democrats proposing at least seven references committees.
We say there is a need for a single body, whatever that body may be, to encompass, bring together all the various pieces of the government's mosaic. It does not make sense to us to have individual committees beavering away at individual pieces of the mosaic in isolation from other committees. So, in our view, this is a job for one committee. I have no idea why the government does not see fit to support this proposal, why an appropriately constituted, appropriately staffed and resourced single committee cannot do this job effectively in the best interests of the parliament and the public.
We also believe there is a chance that the Democrats's proposal really will turn into a logistical nightmare. How will seven separate references committees cope with running simultaneous inquiries into references which are inextricably interrelated? It is not possible to separate neatly all the various impacts and implications of the government's proposals.
There are many professional organisations, community groups and individual citizens who will be wanting to put their views to a number of committees who may well be sitting simultaneously in different parts of the country. Will the government put under this proposal eight different submissions to the eight different proposals? I do not think the government has thought any of this through. And what will happen to the other inquiries that references committees are undertaking? We do not think it proper that those simply be shoved to the back of the queue to accommodate the government's—what was once a never-ever, but now pressingly urgent—GST proposal.
I have to say that there are also implications for the resources of the legislation committees which, as senators know, share secretariat resources with the references committee. We are concerned that this has the potential to bog down the whole Senate committee system, with committees travelling everywhere 
 and hugely drawing on the Senate committee budget.
For those reasons, we do not support the Democrats's proposal. We think there are substantive reasons, but we have talked about these differences at length with Senator Lees and Senator Murray and others on behalf of the Democrats. But, as for the government's proposals, they are entirely half-baked, as senators know. They are really a belated attempt to define a lowest common denominator here. They are confined to impacts on just food, health and education; they ignore a huge range of other impacts and issues of concern to millions of Australians. And they are shoehorned, just like the Vos committee, into an impossibly tight and unrealistic time frame.
I have never been really able to understand why Mr Costello does not understand what I believe is the bottom line politics of this. Mr Costello should understand: no parliamentary inquiry—no GST. Of course, all these propositions might go down because the government has taken a new approach to the tainted vote of Senator Colston, but we believe a comprehensive multifaceted reference to the Economics References Committee is the way to go. That will best ensure that the Senate's, the parliament's, and the public's  wished are adhered to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>References</title>,Committees,12,2
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-11-12,"—I wish to begin by speaking about process. As we have seen over the last few days, three different terms of reference were put on the table—one by the opposition, one by the Democrats and one by the government. I think everybody in this place except the government rejected the government's terms of reference as completely inadequate and little better than what the Vos committee is doing already. Indeed, their use of the Senate legislation committee is an automatic process that we cannot stop if they still want to go ahead with it later.
Obviously, there are a few facts in this place that we have to acknowledge. We felt that we should try to get some consensus. The first thing we have to acknowledge is that nobody has the numbers—something that the House of Representatives members do not 
 quite seem to have grasped as yet. The government can move its motions all day, every day and it will not get support if they are just supported by the government—as can we, and as can the Labor Party, the Greens or Senator Harradine. We need to get consensus to get anything through this place.
Secondly, once this committee process starts, we will be looking, I hope—if we actually get some agreement on this starting today—at February, March and April as pretty intensive working periods for these committees. People actually have to get on together. Senators have to spend time together. If we are dragging one party kicking and screaming to the table—they do not want to be there; they do not want to cooperate; they feel hard done by—then it does not lead us to a situation where we actually have good working relationships which will have to last under that much pressure for that period of time.
So, yes, I did ask yesterday if we could have another day. But, unfortunately, that was interpreted by the Treasurer last night as us caving in to the government, about to agree to what they put on the table, so our phones run hot today with all those people out there—particularly our members—concerned that we have collapsed and are just going to agree to whatever the Treasurer wants. I just want to assure you at the beginning of the debate today that is not the position. The position was that quietly, behind the scenes, we were sitting down, with various people talking to different senators. People such as Senator Brown were writing us letters, we were talking to Senator Harradine, and having discussions with the opposition and with the government on three particular issues: firstly, the content of the material if there was to be an inquiry—what were actually going to be the issues; secondly, the structure—which committees, how many committees; and, thirdly, the timing.
As far as the content is concerned, the ALP had some specific issues. It was not going to go beyond its bottom line. The government had a long way to go, but I am very pleased to say they last night agreed to the position we had reached with content, which we were able to roll into the amendments I am about 
 to move—which I will now call `the omnibus amendments'. All parties are basically happy with the contents of these amendments, although I note another circulated amendment by which the opposition actually wants to take out and rephrase a couple of clauses, which we have agreed to.
We worked very hard with Senator Harradine, who had quite a bit of content to put in, and I congratulate him on that. They are things we probably should have thought about ourselves. They broaden some of the references to the necessities of life, rather than just looking at food, and some other specific examples of treatment of charities, et cetera. Senator Harradine has had some input there, and I thank him for that.
Overnight, we amended our original amendment to take into account Senator Harradine's and Senator Brown's concerns. I just want to acknowledge the letter from Senator Brown and just refer him back now to the amendment that I am about to move to the Labor Party's motion, to assure him that we had all the matters that he has raised. In particular, he has asked that we go beyond food and books and look at items such as health and non-profit organisations. That was already in the community affairs reference. Other environmental concerns that he and Senator Margetts had can be covered in the environment committee under option (o).
As far as content is concerned, we seem to have agreement; certainly as of last night I thought we had agreement. But when we come to the structure, I realise we still have many people who are not particularly happy. But, again, we have got to the point where I think the ALP are going to reluctantly accept this amendment. I know they are still not happy with that. I acknowledge their concerns about the use of Senate time. I acknowledge that they have a range of other issues they wish to refer to committee. But, looking at the breadth of the changes that this government has within its package—remember, we are not looking at a new tax; we are looking at a new tax system—and considering this is the first real look we have had at our tax system since before World War II—before many of us, or indeed most of us, who are in this chamber at 
 the moment were actually born—I think it justifies a thorough committee hearing.
My colleagues last night at about 7 o'clock agreed to reduce our seven references committees back to four, and I understand the ALP has agreed reluctantly to accept an increase from one references committee up to four. The government last night also indicated, again reluctantly—I think we are still talking at a few cross-purposes here—that four committees was workable, even though it was not their best option. But, again, we had reasonable agreement.
 I will just run through this amendment and explain how we will be using the committees. The ALP wants an overarching committee, and that will be the Senate Economics References Committee. That committee will have the other three references committees—the Community Affairs References Committee, the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee, and the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee—reporting to it.
Can I just pause briefly on the environment committee. It is absolutely essential that we look at parts of the package other than just the GST. I remind people again of the government's words: it is a tax system. Changes to diesel fuel treatment and the actual cost that is going to mean for diesel fuel will have major impacts on the health of Australians, particularly many low income families in the capital cities who are often living around some of the major freeways and expressways. That is not an issue we can simply push to one side and hope we can roll into an economics committee. The environment committee is where the expertise is, and that is where we want to send it.
We are still having some difficulties with timing. After the Treasurer's comments last night, I do not feel that we can agree to any further adjournment. I think that will again be seen as the Senate caving in. We are not caving in; we are actually trying to work for some consensus. The ALP has come some two months back and one month back on their original request for the end of this process—for the final report. The overarching 
 committee will now report a month earlier at the end of May. The other three committees which will feed into the economics committee—the environment committee, the community affairs committee and the education committee—will finish a month earlier, at the end of April. We have also agreed to that change—bringing it back to April—which will hopefully assist the government.
However, I am well aware of the fact that the government is still working on the timing. I am not sure where we are going to get to with that today but, as far as the Democrats are concerned—from what we have heard so far in discussions—it is particularly unfortunate that the government believes we can all expect the community to give up Christmas and work through what is a holiday season in this country. The economic rationalists might like us to work seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year, but I think we have all agreed that what may be a perfect economic world is certainly not a perfect social world. I think it is unrealistic when many of those presenting submissions are going to be charities and not-for-profit organisations—the Surf Lifesaving Association, the Royal Lifesaving Association, the tourism industry and many other organisations and businesses—whose busiest time of the year is actually through Christmas.
They may, hopefully, be able to start work in December, which is why we wanted to get this committee process going now. Many of the bigger organisations have the bones—the outline—already prepared, hoping we could get the Senate references up. But many organisations are saying to us, `If you get it up this week, then we will start our modelling. We will then go back to many of our smaller organisations—our smaller branches or our smaller clubs—and ask them for their figures and look at how the GST, in particular, will affect them and look at how the fringe benefits tax changes will affect them.' I think it is unrealistic of the government to suggest we report in January—that basically all the community reports be in by January. If you are looking at a reasonable period of time, you are going to need at least four weeks of activity in December and a couple of weeks next year for them to finish those 
 submissions. I am sorry I am not quite up to date as to where the government's negotiations are this morning from thereon.
—Yes you are. You are right up to date.
—But as far as which weeks, I do not remember the single sheet of paper you sent around to us. Is that still in operation?
—Yes. You have four weeks.
—So you are looking at four weeks of hearings in February? I will leave you to explain later on in terms of the timing. We put it to our party room this morning and it was roundly rejected, and I am not able to support you on the floor today. I go back to the timing that other senators have brought their references back to: the end of April and the end of May. I would be happy to listen to your arguments as to how many weeks you believe you need to negotiate and discuss because, hopefully, we can get back to negotiating and, hopefully, that will be done as much as possible at a Senate level.
As far as what we hope to achieve out of this, I think one of the most important things—as well as, obviously, content—is to actually give the community the opportunity to participate, to actually give the community their chance to be heard. It was not just a quick reference to a few letters yesterday, Senator Kemp, when I asked you the question about how the government is actually getting its message across and where the detail is. There are lots of examples in my mail of letters to ministers not having been answered in three, four or five weeks. We are expected to know the answers, yet the detail in many instances—the treatment of charities, the treatment of pensioners who get their pensions from Britain, and the list goes on and on—is simply not in your documents. I also have copies of letters that you have sent back to constituents advising them to go and spend $11 or $25 and buy themselves a copy of your tax package, and I think that is particularly unreasonable for pensioners.
So one of the aims of this committee process is to actually give the community the 
 time to participate, which they did not get with Vos, and to feel that they have actually been heard. If you try to drive through this place a tax system that the community does not accept, it will not be to the benefit of all Australians. It will not be in any of our interests to see people stop spending, to pull back into themselves and their family units and wait for the dust to settle. We need an open process that the community can see working, that they believe in and where they have an opportunity to have their questions answered.
That is not to put to one side the genuine concerns of many industry groups, the genuine concerns particularly of the charities and the genuine concerns of many in the health area—the pharmacists and those who are involved with the sale of a range of products under the Therapeutic Goods Act. I will not go through all the details here, but where the lines are drawn on health and education is particularly important to many businesses. Some of the details on the treatment of aged care and child care will be revealed when Vos reports tomorrow, but there is a long way to go before we have a community understanding that this is an open process and that they have the opportunity to participate.
So I hope if the government is determined today to somehow push a very short time frame through this Senate, that it remembers that Australians out there are concerned about a new tax system, they are not happy about a new tax system and they need more than just a few weeks over Christmas to get submissions in.
I will close by saying that I hope the amendment I will move to Senator Faulkner's general business motion No. 1 will be successful. We do not know whether it will because negotiations effectively came to a halt this morning. But hopefully my amendment will be successful and we will actually get going on this committee process. I move:

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-11-12,"—I rise to speak on the motion moved by Senator Faulkner. Let me say from the outset that the government will not be supporting that motion. We went to an election on a tax reform. It was the central election issue. The Labor Party could not stop talking about our tax reform. They did not want to talk about theirs too much as it fell in a heap fairly early on.
Tax reform was the major election issue. That is what voters went into the polling booths on, and the government won the election. Therefore, we believe, and I think the Australian community expects, that the government will deliver on its promise. There are elements in this Senate concentrated on the Labor Party's side who are determined to try to force the government to break that promise. Let me make it quite clear that we are determined to proceed to ensure that we can deliver to the Australian people what we went to the election on and what we achieved a mandate on.
The government's position on an inquiry is clear. We have been returned to office with a mandate. However, we understand and we recognise that there is a disposition in the Senate for an inquiry. You do not have to be a genius to count the numbers in this chamber. We made it clear in a press release that was issued by the Treasurer that it is unlikely that we will achieve our goal of passing the legislation by 1 July 1999 unless the government agrees to an inquiry being held. So we have recognised that there will be an inquiry in the Senate.
What is fair and reasonable for that inquiry? What are the key principles on which one would want to have a fair and reasonable inquiry? The first one is to give people time to put submissions to that inquiry. That is the first one. The second one I put to the Senate is that there must be time for those submissions to be considered. The third element I put to the Senate is, having met those two criteria, there must also be time for the government to have the legislation debated properly and passed in the Senate to meet the government's deadline of 1 July 1999—a promise that we gave the Australian people, a commitment that we gave the Australian people. That is the dilemma that is before this chamber.
Where does the Labor Party stand? Essentially, the Labor Party is opposed to the tax reform measures that we have brought forward. It will do anything in its power to attempt to defeat those tax reform proposals. The Labor Party refuses to recognise the election result. So, as Mr Beazley said in a startling statement of frankness, it will work any parliamentary manoeuvre that is available in order to defeat the government's election promise. This is essentially what the Labor Party motion is about. No-one in the Labor Party is going to change their mind as a result of the inquiry. They are really not the slightest bit interested in an inquiry.
The Labor Party is interested in delaying and attempting to cause confusion. That is what the Labor Party is interested in. The Labor Party has dealt itself out of serious debate with its attitude and its shameless refusal to accept the result of the election. So the views of the Labor Party are quite clear. The Labor Party wants an inquiry only in order to delay consideration by the Senate of these bills. It does not come to this issue with clean hands.
I listened very carefully to the comments made by Senator Lees and the Democrats. I listened carefully to the views that she put, some of which I agree with and some of which I do not agree with. I agree with the fact that there have been productive negotiations in recent days. I hope those negotiations have been useful in helping the Democrats to understand the government's position. Equally, the Democrats have put their views to us.
We listened carefully when Senator Lees said that she was also prepared to negotiate further. I personally welcome that comment of Senator Lees and, as soon as both of us have a time to leave this chamber, I will certainly make myself available to see whether we can move this matter forward. I am not confident that we can move this matter forward in the chamber at the moment, only time and the votes will tell whether that is the case. I am not confident but, nonetheless, I welcome the comment that she is prepared to discuss this further with the government to see whether a consensus can be reached.
 At the start of my remarks, I indicated that there were perhaps three broad issues that had to be considered. Is there time for submissions to be called? The truth of the matter is, if this inquiry is set up by the Senate today, submissions could effectively be advertised tomorrow or on the weekend. Depending on the timetable set by the committees, this would certainly give many weeks—four, five or six weeks—for groups to put submissions to the Senate committees. After Christmas, the committees will have a chance to consider these submissions.
Again, the government has put down a position in its motions. We understand that the Democrats are not happy with that. We will look at further proposals there. But the government's bottom line is that we believe it is possible to set up an inquiry which on the one hand provides extensive time for people to put submissions in, and Senate committees typically make allowances for those groups who find it hard to meet deadlines. I do not think that would be any problem for the particular Senate committees which will be calling for submissions.
Equally, the government has indicated that we will work with the Senate to make sure that there is extensive time available for the hearings of the committees. I think Senator Ian Campbell has indicated that we would look at the parliamentary sitting times to make sure that space is provided for very extensive hearings by the Senate committees. We have also put down that the government needs time to make sure that these bills can be properly considered in this chamber and, hopefully from our position, passed by this chamber.
We believe that, if people come to the table with goodwill, we can meet all those three criteria. If people do not come with goodwill, if people have other agendas, then that is a different matter. But if the issue is to give people a fair time to put in submissions, if the issue is to give the Senate committees enough time to properly consider the issues which are before them and if the issue is to ensure that the government has sufficient time in its program to have the legislation considered by 
 the Senate, we believe that this Senate can achieve those three criteria.
We will, as I have indicated, be quite happy to speak to the Democrats, Senator Harradine, Senator Colston and even the Labor Party and the Greens if they wish to see how we can achieve those goals. I have no doubt they can be achieved, but it requires people to recognise we have to look where the centre of gravity is in this place. The government is very keen to get its bills passed. Senators wish to have proper and extensive consideration of these bills before Senate committees. Although the government does not see a need for that, it recognises there is a disposition in the Senate to do that and the government will cooperate so that the Senate can achieve that goal. The final thing is to make sure that people can put submissions to the committees. I say to Senator Lees and other senators that I have no doubt that we can achieve that. It will require a lot of work.
The one thing I was inclined to agree with Senator Faulkner on was that this is going to tie up the Senate committee structure for a considerable period of time. If you look at the time Senate committees have had for consideration of important bills that have come to this chamber—and I did some quick research last night—the most extensive inquiry done by a Senate committee on a bill was 16 weeks on the euthanasia bill. We have proposed three committees and the Democrats have proposed four committees—they have come down from seven. The time available for committees to consider the bills would be three or four times more what has ever been done before in this chamber. So if people want an extensive inquiry, that can be easily achieved.
As I said, the government will try to ensure, within reason and within the constraints of its own program, that the Senate and those committees have time to properly consider the matters before them. So very extensive time can be provided for these committee hearings, vastly in excess of anything which has ever been done before in this Senate that I am aware of. We can do that and still meet the criteria that the government has put down on 
 the need to provide plenty of time in this chamber for these bills to be considered.
I think the basis is there. If people come to the table with goodwill, it would surprise me if we could not reach agreement that would meet the demands of all parties in this Senate chamber. Certainly I hope in the next few hours, maybe days, that I and my colleagues will work to see whether that can be achieved.
I understand the Democrats went to the election and said they were not opposed to a GST. The Democrats had some queries about a GST in relation to food, but they were not opposed to the broader principle that the government was putting forward. The Democrats come with a position that we do not agree with, but it is a position that certainly was put by them to the people. We are happy to have those issues fully explored by the Senate if they feel it is necessary because we believe the results of such an inquiry will vindicate the government's position.
The government arrived at its policy position after a year of intensive discussion and negotiation with many groups. I can remember the extensive work of the Gibson committee in drawing in a very wide range of submissions from all groups in the community.
—That went into a black hole somewhere.
—No, it was done in good faith, Senator Lees, and as a result we were able to go to the election with the most comprehensive tax reform package which has ever been put before the Australian people and we won that election on the basis of that tax reform package. We are determined to proceed with the mandate, but if what you want is an extensive inquiry, I believe that can be accommodated. If what you want is reasonable time for people to put in submissions, that can be accommodated. If what you want is plenty of time for the Senate committees to hear the evidence, that can be accommodated. We can achieve all that and at the same time provide plenty of time for the Senate to consider the legislation that goes before the public.
I think you will find, Senator Lees, that with reasonable notice—and, as I said, we could put the notice out almost immediately—the vast proportion of groups will be able to meet any reasonable deadline for the submission of their views. Of course, as I said earlier in my remarks, Senate committees have procedures which can deal effectively with those who cannot.
We can provide plenty of time, but the Senate does not want to get itself in a position where it is not prepared to work. Senators are not prepared to work over this period. Senator Lees, it is now 12 November. There is plenty of time before Christmas for work to be done, for notices to be issued and even for hearings to be established early, if that is the wish of the committee. Equally, there is time, given a reasonable break over the new year, if people wish that, for the Senate committees to resume as well. This is very important. You are correct in that there will be lots of people who wish to put views to this committee. I do not think the Senate should say, `Well, we think tax reform is very important. We've got to have the biggest inquiry ever, but we really can't get moving until perhaps late in January or early in February.' I think that would put senators in a very odd position.
We believe that we can achieve a consensus, we can achieve a position at which the reasonable demands of all groups in the Senate can be achieved. We are not too far from it, to be quite frank, Senator Lees. The next few hours will determine whether that is the case or not. As I say, we are happy to discuss with all parties in the Senate to see whether we can reach an appropriate consensus which allows people time to put their submissions in, which allows the Senate committees plenty of time to conduct hearings and which provides the government with plenty of time to ensure that the bills can be properly debated in this chamber and passed by the 1 July deadline. We believe all that can be achieved. It is not achieved at the moment with the motion that has been put down by Senator Faulkner and it is not achieved by the amendment Senator Lees has put down.
In relation to Senator Lees's amendment, just to illustrate one of the dilemmas we have, clause (4) says that not only are we to have the final committee reporting by 30 May but also the consideration of any legislation implementing the government's proposals for this taxation reform be postponed. So not only do we get the 30 May deadline, you then say `until after presentation of all reports required by this resolution, and until after presentation of the Government's responses to these reports'.
The truth of the matter is that the government gets four or seven reports by 30 May. The government has then to consider in detail all these reports, and the legislation cannot even be debated then, Senator Lees. Typically, what happens is that committees put their reports down and these reports are considered in the debate. But, in this arrangement, you have not even given the government that usual precedent which is followed in this chamber.
Senator Lees, Senator Harradine, Senator Brown, Senator Margetts and the Labor Party, I think further discussion is required. We are happy to have those discussions. As I said, I believe we can achieve a consensus if all parties come to the table with goodwill.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>References</title>,Committees,12,2
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-11-12,"—Before the chamber is a motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, and an amendment moved to that motion by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Lees. I wish now to move an amendment to Senator Lees's amendment to Senator Faulkner's motion. I will do that at the conclusion of my remarks. My amendment to Senator Lees's amendment to Senator Faulkner's motion is circulated in the chamber. I do need to say one or two words about the structure of this amendment.
The amendment by the Australian Democrats is a quite comprehensive and extensive amendment. With respect, we think there are ways of making it even more comprehensive without losing any of the point or merit of some of the elements of that amendment. If those changes were accepted, it may well be 
 that the opposition would be in a position to support the final amendment amended in this way.
My amendment goes to paragraph (e) in paragraph (3) of the reference to the Economics References Committee and proposes to delete the introduction to (e) and replace it with a new introduction which would read:
(e)	 options for improving the effectiveness and fairness of the tax system and reducing inequitable or unreasonable tax avoidance and minimisation, including consideration of alternative areas for tax generation, either where there are current tax concessions or where Australia's taxation system does not address major tax potential.
My amendment would replace an introduction which introduces a series of points set down in (i) to (vii) which itemises types of alternative areas of tax generation or types of current tax concessions or efforts to address major tax potential. The reason I think this is a more satisfactory amendment is that, in my understanding of the narrow interpretation of the Democrats proposal, if you introduce a concept and then set dot points, you in fact tend to limit the meaning of that concept to the dot points that you have introduced. By removing the dot points and explaining more widely and more effectively the idea of the wide range of this inquiry, you encompass all of the dot points that have been mentioned and any others that might arise as well or some that were not thought of in the heat of drafting. Therefore, you open the potential for a wider canvass of views and a wider examination than the amendment may have allowed by virtue of itemising a series of issues.
If that is not gobbledegook and is understood, and I trust it is—I see beaming smiles from some of my Democrat colleagues which suggest that at least the point is understood—then they can see that no merit is lost by these changes—in fact merit is enhanced by them—and that the changes might be acceptable. The further part of my amendment seeks to remove paragraphs (i) and (k) on page 3. Paragraph (i) deals with the restoration of the 150 per cent tax concession for R&D and paragraph (k) deals with capital gains tax, 
 including the implications of the suggested 30 per cent cap on the CGT rate.
Those changes are consistent with the explanation I have just given. The changes suggested by my amendment enable those things and more to be encompassed. Again, nothing is lost. I think more is added, and the text is improved. For those reasons, I recommend the changes to the chamber and trust that there might be, in an act of shaking hands across the chamber, consensus and agreement that they might constitute reasonable terms of reference for a Senate inquiry into the GST. I commend the amendment to the chamber in the expectation that that is so.
On the general subject of this inquiry, the issue has been canvassed substantially, and I believe persuasively, by speakers in this debate bar the government, which has defended its position and, while indicating to the chamber support for a Senate inquiry, rejected essentially the approach taken by the opposition and the Democrats. In terms of the government proposal for a shortened reporting time for the inquiry, Senator Kemp said, `The vast majority of groups'—meaning community groups and potential organisations or entities that would submit to an inquiry—`can meet our deadline,' which is a shortened deadline for February. I do not believe that that is true.
If you look at the Vos committee, which is a committee the government has set up to look at elements of the GST, and the time frame in which that committee has to operate, you can see a window on government thinking about what reasonable time looks like. The Vos committee will be in existence for 17 days. According to the ABC radio yesterday, it has attracted some 250 submissions. The committee has 17 days to deal with 250 submissions. There are 408 hours in 17 days. If the committee sat 24 hours a day, it would have 1 hour and 38 minutes for each submission of the 250 submissions made. In that 1 hour and 38 minutes, the committee members would have to read the submission, understand the submission, analyse its contents, come to a conclusion about it, extract from it any main points, balance them against other submissions that they had read or intend to 
 read, reserve time at the end for a conclusion, and then reserve further time to write their conclusion.
If you put it in that context, perhaps it is physically achievable and perhaps Mr Vos has powers that transcend those of normal human senators in the ability to do this at such a rapid clip. I do not necessarily pretend that he cannot do it, but I do think it is unreasonable and fantastic to argue that that can lead to a balanced consideration in the national interest of matters of this weight and importance so fundamental to the taxation structure of Australia and the wellbeing of ordinary Australians. I mention that because that is the best example I have to hand of what the government thinks is a reasonable deadline for a committee that it has set up to deal with the momentous matters contained in this debate.
If you go back to the actual circumstances of how we came to have an election on the GST, you will remember that the Prime Minister announced the great tax adventure in May 1997, and in August 1997 the committee to review the taxation structure of Australia was set up. It was a committee set up in Treasury. It was a secret committee. It had a chairman, which we later adduced by inquiries through the estimates process. It never kept minutes. It never kept records. Its membership was indefinite. We know that the senator representing the Treasurer in this place, Senator Kemp, was not a member of it and not privy to it, at least not initially. It sat for 460 days before it brought down its report.
Government consideration of these matters—a process internal to government and hidden from public view—took 460 days before the committee produced its report. When the report was produced to the accompaniment of a $17 million advertising campaign paid for by the taxpayer, Australians had two weeks to absorb the detail before they were in the midst of an election campaign. Election campaigns are a bit like war in the sense that often the first casualty in an election campaign is truth. Certainly, a casualty in an election campaign is space for objective calm analysis because parties are con 
 tending for the ultimate prize and there tends to be often—and this as an observation—a degree of exaggeration in the way in which parties put their arguments in an election context. While in this election campaign that may not have been true of the Labor Party, it certainly was true of the government.
After 460 days to incubate and prepare the ideas and a $17 million campaign over two weeks to present them, the government now tells us that it has a mandate to introduce legislation along these lines. That does spark a debate—and we have had one over the last couple of days in this chamber—about the meaning of the word `mandate'.
Senator Kemp talks about a deadline, as he did a moment ago in this debate. Apparently, according to Senator Kemp, the deadline is 1 July 1999. I do not recall a deadline actually being voted on in those terms. The deadline is one invented by the government and imposed on itself to encourage the public to believe there is urgency here and that they have to get the legislation through by that time for whatever reason.
The allegation of a deadline is attended to by intimations that tax cuts may not be made and other benefits that the government alleges are contained within its package will be withheld, disturbed or degraded to some extent if this deadline is not met.
I am always sceptical of self-imposed deadlines for negotiating purposes. There is often no such case and I do not believe there is one on this occasion. If the issue of a deadline is put alongside the issue of a mandate, a reasonable question for the citizens of this nation to pose to a government is, `If you claim a mandate, why don't you wait until the Senate that was elected at this election is able to take its seat and exercise the mandate that we, the people, gave both houses of parliament, and not just take the view that, simply because the government is formed in the lower house, that is the sole chamber in which these matters must be determined?'
This is a classic debate for the Senate—the role of the Senate versus the House of Representatives. I am unable to read the position of individual senators on this matter and I make no allegations or observations about it, but 
 what is different in the debate about this legislation is that government believes that it has—and it is a belief in the mind of the government—a far better chance to rush this legislation through before 1 July than it might have after 1 July. Its deadline is convenient for that type of caper, and this is all about that; it is not about proper examination of the basis for major tax change.
Let me add one observation on the question of mandate. Nearly 52 per cent of Australians, in voting in the House of Representatives on a two-party preferred basis, voted against the party that was proposing a GST. Sure, the government was elected, but that is because the vote went their way in a number of borderline constituencies.
If the election was a referendum on the GST rather than an election, the referendum would have been lost. There were only two states in Australia in which the government had a majority on a two-party preferred basis, that is, South Australia and Queensland. In every other state, and in the two territories as well, if this was a referendum on a two-party preferred basis, in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia the referendum would have been defeated. And, for the record, in the ACT and the Northern Territory it would have been defeated as well.
If this last poll had been a referendum on a GST, we would not be debating the matter; it would have been disposed of by the people by expressing their will in the terms which I have described. It would not have commanded a majority of the total vote and it would not have commanded a majority of the vote in a majority of the states, and both conditions are necessary to carry a referendum.
A number of matters have been put to the public in the argument about a goods and services tax and its economic impact. They have been presented almost as slogans or mantras in the belief that, if you repeat a concept often enough, people will come to believe that it has a certain truth or permanence to it, whether it is true or not. There is no doubt that that was done on the government's side in this election campaign—no doubt whatsoever. Some of those are imminently challengeable and many of them 
 are nothing like what was said in the sloganeering way in which it was put.
For example, an area that I am familiar with and which falls within the bounds of my own shadow portfolio is trade. It was argued that there would be a massive boost to Australia's trade prospects if a GST was introduced and if charges were taken from the backs of exporters and export was zero rated. It was argued, therefore—and on the face of it, it seems true—that Australia would have a competitive advantage in that the costs of goods in foreign markets would be lower. Presumably, as a consequence of that, we would be able to win more market, sell more goods and create more jobs. That was the image presented.
That is good enough so far, but of course it goes a lot further. When you travel the whole distance and look at the ongoing economic impact, nothing like that conclusion is reasonable in a debate in which reason is the centrepiece rather than political opportunity.
Let me explain why. First of all, that debate does not account at all for fluctuations in the exchange rate. We know that the Australian dollar is valued by the international market to reflect the market's view of the competitiveness of the Australian economy. As every economist I have consulted on this point says, of course, if our goods become a bit cheaper, then the dollar will go up to compensate. The international market equates the price of our goods to the competitiveness of the economy and increases the dollar to offset that competitive advantage. So there might be an immediate short-term advantage, which will be washed out of the system reasonably quickly by changes in the exchange rate.
That is not my view, although it is a view I hold, but it is a view held by many eminent economists. It is a view attested to by the deputy chairman of the government's own task force and a former staffer of the Treasurer when he wrote a paper on the exchange rate impact of a goods and services tax in Australia and concluded that there was essentially no real value in making the change—a gentleman by the name of Mr Matthew Ryan.
 It is also the view attested to by the International Monetary Fund when they did a world survey of goods and services taxes to assess what the competitive advantage to nations introducing GSTs will be. We never heard very much about any of that in the election campaign. The IMF concluded that there is no essential value of such a tax in trade terms. What we heard in the election campaign was that there would be a massive windfall.
 One of the advantages that this inquiry can bring is to get to the bottom of this argument, to present impartially and clearly the argument, so that the real economic impact—if there is one—can at least be understood. That is one element that I think an inquiry would be justified on. It is one advantage that this process can bring to enlighten public debate and understanding on this measure. I conclude my remarks on that point. I have foreshadowed an amendment. I now formally move it. It was not my intention to ask you to take it in separate parts. I ask you to put it as one. Therefore, I move:
(1)	 Omit paragraph (e) of the reference to the Economics References Committee in paragraph (3), substitute:
(e)	 options for improving the effectiveness and fairness of the tax system and reducing inequitable or unreasonable tax avoidance and minimisation, including consideration of alternative areas for tax generation, either where there are current tax concessions or where Australia's taxation system does not address major tax potential.
(2)	 Omit paragraphs (i) to (k) of the reference to the Economics Reference Committee in paragraph (3).",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>References</title>,Committees,12,2
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-11-12,"—I want to commend Senator Cook first for that contribution. It made a lot of sense. If that is evidence of the debate that is going to follow in the Senate further down the line, then we can look forward to a lot of enlightenment on the impact of the GST on the Australian community as a whole. Just following up on what Senator Cook had to say, it is true that, in politics, timing is crucial.
There are three alternatives as to when this debate on the GST and the inquiry could take place. The first and best time for it was 
 before the election. We knew—all of us—12 months ago that the government was moving to a GST-oriented election. Seeing that, the Greens called in a consultant to see if there could be a green GST, meaning a GST which is socially just and environmentally sound. The consultant, Dr Louise Crossley, went to look at world experience—the best way to answer that question—and the resounding answer was that a GST in Australia at this time can neither be socially just, no matter how it is fiddled with, nor can it be environmentally enhancing.
 On the basis of that, we went to the election with our homework done, rejecting the GST, but moreover putting forward the better alternative now being adopted in European countries and being moved towards by the Blair government in Great Britain of European-style eco taxes. I am glad to see that the parameters of the proposed inquiry from the Democrats have been widened, amongst many other things, to allow a very clear look at that as an alternative. That was the best time—before the election—for this inquiry to have taken place, for the community to be involved and for the community to be aware of the ramifications of a GST. However, that did not happen—except with us Greens doing that consultancy—as far as I can see, and the electorate was asked to vote on the matter.
The next best time, as Senator Cook pointed out, for this inquiry to take place therefore is when the representatives of this place elected by the electorate on the issue of the GST are also in place; that is, after 1 July 1999. It is extraordinary that the government—and Senator Kemp in his submission—has said there is a deadline of 1 July 1999. That ought to be the starting point. That is when the people's elected representatives will be here in full.
 The third alternative is to hold the inquiry between the election when the people have voted—and, as Senator Cook has pointed out, the majority indicated a position against the GST—and 1 July. And here we are with the worst of the three alternatives. The timing is wrong, wrong, wrong. However, I am not going to be able to alter that timing.
 Having made it clear that the Australian Greens are totally opposed to the GST package, we are left in the position then of saying, `We have done our homework but it appears that other entities of the Senate have not and certainly the people have not been given that opportunity to be consulted, so we move to an inquiry.' There seems to be a consensus or there seems to be a majority feeling that that inquiry should take place before 1 July.
 Our job therefore is, in seeing that, to help to make this inquiry as productive as possible. It was on the basis of that that I made it clear to the Democrats who are moving for the inquiry that there was no point in doing so with a closed mind, that they and indeed all of us should be open to the outcome of that inquiry and the input from the Australian people. We need to go beyond Senator Lees's concern that the community must feel it has been heard and to actually implement and ensure measures that protect the community interests. She and I will be in agreement here that that means in particular the interests of those who have it hardest in the Australian community. That is why I stood out for a condition being that the Democrat position of supporting a GST, provided food and other items were exempted, be open to change.
If this inquiry is going to have meaning and the Australian community is really going to believe there will be a dinkum outcome, the option of both supporting the GST but, more importantly, rejecting it in toto has to be there. I am pleased to have heard that the Democrats have agreed to that. Indeed, in the note I sent Senator Lees two days ago, I asked her to confirm it in writing. The transcript of some comments made in the media would be adequate for fulfilling that desire I have.
—I have not agreed to that.
—Senator Lees now says that she has not agreed to that.
—Not your interpretation of that.
—That creates some concern with me. I want the matter cleared up before I vote on it. That is why I want it from Senator Lees in writing. I ask Senator Lees to 
 listen to it. I want in writing what she does mean by that. I do not want to misinterpret what Senator Lees has said. It is up to her to clear up that matter. I will make my decision based upon the written version she gives me.
I believe that the government would not have won this election except for the blunting of the threat of the GST by the Democrats' position. When the Democrats said, `We stand for a gentler, kinder, more compassionate, food exempting GST,' the tide turned against the election campaign. Until that point, there was a much greater concern in the Australian community about the impact of a GST. The government got home because the Democrats said, `We'll look after this GST and make sure it's socially just.'
Having done that, there is an enormous responsibility on the Democrats to ensure that it is socially just. I say again that, in the Greens' assessment of world practice, it cannot be socially just. My conclusion is that a proper, thoroughgoing inquiry will lead to the Democrats changing their point of view to reject this GST package.
I am also pleased that there has been an increasing emphasis put on the ability of the inquiries to look into the environmental impacts. It is not just the GST, although that has environmental detriment built into itself, which I speak of here. The package, which ought to have taken into account the environment and made sure that there were incentives built into it for those who do the right thing by the Australian environment, does quite the reverse. It gives incentives to polluters. The Australia Institute, in an independent assessment, has found that the rebate—the incentive given to those who use petrol and diesel fuels—of $3½ billion plus per annum will lead, on a national basis, to an extra five million tonnes of greenhouse gases being produced in this country. On top of that, some 2,000 plus tonnes of carcinogens will be put into the environment as a result of the increased use of diesel fuels.
This is no light matter. The New Scientist reported some time ago that in Britain alone some 10,000 Britons a year die of cancer due to the carcinogens coming out of diesel exhaust pipes. You can translate that to the 
 approximate thousands of Australians who die because diesel is a major polluter of urban environments. This package is an incentive to increase that toll. It is a very important consideration. An inquiry which does not address it is an inquiry that will not look after the interests of the unsuspecting populace in terms of the detriment to the environment, their health and their longevity.
I could speculate that, at the end of the day, after all the inquiries have been held and after all the energy has been put into this by the Australian community, the outcome may simply well be another deal between Senator Harradine and the government. It is a good thing Senator Harradine spoke with the disabled people the other day outside this place, because they are concerned about the impact of the GST. But I have very worried recollections of what happened to the rights of the indigenous people after an interaction between Senator Harradine and indigenous people outside this parliament earlier this year, where they lost so much of their interests in a compromise between Senator Harradine and the government on that occasion.
The political reality—I do not aver from this—is that Senator Harradine and Senator Colston will strike a deal with the government some time in June, as things stand. My only appeal to the Independent senators is that, in the process of enjoining this inquiry, they make it dinkum. They need to listen to what people have to say in the inquiry. They need to act, as we all must if we are genuine representatives of the people, in the interests of everybody who will be affected by the GST. In particular, that means those on low incomes, the most powerless and those who have the most to lose by this remarkably important change in which the community is not only taxed but wealthy entities in the community get multibillion dollar breaks out of the government's tax package.
I will watch the rest of this debate with great interest. I will do what I can on behalf of the Australian Greens to continue to see that this is a dinkum inquiry—that it doesn't just make everybody feel good, but brings a result which will soften the impact of a very 
 threatening GST package on the wider Australian community.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>References</title>,Committees,12,2
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-11-12,"—Poor Senator Brown. He can't help himself. He is constantly reflecting on the bona fides of parliamentary colleagues. He did it to the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees, and he has again done it to me. If he wants his colleagues to have any regard whatsoever to what he says or, indeed, to his credibility, the least that he can do is acknowledge the goodwill and good faith of colleagues and not presume the worst. It behoves the Senate to deal with these matters on their merits and not bring to them the sorts of prejudices we have heard from Senator Brown.
In respect of the native title legislation, Senator Brown's contribution to that debate showed that he knew very little about the whole issue of native title. Have a look at it. Read through what he said during that debate. I must admit that there were not too many people who knew the ramifications of the native title legislation, let alone the common law rights of indigenous Australians. The outcome of that debate was an honourable, fair, just and workable outcome. What Senator Brown clearly wanted was a stalemate, where indigenous Australians were not able to access their rights—let `em go. Don't get a workable solution.
Are you suggesting that the Queensland government's proposal that was passed last night—I don't suppose you knew that it was passed last night, but I am continuously updating myself on what is happening as a result of the legislation—is not going to mean a better, more rapid, more just application of principles so that the indigenous people can get their rights quicker than they would have otherwise? Is that what you are saying?
—Yep. Rights.
—Oh, really? I don't know how many other people would say it. That is not what the Labor Party is saying.
—I know.
—Oh, you know. Did you know that it passed last night 
 through the Legislative Assembly of Queensland?
—Of course we did. Where is the goodwill you are talking about, Brian?
—Well, if you did know you wouldn't have said what you said.
—I also know what they are doing in Western Australia.
—Yes, and I know what they are doing in Western Australia, too. I am sure that that matter, which is currently being debated in the Legislative Council, will show the Court government that they couldn't get away with what they were proposing to get away with. Even if they tried to get away with what they were trying to get away with it wouldn't have been accepted in this chamber. The Northern Territory proposition is absolutely laughable. I should imagine that the relevant minister in the government would certainly not tick what the Northern Territory has tried to do.
Bear in mind that these procedures were put in place by the Senate and the parliament in general. Let me just say this in respect of statements that have been made about what the government might or might not hope for if this measure is debated by 30 June. The government has no reason to believe that it would be better off having this legislation voted upon in the Senate before 30 June as against after 30 June. I have said nothing publicly or privately to the government which would indicate that to it. In fact, everybody knows that I have had a view about the GST for many years that such a proposal would be regressive. Even before this election I have indicated that I oppose a GST on the basic necessities of life where that discriminates against those least able to pay. That is pretty clear.
Then I heard what Senator Brown said: `Why not leave this until after 1 July when the senators who were elected at the last election take their place?' He is falling into the same trap of the argument on mandate. Are you saying that that is the mandate? They are saying that is a mandate. You are saying it is a mandate. Do not bring it in until after 1 July because we do not have a mandate for 
 it. You are falling into the government's trap. We are not saying that the government has a mandate for this. What we are doing is proposing to exercise our rights and our duties to form the functions which we as a Senate should perform. Those functions are particularly functions of review of legislation that the government brings before us.
But surely it is the executive government's right to bring legislation before us. Whether or not they think they have a mandate for it, they have a right to bring legislation before the parliament. They have a right to do so whenever they choose. But we also have a right—indeed, a duty—to examine that legislation or the policies behind that legislation and to do so in a thorough manner. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees, is one which I believe would provide the Senate with an opportunity of thoroughly examining the issues relating to the tax reform package, including the GST. I am pleased that the Democrats took on board some suggestions that I made, and I referred to a couple of them. I think it is important to deal not only with the issue of food but also with the basic necessities of life, such as food, clothing, shelter and essential services. I think it is important to examine the effect of taxing those basic necessities of life.
For some considerable time I have been seeking papers from Treasury, as have Senator Lees and Senator Margetts. We were given the no treatment by Treasury mainly. I have been seeking that information for some considerable time. Besides the assumptions, calculations, predictions, estimates and modelling which underpin the government proposals for taxation reform, I am pleased to see that Senator Lees has included the economic theories that may well be behind those matters. Because they would be very revealing I am sure.
I am a bit disappointed that the amendment differs somewhat from the proposal by Senator Lees which is in the Notice Paper—namely, that it is reducing the number of committees from seven to four. I would like to make a comment on the effect that the GST and the whole of the package are going 
 to have on the states and their finances. This is a very important matter. The state premiers are very concerned about the issue, and they are meeting this afternoon and tomorrow here in Canberra. The original proposal states:
The effects of the Government's taxation reform legislation proposals on state and local government administration, including:
. . .              . . .             . . .
(d)	 the implications for future federal-state financial relations of not extending the GST to the necessities of life . . . and any adjustments to the proposed arrangements which would be required to federal-state financial relations . . .
I am particularly interested in whether the proposal really discriminated against or between the states. I am glad it is there, but the problem with reducing the inquiry to four committees is that the Finance and Public Administration References Committee will not get a guernsey to look at these particular areas for which it has expertise. Again, at some stage I hope that the Finance and Public Administration References Committee will be the committee that will deal with the matters that were proposed originally by Senator Lees in the notice of motion that appears in yesterday's Notice Paper .
Also, I believe it would be quite desirable for the rural and regional affairs committee to deal with that particular area because of its expertise; there are a number of terms of reference that would be better dealt with there. I also think it is very, very important for the legal and constitutional affairs committee to look at the matters which were originally in the document put forward by Senator Lees—and I quote:
The effects of the taxation reform legislation proposals on legal and constitutional matters, including:
(a)	 the constitutionality of the proposed mechanism for future changes to the GST, including whether such changes would present a significant hurdle to future increases, or reductions if deemed necessary to stimulate the economy . . . 
That is relevant because of what is happening in Japan at the present moment.
I do express a bit of disappointment that the full resources of the Senate committee system, 
 that all of the Senate committees, are not going to be brought to bear to focus on this matter so as to provide the Senate with reports and to consider the submissions from the public. Nevertheless, in order to not waste time, I propose to support the amendment that has been moved by Senator Lees.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>References</title>,Committees,12,2
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-11-12,"—This debate is about the unfairness of the GST. The government wants to pretend that this is a fair package. This is about whether or not the government will continue to run and hide from that fundamental fact. This is about whether or not the government will agree to genuine scrutiny of the GST package—genuine scrutiny.
What we saw before the election was a tax package described as `the biggest change in Australian taxation history' dropped on the community. Then, two to three weeks later, we saw an election called. At that time those opposite ran from scrutiny. They have no runs on the board when it comes to whether or not the Australian community, the parliament, people in this chamber get a chance to actually test their bona fides. What we have seen for the last two or three weeks is a position consistent with the one those opposite had before the election: they do not want anybody to have a good hard look at the facts.
All sorts of lies and untruths have been told about this package. Those opposite claim that the GST package, this tax reform, will lead to more jobs—well, it will not. They say that it will lead to the end of the black economy—well, it will not. They say that it will improve our national savings rate—well, it will not.
The part of this debate I find the most offensive is the misleading of the unemployed people in this country. Those opposite want to pretend that the GST can create jobs. There is no country in the world—not one—where the introduction of the GST has led to a reduction in the rate of unemployment. But that is the big lie that this government keeps trying to tell those poor struggling Australians who are out there battling to find a job.
We have seen the employment figures today: 7.9 per cent—the rate has barely moved; three more years, and the rate has 
 barely moved. That is what this mob are promising us again—no change.
—Tell us about full-time jobs, Senator Connroy.
—That is exactly right, Senator Stott Despoja: there are no full-time jobs being created in this country. But those opposite want to keep pretending that is what is happening.
Then they want to tell you about the national savings rate—something that this country needs to address; very important for a better balance of payments; very important for foreign debt; very important for whether or not this country can sustain its living standards. They say that the GST will increase the national savings rate.
But even their own Treasury department, when questioned, had to admit that there is not, again, one country in the world where, when a GST has been introduced, there has been an increase in the savings rate—again, not one. But you will still see them out there peddling this lie to ordinary Australians, making them believe, giving them false hope that this package is about making a difference on those issues.
The strongest argument those opposite claim they have had, apart from jobs, is that it will make those bludgers who are not paying tax pay tax. It will fix up the black economy. I am telling you: the GST ain't going to make Kerry Packer pay tax.
But what happened overseas in Canada when they introduced the GST? There were actually a couple of extra jobs created—I have to correct myself—when they introduced the GST in Canada. But where were they all? In the tax office. What has happened with the Canadian experience and all over Europe is that there has been a massive increase in the black economy—not a decrease, a massive increase in the black economy. It only makes sense. If you increase the amount of goods on which is paid an indirect tax, if you increase the total on indirect tax, there is a greater incentive to avoid it. It is perfectly rational behaviour to have an increase in the black economy when you introduce a GST.
Those opposite try to pretend that the GST will stop all those bludgers out there, but the only place you will see more jobs from a GST will be in the tax office. We have seen some heroic assumptions in their package. They did not want the opposition, the Democrats, the Greens or any of the eminent economists around the country to have a good look at this because, when you stand it up, even if you give them the best case scenario and pretend all their other assumptions are true, the famous 1.9 per cent—which today we have seen was a lie—has been shown by their own studies to be a fabrication.
If you believed that the 1.9 per cent was true, you had to believe in the Easter Bunny. You did not need secret Treasury documents that were held back until after the election to see that pensioners were going to be worse off, to know that the story they were trying to tell on the unemployed and single parents and people in those positions at the lower end of the spectrum were going to be worse off; you did not need the Treasury documents. It stands out: how on earth can 1.9 per cent be right?
But they pretended for the entire election campaign. They spent $15 million of your money to pretend that 1.9  per cent—remember the advertising campaign?—was the real figure. They knew it was not. They misled the Australian community, and Senator Kemp has been part of that. You are walking out of the chamber now, Senator Kemp, because again you do not want to face the scrutiny of this chamber. Senator Kemp, 1.9 per cent is a fraudulent figure. You know it, and you have been exposed.
We saw the WST lampooned during the election, but who ended up looking like the buffoon? There was the Treasurer and his teddy bear. Where is the teddy bear, Senator Alston—the one that Mr Costello was going to carry around with him every day of the campaign, the one that was coming down in price? Why did he suddenly lose his teddy bear? He lost his teddy bear because it became apparent very quickly that in actual fact the claim about the WST and the fall in the price of that teddy bear after the introduction of the GST was not true for the very simple 
 reason that WST is levied before the mark-up, before the profit margin is put on. So, when this became apparent, when people in the industry said, `We had better let Costello know that that teddy is actually not going to go down in price,' he had to lose the teddy bear. The hunt is on to find the teddy bear; this government now wants to hide that teddy bear because it is an embarrassment.
We have seen all sorts of allegations from this government about its modelling. This debate is about this parliament, the Australian community and those economic experts around this country who have stood up before and after the election and said, `Some of their assumptions are heroic, some of them are disgraceful and cannot be sustained with any intellectual rigour whatsoever.' The government withheld these papers. Even if you give them the benefit of the doubt about the 1.9 per cent and say, if you average it out, 1.9 per cent works, you have got serious economic forecasters, economic modellers, in this country saying they have used false assumptions, they have not put fair dinkum assumptions in there.
You have even had in today's paper the head of the government's retirement income modelling unit, Phil Gallagher, defending the documents released yesterday, saying they are a credible way to estimate the impact on low income earners. They are a very credible way. Surprisingly enough, in 1991, when this lot put up Fightback, guess which figures they used? The HES figures, the household expenditure survey figures. In 1985, when this country had a genuine debate about tax reform, when we had a summit, when we had debate right across the community for many months and full disclosure of Treasury documents, what figures were used? The HES figures, not some concoction by the government on a few bodgie bits of advice to Treasury—`Come on, find a decent figure that is not going to make it look as bad for us.' You have got the government's own people saying, `Just a minute, no, we do not think it is wrong.'
They have given the Vos committee 17 days. It was a joke. The Vos committee said it was a joke. They have been dragged kick 
 ing and screaming to this point today. They have said, `We do not want an inquiry.' Two weeks is all the Australian community got to have a good hard look at the assumptions in the Treasury modelling, two weeks before the government called the election. They have spent all that money—over the top—in the lead-up to the election in a couple of weeks. There has not been any fair dinkum scrutiny.
What we have seen is a tax package, as George Megalogenis says today in the Australian, that promotes, at best, if you give them the benefit of the doubt, a one per cent increase for pensioners—if you want to give them the benefit of the doubt, and I do not—yet will give a 10 per cent increase to people who earn more than $50,000. Is that fair? Is that equitable? Absolutely not. This chamber has every right to expose that through the committee process being proposed today. It is absolutely right to demand scrutiny. Why should 52 per cent of the tax cuts that this government is giving—over half—go to people who earn what I do? Why should I be part of the group that will get half of the total tax cuts when the pensioners in this country are going to get almost nothing—and that is if you are being generous.
I pose this question to people in the gallery and to members of this chamber: do you really believe that when the WST is taken off, the 22 per cent and the 32 per cent is removed, all those shops out there are going to drop their price from 22 per cent to 10 per cent, from 32 per cent to 10 per cent? Do you really believe that? If you do, you believe in Santa Claus. I certainly do not.
What does the government say to us? They say, `We have got Alan Fels and the ACCC. They are going to make sure there is no unfair profiteering.' Alan Fels would have to be in every single supermarket every single day to make sure that we do not get ripped off. I am not prepared to believe that Alan Fels could possibly do it—even if he had a doubling of his budget, even if he had nothing else to do in this country but to look at supermarket prices to stop profiteering. With the best faith in the world, he could not possibly do it. But this government wants you to believe, just because Alan Fels has been 
 put in charge of the issue, that the profiteering that will take place can be stopped. The chamber should vote for Senator Faulkner's motion and Senator Cook's amendment, because the Australian community deserves the right—
Senator Calvert interjecting—
—Don't you start, Senator Calvert. The Australian community deserve the right to have look at this package—the biggest ever tax reform in the history of Australia, according to the government—but they are only allowed two weeks. I urge the Senate to support Senator Cook's amendment and Senator Faulkner's motion, and I urge the Australian community: when you get the chance, put in a submission to these hearings. Do not be shy, come forward and put in submissions.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>References</title>,Committees,12,2
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-11-12,"—The starting point in this debate has to be the fact that we are not entering into a discussion on the GST cold. The GST was certainly the centrepiece of the 1993 election campaign; so there has been a long history in this country of opportunity for people to scrutinise the implications of the proposal.
Senator Conroy, of course, lets the cat out of the bag in a comprehensive fashion—I suppose revealing his relative inexperience in this jurisdiction. To concede as he did that this is about an unfair tax package is simply confirming what we all know, and that is that Labor does not have the slightest interest in any sort of sensible examination of a proposal. What Labor is interested in is exposing what it sees as the reasons not to support a GST. In other words, it wants to have a re-run of the election campaign.
Mr Howard did also, of course, announce more than 12 months before the election that the GST would be something we would take to the last election. It was, from then on, the centrepiece of the campaign and it remained so. What that means is that there are many organisations in the community who have had every opportunity to look at the implications. Certainly, since 3 October it has not been a matter of `whether'; it has been a matter of 
 `how'. Again, they have had every opportunity since 3 October to be putting together submissions, examining, engaging consultants and doing what that silly Senator Brown told us he did some time back, and that was to get the Democratic candidate in the last federal election, Crossley, to go around the world—
—A Green candidate.
—A Green candidate. Sorry, you are absolutely right. It was someone called Crossley, who I think claims to have a PhD, so presumably she charged them for the exercise. She went around the world. So why would there be a need, in those circumstances, for any further work to be done by Green groups? They have crawled all over this exhaustively. Of course, Senator Brown—and once again it is cat out of the bag stuff—started off by congratulating Senator Cook, who is basically adding on an amendment to examine alternative tax systems and alternative revenue raising proposals.
If you could ever imagine a better way of having an endless, ongoing, post-millennium discussion about tax reform, that is probably the best way of doing it; so Senator Brown's congratulations make it clear where he stands. He then went on to criticise the Democrats for not having an open mind—having told us that, as far as he is concerned, the Greens are totally opposed to a GST. It is ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous; and Senator Harradine was perfectly correct in objecting not only to the flawed logic but to the systematic way in which Senator Brown tries to verbal people on a regular basis. It is just appalling, and I can well understand Senator Lees's howls of anguish on that front.
The important thing to remember is this: having gone to the election, having had 12 months notice and having this matter subjected to exhaustive examination, one of the things we are entitled to—just putting aside mandate theory for a moment—as Senator Harradine did say, is the right to bring legislation before the parliament. Senator Harradine is partially correct: we also have a right to have legislation considered and voted upon by the parliament within a reasonable period of time. The time that elapses from 3 October to 30 June, for example, is pretty close to nine 
 months. If a government duly elected in the face of trenchant opposition, with a high risk strategy and a very controversial tax proposal as the centrepiece of its campaign, cannot have that proposal voted on within a period of nine months, then there is something seriously wrong with the democratic process in this country.
What we say is that the starting point is that you should absolutely commit to ensuring that, one way or another, we do not run out of time—in other words, that we are able to be absolutely certain before we embark on any committee process that, at the end of the day, there will be a vote. I accept entirely that Senator Harradine has given the government no reason to believe that his vote before 30 June would make us any better off, but he has said that we have no reason to believe that the government would be better off having its legislation voted on before 30 June. I am as much concerned about our right to have it voted on—good or bad, yes or no—as simply about outcome, because even if we lose we have got a right to bring it back to a subsequent parliament, post 30 June. But our right surely is not to have the thing filibustered to a point where, 12 months down the track, after it being the centrepiece of our campaign, and all that flows from that, it cannot get through the parliament. Then you are making the process unworkable.
If you look at what we think is a much more critical element than simply which matters ought to be under consideration by the committees, Senator Harradine says that it has been cut back from seven committees to four and that he would rather have more. I am not averse to that, much and all as we would argue that you really only need one committee, a legislation committee that can do the job that the Senate charged legislation committees with—and that is considering legislation—and it could go over every aspect of these bills. But, accepting Senator Harradine's point that he wants particular emphasis in a range of important areas, every time you increase the number of committees, you are spreading the burden and therefore reducing the total time that the Senate itself needs before it reports back. It seems to me 
 there is a trade-off there. If you have more committees, you need less time in a chronological sense than you would otherwise. Of course, what is being proposed—
—That is very strange mathematics—very strange.
—I know that simple logic is normally beyond you, so I am not expecting you to agree with me; but I just want this to be understood. There are four major pieces of legislation that are very useful precedents in terms of the duration of committees. With the Telstra (No. 1) legislation, the committee was in existence for just under 15 weeks; with Telstra (No. 2), it was just under eight weeks; with workplace relations in 1996, it was 12 weeks; with the euthanasia debate, it was 16 weeks.
If you were to establish the committee today, then you would have something in the order of 16 weeks, if you went through until early March. So you would be pretty much breaking the record just by having that as a report date. If you accept the fact that you have got four committees meeting simultaneously in tandem, then you can effectively say you have got four times that. So you have got 16 months worth of committee process running.
Even if we accept that the GST is more significant than those other pieces of legislation—and that is in the eye of the beholder—it just seems to me to be totally out of proportion to suggest that somehow we should go on and on. Labor wants it to go on and on to the point where we never get to a vote.
What concerns us about the Democrats' time frame is that you get to the end of May and then you have to get an assessment of the separate references committees and then you have to get a government response. It is not difficult to envisage a situation in which some would claim that the government response was not adequate, that it did not amount to a response, and that, therefore, we still should not commence the debate. Time is running out, and it is almost inevitable in those circumstances that you simply would not get to a vote on this legislation. Just in passing, let me remind the Senate that we also have the budget legislation, Telstra and a range of 
 other matters that are certainly entitled to consideration during that same period of time.
 You would be left with maybe a couple of weeks in June to consider, debate and vote on what you regard as the most important legislation. I will give two examples of how easy it is to ensure that the debate could go on and on in this chamber. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 was debated in this chamber for nine weeks. The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 was debated in this chamber for 11 weeks.
I can well recall in the debate on the Telstra bill Senator Schacht, who was handling it for the opposition, being told time and again by his own colleagues to cut it short, and by his standards he probably did. He has a constitutional incapacity to say anything in a reasonable length of time. He is always wanting to add more and more but, by his standards perhaps, he was reasonably restrained.
—You should talk.
—I responded. I did not seek to extend the debate. All I am saying is that it is so easy to have these things go on and on. With the best will in the world, if Senator Harradine, the Greens and the Democrats all signed a pact under seal that they would not ask a single question during the committee process, there would be nothing to stop this mob doing it endlessly. If you can take 11 weeks on the Telstra legislation without really trying, just imagine how long it would take if you set your mind to it. In other words, your approach gives them carte blanche to ensure that this package of bills could not possibly be voted on before 30 June next year.
That is a travesty of justice. It is an outrage and an offence to the whole parliamentary process to think that the centrepiece of a government's election campaign—on which it had given formal notice 12 months before and which was, in some respects, a re-run of an exercise conducted five years ago, on which every interest group has had every opportunity over many months to look at the implications and to raise them during the campaign—should nonetheless mean that we are not entitled to have a vote within nine 
 months of that seminal election event. That is the nub of this whole debate.
Our starting point is that we do not see a need for more than one legislation committee. We accept the reality that there are enough people around here who take the view that there ought to be a committee process, and that is pretty commonplace in the Senate, so it is then a matter of how many and how long, and that is where we are at. If it is a question of a choice between those two, there is no doubt about what is of paramount importance to us. The ultimate critical event is that there is time available—not just, `We think that four weeks is good enough or eight weeks is good enough.'
It is crystal clear, if you look at those two precedents of workplace relations and Telstra, that even three months would be a risk, unless you nailed it down, unless you were able to give an absolute commitment that you would ensure that a vote occurred, not just at the 11th hour of the 11th day and not after the Senate had sat night and day for three months straight. You ought to allow a sufficient period of time.
If we took the end of February, which is sort of a mid point between what we formally have on the record and what we have had some discussion about, we would have four months. As I have pointed out, that would allow a committee process of about 15½ to 16 weeks, which is pretty close to the record period of time. You are multiplying that by four. You could extend that a bit if you liked but, at the end of the day, you must acknowledge that you need something like three months at least in order to ensure that not only this legislation but also budget legislation and other critical bills are given a fair chance. This legislation, in particular, should be given a guaranteed chance of being voted on otherwise the whole game is a charade.
If that is really what it is all about, that you effectively want to have the legislation delayed forever and a day, in the old days that would have been a failure to pass—and I think you would be getting perilously close to that situation. Labor make no bones about it. That is their position. Whether the Governor-General would take the same view of other 
 parties in the Senate would be a matter of judgment. But, given what I have said, I would be confident that, if you were to allow anything like only a month or two, it would be perfectly clear what the ultimate objective was if you did not have it surrounded by guarantees and if by one mechanism or another you did not commit to ensuring that a vote could occur—and there is absolutely no confidence that that could be the case based on the motions that have been put down to date.
Even a delay in establishing the committees today will effectively mean waiting another 10 days. There is no reason why that needs to occur. If we got the committees up and running today, we could call for submissions at the weekend. There are any number of people who would be ready to put in their submissions. In fact, Senator Cook pointed out that the Vos committee had 17 days and managed to attract 250 submissions. They did not have any difficulty in putting those submissions together in a very short space of time. All those submissions could be considered by the committees. We could have hearings in December, which is a month or more away in terms of an appropriate committee date, and we could start to make some real progress on hearings.
Of course you do not need to hear from every submittee. We all know that there will be many individual submissions. There will be an orchestrated campaign run by the trade union movement with its usual unlimited resources to run political campaigns on these matters. There will be hundreds of submissions about the inequities and the perfidiousness of the proposal in terms of its impact on the trade union movement. I think you would need deal with that only in a very short form because it will be utterly repetitious. So a lot of the submissions can be boiled down to critical areas. By allocating them out to various committees, you are able to make very significant progress.
You could have five or six weeks of hearings set aside, even to the point of forgoing debate in the Senate. In other words, the Senate would not sit for the periods for which we had otherwise scheduled sittings in Feb 
 ruary to enable the committees to have top priority. So we are bending over backwards. I make the point again that all these dates that have been put down have been irrespective of the sitting pattern; in other words, they have been ambit claims effectively because they have not looked at what time might be available. Once we take a decision to forgo some weeks of sittings, we make it that much easier for the committees to get on with their work. There is goodwill on our side. We are prepared to be reasonable, but it has to be on the basis that at the end of the day there is more than adequate time available to ensure proper debate and consideration and a vote on this legislation without prejudice to budget legislation and other critical bills.
There is no doubt that there would be a high-powered secretariat established. There would probably need to be a number of them so the whole committee process will be brought to bear on this exercise. I would have thought that even most of the non-profit organisations and other charities to which Senator Lees refers would have organised their arguments well before this point in time, certainly since 3 October. Clearly you will need to look at particular elements of the legislation as we always do, but at the end of the day most of this discussion is not about the fine print, the detail. As far as Labor is concerned, as Senator Conroy obligingly told us, it is about an unfair tax proposal. So we know the extent to which detail will be considered by the Labor Party and no doubt the Greens, who are implacably opposed to the package.
So there will be ample opportunity. I think it is reasonable to expect people to be working on these matters in December; after all, this parliament has sat until as late as 23 December in years gone by. We have just had a month or more off after the election. The public does expect us to be prepared to work during January. To set a closing date for submissions that is so far out that it just happens to coincidently ensure that everyone is able to have a good six, eight, nine weeks holiday just after you have had a month off and been back in the parliament for two days 
 I think will be very poorly received by the community at large.
So if we are all fair dinkum, there are ways in which you can ensure that justice is met and that every opportunity is available, but at the end of the day there is a sufficient period of time in order to enable this legislation to be voted on. That is our bottom line. We are not prepared to countenance what is essentially a charade of saying, `The last week in May and then further consideration by the committees and then awaiting a response from the government and then, presumably, a response from others.' There is no guarantee of anything in any of that.
It would be a very simple matter for a majority of votes in this parliament to ensure that the debate never got under way. As we all know, every vote is critical. You need only an equality of votes to block the passage of legislation or the continuation debate. Without those sorts of guarantees then it seems to me you are simply embarking on an exercise which everyone can predict will result in no GST tax reform package being properly considered, supported or voted down by the end of June next year. Whether or not you think that is a critical date, just ask yourselves: is nine months after an election a reasonable period in which a government should be entitled to expect that the centrepiece of its campaign will be considered by both houses of parliament?",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>References</title>,Committees,12,2
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-11-12,"—I am sure the Senate will be pleased to hear that I do not intend to take much of its time. I have a couple of things. Firstly, I was very pleased to hear Senator Brown say that he does not want to misrepresent what the Democrats say. That will make a really delightful change for all of us and I look forward to it.
Secondly, the government seems to be particularly concerned about a government response being required as part of Senator Lees's amendment to this motion before the bills can be considered. I am sure the current government remembers that in June 1996 it committed itself to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation. I have got the 
 list here of all the government responses to committee reports for the first half of this year and there have been only two since then. Ignoring the two responses since then, which I will not mention, there were 31 responses received, one of them was within the three-month response time which the government has committed itself to—and that was two months and two weeks—30 of those 31 took more than three months, 28 took more than six months, 16 took more than a year, five took more than two years and two took more than three years.
One particularly interesting response is the final response to Off the record: shield laws for journalists' confidential sources, a report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Senate Standing Committee. I did not remember this one, which is really no surprise because the final government response to that has not been received yet and the report was tabled on 10 October 1994. So it is so far more than four years out of date and we still have not had a final response to that one.
So the government does not really have its act together on government responses. I understand that the relevant government departments get those responses together well and truly within the three months in general, but the ministers do not seem to be able to sign off on them within those three months. It would be very good practice for the government to have a government response ready to go within three months after the committees have reported. I am sure that this would not be a great difficulty for the government because there are several people within Treasury and Finance who are very au fait with this legislation and who could quite easily monitor what is going on in the committees because they will have several officers who will be covering absolutely everything that is going on in those committees. They will be able to draft responses for the government as we go along.
We should keep in mind that there are three response times in Senator Lees's amendment as well. This would not be a hardship on the government. In fact, it would be extremely good practice for the government. By the end of it, perhaps it would be able to get a final 
 report together for the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report which is more than four years old.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>References</title>,Committees,12,2
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-12,"—I do not know how many senators in this chamber or people in the community watched a drama series recently on the rise of fascism in Britain which portrayed the rise of the influence of Moseley in Britain. One thing I do recall from that drama series was that, when Moseley was on the hustings at one particular point, he said, `I don't know who will win this election, but the one thing I hope is that whoever wins is given the right to govern.' I would have to say that that is probably very indicative of what is happening with parliamentary democracy in Australia. There is an assumption—I would say very close to a fascist assumption—that, somehow or other, the way executive government and party politics in Australia has developed means that the electorate, the community, the public and the parliament lose all ability to have a say once one party crawls over the line in any way, shape or form.
That is not the way the constitution of Australia is written. The way the constitution of Australia is written is that we are all charged as parliamentary representatives to represent our electorates. We are all charged to represent our principles, and obviously those principles we have represented to our electorate. The right to govern was never in the Australian constitution, never has been and is not in the Australian constitution. The right to form a government is there, but it is basically about good governance. It is not about autocracy. It is not about winner takes all. It is not about abusing the democratic process. That is what I believe is happening in this whole debate.
Although we have heard Senator Alston say in his contributions on several occasions that the coalition—he says the coalition, but you would have to say the Liberal Party, and it was not even a full coalition, as we well know—went to the people with the GST as their centrepiece, you might be excused for saying that that was the only policy that they went to the people with. However, they are going to come in again and again every time 
 the Senate wishes to represent the views of the community, the views of the electorate, and say, `We have a mandate for this, that and the other.'
Remember that any time the Senate wished to review or amend any piece of legislation before the last election they spat the dummy. They said, `We are the government. We have the right to govern. We have a mandate.' So it does not really matter. They went with one aspect to the election. The opposition went with the opposite, but we have this concept that whatever executive government want they have the right to demand, whether or not it is what the Australian people want, whether or not it is good for the Australian people, and whether or not we even know what it is. The answer is that we do not. We have not seen the legislation. It has not been presented to the House of Representatives. The legislation does not exist.
We are being told that we are being outrageous for asking for full public scrutiny for legislation that does not even exist—not just in the Senate but in the House of Representatives. We have a committee still looking to see what health is, what education is, how you define where the limits are and how you can do this in a way that can be imposed by law or regulation. We do not even know what the legislation looks like yet.
Senator Alston also said that every interest group has had every opportunity over many months. As I say, we have not seen the legislation. What a load of nonsense! That could not be further from the truth. The firm position of the Greens (WA) is and was that the government has got it the wrong way around. If they want tax reform, then get groups in the community, interest groups and people with knowledge and acumen together to form the basis of a tax reform to get the interest groups and the community's involvement at the earliest possible stage. But that is not what the government did. They said, `We know it all. We've got an idea and we are going to put it to you, all or nothing.'
If you recall, before the election the Prime Minister said again and again and again that tax reform was not spelt G-S-T. He and the government said on many occasions, includ 
 ing in this chamber, that you cannot and should not consider that the GST is the whole package. They said that you cannot look at a GST without looking at the package of what business tax is doing and what income tax is doing. What we are being asked to do—what the government is insisting on—is to vote on and consider the GST without the business tax package, without the income tax package. They have already gone back on their very basic, most important claim that you cannot consider the GST outside the context of business tax changes and income tax.
So here we go, already. Yes, we are going to deal with a GST and we are going to isolate it out from the business tax. How can we look at fairness? How can we look at workability? How can we look at equity issues and the impact on employment and the impact on regions without looking at what the business community have literally been given months to look at—that is, their own tax proposals? They have been given, because it is going to take them such a long time, an extension. So they cannot do it by May. They have to do it after we look at it in the Senate.
 This is an outrage. The government are saying that tax reform for them does equal a GST. They want to take a reductionist approach, and they want to use this as a means of abusing the Senate—and I do mean abusing the Senate. I do not know how long it will take, and I do not know what mechanism the government will use, but I think the rhetoric has been there for the last few months—obstructive Senate, abuse of power. I think very soon the government, and potentially the opposition, will move to get rid of the influence of the minor parties in the Senate, to get rid of the voice of the community, to get rid of the voting system that allows the community—industry, small business, regional Australia, local government, farming groups, community interest groups, environment groups, you name it—to have a say within our democratic process. I believe that we will see some move within a relatively short time.
Today we have already heard Senator Alston talk of double dissolution triggers. The last contribution but one was about setting up 
 potential double dissolution triggers. If the government is going to spit the dummy to that extent—`we want everything we want, despite the fact that the majority of the people of Australia voted for parties that opposed a GST, or we will threaten to go to another election'—I wonder what kind of anti-small party package might be included in any such move. I wonder what collusion there could be in bringing about the changes we have seen in Tasmania.
I wonder where the changes will be and when they will try to stop the community from having a say through the democratic process and through the ability of small parties in the Senate to speak outside the shackles of party discipline. That is the travesty we are seeing today. The flawed concept of mandate, as Mr Howard very rightly put it a few years ago, is the flawed concept of parties voting as one vote outside any concept of representing their electorate, outside any concept of representing the community and outside any concept of the fact that in the parliament we are presented with little bits of information by little bits of information. We can never know all there is to know about the legislation if the legislation has not been presented, and it has not.
How many times have we seen proposals put to the electorate, put to the parliament, and they have changed significantly from when they have been proposed to when we are asked to vote on them? How many times have we seen elements put into legislation that are thoroughly distasteful and odious? Quite frankly, we have seen it on many occasions. When the Labor Party were in government they did the same—omnibus packages of legislation. The coalition have done it on several occasions.
We have not seen the legislation. We do not know what is going to be in it. Even if the vast majority of the community were relaxed and comfortable about the idea of a GST—and, quite frankly, that is clearly and provably not true—we would all be wondering how it would work. We would all be wondering how the details of the legislation and the details of the regulation would lead to an outcome. We would all be wondering how it would be 
 implemented. We would all be wondering how the safeguards would be implemented. We would all be wondering what the compensation packages would do in reality. We would all be wondering what real people would suffer. We would all be wondering what the impact would be on small businesses and other communities.
This debate is about the tax package. Do you know what I find is the most extraordinary thing about this whole debate? Here we debating the GST as if it were the most important thing in the Australian parliament. Obviously, I believe it should have proper scrutiny. Senator Harradine talked about a vote that took place in the Queensland parliament last night. There was more than one vote in the Queensland parliament last night. There was, I believe, a unanimous vote—all parties and independents—in the Queensland parliament for changes to the national competition policy.
The Australian community is not only worried about the impact of a major tax change but also worried about the real impact that the national competition policy is having on a daily and weekly basis on their mode of operation, their continued programs, and their ability to operate. This area got almost no debate in this parliament, except for those people representing minor parties and Independents. There was collusion between the two old parties, and a decision was made which is only now beginning to hit the Australian community as to the wide ranging and future implications. The Queensland parliament voted unanimously that the national competition policy had to be changed.
I want to know where this debate was during the election campaign. If we are going to talk about mandates, who ever put the concept of national competition policy to the Australian electorate? Who ever put the concept of global free trade to an Australian electorate? On a daily basis, these are the issues that are having a comprehensive and sometimes devastating impact on just about everyone in the Australian community—rural community, regional community, local government, industry, health, education, you name it.
Where is the debate? Where is the outrage from the opposition side? Where was the debate during the election campaign? Where was the so-called mandate, if you ever agreed with the concept of mandate? Where was the moral or electoral authority to devastate the whole way the Australian community operates and hand power to big business? Where was that mandate? Where was that authority? It did not exist. It did not exist then and it does not exist now.
Here we are talking about a major tax issue—and I agree it is a major tax debate, which has wide ranging implications—yet major changes affecting the Australian community were really not debated at all. I was abused at the time for even suggesting amendments to the national competition policy. Changes were made within this chamber and almost no amendments were agreed to in the national interest, the public interest. It is a nonsense that has been perpetrated on the Australian public.
We have to put this whole debate within the context of what is really happening in the Australian community. The context is that democracy in Australia has reached a very low point. It has reached the point where the real issues and implications for the Australian people are ignored. The big issues are not even debated between the major parties. Issues like global free trade and the Multilateral Agreement on Investment are passed by on an ongoing basis. Therefore, we get a sham argument; a sham debate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>References</title>,Committees,12,2
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-11-12,"—Firstly, I signal to the Labor Party that the Democrats accept Senator Cook's amendment to our amendment, and from the point of view of formality, we should record that. I wish to speak only briefly, because most of the points that need to be made have been made.
The government is quite right, in that an election did return the government. But an election has two functions: not only to return the government, in which there are realistically only three parties competing—the National Party and Liberal Party in coalition and the Labor Party—but to return the parliament. In returning the parliament, there are dozens of 
 parties and independents competing and the parliament reflects the totality of that contest.
Those two sets of people returned have two entirely different jobs. The government and executive have the job of putting forward their agenda and proposals, and the parliament has the job of reviewing and amending those proposals. Unfortunately, in the lower house they do not have the numbers to do that, but if Labor did have the numbers to do that, the legislation which reached this Senate would be in an entirely different form to that which reaches here at present. The job primarily falls on the Senate to do that review and amendment job.
The government needs to accept that, whilst the end of this process may be a package on their tax system which is not entirely acceptable to them, it will result in a package which is a lot more acceptable to the Australian people.
Of course, the will of the people as expressed on 3 October will be delayed before its full expression on 1 July. But we recognise, as does everybody else here, that we still have to get on with the job and deal with what is before us. In a sense, we have to put that consideration aside.
One of the matters raised is the issue of a tax system versus a tax. The Labor Party quite rightly contested the election on the primary ground of the government, which was on the GST. We all know that the GST is but one component—and an important component—of an entirely new tax system. This Senate review process, which the Labor Party, ourselves, other minor parties and independents agreed with—and which was belatedly joined by the government—is designed to look at the new tax system, not just the GST.
The Australian Democrats will approach this review process on this basis. When the review is completed and when the amendments go through to the legislation that will be before us, we will then make a decision in terms of the totality of that package as to whether we vote for or against the government's total package as amended.
We expect that within the legislation discussion there will be shifting alliances of govern 
 ment, minor parties, independents and Labor, depending on the issue that is before them. I do not know yet where Labor will stand on the final income tax cuts that go through, on the diesel and other excise issues or on the poverty trap issues. And quite rightly so, because they have not seen the legislation and have not had the opportunity to have the detail of those things put before them. Their views may well coincide on some matters with the government's and on other matters they may not. We do know that Labor is utterly opposed to the GST and that is a legitimate position, but they might have a cooperative view with the government on other matters within the tax proposal.
To vilify Labor in this debate as being automatically obstructionist, automatically opposed and not acting in the national interest is quite wrong. They have legitimately said, `Let us look at the entire tax proposal. You know our views on some core issues, but we do want to be able to contribute to the total approach and review.' Indeed, that is our approach as well.
I am distressed that the government has arrived at consideration of the Senate committee at such a late stage. I will contrast the attitude of the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer with those of another minister who, on the Monday after election—Monday, 6 October—rang me about his program and said, `Look, I know you are opposed on a number of these things, but it falls into your portfolio area. Would you discuss with me what is to come up?' Neither I nor my leader, as far as I am aware—but certainly not I, as the taxation spokesperson—was ever rung or contacted by any government figure to say, `Let us discuss the possibility of a Senate committee.'
You might certainly be opposed to a Senate committee, but if you know the numbers in the Senate, you would certainly have up your sleeve that if there is going to be one, you would try to influence the shape of it. It was not until we put out our terms of reference two days ago that the government finally came to talk to us.
Now I would suggest that is the wrong way to approach the Senate and to approach the 
 realities of the numbers. Labor had clearly signalled they wanted a review and so had every other participant. We think a review is desirable. I would hope that, as this process develops, the government with regard to the tax issues will become far more forthcoming and cooperative in terms of dealing with the committees that are going to handle this matter.
I would stress that the Democrats began the process of development of their recommendations weeks and weeks ago, and we have consulted widely to do so. We are particularly grateful for the input and contribution from Senator Harradine. We were aware of the needs of the Greens and Labor, and that has been very helpful. But up until two days ago, as far as we were concerned, the government's position on the Senate inquiry was none—not at all—and they were not interested. So, of course, we did not talk to them. I regret we have now got to this stage where the easy resolution of this matter has been forced to a considerable debate.
With regard to the length of time that is to be taken, I would remind the Senate that the government itself took 14 months to arrive at its new tax system. We know that with other inquiries, as Senator Bourne has outlined, they take a great deal of time. We do not consider six months as a lengthy time to address a new tax system.
The final point I would make with regard to this tax review that we are discussing is I believe that the result of this will be, to some extent, similar to the result of the industry reference review, and that is that process of careful examination of a very thorny area of policy resulted in a great contribution to ourselves, to Labor, to the government's view of where they should be going in terms of industry policy.
We do not hold the view that the government have all the answers on tax. We are hopeful that Labor as the alternative government in opposition will use this process to flesh out and develop their own theories and policies on tax as well as using it as a mechanism to respond to the government's view, because you, like us and like them, are as 
 interested in this tax system as is the whole of Australia.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>References</title>,Committees,12,2
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-12,"—If I can speak in reply to this very important debate on the nature of the Senate committee inquiry that this chamber may determine and I suppose the more fundamental issue of whether this particular matter is of such significance that a Senate committee is warranted. We have before the chair the proposal that I have moved on behalf of the opposition, which I have already commended to the Senate and, I hope, argued persuasively is indeed the best way for this particular chamber to proceed.
 We also have before us now an amendment moved to this proposal by Senator Lees. In essence, Senator Lees is proposing now an overarching inquiry by the Senate Economics References Committee, which will deal first with an examination of the assumptions and modelling behind the government's tax proposals. Then that initial inquiry by the Senate Economics References Committee will inform four separate, more focused, specialist inquiries conducted by four of the Senate references committees—the Community Affairs References Committee; the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee; the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee; and also the Economics References Committee itself.
 Under Senator Lees's new proposal, the plan is that reports from those four references committees will again, if you like, inform the third phase of the Senate Economic References Committee's work. The proposal is that that particular references committee complete its work by reporting by the last Thursday in May. To that particular amendment from Senator Lees, Senator Cook has moved an amendment on behalf of the opposition, which again I commend to the chamber, to make a very significant improvement to those terms of reference that are before the chamber via Senator Lees's amendment to my substantive proposition. 
So the time has come for the Senate to make a decision about the nature of the committee inquiry it will conduct, if, in fact, it sees and deems fit to conduct any committee inquiry at all. The government has made its position clear: it does not want scrutiny; it does not want a parliamentary committee inquiry into this issue. I do not think Australians can trust Mr Howard and Mr Costello on this issue. You cannot trust them on their intentions. We have had a recent injection of Mr Costello into this particular debate. I noticed that poor old Mr Costello, the Treasurer, has been unfavourably compared to—of all people—Mr Reith because of his lack of negotiating skills for the government in relation to the Senate. What an indictment of Mr Costello to be unfavourably compared to Mr Reith. But, as I said earlier, Mr Costello has to remember this: this is not a threat—
—Who was the negotiation on workplace relations with? Senator Kernot. Where is she now?
—As far as I know, Senator Harradine, I am very pleased to say she is the member for Dickson in the House of Representatives. That is exactly where she is, and every Labor senator is delighted to see that former Senator Kernot was elected.
I think Senator Harradine understands because this is the view that Senator Harradine himself has put so strongly in the public debate over the last couple of days. The message does not seem to have sunk in to Mr Costello and the government. This is what Senator Harradine and others are saying, and Mr Costello perhaps should remember it: no proper inquiry; no GST. That is your message, Senator Harradine—who interjects in the chamber.
Mr Howard says that his so-called reform is a great tax adventure and the greatest economic reform of his whole time in politics. But Mr Howard is trying to force, using the vote of Senator Colston, some form of shotgun inquiry. That is a mechanism, of course, to deal with as little of the substance of the government's intentions as possible. The opposition will not sign up to a Howard-Colston shotgun inquiry. You cannot trust this government on this issue. You cannot trust a 
 government trying to shoehorn an issue as important as this through the Senate with no appropriate level of Senate scrutiny and investigation. We say that a Senate committee inquiry has to be broad ranging, it has to be thorough and it has to be conducted at a higher level. That is why we believe our proposal before the chair is the best way of achieving that outcome. Of course, if the government was fair dinkum about decent reform, it would also endorse and support a broad ranging inquiry, but it is not.
I want to debunk Mr Costello's fundamental argument—parroted in here again by his liegeman, Senator Alston, during the debate—that there is no point in having a Senate inquiry because the Labor Party has made up its mind on the issue of the GST. You have to have a memory in this business. You have to remember what others do. I recall that in 1994 Mr Costello, a member of the then Liberal-National Party opposition, had responsibility for the Labor government's employee share ownership legislation. I want to remind the Senate and coalition senators what Mr Costello said at that time. Let me quote this to the Senate. Mr Costello said:
We are going to vote against the Government's proposal to extend fringe benefits tax to employee ownership schemes. We will defeat it in the Senate and we will initiate a Senate inquiry to have a look at the whole matter . . . 
That was Mr Costello's approach on that legislation at that time, and he has the hide to turn up here to this debate and hypocritically argue that the Labor Party should not support an inquiry if we intend to vote against the legislation.
But, of course, there has been another development in the Senate today that will possibly have an impact on the votes on the motion and the amendments that are now before the chair, and I think it is worth placing this on the public record. In this chamber this morning for the first time since March 1997, the government has accepted the tainted vote of Senator Colston. As a result, the balance of votes in the Senate has been changed quite drastically.
This morning, the Senate dealt with two motions which were determined and negatived 
 on the vote of Senator Colston voting with the government. The first motion was one standing in the name of my colleague Senator Bolkus for the production of documents on the approvals process for the Jabiluka mine and Jabiluka mill alternative—I think most senators would agree that this was a very important question before the chair. That was negatived because the votes were equal, with Senator Colston voting with the government. A motion standing in the name of Senator Margetts, proposing an order for the production of documents by Senator Kemp relating to an interim report by the Ralph review, was also negatived as a result of an equal vote in the Senate this morning.
This is the first time since March 1997 that the government has accepted Senator Colston's tainted vote. We now face a Howard-Colston axis on matters of public policy. Mr Howard and Senator Colston are joined at the hip. Do not forget that, in April last year, Mr Howard was finally forced to cut Senator Colston loose when he said:
Now what we have done has been measured, responsible, correct. What I am announcing this morning is a very, very clear measure to the people of Australia that, until this matter is cleared up, we are not going to accept Senator Colston's vote.
He said he would not accept that tainted vote until the issues, the charges, relating to Senator Colston were resolved. They have not been resolved. Mr Howard did not canvass this issue at any time during or before the federal election. He made this announcement at the commencement of the new parliament. As I say, this is an outrageous decision, a decision that smacks of nothing but political opportunism from the Prime Minister.
His original decision to reject Senator Colston's vote had nothing to do with the principle of the presumption of innocence and his backflip on that matter has absolutely nothing to do with the principle of the presumption of innocence either. Mr Howard made clear when he made his statement in 1997 that, in relation to Senator Colston's vote—when he was forced into that position by public and parliamentary pressure from the Labor Party—it was a matter of asserting higher standards. Of course, now those higher standards have evaporated on the third day of 
 the sitting of this new parliament—the third day of the sitting of parliament in Mr Howard's second term.
Mr Acting Deputy President, I cannot say what the likely fate is of either of the two amendments or the substantive motion that stands in my name, as a result of the decision by Mr Howard to accept the tainted vote of Senator Colston. I can acknowledge that the Australian Democrats, the Greens senators and Senator Harradine have worked hard to try and reach an acceptable compromise position in relation to the process that a GST inquiry would follow. It is not our preferred position—the amendment that Senator Lees moves is not the preferred position of the opposition. Our position, as you know and as I have outlined before, is for a cleaner, better sort of inquiry that is wide-ranging in its effect and would lead to a better outcome. But we, along with others, have worked hard to try and reach an acceptable compromise in relation to the nature of the Senate inquiry to deal with this very important issue.
As far as the opposition is concerned, we have moved from our position of having one references committee. We would have preferred a select committee in the first instance, for the reasons I outlined previously, but we have moved from one references committee that would have carefully, closely and thoroughly examined this issue to now the amendment before the chair where four references committees will be involved. But, importantly, there will be an overarching role and responsibility for the Economics References Committee, which is something that the Labor Party does welcome. The government itself argued for no inquiry, and then came and laid on the table yesterday a proposal for three inquiries. And I know the Democrats preferred seven references committees and another committee—a total of eight committees—and have come back to four references committees looking at this particular issue.
So there has been compromise around the chamber. What we cannot say, as a result of that compromise, is that the proposal that stands in Senator Lees's name will necessarily be accepted by the chamber. Of course, if other non-government senators see fit to 
 support this particular position, then quite clearly this can be sunk by the votes of the government and Senator Colston. Even if all the other non-government senators combine, the Howard-Colston axis can sink this inquiry. As I said, it is quite clear from voting patterns in the Senate today that Mr Howard and Senator Colston are joined at the hip.
We believe Senator Colston's vote should not be accepted by the government. We believe that Mr Howard should have maintained the position he was forced to accept in early 1997. We believe that if there was to be a change, Mr Howard should have been honest enough to announce it, either before or during the election campaign, so Australians might have taken that into their consideration as they cast their vote for the House of Representatives and Senate on 3 October. Of course he did not because Mr Howard is not serious about asserting parliamentary standards.
The Labor Party is serious about having the best possible inquiry into the GST proposals of the government. We are serious about a thorough and high-level inquiry. But we are also serious about ensuring that we work towards trying to achieve a consensus position as we know our preferred position will not be accepted by a majority of senators in the chamber. It is for those reasons that the opposition will support the amendment that stands in Senator Lees's name with, of course, the amendment that has been proposed by Senator Cook. I commend Senator Cook's amendment to the chamber.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-11-12,"—by leave—I move:
That business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2 standing in her name for today, relating to the reference of matters to certain committees, be postponed till a later hour.
I seek leave to make a brief explanation as to why. 
—I put the question that the motion moved by Senator Lees be agreed to.
—Point of order, Madam President: given the Senator Lees has sought leave to make an explanation about the motion before the chair, I just respectfully suggest—and I am sure that the Senate will grant leave—that it would be useful to hear the explanation before the question is put.
—Senator Lees could actually speak to the motion.
—She could indeed, but she has actually sought leave to make an explanation.
—Is leave granted for Senator Lees to make a short explanation? There being no objection, leave is granted.
—As we all saw from the votes a moment ago, we do not even have reasonable cooperation any longer. Not even the matter that was of concern to the Labor Party could be amended into my motion. Fair enough, my motion went down because you still have a major problem with timing. But then there was the process of forcing us through to having to vote again to say that the Labor Party's motion of one committee could not be accepted. I think basically everything has fallen apart.
The government—and I thank Senator Campbell for this—has approached Senator Harradine and myself and suggested that we may have an opportunity to meet briefly and discuss before the end of question time another proposal that the government wishes to put to us on timing. I am giving no undertaking of anything other than to listen and to keep discussing with the government, because I think where we are heading at the end of the day is toward no inquiry.
I have just sought leave to propose my motion so we can continue at a later hour this day and still try to get an inquiry. If all my motions go down—as Senator Colston has just voted against them, I presume they may well go down again without the government's support—we are running very quickly into a dead-end, but I am determined to do what I can in the next couple of hours to see if we 
 can avoid that and then report back to my colleagues as to what the new offer is from the government.
—Senator Lees has moved a motion to postpone business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2. Do you wish to speak by leave, Senator Faulkner?",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Taxation Package: References to Committees</title>,Business,13,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-12,"—No, I want to speak to the motion. Madam President, can I indicate that the opposition will support the procedural motion before the chair that has been moved by Senator Lees. I do not accept part of Senator Lees's explanation to the Senate that everything has broken down. I really do think a more thorough analysis is required in relation to the votes that have just been held in the Senate. I think that is required.
The situation is this: in March, 1997, the Prime Minister indicated that the government would not be accepting the tainted vote of Senator Colston until the matters relating to Senator Colston had been finalised. He made it absolutely clear that that was the position of the government and that the government, of course, had been forced to that position by sustained public and parliamentary pressure—public pressure and parliamentary pressure from the Labor Party. The Prime Minister was dragged kicking and screaming to the announcement that he made but, nevertheless, he was forced to that position.
I want to remind senators what Mr Howard said in April last year. Let me quote the Prime Minister:
Now what we have done has been measured, responsible, correct. What I am announcing this morning is a very, very clear message to the people of Australia, that until this matter is cleared up we are not going to accept Senator Colston's vote.
The Prime Minister said he would not accept this tainted vote, until the matters relating to Senator Colston and the charges that Senator Colston faced were resolved. Those charges have not been resolved.
Nothing has changed in relation to the situation that the Prime Minister was referring to. Only one thing has changed since April last year, and that is Mr Howard the Prime Minister's desperate effort in terms of the 
 need for Senator Colston's vote to deliver a policy—the GST policy—that most Australians would prefer him not to deliver. That is the only thing that has changed.
What we have from the Prime Minister and the government that we have seen now in a number of questions put before the Senate today is political opportunism at its worst. It is totally unprincipled for this government to change their approach in relation to accepting the tainted vote of Senator Colston. That is the proper analysis that should be made in relation to the compromise motion that was defeated before this chamber.
I have to say that I did predict in an earlier speech today that this was a very likely outcome and that there was a very distinct possibility these motions would go down on equal voting. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, Mr Howard did not make his position in relation to accepting Senator Colston's vote clear before or during the election campaign. Not only has he accepted Senator Colston's vote; in our view he has actively solicited it.
We say, as the Prime Minister said in 1997, that this issue is an issue of parliamentary standards. This is an issue of parliamentary standards and the Prime Minister's parliamentary standards really speak for themselves. I think that is a more accurate analysis of the reasons that we have seen these particular motions defeated before the chair in relation to the establishment of a possible Senate inquiry into the issue of the GST. It is the same reason that we saw two motions defeated this morning: one that stood in the name of Senator Bolkus in relation to the production of documents for the Jabiluka mine and another that stood in the name of Senator
Margetts. The reason is that the Prime Minister and the government now accept Senator Colston's tainted vote. I think that needs to be made absolutely clear. The Labor Party agrees with the Prime Minister: it is an issue of standards and we see this as the most sleazy, opportunistic and unprincipled move imaginable.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Taxation Package: References to Committees</title>,Business,13,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-12,"—The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1998  seeks to extend the operations of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 for three years, to the end of 2001. This act, commonly known as the ESOS Act, was introduced in response to a situation which developed around 10 years ago with regard to the credibility and financial viability of some providers of education for overseas students.
The act requires that only providers listed on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions 
 and Courses for Overseas Students, CRICOS, may offer courses to overseas students. These providers must operate a Notified Trust Account, designed to ensure refunds are available to students in circumstances where a provider defaults. Providers must also make tuition guarantee arrangements before enrolling students, including membership of a Tuition Assurance Scheme to offer alternative placement of students if necessary.
The operation of the ESOS Act was reviewed in 1996 by Ernst and Young. The review canvassed a number of regulatory models. While problems have been identified, particularly in South Australia and Queensland, there was widespread support for the current three-tier model of regulation, which shares responsibility between the Commonwealth, states, territories and the industry. On that basis the ESOS Act's sunset clause was extended to 1 January 1999.
The consultations with industry associations, and government agencies, took place during April and May this year, and support for existing arrangements remain strong. On that basis, the opposition supports the proposal to extend the life of the ESOS Act for a further three years.
The seven-fold growth of the education export industry over the years since the act's introduction has highlighted the importance of the industry to Australia and the need to 
 ensure confidence in it. In 1997, 151,464 overseas students were studying in Australia generating revenue of more than $3.2 billion. This type of growth is not likely to continue, however. In the future, we will need to work harder for our educational export dollars.
In the summary of his report `The Asian deflation in Australian education', Professor Raoul Mortley points out that `the most realistic forecasts indicate little growth above the 1996 levels' and that Australia faces a `more competitive world in education'. While Professor Mortley focused on only the Asian region, this is the region that is the source of 77 per cent of Australia's overseas students.
The government has refused to release the full report so speculation is bound to occur about just what Professor Mortley has found. Yet, as it seems he has identified some significant problems, it raises the question of what the government will do about those problems. An announcement was made at the time of the budget of some $21 million to be spent over four years on international marketing to promote Australian educational training for overseas students, but the vast bulk of this money was not new money.
Also, the government has taken no steps to lower the cost of student visas from the current high level of $285. As far as the Australian Labor Party is concerned, this issue requires a whole of government approach. Quite clearly, this government has yet to recognise that fundamental principle.
In terms of the bill before the Senate at the moment, the opposition initiated an inquiry following allegations of some parts of the international education sector that the provisions of the ESOS Act were not being complied with. It can be assumed that this is at least partly due to the staff cuts and the recent administrative changes within DETYA. It is of extreme concern that an important export industry could be put at risk by the miserly cost cutting by this government. In fact, some 50 per cent fewer staff are now available to administer the provisions of this act than were available under the Labor government.
The opposition will be supporting the bill because it is vital that it continue beyond its current expiry date. It is immensely important 
 that international students have confidence in the quality and the stability of Australian education and training providers, not only because of the value to Australia in terms of industry, but also because the industry is already under some strain as a result of the economic downturn throughout Asia. It is important that Australian taxpayers are not called upon to make good when providers default.
The Senate inquiry that was initiated by the Labor Party was able to draw upon evidence from a range of sources, and it clearly demonstrated that, in the opinion of the department—irrespective of the interests of the various private providers, and some 1,000 private providers are involved in this industry—the situation is of extreme sensitivity. The department told the committee that whilst the education and training industry contributes in excess of $3 billion a year to the economy it also brings a number of intangible benefits that cannot be measured, such as the development of contacts for future trade, progressing ideas and contributing to Australia's international standing.
This issue is more than just about regulations concerning the operations of certain businesses that are operating within the education industry. The department told the inquiry:
Each year, the education and training industry contributes in excess of $3 billion to Australia's economy, as well as bringing a range of intangible benefits—for example, developing contacts for future trade and progressing ideas and international perspectives. It is an important and valuable industry for Australia, and the government believes that it deserves the continuing support of the existing cooperative framework between the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and industry.
That is a sentiment that the Australian Labor Party would fully agree with. However, the experience of the department is that while the education and training services industry has matured during the life of the act the industry is not yet able to provide universal protections to ensure the international reputation of the industry. That, too, is a sentiment the Labor Party would agree with and which it is very 
 concerned about. The department went on to say:
If the sunset clause deactivates the act, there is a heightened risk of return to the heavy cost for industry and governments which existed prior to the introduction of the act, including the financial collapse of providers, consequent damage to Australia's international reputation and the potential cost to Australian taxpayers to refund overseas students' prepaid course money.
The department also said:
The ESOS bill will ensure quality standards through the maintenance of the national register, known as the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, and the financial and tuition guarantees which ensure that Australia's international reputation is not damaged. There could be a risk to the integrity of the quality of Australian education offerings in the absence of the national register which could place in question the integrity of Australian awards. This could adversely impact on student demand for places.
These are sentiments with which the Labor Party also agrees.
The department drew the committee's attention to the fact that during the current volatile period in many of Australia's major source markets, it is particularly important to maintain confidence in Australia's international education and training industry by ensuring a stable domestic environment. Great emphasis is placed on the relationship that exists between the various levels of government in Australia in regard to the provisions of this act. As the department has said:
. . . at the moment we have the ESOS Act, which provides an overarching Commonwealth umbrella of protection for students. To be honest, if you were an overseas student contemplating coming to Australia, you would find the overall level of protection you get to be of most importance. I do not suppose a great many students have a clear idea of what happens at the different levels of government in this country, except perhaps for those with an interest in government matters. But we certainly believe that the overall level of protection is important. Of the students we have surveyed, we know that some 70 per cent have said that the levels of protection afforded by government are a factor of which they are aware—and I think that includes things which go beyond the matters covered by the ESOS Act.
What we find is that these matters are being canvassed now quite regularly within the media in Australia, and equally in the media 
 on an international basis. In today's Sydney Morning Herald  we see a report of a private college hit by the Asian crisis. The report says:
One of Sydney's oldest business colleges, the Metropolitan Business and English College, has gone into voluntary administration, potentially ending more than a century of private non-profit education. While more than 300 students at the college can finish their courses, staff have joined the list of creditors, who will meet for the first time today. Problems loom for similar private colleges, whose student numbers have fallen by about 40 per cent because of the Asian economic crisis. Many colleges have suspended enrolment for some courses, some have closed branches, and a few have been taken over.
During the inquiry processes, the department was able to advise us that since 1995 five providers had defaulted under the existing arrangements. These included: Rainshine, trading as the ABC Colleges of English and Australian Academy of Business Studies; the Parafield Flight Centre, which ceased trading in January 1996; K. Ebenezer, trading as Eliaus English College, which ceased trading in June 1997; the Rehabilitation Management Services Limited, trading as the Excelsior College or Rehabilitation and Risk Control Services; and the Queensland International Heritage College Pty Ltd, which ceased trading in May 1998.
Under the existing operations of the act, in 1996-97 alone, as a result of the decisions, DEETYA found that there were six suspensions and two cancellations for the breaches of the act. Four of the six providers had their registrations suspended because they did not comply fully with the NTA requirements of the ESOS Act. A further 13 had their registrations suspended because they failed to report by the due date. No doubt the government would say that many of these problems were put right. Nonetheless there clearly exists  demonstrable evidence that there are profound problems emerging within this industry and that without effective monitoring and regulation by the department this is an area of great potential damage to this country and its international reputation.
What we are seeking, and the Senate committee report has highlighted, is the need for an ongoing inquiry into this industry. There 
 is a joint approach on this matter right around the chamber, I think, that there needs to be further inquiry into the operation of the ESOS Act. I, for one, maintain strong support for the regulatory framework that has existed. My concern is for the effective administration of it and I ask: is it possible—as has occurred under this government—to effectively administer the current act with 50 per cent fewer staff? In terms of the evidence put to the Senate education committee we see that the operation of the registration process at a state level is deficient and quite clearly the capacity to have revolving door arrangements occurring in a number of states is not satisfactory. We might find upon close examination that many state and territory registering authorities do not have the political will to deregister organisations that are not fulfilling their obligations to students and are not able to administer their own arrangements in their own states because of their concerns about the excessive legal costs that deregulation will involve.
The problem has been highlighted in the evidence presented to the committee by the organisation of private education and training providers representing 1,000 people in the industry. They have highlighted this problem, both in terms of their submissions to me directly, and in their submissions also in writing to the Senate committee. I do not agree with their conclusions on all accounts, but they do a great service to this parliament in drawing our attention to some of the problems with the current administration of the act.
They point out, for instance, that the separation of powers for the registration of private providers between the various levels of government in this country is currently inadequate. Two states do not have complementary legislation—Queensland and South Australia. They also point out, in terms of CRICOS, that there is a lack of information available concerning the assessment of future demand.
They also point out that there are dishonest operators functioning within the industry that do not respect the trust fund arrangements. While honest operators incur unnecessary 
 delay on cash flow due to the limitations placed on the draw-down provisions of the current act, dishonest and unscrupulous providers are able to have access to those funds outside of the audited period. The provisions the act currently contains are very limited in that regard. They are quite clear there is strong evidence that people are able to draw upon these trust funds in a manner not foreseen when the provisions of this act were established—and of course they are going to do that. If a company is going broke, if it is in some difficulty, a provider, a small business person—which is often the case in this arrangement—is of course going to draw upon cash reserves in a trust fund rather than put their house or other assets at risk.
That may be well and good for the individual running a business. But this is a matter that is now beginning to affect the international reputation of this country. While one company may go broke and that may have a devastating impact on one particular family, it may also have a quite significant impact on Australia's international reputation if overseas students are adversely affected. This is quite clearly the evidence that the Senate committee has come across.
There are further problems in terms of the communication between the industry and government with the operation of what are now effectively seven tuition assurance schemes operating. The capacity for those to be effectively monitored is, I believe, still open to question.
What we have got is the Senate committee requiring a further investigation into these matters—an ongoing inquiry to examine a number of outstanding issues. These include: the lack of funding for research into the education export industry; the current cost of student visas and the impact of international competitiveness on the Australian education export industry; the lack of communication between the regulatory authority and the various tuition assistance schemes, and the effect that that has on the continuing viability of various private providers; the proposed removal of various exemptions from the act; the need to increase international student awareness of CRICOS; the continuing need to 
 address unethical marketing practices; the provision of easier alternative methods for students to recover debt; and the need to allow for students to be represented in debt recovery proceedings.
The Senate committee is also seeking to have a look at the proposal that courses run overseas by providers or by providers in partnership with overseas agents be subject to CRICOS itself. A further issue that needs inquiry is the provision of clear guidelines for international students on how to raise complaints about providers for misleading or deceptive conduct. It is quite apparent that these are issues of some significance. While this is a non-controversial piece of legislation, it is a matter that does require a great deal more work by the department, in my judgment. I know how difficult that is, given the fact that there has been a cut of 50 per cent of the staff in this particular section of the department. And one presumes that, with a further removal of staff in the restructuring of the department, that strain will grow even greater.
We are facing a period of great economic uncertainty. As a consequence, we are likely to see pressure upon educational institutions and education authorities to cut corners, to cut costs, to administer quick fixes. These sorts of pressures are likely to grow. The dangers for collapses of enterprises under these circumstances are all the greater. At a time when we are facing great perils for our educational facilities, we are seeing that this government is in fact devoting fewer and fewer resources to deal with this issue.
These are matters of great concern to me and they should be of great concern to this government. Unfortunately, I am not confident that this government acknowledges just how serious the problems are. It is not, frankly, facing up to its responsibilities to protect Australia's international reputation and to protect the overseas students who are studying in this country. After all, they are entitled not to be ripped off by unscrupulous providers; they are entitled to get a service that they have paid for; they are entitled to the full protection of Australian law. I am very concerned that the current arrangements 
 are not adequate to meet the challenge. However, this bill needs to be dealt with and it will be accordingly supported by the opposition.",SENATE,<title>EDUCATION SERVICES FOR OVERSEAS STUDENTS (REGISTRATION OF PROVIDERS AND FINANCIAL REGULATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1998 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-12,"—I begin my remarks on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1998 (No. 2) by supporting many of the comments made by Senator Carr, in particular the idea that we should provide ongoing inquiry into this industry and regularly monitor export education in this nation. That is why I commend Senator Brian Harradine for incorporating into the terms of reference that were proposed by the Democrats for a GST and taxation inquiry the notion that we should examine not only the impact of a GST and taxation reform on education services in the domestic sphere but also on overseas student services and export education in particular.
This bill extends the sunset clause on the current administrative arrangements required of providers under the ESOS Act to 1 January 2002. The act allows for the regulation of the overseas education industry. It arose from a situation in 1991 where the government was forced to refund the fees of over 12,000 international students who were affected by the closure of private educational services. The act and this bill in particular provide for quality and fairness within the industry. This bill is extending the sunset clause while consultations are still ongoing within the industry regarding service provision for international students.
I raise concerns on behalf of the Australian Democrats that recent events in our region may necessitate the closer monitoring of our international education industry. I do wonder what the impact of a goods and services tax would have on this particular industry, let alone on the education sector more generally.
The ESOS legislation seeks to address three major problems which have the potential to damage Australia's international reputation as a provider of education services. Remember that export education provides this country with comparable amounts of money to that 
 provided by the wheat industry. Around $1.9 billion per annum is generated as a consequence of export education services. That is actually more, as I understand it, than the wheat industry brings into this nation. So any adverse or negative impact as a consequence of the introduction of a goods and services tax deserves to be investigated, and investigated thoroughly, in a wide-ranging and comprehensive Senate inquiry.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-11-12,"—In response to Senator Harradine's question of 11 November concerning Hurricane Mitch, I indicated I would provide additional information on the extent to which the Australian government might be involved in discussions about debt write-offs and what contributions are being made by other countries for this disaster of devastating proportions. The further response is as follows: Australia welcomes the efforts of the large bilateral creditors concerning debt relief assistance for these countries and supports existing debt relief frameworks. Australia is prepared to discuss options but is not a major creditor to these countries. Indeed, of the Central American countries affected, only Nicaragua has a sovereign debt with Australia. This debt is small, $5.8 million, and has already been rescheduled, extending the term to 25 years with a 14-year grace period.
Debt forgiveness is a very complex issue. It is important for countries not to raise false expectations nor to encourage unmanageable debt levels in the future. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, has asked his department, in consultation with Treasury, to continue to look at debt in the multilateral context. As I said to the Senate yesterday, Australia is appalled at the terrible damage and loss of life caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central America. The Australian government has acted promptly to respond to the devastation with an announcement of a contribution 
 of $1 million in relief assistance. The international community has also responded generously with donor responses continuing to be announced. The United States has pledged more than $US100 million and Spain a similar amount. Other major contributors include the European Commission, Japan and Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. Many countries, including Central American neighbour Mexico, are also providing substantial amounts of aid in kind.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Hurricane Mitch: Aid</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1

That the Senate take note of the document.
—I very much want to take note of this report because one of the things that really disturbs me at the moment is the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. While I do not want to suggest that the picture is totally black, I do want to suggest that some very serious Aboriginal health issues are occurring in my state of Queensland which the Senate ought to note. Certainly I know that many senators already personally have an interest in them, but I think that the record ought to note some of the press reports of the last few weeks and particularly my own personal experience of a number of these communities.
The question I asked the minister today was not meant to score political points. In fact, I gave him notice of it. I am very pleased to say that I got a very serious answer from the minister. I was very pleased about that because even though at times the minister and I may disagree in terms of policy on this issue, I know that he also has a deep concern about what is happening in some of these communities. I particularly draw attention to some of the stories that have been in the press about the state of health of people in the communities in Cape York. There are some very tragic stories about what is happening to women and children. I think that disturbs all of us. The domestic violence and the abuse which is occurring would simply not be tolerated in any white community in this country. It is appalling.
I have worked with Aboriginal communities for 36 years. Despite some improvement over those 36 years, one wonders whether the situation in some of these communities today is even worse than it was some years ago. In Cape York I have been especially involved with the Aurukun community for over 20 years in many different ways, seeking justice and improved services for the people there.
I recall that back in 1978-79 I was in a deputation to the then minister, Mr Russell Hinze, seeking on behalf of the communities at Aurukun and Mornington Island, including the women, to make those communities dry communities. Although they were local government communities and still are today, it was not possible at that time for the state government to accede to that request. I am sure that, if I went back to the state government with the kind of evidence that is now coming forward, any minister would reconsider the possibility of those communities excluding alcohol.
I visited Aurukun last week, and I was quite devastated to see that after 20 years of struggle by a number of absolutely wonderful Aboriginal elders in the community it seems to be worse than it was 20 years ago. The minister was present at the funeral of Francis Yunkaporta, and I visited the family the day before the funeral. He was one of the last of those men who for 30 years struggled to get 
 justice for their community. I spoke with Gladys Tybingoompa, whom many of you will remember from the pictures on TV dancing before the High Court and then dancing with Senator Harradine. I asked her, `What is going to happen? Where are the leaders in the community?' She said, `The young people just don't seem interested, and I don't know where our leaders are coming from.'
I want to draw to the attention of the Senate a report in the Cairns Post of Wednesday and today of the trial of Richard O'Brien, who was gaoled for life for the murder of Norma Chevathun. Richard is an Aboriginal man and Norma was his partner, and she was beaten to death due to alcohol. Norma was here in this chamber in both December and April of this year. She was down at the invitation of our party room. She met the Prime Minister and she met the minister. Just a few days after going back after the debate in April she was beaten to death. I get pretty emotional about this, because we see this happening to people that we know. We really cannot allow these kinds of incidents to continue without comment and without trying to do something to restore some kind of health to these communities.
I was glad the minister said that the federal government is attempting to implement a number of programs, but I hope the minister will go beyond that. In consultation with the Queensland government and the minister there, I hope they will specifically address the problems in the communities that I am talking about. The people are at the bottom in terms of their ability to lift themselves out of what is happening to them. They have lost a lot of their hope and a lot of their confidence. The old people who led them so effectively for so many years are nearly all gone. One wonders where the new leadership is coming from.
I could read into the record some parts of the report describing how Norma Chevathun died. I do not know whether that is a little too morbid, but those who are interested should read the Cairns Post of Wednesday and today. It is pretty distressing to read. I will quote just this:
A forensic pathologist told the court the injuries were similar to those sustained in motor vehicle accidents and were consistent with Ms Chevathun having been stomped on several times.
We are not talking about something that can be just passed over as though it were a natural occurrence. We are talking about something which I believe has to be addressed by this Senate and by this parliament. I make an appeal that we give serious attention to this issue. I am sure the minister will, having given that assurance to the Senate today. While we have this performance audit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Program, and it has some good things in it, we cannot pretend that we have cured the situations that now face these communities.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,19,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-11-12,"—I would like to speak briefly to this report. I want to reinforce my support for the comments of my colleague Senator Woodley, a fellow Democrat and fellow senator from Queensland, and reiterate the very high degree of seriousness which the Democrats place upon this issue. This particular performance audit from the Auditor-General is one of a series that come down fairly frequently of various programs and various departments.
The issue of the appropriateness of expenditure on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs of a wide variety, including the health area, has received a degree of attention in recent years, with fairly frequent repetition of allegations that money is wasted; that it is soaked up by white bureaucrats; that it is thrown around with gay abandon; that it is rorted by inappropriate organisations or by indigenous people at the local level. It is important to emphasise the point—and it is one that the Democrats have continuously tried to emphasise—that, when it comes to ensuring accountability of the expenditure of public funds, programs on areas relating to indigenous people are scrutinised as tightly, and in many cases more tightly, than any other expenditure of public money in the country. There is no group of people more keen to ensure the appropriate targeting of expenditure on such areas than the indigenous peoples themselves.
It is important to emphasise that we need to speak out whenever possible to crush the myth that somehow or other money spent on indigenous people is wasted, that it is spent less efficiently than any other public money and that it is somehow rorted. That is clearly not the case, and the evidence in many reports demonstrates that.
That is not to say, of course, as Senator Woodley has just graphically outlined, that the assistance that is being provided through public moneys has gone as far as we would like in addressing some of the problems in the Australian community, particularly amongst many indigenous communities.
No-one pretends to have the single perfect answer to address some of the terrible problems that have been outlined by Senator Woodley and published in the Courier-Mail in recent times. But it is also important to emphasise that there are many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities throughout Queensland and in other parts of Australia that have made progress.
Part of what we need to do as a parliament is to ensure that there is an examination of those areas where progress has been made: to look at what has made them work and to try to ensure that other indigenous communities are encouraged and, more particularly, empowered to follow some of those examples so that they are able to make some of the advances that are so desperately needed.
That issue of empowerment at the local level is really one of the fundamental components that need to be addressed for the improvement of the health situation in some of those areas. In a number of Aboriginal communities women particularly are looking to have more support for what they believe needs to be done. In many cases they bear a disproportionate level of the violence that is perpetrated in some of these communities—often due to alcohol—and they are often the ones who are working most strongly to try to overcome some of the issues that need to be addressed.
It is important when we look at the expenditure of public funds for public needs—and clearly this is a public need, as has been outlined—that we do not look just at the issue 
 of ensuring that all the moneys are spent appropriately. As I said, I would suggest that indigenous organisations are more accountable and more scrutinised now than any other organisations in the country. We also need to ensure that the people the funds are meant to assist have an adequate say in how those funds are expended and in how the services are delivered. I think that is one area where further advances can be made.
In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the Democrats' strong commitment to ensuring that action does occur and that these problems are addressed in the near future, because it is a serious issue and an urgent issue. Unfortunately, people have been saying that for far too long. We do not suggest that we have all the answers and we do not suggest that the government or other parties are not also aware of the problem and seeking to find ways to address it, but we do believe that among the many other issues that arise every day in the public arena this is one that really must not get lost beneath the smoke and fog and heat of battle that occurs in the political arena from time to time. It is one that we all need to reaffirm our commitment to and work together to address.

We do not suggest that we have all the answers and we do not suggest that the government or other parties are not also aware of the problem and seeking to find ways to address it, but we do believe that among the many other issues that arise every day in the public arena this is one that really must not get lost beneath the smoke and fog and heat of battle that occurs in the political arena from time to time. It is one that we all need to reaffirm our commitment to and work together to address.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-11-12,"—I think it would be desirable that when 
 Senator Lees is able to move that motion, that she be given leave to do so, no matter what is coming up. Is general business on now?
—No, it is not on now, but at 4.30 it will be.
—My understanding is that Senator Lees will be given leave to move the motion, even if it happens to be in the middle of a debate.
—The question is that the motion moved by Senator Lees be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Taxation Package: References to Committees</title>,Business,20,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-12,"—Madam President, as I understand it, the motion before the chair is to defer Senator Lees' business of the Senate motion No. 2 to a later hour this day. It is that motion to which I am now addressing myself.
I think there are some procedural issues here that need to be clarified. I think we all accept in the chamber that a business of the Senate motion takes precedence over a range of other matters that are before the chair. However, I point out to the Senate that our colleague Senator Hutchins will be making his first speech to the Senate at 5.30, and there is an order of the Senate to that effect. My clear understanding is that that order of the Senate would have precedence over any suggestion that a business of the Senate matter have priority. 
—Yes, that is correct.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. The other issue that the chamber needs to give some consideration to is that after six o'clock on a Thursday there are no divisions in this chamber. I believe, and I seek the guidance of the Chair on this, that if a business of the Senate matter is before the chair at that time, and there is a matter on which the Senate would divide, it would be impossible for the Senate to finalise that matter.
It is my understanding of the procedural situation in relation to the standing order which precludes divisions after 6 p.m. on a Thursday that, if a business of the Senate matter was still before the chair, we could not 
 bring that matter to a conclusion if there was not unanimous agreement in the chamber. I am sure Senator Harradine would agree that we need to get some clarity on that particular issue before we move along. I ask for you for a ruling on that, Madam Deputy President.
—I am advised that after 6 o'clock there is no provision for divisions to be called.
—Yes, I appreciate that. But the issue I raise is the circumstance where at 6 o'clock we are debating a business of the Senate motion before the chair and there is not unanimous agreement in the chamber—in other words, a division would be required to be called. I think we all understand that the standing order applies in that circumstance. Where do we find ourselves in terms of that matter before the chair?
It would seem to me that if we are still debating the business of the Senate motion standing in Senator Lees' name or, for that matter, the business of the Senate motion No. 3 standing in the name of Senator Kemp, which has also been deferred to a later hour this day, we would find ourselves in a position where the Senate would be unable to come to a final conclusion on the matter. It is that particular element of the issue, Madam Deputy President, that I think it is worth getting some clear guidance on before we move on.
—Standing order 57(3) says:
If a division is called for on Thursday after 6 pm, the matter before the Senate shall be adjourned until the next day of sitting at a time fixed by the Senate.
I understand that to mean that a vote would be deferred to a following day.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Taxation Package: References to Committees</title>,Business,20,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-11-12,"—Is Senator Lees's motion before the chamber?
—Yes, her motion is before the chamber.
—I move:
Omit all words after ""That"", substitute ""business of the Senate notices of motion Nos 2 and 3, relating to the reference of matters to certain committees, be postponed till a later hour, and that consideration of business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2 be called on at 4.30 p.m.""
Clearly, we would like to facilitate the conclusion of those matters prior to the first speech by the new senator and clearly before 6 o'clock. I think you have given a very clear ruling as to what happens at 6 o'clock if we do not.
—Madam Deputy President, on a point of order: I hear what the Manager of Government Business says, so I want take a procedural point. Is it necessary in fact for such an amendment to be determined by the Senate, given that it would seem to me that these particular matters at 4.30 p.m. might have precedence, regardless? I just want to be clear that this is actually necessary.
—The way that it would have to proceed would be that general business would have to be adjourned or deferred.
—No. Not if it is started.
—You would have to adjourn the debate on general business to allow this one, after 4.30 p.m., to take—
—Madam Deputy President, the issue before us here is the question of what takes precedence. My understanding is that the matter of Senator Lees's motion being deferred prior to 4.30 p.m. would automatically take precedence before general business. However, if general business is commenced, then leave would be required. That is what I understand to be the situation. However, I understand that the government is seeking to bring this matter on before 4.30 p.m.
—We will bring it on at 4.30 p.m. and—
—If you bring it on before 4.30 p.m., it certainly is the case.
—We have the amendment from Senator Ian Campbell to add 
 `and No. 3 and bring on at 4.30 p.m.' Is everybody clear on the amendment?",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Taxation Package: References to Committees</title>,Business,20,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-11-12,"—Madam Deputy President, one thing that would be helpful to the Senate—as the afternoon wears on and there is very little time left for extraordinarily important matters here—would be if either now or at 4.30 p.m. we were apprised of the options that the Senate is going to have to deal with. The Greens—and, I presume, the Labor Party—are not in the loop as to the discussions that have occurred between the Democrats, Senator Harradine and the government, but we will want to debate what the outcome of those discussions has been, if there is any variance from the motion as it stands on the Notice Paper .
It may be very helpful to the Senate to have at this time some report back as to what we are going to be debating at 4.30 p.m. Is it simply going to be the motion as it stands on the Notice Paper? Or is it going to be an amendment to motion No. 2 or No. 3, either as to the substance of the matters to be canvassed by an inquiry into the GST package or as to the time of reporting or as to which committees are going to be dealing with the matter? These are all very important matters. I, for one, will want to be contributing to a debate on any changes which have come up there; and of course it is proper that we have time to consider any proposals being put forward by the three negotiating parties together or separately.
I note that there is still some discussion occurring in the chamber to clear the air on just that matter. I am being a little helpful here by talking on the matter while that discussion takes place.
—As always, Bob.
—Yes. I am at your service; it is goodwill. I am wanting to—
—The promise is never returned.
—Order! I would appreciate it if there were fewer interjections and if you would address the chair, Senator Brown.
—Of course, Madam Deputy President. The Manager of Government Business himself, although he is leaving his seat now, in fact might be the person who is able to give us an insight and to report progress. That is what we want. I am sure there are many other people outside this chamber as well who want to know what the progress of talks has been since the matter was adjourned earlier in the day.
It is very fascinating, because a senator commented to me, as we were breaking earlier, that `if there is no inquiry, there will be no GST.' I have now heard that from the Democrats and Senator Harradine. The outcome of this morning's debate looked as though there would be no inquiry. It is a fascinating stalemate, if that is going to be the outcome of deliberations this afternoon. The alternative is for us to be acquainted with what the three parties have been talking about. I have an indication from the leader of the government in here that in fact he might be going to enlighten us somewhat, and so I will end this period of assistance to the Senate in general and sit down.
—Thank you, Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Taxation Package: References to Committees</title>,Business,20,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-11-12,"—I understand that there is some sort of consensus, which I hope Senator Brown would join in on, to bring this matter back on at 4.30 p.m. as my amendment suggests. Clearly, once I am enlightened, Senator Brown, I will be happy to enlighten you and all other honourable senators.
—Are you withdrawing your amendment?
—No. I have fulsome support for my amendment.
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Ian Campbell to add `and No. 3' and omit `later hour' and substitute `4.30 p.m.' be agreed to.

(4)	 That consideration of any legislation implementing the Government's proposals for taxation reform be postponed until after presentation of all reports required by this resolution, and until after presentation of the Government's responses to these reports.
The motion I have moved is the original one that the Democrats put down—that is, with seven references committees. The amendments you have before you in my name will actually be moved by my colleague Senator Murray, who will only speak briefly because we did go through all of this this morning.
The motion I have moved includes the concerns of Senator Brown and Senator Harradine as well as the material that the ALP wanted us to make sure was in. If I can point out, however, to the ALP that we have not, as we are back on today and not Monday week, had the opportunity to talk again with Senator Cook, who has his own range of concerns. So I leave that to you as to what happens. We have had some further discussions with the government. It seems that there has been no agreement reached and we want to move the 
 adjournment of this debate to the next day of sitting. Is that right, Senator Campbell?",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Taxation Package: References to Committees </title>,Committees,22,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-11-12,"—by leave—It would be in the best interests of a sensible resolution of these matters to move to postpone consideration of these two business of the Senate motions until the next day of sitting. I would certainly be supportive of such a move if Senator Lees is able to do it. We have had constructive discussions. However, in the time constraints available to us, a sensible handling of it is not possible this afternoon unfortunately.
—I just need to be clear, if I can. Senator Lees, you have moved the postponement?
—Yes, I want to move the postponement of business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2 until the next day of sitting.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Maybe Senator Lees wants to move that now, but my point of order is that, before the chair currently, until perhaps that very last contribution from Senator Lees, is business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2, which had been formally moved by Senator Lees.
With respect, Senator Campbell sought leave, I assume, to give a public indication to Senator Lees that whatever discussions others are having—I do not involve the opposition—obviously have not come to a conclusion. It is obviously competent for Senator Lees to move deferral of her business of the Senate notice of motion that is before the chair, but I think the substantive motion was before the chair previously.
—Senator Lees, if you could seek leave to continue your remarks. I thought it was clear that Senator Faulkner's contribution is correct and that everybody now understands that. Senator Faulkner, it should be on the record that this time, as many other times, you are correct. Senator Lees, if you would seek leave to continue your remarks this will resolve the difficulty before the chair.
—Thank you. I therefore seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1998-11-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Document No. 5 is what has become commonly known in the Northern Territory as the Reeves report. It is a review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. We in the Territory believe that the way in which the federal government handles the review of the land rights act will be this government's first test on its post election commitment to genuine reconciliation. There are a number of major outcomes of this report—the effectiveness of the legislation; its social, cultural and economic impact; the operation of the exploration of mining provisions; the operation of the ABTA, including the distribution of payments; the operation of royalty associations; compulsory acquisition powers of Aboriginal land; the application of Northern Territory laws to Aboriginal land; the role and structure of land councils; and a number of other relevant matters.
But what I draw the attention of the chamber to is the fact that there are some major problems with the review of this act. There is an unacceptable attack on self-determination within the recommendations. The Northern Territory Aboriginal Council, which it is suggested be established, is to be appointed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. Currently, the four land councils—that is, the Northern Land Council, the Central Land Council, the Tiwi Land Council and the Anindilyakwa Land Council—are chosen directly by Aboriginal people. So this recommendation is seriously a retrograde step.
The ABR, a statutory statement of what money should be spent on, takes away Aboriginal people's ability to make decisions for themselves. The loss of the permit system means loss of control over who can enter Aboriginal land. In fact, what is suggested is that the trespass act would be used, which means that, if you catch somebody on your land and you do not want them there, you have to be in a position of finding them there and you shoo them off, whereas with a permit system you have the ability of saying who can come onto your land before they even take their first step.
There is a suggestion in this report that 18 land councils will be created, which will increase the delays and burdens on industry seeking access to Aboriginal land. Less skilled and experienced staff and council members will inevitably lead to less certainty in agreements and greater possibility of legal challenges.
Throughout the review, though, of the land rights act Aboriginal people reiterated that they wanted a strong land council to represent their interests. There are, and the Senate should note, a number of regions in the Territory which are seeking to establish their own land council. It is our position that they can do that under this land rights act. There is a process for that as opposed to the current arrangement that has been set up with Minister Baldwin and the federal government in relation to trying to achieve this.
Aboriginal people have said that, no, they want no transfer of the act from the federal government to the Northern Territory government. They do not want compulsory acquisition of Aboriginal land. They do not want to break up the land councils or take away the veto, but they have said yes to participating in economic development on Aboriginal land without taking away their rights. They have said yes to the land councils' plan for regionalisation and they have said yes to a strong land council to help look after their rights and interests. The land councils acknowledge that Aboriginal people's desire for change is there, and we believe they are responding to that.
I am particularly disappointed in the Reeves report and I think it would be fair to say that 
 I reiterate that on behalf of quite a number of my fellow Territorians whom I represent, particularly those who are indigenous Australians. It is based on very poor research, dubious anthropology and economics and arrives at recommendations which ignore the overwhelming responses from Aboriginal people. The recommendations are based on very selective use of information and advice. It is not a balanced report and confirms the concerns which we have—that is, that it threatens to take away Aboriginal people's rights and ignores the potential for a bipartisan approach to change.
In finishing, I would like to add that the review recommends taking control over land use and financial management and taking this away from Aboriginal land owners and giving them to a new body hand-picked by the Chief Minister and the federal minister. It is with some interest that we wait to see what will happen with this report. I understand that the minister made a commitment prior to the election to send this off to a committee in the House of Representatives.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1998-11-12,"—I  move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Creating opportunities: promoting Australian industry  is a report of the considerations of the Economics References Committee and of deliberations for a period of about 18 months in a broad-ranging inquiry into industry policy in Australia. Evidence given to the committee showed that while Australia's manufacturing output has increased in recent years, the numbers employed in manufacturing have remained stagnant. Witnesses expressed concern about the continued lack of growth in manufacturing employment. The committee, in response, proposed that industry policy should be designed to provide high growth rates in the long term for Australia's benefit.  	 This report was tabled out of session, and associated media reports were released at that time. The importance of today's comments is 
 to thank—and acknowledge the contribution of—all those involved in this inquiry: my fellow committee members, the organisations and individuals who lodged submissions, Dr Ian Marsh for his assistance in the committee's deliberations, and the secretariat for its support to the committee. This was quite a lengthy inquiry that involved significant input from the economics references secretariat. The secretary, Mr Rob Diamond, research staff, Mr Tas Luttrell, who has assisted the committee with his economics expertise, Yvonne Marsh, who left the committee in its early stages, Graeme Fawns, and executive assistant, Paula Arnts, all made a significant contribution to our concluding this inquiry in a very timely way in terms of finishing the last term of the government. It was certainly an inquiry which we wanted to make sure we concluded and did not leave hanging or indeed pass over to a new committee.
The Senate referred the inquiry into promoting Australian industry on 11 December 1996. The terms of reference required the committee to consider the necessary elements of efficient and effective industry policies, including the effectiveness of existing industry policy in key sectors. The committee also looked at several key industry sectors: pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles and vehicle components, and the wine industry. It drew several key themes from looking at those sectors. For instance, the apparent success of the wine industry took a lot of consideration from the committee in terms of what sort of support had led to that success.
The committee was also required to examine initiatives for the design, implementation and evaluation of specific industry policies, and the barriers and impediments to such policies. Finally, the committee was asked to review appropriate criteria for review and evaluation of industry policy, including any specific research and measurement systems.
The committee conducted a number of public hearings and site inspections, and received private briefings from departmental representatives but also the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Economist Intelligence Unit. As I mentioned, the com 
 mittee received assistance from Professor Ian Marsh of the Australian Graduate School of Management at the University of New South Wales—both through his submission and as a consequence of how impressed the committee was with that submission in the framing and finalising of the report.
A point to note about the recommendations of the committee is that industry policy has been an area where there have been quite divergent views and a number of inquiries during this inquiry but also prior to it. In one sense, this inquiry followed much of that debate. A point that was highlighted at the time the report was released is that the committee itself was able to come to a consensus position on the recommendations that we thought were appropriate to the future of industry policy. I think that is quite a significant point in terms of the subject matter that we were considering and the issues that were covered within the broad framework of what is considered to be industry policy.
The committee proposed a national approach involving all relevant parties and seeking a consensus on major issues, with the view that a consensus and a vision for the future are what Australia needs in relation to the match of industry policy, economic issues and social issues. It found that, for Australia, a balanced approach, avoiding the extremes of outright protectionism and complete non-intervention, is most likely to be successful.
The policy mix proposed involves elements of both approaches: using intervention where appropriate but involving also extensive collaboration between industry and government. This approach led to one of the most important recommendations by the committee, which proposed that Australia should have a national policy for the manufacturing sector and that it should be developed by consensus between all relevant parties.Cooperation between industry and government is regarded as an essential feature in this process. Where industry assistance is given, the committee proposed that it should be subject to strict cost-benefit analysis and regular review.
Several recommendations relate to improving Australia's standing as an investment location. The committee noted the need to 
 expand the Australian venture capital market to make investment funding more readily available and to adopt policies that encourage long-term investment. The committee also considered that attracting investment should be a key focus of any tax reform package.
The committee recommended that Australia's focus for future development should be on industries with potential in a number of specific areas. They should be industries which: add substantial Australian value to the final product; have a high degree of income and market elasticity of demand; and have the capacity to provide substantial employment opportunities in medium-highly skilled occupations. This is the focus we need to have on the future.
One of the main recommendations is for the establishment of an independent agency to advise and evaluate industry policy. The agency would be independent of the bureaucracy, but accountable to parliament. Its advice would be referred to the government for decision and then to the departments for implementation.
The committee was anxious to see industry policy formulated on a long-term basis and made independent of the electoral cycle. Evidence given to the committee indicated that such an approach would provide a solid foundation for companies to undertake the long-term planning essential in the manufacturing field.
Other main issues arising from the report included the need for a process to oversee government procurement and outsourcing practices, particularly in key industries. The committee noted that practices in these areas should not disadvantage local industries, particularly in regional Australia. The committee believes that government policy should give preference to Australian products when other things are equal. It believes that these areas should be used as a tool of industry policy to the extent permitted by the WTO and of course by cost effectiveness.
The other main factor considered by the committee was the question of government encouragement for research and development. Evidence given to the committee made it clear that the ability of firms to compete in 
 the marketplace is directly affected by their ability to be innovative in areas such as production methods, marketing and the provision of services. Recommendations on this topic covered the desirability of suitable tax concessions, maximising the likelihood of commercialisation of new products and processes, continuation of technology transfer programs, and encouragement of industry research consortia.
I conclude my comments by saying that this inquiry was a very productive one, particularly given that it followed the committee's inquiry into the workplace relations bill, which we will all recall was a very contentious inquiry. I wish the committee success, particularly with the future projections that it may well be dealing with the GST inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics References Committee </title>,Committees,28,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1998-11-12,"—I want to support the remarks made by the chair of this committee, Senator Collins, and particularly to thank her for her efforts in the conduct of this inquiry. I want to say a word or two because I understand Senator Collins may not be chairing this committee with the reallocation of portfolios that is happening at this time. Although the final decisions have not been made, it is just possible that Senator Collins may not be chair of the Economics Reference Committee for this parliament, and I would like to thank her, particularly for her cooperation and the manner in which we were able on many occasions to come to agreements and adopt a bipartisan approach to many of the issues that were involved in this particular report. When she first took over the chairmanship of this committee, it is fair to say she was thrown to the wolves is a bit with the industrial relations inquiry being, I think, the first inquiry that she—
—Outworkers.
—Sorry, she was there for the finalisation of the outworkers inquiry, and then for the industrial relations legislation inquiry. It was certainly not very easy for a reference committee to take a bipartisan approach to many of the issues that came under consideration with this piece of legislation. Of course, I made my views quite clear that I thought it was a piece of legisla 
 tion that should have gone to a legislation committee rather than a references committee. But, in fact, throughout the conduct of that inquiry, which was a difficult one, Senator Collins learned the ropes very quickly as chair of that committee. Since that, on other inquiries we have done and particularly on this industry inquiry, I have found it a pleasure to work with her. I wish her well if she does move to another committee which more suits the reallocation of portfolios and her interests.
This particular inquiry into industry was brought about, I think, by the enthusiasm of Senator Bishop and some others, who at that stage wanted an inquiry into the future of Australian industry and the role that government should play in matters relating to industry. We had a considerable number of submissions. From the outset we were determined to look at why it was that some industries were successful without any or with very little government support while others seemed to require government support in order to survive or to succeed.
I think, to that end, this report, which took a long time for us to eventually finalise, does say a lot of good things about what should happen to industry in Australia. It is one I know the government will take notice of and will take care when responding. While of course there was not a unanimous view amongst the committee as to the direction we should take, there were a number of issues and recommendations on which the committee worked at length to make sure that we had a bipartisan approach. In fact, government senators, opposition senators and the Democrat member, Senator Murray, came to an agreement on many of the issues that were raised during this inquiry.
It was very interesting. Senator Collins I know has raised the issue of the wine industry around Australia and how it has been a great success. It has been a success with less government support than perhaps many other industries get. It is not without support, but I think it has grown because of its own particular strengths and maybe the idiosyncrasies of the market that we are in at present. I well remember a couple of memorable visits that 
 we made during that inquiry to the Barossa Valley in my home state and the generous hospitality that we received. In fact—if it is not wrong for me to say this—Senator Collins was introduced to some very fine quality red wine by some of our very excellent winemakers in South Australia. I certainly remember that part of the inquiry as one of the pleasurable times.
Once again, the secretariat staff did an outstanding job on this industry inquiry and on the report that they have produced with some professional help. The work has been done by the outstanding secretariat staff on the economics committee, with Rob Diamond as the secretary and other members of the staff, who I will not mention by name. I have been involved with this secretariat over a number of inquiries in the last six years. I think their work is probably as good as any that I have ever seen done by any of the secretariats of the Senate committees that I have ever worked with. I hope that they will accept those words in the way that they are meant, because it can be very difficult when the pressures are on to get a report out on time, to get everything in that everybody wants and to cater for the different requirements or the different views of sometimes eight different senators—because some of us within our own parties have differing views as to just how a report should finally read when it comes to be presented to the Senate.
Can I say that this was a very interesting and important inquiry. I look forward to the government's response to the recommendations that have been made and to its reaction, particularly to the bipartisan areas of this report. When we do get that response, we will read it with interest. I hope that the work that has gone into this inquiry will be well worth while. Once again, I thank Senator Jacinta Collins, as chair, for her input, and also the secretariat staff and all the members on the committee, who worked so cooperatively to get to the final stage that we did.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1998-11-12,"—I  move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Creating opportunities: promoting Australian industry  is a report of the considerations of the Economics References Committee and of deliberations for a period of about 18 months in a broad-ranging inquiry into industry policy in Australia. Evidence given to the committee showed that while Australia's manufacturing output has increased in recent years, the numbers employed in manufacturing have remained stagnant. Witnesses expressed concern about the continued lack of growth in manufacturing employment. The committee, in response, proposed that industry policy should be designed to provide high growth rates in the long term for Australia's benefit.  	 This report was tabled out of session, and associated media reports were released at that time. The importance of today's comments is 
 to thank—and acknowledge the contribution of—all those involved in this inquiry: my fellow committee members, the organisations and individuals who lodged submissions, Dr Ian Marsh for his assistance in the committee's deliberations, and the secretariat for its support to the committee. This was quite a lengthy inquiry that involved significant input from the economics references secretariat. The secretary, Mr Rob Diamond, research staff, Mr Tas Luttrell, who has assisted the committee with his economics expertise, Yvonne Marsh, who left the committee in its early stages, Graeme Fawns, and executive assistant, Paula Arnts, all made a significant contribution to our concluding this inquiry in a very timely way in terms of finishing the last term of the government. It was certainly an inquiry which we wanted to make sure we concluded and did not leave hanging or indeed pass over to a new committee.
The Senate referred the inquiry into promoting Australian industry on 11 December 1996. The terms of reference required the committee to consider the necessary elements of efficient and effective industry policies, including the effectiveness of existing industry policy in key sectors. The committee also looked at several key industry sectors: pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles and vehicle components, and the wine industry. It drew several key themes from looking at those sectors. For instance, the apparent success of the wine industry took a lot of consideration from the committee in terms of what sort of support had led to that success.
The committee was also required to examine initiatives for the design, implementation and evaluation of specific industry policies, and the barriers and impediments to such policies. Finally, the committee was asked to review appropriate criteria for review and evaluation of industry policy, including any specific research and measurement systems.
The committee conducted a number of public hearings and site inspections, and received private briefings from departmental representatives but also the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Economist Intelligence Unit. As I mentioned, the com 
 mittee received assistance from Professor Ian Marsh of the Australian Graduate School of Management at the University of New South Wales—both through his submission and as a consequence of how impressed the committee was with that submission in the framing and finalising of the report.
A point to note about the recommendations of the committee is that industry policy has been an area where there have been quite divergent views and a number of inquiries during this inquiry but also prior to it. In one sense, this inquiry followed much of that debate. A point that was highlighted at the time the report was released is that the committee itself was able to come to a consensus position on the recommendations that we thought were appropriate to the future of industry policy.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,1998-11-12,"—I cannot miss the opportunity this week to say something about Ian Sinclair, who left this parliament on 3 October after 35 years as the member for New England. Under the convention of Westminster parliaments, he remained Speaker of the House of Representatives until midnight on Monday of this week. Ian Sinclair's political career has spanned nearly four decades from Prime Minister Menzies to Prime Minister Howard. His time here has been well documented since he entered the ministry a mere 18 months after entering the parliament. I think I can say with some legitimacy that, at a different time or with a different party structure, he would have become Prime Minister.
The impression he left and created wherever he went in the world is the same. In 1995 I went to the European Parliament and I sat beside a German member of the European Parliament who had been in the Bundestag and his father had been in the Reichstag. He said to me, `That leader of your party, the leader of the national agrarians, if he had been in Germany, he'd have been the Chancellor.' I think that was an impression that Ian Sinclair created wherever he went.
To most of us on our side of politics, and a surprising number on the other side, he has been a friend, an adviser, a confidant and a mentor. He is simply a remarkable Australian. Throughout his 35-year career in public life, where he has endured a fair amount of turbulence, it will be the good and creative things he has done for which he will be thanked and remembered, always with the style and dignity we all know. Ian was an outstanding school boy. He was head boy at Knox Grammar, the school with which he maintains contact. He was a fine sportsman and pianist and, throughout his life, he has been lucky enough to have a natural intelligence that few can better.
I have known Ian for 32 of his 35 years in parliament, but I have known of him for a little longer. I shared this otherwise unrecorded anecdote with the National Party room the other night. When Ian sought preselection for 
 New England over 35 years ago—in fact, in 1962—so did my late father. I was only about eight at the time and I could not understand the comings and goings of my parents for many nights in a row and the tenseness and whispering that ensued. My childhood mind was concerned that maybe my parents were under some sort of marital stress. It was much later that I realised that they were going through the difficult Country Party preselection, which history shows was won by Ian Sinclair. My father had never been beaten by anything before, or since for that matter. He went on to make a good contribution in public life in another way, and he and Ian remained good friends for the rest of his life.
I met Ian when my primary school went to Old Parliament House in 1967. Ian took us around and I later got to know him well as my political involvement grew. We have shared at least one flight to or from Tamworth each week during the last 5½ years of my time in the Senate and we have developed a unique comradeship that only close political allies understand. I shall miss him and Rosie, both of whom command such charm that they can lift a room whenever they enter it. To have had one terrific wife is more than most of us can hope for, but Ian has had two. His late wife Margaret, Rosie and all their children are fine people who have all been contributors in a way that is making Australia a better place. No parents can have a better judgment than that.
Spending a little time with Ian as I have over the years has given me the opportunity to assemble what I might call his ten commandments for political success. I guess I have used a little licence in these. I think it is probably appropriate that I share some of them with the Senate tonight. Firstly, always be pleasant and well mannered. Even in politics it will get you a long way. Secondly, do not ever commit anything to paper. Say it in diamonds, say it in mink but never, ever say it in ink. This was a particular favourite with the CWA ladies. Thirdly, never explain, never complain and never resign. Fourthly, never talk about your overseas trips and never say where you have been or where you are 
 going. Fifthly, never tell people how busy you are. They expect politicians to be very busy.
Sixthly, always make a very big entry into a function but leave as unobtrusively as good manners permit. Seventhly, forgive but do not forget. Senators needing explanation to that rule can perhaps take the time to ask Neville Wran or Frank Walker. Eighthly, always remember that in politics tomorrow is another day. Certainly, you can never say never. There are more, but I have probably revealed enough of his secrets.
Ian has an undying love of politics. However, he said to me a couple of times, `Sandy, there are many things I would like to do outside politics,' to which I have always replied, `If that's the case, Ian, you would have done them by now.' Now he has that chance and I wish him and Rosie all the very best for the next exciting chapter of their lives. Australia is fortunate indeed to have had their contributions so far.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Sinclair, Rt Hon. Ian</title>",Adjournment,29,1
