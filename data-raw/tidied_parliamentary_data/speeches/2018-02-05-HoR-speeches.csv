Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (10:04):  Today I present the 19th report of the Petitions Committee for the 45th Parliament together with 97 petitions and 20 ministerial responses to petitions previously presented. This report is the largest petitions report for this parliament, indicating what a busy time it's been for the committee over the last few months and, indeed, over the past year. Our records show that, over the last 10 years, an average of 137 petitions have been presented each year. In contrast, last year the committee received around 550 petitions. Approximately half of these were paper petitions, many of which were part of two large-scale campaigns that spanned communities all around the country, communities that care deeply about the issues the petitions raised. The remaining petitions were lodged by the House's e-petitioning system, making requests to the House that covered myriad different community and individual concerns.


It's great to see petitioning serving its purpose as a conduit between the parliament and the people, and, with the introduction of e-petitioning at the start of this parliament, people are finding it easier than ever. Now people can choose the petitioning process that best suits their petitioning goals, be they to launch a nationwide campaign or to attract a special interest group to lend support to their concerns. I encourage all members to continue championing the petitions process by engaging with, or presenting petitions on behalf of, their constituents. I also thank those ministers who have facilitated responses to petitions referred. In this way, we can continue to assist Australians to have their voices heard in this parliament. I will continue to provide updates to the House on the work of the Petitions Committee.

Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (10:06):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy, I present the committee report entitled Powering our future: inquiry into modernising Australia's electricity grid, together with the minutes of proceedings. 


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr BROAD:
  Throughout 2017 the Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy examined the important issues facing Australia's electricity grid. Not only are we experiencing a changing mix in the source of the electricity generated but consumer preferences are also changing. The modernising of the electricity grid in Australia provides an opportunity to reconsider what the system could seek to achieve and how the different priorities of stakeholders could be balanced. Four key issues under consideration are the ongoing security of the system, the reliability of the system in meeting customer demand, emissions reduction and affordability.


Industry experts, energy users, electricity distributors and regulators all gave evidence to the committee. What was striking was the committee heard the same evidence from each witness—the importance of a consensus approach to energy policy in Australia. The committee took this evidence about consensus very seriously and applied it to all the inquiry work. This report reflects the absolute best efforts of the members of this committee to find common ground when it comes to delivering a modern electricity grid to ensure the secure and reliable delivery of electricity whilst balancing emissions reduction considerations and the important issue of affordability.


Of course, as members of parliament representing different constituencies, many of us have different views which we had an opportunity to test and discuss throughout the inquiry. Yet this report is the unanimous report of the committee and the fact that it is unanimous is a source of personal pride to me and is testament to the professionalism and goodwill of my colleagues. The collegiate spirit that was fostered in this committee enabled us to consider the evidence and prepare a report in a manner which enabled us to put consensus and pragmatism first.


The witnesses spoke, telling us of the energy industry's need for certainty. The committee listened, and we have delivered a comprehensive consensus-based report that provides recommendations which will enable the grid to be modernised in a manner which provides the certainty the stakeholders expressly requested. Four members of the committee, including me and the deputy chair, undertook a delegation to visit parts of Germany and the United States. Benefiting from a comprehensive program, we learnt more about current electricity markets and policy landscapes in each country. We collected evidence from visits to the mainland National Electricity Market states, submissions and our visits overseas. We gained genuine insights into how we can take a grid that was built for very different conditions in the earlier part of the 20th century and transition that same grid into the 21st century, and, in so doing, futureproof it.


There is space for big thinking when it comes to modernising the electricity grid. Additional interconnectors in places such as northern Tasmania could provide a platform for truly innovative practices such as wind farms taking full advantage of the Roaring Forties winds. A Mallee interconnector, which could be linked into Snowy Hydro, could capture the advantage of east-west solar resources.


I thank my fellow committee members for their collegiate and productive approach when considering the issues raised during the course of the inquiry. The committee was fortunate in the assistance it received from submission makers and witnesses, who provided a strong evidence base which informed our deliberations. I would also like to the thank the staff of the secretariat for their assistance with our work. They are in the chamber here today. They worked very hard.


This report canvasses important issues and makes timely recommendations that seek to ensure Australia is not left behind in the electricity revolution that is occurring all around us. I call on all my colleagues in this place to take heed of this report and the evidence of witnesses everywhere. This evidence was a call to arms: abandon partisan politics and unite to deliver the certainty the energy sector requires in order to deliver secure, reliable electricity with lower emissions and—of paramount importance—that is affordable to all. I'm very optimistic for the future and what can be done. Our electricity grid will transition, and this report will form a body of work that will assist in that transition over the next 20 years. I thank my colleagues for their hard work and I commend this report to the House.

Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (10:11):  I want to start by thanking the secretariat for the brilliant job they've done in putting this report together and by complimenting the chair of the committee, the member for Mallee, and all the members on what is a very strong report. In the energy policy arena, which is probably the most heated part of the national policy debate, a consensus was achieved across four parties. It's a rare issue that gets the member for Mallee, the member for Hughes, the member for Melbourne and me to agree on anything, and this report recognises that and represents that. I think it signals a way forward on the energy debate in this country.


There are a stack of recommendations, 23, and I won't go through all of them, but I want to highlight quickly seven really important recommendations, starting with the first one, about the drastic need, the desperate need, to resolve the uncertainty in energy policy that has bedevilled this country since 2009. The report makes reference to calculations by the Energy Council, the peak body for generators, which says that the effect of the inability of this place—the House of Representatives and the Senate—to agree on a settled energy policy since 2009 is the equivalent of a $50-a-tonne carbon price. That is because people in this place cannot agree on a policy that people can invest in for the next 40 years. It is essential that we resolve that uncertainty in energy policy and get an enduring mechanism to tackle our greenhouse gas abatement requirements.


Recommendation 4 talks about speeding up rule making. Recommendation 5 talks about greater parliamentary oversight of the Finkel recommendations. There are recommendations around industry demand and responses around energy efficiency which will be essential to reduce demand in the sector while providing a revenue stream for our manufacturers. There are recommendations around AEMO studies into more interconnectors, which the member for Mallee has referred to. There is a strong recommendation around reviewing the RIT-T test, which is very short sighted in its regulatory oversight for new investment in transmission infrastructure. The recommendation I'm particularly passionate about, besides the uncertainty recommendation, is recommendation 16, which is that AEMO consider establishing renewable energy zones. This is essential if we have to decarbonise our grid. We need serious investment in renewable energy zones to take advantage of the greatest solar radiation in the world and great wind resources, but to do that we need adequate planning and adequate investment in the grid, and AEMO has a lead role in this. These are really important recommendations.


There is some really important commentary around system security. Our review found that renewable energy can provide all the security services that the grid needs around frequency control, ancillary services and inertia responses if there is adequate planning and investment. It is not that these sources of generation can't provide these services; it's that they've never been called upon to do that. With adequate planning and a good regulatory framework, they can provide them.


The final thing in this report which is really important is the commentary around geographic diversity. We are an energy island, and some people say that, because we are an energy island, we can't invest in renewable energy because we don't have nuclear from France to draw upon or hydro from Canada to draw upon—as you can if you're in New York. But our geographic diversity and the sheer size of the land mass in this country means that that diversity provides reliability, north and south and east and west. If we invest in renewable energy with good planning, we can have solar going in western Queensland backed up by wind and wave power in Tasmania and great support in South Australia. These are things that can be provided—they occur in other countries—if we do the planning right.


I want to thank the Speaker personally for approving overseas travel for this committee. Often this travel is portrayed as a junket, but I, as one of the four members of the committee who had the privilege of going to Germany and the United States, learned so, so much about the energy infrastructure and approach in those countries, and it informed this committee report. I can absolutely assure you that this report would not be as strong, credible and well researched as it is now if we hadn't had that trip, so thank you very much, Speaker. 


I commend this report to the House, and I would recommend that everyone who is interested in energy policy have a read of it with an open mind, because it does chart a way forward.



The SPEAKER:  The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the member for Mallee wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a later occasion?

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:17):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Today, parliament is acting.


Today we have an opportunity to address the epidemic of domestic violence that scars our nation.


Today I am proud to introduce this bill, the Fair Work Amendment (Improving National Employment Standards) Bill 2017, which will provide every employee with an entitlement to 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave per calendar year. An employee will be entitled to access the leave if they or a member of their family experiences family and domestic violence and, as a result, requires care from that employee. The employee will be able to take this leave if they require counselling, medical attention, legal advice, relocating or any other activity associated with the experience of domestic violence.


Family and domestic violence is a wicked act that is not caught on CCTV footage, like a hold-up at a convenience store or a robbery, which are often beamed into lounge rooms across the country on the nightly news.


This insidious violence takes many forms, often occurring under a dark shroud, behind closed doors. It is hidden from view. It is perpetrated by cowardly people in the kitchens, bedrooms and living rooms of homes all across the country.


One in six women experience family and domestic violence. Indigenous women experience violence at even higher rates. Last year, we lost 44 women to family and domestic violence. Every one of these deaths is a tragedy—an unacceptable tragedy. The number should be zero.


Domestic violence is a problem that begins and ends with men. Mainly, it is men who perpetrate this violence against their partners and their families. It is men who are imbued with entitlement and misogyny, who scar our collective national consciousness, and it is men, not women, who must change their behaviour. It's clear that we need to alter the way we raise our boys. We need to teach them to respect women, and that violence is abhorrent.


It's clear we all have a role to play to stop this from happening—but that until then we must live with our failure, and living with our failure means acknowledging the reality before us: that family and domestic violence is an ongoing problem that we must address now. And, while the parliament cannot flick the switch immediately and prevent another woman from dying an unnecessary death at the hands of their partner, we can do something.


The reason that this bill is so important, and I urge everyone, whichever party they come from, to support this bill, is because leaving a domestic violence situation is one of the hardest things that a person may attempt in their lives. It is not a matter of packing a bag and walking out the door. The perpetrators of family and domestic violence erode the liberty, the freedom and the independence of their victims. They do not just inflict fear and pain—they paralyse and isolate people.


Not only is the cost of domestic violence to our society vast, but the cost of escaping and leaving a violent relationship is also significant. According to the ACTU, on average it takes $18,000 and 141 hours to escape such a relationship—$18,000, 141 hours. Starting a new life in a new place isn't easy—you need to do simple things, logistical things, like hire a truck to move possessions, and spend time finding a new place to go; things that in many circumstances are stressful enough anyway, but when you have the added burden of experiencing family and domestic violence, or knowing someone who has, it makes it all the harder. And if you're trying to start a new life while escaping an old one, you also need to pay lawyers, seek support to deal with trauma, apply for Centrelink, look for new schools for your child—the list goes on and on.


Many women consider their financial capacity while they're thinking about leaving an abusive situation, and a majority of women—two thirds, in fact—are in paid employment.


But right now, instead of automatically having the support of their workplace, women in abusive relationships are trapped in a scary catch 22: leaving work to create more time means sacrificing income, financial independence and possibly their job, but staying at work may hinder their ability to get organised and get out.


Additionally, along with the personal impact that domestic violence has on an employee, there are real costs borne by the workplace in the form of decreased performance and conflict among workers. This is because intimate partner violence spills over into the public sphere. This violence does not end when women step outside their homes but pervades every part of their lives, including their workplaces. The workplace can cease to be a safe space. Oftentimes, past or current abusive partners may target victims and survivors at work, through an onslaught of emails, phone calls or by showing up in person, attempting to get these women fired or forcing them to resign. Make no mistake, this is an exercise in exerting power and control over women, robbing them of financial security, self-confidence or the ability to do their work effectively. Women cannot afford this disruption and the endangerment of their jobs.


According to a report from the Australian Human Rights Commission, women who experience domestic violence are more likely to have lower personal incomes and a disrupted work history, and almost half of the women said it affected their ability to work.


The point is that this impossible choice is a false choice. There is another option for these women, if this place has the courage to choose it. We can give another option to millions of women across this country.


Ten days of paid family and domestic violence leave gives women the flexibility to take time off work to arrange for their own safety. This year, the parliament can grant what should be a universal right for every single worker in this country—the right to safety.


This policy will save lives.


Without paid leave, it's very hard to leave.


And right now, we're not doing a good enough job at both preventing domestic violence from happening in the first place but also calibrating our policies to ensure that people who are in abusive relationships can leave them. We're failing on both fronts.


Why is this? How many people must suffer until we do something? How many more Rosie Battys will there be until we act? This government talks a lot about keeping Australians safe. But there's a troubling reality: figures from the Bureau of Statistics show that from 2003 to 2012, while deaths to Australians caused by terrorism was at 133, deaths from domestic violence was at 870.


It is the height of hypocrisy and it is offensive for the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to sit here in this place, complete with white ribbons, to talk about tackling family and domestic violence and then—when we have the opportunity to act to do something about it—to choose not to


That takes a special kind of malice, a special kind of mendacity—to look women who have suffered in the eyes and effectively say, 'I know I can help, but I am choosing not to.'


The Greens are putting our cards on the table. We've introduced this bill and we're willing to have a conversation about this issue that's literally destroying people's lives.


I hope that this bill passes with support from across the aisle. I know, having been here now for a period of time, that what often happens when courageous bills are brought forward is that they're ignored and then there's a period of ridiculing them saying, 'It'll cost too much,' and then, as we see time and time again, policies that the Greens bring to this place usually get adopted a few years later. We should not wait. We should not go through that cycle this time. We should make this a reality this year.


I challenge members who are sitting in this place to turn their talk into action. Put forward a legitimate reason for not voting for this bill. The Minister for Employment, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition should all stand up and say they support this bill and turning it into law this year.


Women today are living in an extraordinary time. The President of the United States is an anti-abortion misogynist who sees women as objects for him to accumulate and conquer. The #MeToo movement, at the same time, is sweeping the globe, uncovering men in powerful positions who have abused their power and their privilege at the expense of women who are just trying to do their job. But this is not merely a problem of men in power or men of celebrity. These abusers of women are hiding in anonymity across our country. Most women's stories are yet to be acknowledged. Women without the privilege, the public platform, the workplace support, or the financial security often needed to speak up, face a greater likelihood of devastating consequences. So, as this bill is debated and progresses through this place, every one of us needs to decide: which side are we on? Right now, history is being written. Will this parliament capitulate or will we use the extraordinary potential of this place to take a step that will save the lives of women around this country? Ten days leave for those experiencing family and domestic violence is unobjectionable, and I commend this bill to the House.

 (Forde—Government Whip) (10:28):  I move:


That this House:


(1) acknowledges the importance of the trade and economic relationship between Australia and Japan;


(2) welcomes the sixty year anniversary since the signing of the Australia-Japan Agreement on Commerce;


(3) notes the significant opportunities offered by the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement for Australian exporters;


(4) recognises and celebrates the significant role of Japanese investment in Australia's economy, noting that this investment is creating and supporting Australian jobs;


(5) notes the ongoing cooperation and commitment between Australia and Japan to open markets and a strong, rules-based global trading system; and


(6) encourages the Australian Government to continue its economic cooperation with Japan to the mutual benefit of both countries, to create jobs and support prosperity in both our nations. 


It's with great pleasure that I stand in this House today to speak about the importance and the value of the trade relationship between Australia and Japan. This motion looks to acknowledge the importance of this trade relationship. Importantly, it welcomes the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Australia-Japan Agreement on Commerce, and it looks at the significant opportunities that are offered by this economic partnership for Australian businesses and exporters. It recognises and celebrates the significant role of Japanese investment in the Australian economy, noting that this investment is creating and supporting Australian jobs. It notes the ongoing cooperation and commitment between Australia and Japan to open markets and have a strong, rule based global trading system. It encourages the Australian government to continue its economic cooperation with Japan for the mutual benefit of both countries to create jobs and support prosperity in both of our nations.


The economic relationship between Australia and Japan has been exponentially bolstered over the past five years thanks to the success of the government's economic partnership agreement. This successful program is in part thanks to the tremendous efforts of the government's current and former ministers for trade, tourism and investment who have gone above and beyond to build an ever-strengthening partnership between our two nations. However, the success of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement is also in large part thanks to our country's exporters and businesses, who have taken the opportunity to become competitive and to embrace the trade opportunities this agreement with Japan presents.


Japan is a vital and longstanding economic partner for Australia, and over the past decade the country has become a beacon of economic stability. Japan is Australia's second-largest export market and fourth-largest source of foreign investment. In 2017 we marked 60 years of the Australia-Japan agreement on commerce, which has provided tremendous opportunities for our two nations. The 60-year partnership has bound our two countries together, with Japan's investment in Australia underpinning the development of both our economies. It has forged the creation of new industries in Australia, while Japan has prospered from a stable, long-term supply of our natural resources. Our relationship has been further strengthened by the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, which came into effect in January 2015. Three years later we're seeing the fruits of its success, with Australian exporters benefiting from improved market access across a wide range of services and products.


Thanks to the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, Australia has seen the first significant agriculture producer to have a meaningful trade agreement with Japan, providing our exporters with a competitive advantage in the market. I would like to share with the House just how tremendous the export growth to various Australian industries has been. Beef is our largest agricultural export to Japan, worth some $1.8 billion in 2016, and the rapid tariff reductions have provided significant competitive advantage over our major competitor the United States. Between 2014 and 2016 Australian fresh or chilled beef exports have increased by 22½ per cent, a terrific outcome for our Australian beef farmers. It's a terrific outcome not only for our beef farmers but also for our beef processors, like Teys in my electorate, which employs nearly 800 people. The benefits of these relationships with Japan have ensured 800 people in my electorate of Forde have retained their jobs.


Our wine, dairy and seafood industries are also benefiting greatly, with the agreement providing a competitive advantage over other countries. As an example, in the same period Australia's bottled wine exports increased by 13 per cent, our fresh table grape exports increased by 5,183 per cent, shelled macadamia exports grew by 4.7 per cent, rolled oat exports increased by 99 per cent, fresh or chilled carrot exports increased by nearly 500 per cent and prepared or preserved abalone exports increased by some 86 per cent. We can see from those figures alone the breadth of opportunity that's being provided across Australia through these agreements, and I would like to add another business in my electorate: Frosty Boy, who provide the powder for soft serve ice cream. As they like to say in their slogan, 'Often licked, but never beaten'. They have spoken very positively about the improved access and ability to trade in Japan as a result of these agreements.


Our resources, energy and manufacturing industries have also experienced increases in exports. As an example, Australia's exports of pigments and preparations of titanium oxide have grown by some 31 per cent. In terms of fresh produce, many Australian products have seen growth in their exports to Japan. Sugar, natural honey, chilled and fresh asparagus, oranges, broccoli and shelled almonds have all seen very significant increases over the years.


In the education sector, our universities have been brought closer together, with Japan formally recognising Australian bachelor degrees for entry into postgraduate programs into Japanese institutions. This formal recognition is of great benefit to students, and it makes Australian education services more attractive in Japan.


Not only do these figures show an outstanding result for these industries; importantly, every single one of these industries employs Australian people. That is the great value of these agreements—that these benefits carry forward into the Australian economy and benefit everyday Australians by providing them with job opportunities.


This investment continues to be good for the economy as a whole. These tariff cuts in return also provide tremendous opportunities for Australians. The tariff cuts on Japanese exports to Australia mean we are now paying less for goods and services, including Japanese-made cars, electronics and white goods. The economic agreement between Australia and Japan has resulted in successful outcomes for both countries. 


I'd like to finish on a new business that has recently opened in my electorate as a result of this. We've seen one of the great manufacturing companies of Japan open a big new factory in the electorate of Forde, at Yatala. Oji Fibre Solutions have opened a $72 million factory, introducing new technology which will boost fresh food exports and open fresh prospects for food exporters in Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory. The Japanese-owned pulp and paper company is producing food packaging that is tailored to the climatic conditions of specific markets. The packaging technology will help Australian producers ensure the goods dispatched to high-end consumers in Asia arrive in pristine condition. This world market leader in manufacturing of cardboard boxes and specialist packaging is not only helping Australian exporters expand their horizons but also creating local jobs in my electorate of Forde. Without the opportunities created by the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, the demand for Oji Fibre's products wouldn't be as great, and we would never see their multimillion-dollar investment in Yatala. 


It is heartening to see that the hard work that this government continues to do with these trade agreements, continuing to build these trade relationships with countries around the world, has a direct benefit in many electorates around the country, but in particular in my electorate of Forde. I congratulate the government and the minister for the continuing great work they are doing in this space.

Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (10:38):  Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, welcome to 2018. I hope you had a great Christmas. I support this motion and I thank the member for Forde for articulating those good things that are happening between Australia and Japan, both for the benefits that we get in terms of jobs and improvements to our economy and for the great things the people of Japan get as part of our strengthening relationship. I just want to acknowledge the importance of our trade and economic relationship, and add to that the importance of our defence relationship.


Japan is a large economy. It is a large trading partner for us and it is also, as we heard, a very important source of foreign investment. In Darwin, where I'm from, and which I represent, we're very conscious of this. We have a very large gas project, the INPEX project, worth about $40 billion—not a small project at all—the gas from which will be processed and shipped out from the Port of Darwin, and it will literally keep the lights on in Tokyo. The construction phase for that massive facility in Darwin is winding down now—the project is moving into the operational phase—but it has been a big boost for many companies in Darwin and for the people of Darwin and Palmerston, in my electorate. It's a big boost for the energy security of Japan.


We need further investment in the North. Whilst the INPEX project has been great, we can't depend on it; we need to make our own luck and create our own job-producing projects. That's why we look forward to the confirmation of the Darwin City Deal and some form of Commonwealth investment in Darwin. We also need to look at ways that, when there are large projects like the INPEX project coming to town, we can maximise the benefit to the local economy.


There are many opportunities for investment in the Northern Territory, other than in natural gas. We really welcome further Japanese involvement in our many and varied industries in the Top End. We heard a bit from the member about cattle—we've got those. We have natural resources in abundance and we look forward to a deepening and strengthening of our trading relationship with Japan.


But our relationship goes beyond trade and investment. Since the 1950s our relationship with Japan has been broad and deep. Our shared interests in defence, international security, democratic government, humanitarian aid, and disaster response, in which Darwin plays a pivotal role, and our strong ties of cultural exchange, education, and research are but a few of the ways that everyday Australians experience this strong bond.


Darwin, as the capital of northern Australia and the centre of the defence of northern Australia, is part, with the Japanese and our allies, of keeping markets open. Together, we are committed to the rules based order that allows global trade to continue. That's why it is so important that we work closely with Japan and our allies. In Timor-Leste last year I saw firsthand some of that close interaction. There was an exercise involving Timor-Leste, Australia, the US Marines and Japanese defence force personnel, which was fantastic. I note that the anniversary of the bombing of Darwin is coming up on 19 February. We do not forget the loss of Australian lives in World War II, but, in the spirit of the Fujita family, we also look to reconciliation. Our trade and defence ties will get stronger as we move on.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2018-02-05,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:43):  I'm pleased to rise to support this motion moved by the good member for Forde, who I know has great interest in the people of his electorate and the businesses there, and in creating opportunities for those businesses to export to Japan. Over the past 12 months we've seen the success of our free trade agreement with Japan. Just look at some of the results: frozen beef exports up 32 per cent to $663 million; honey exports up 66 per cent to $1.7 million; mandarin exports up 65.8 per cent to over $8 million; bulk wine exports to Japan up 52 per cent to $3.9 million; shelled almond exports up 55 per cent to $3.6 million; and shelled macadamias up 24 per cent to $2 million. These export sales add wealth to the country. They create wealth, especially in our regional areas. They strengthen them, with income flowing into them, with higher prices—good for the economy and good for the country. Is it any wonder that last year we saw 400,000 new jobs created in this economy? Four hundred thousand is a record. That is because this coalition government understands that the way you create jobs is that you get government out of the way, and you give the private sector opportunities to get in and sell their products and exports.


Amongst all the great news of our increasing exports to Japan is coal. In 2016, Australia exported $11.1 billion worth of coal to Japan. I know that last year we had many members of the Labor Party, especially the soothsayer, the member for Port Adelaide, the man with the great vision of the future, stand there and say that thermal coal exports were in significant decline. 'Substantial decline' was the prediction from the member for Port Adelaide for coal exports. Can you guess what happened to coal exports to Japan last year—remembering that the member for Port Adelaide said that they were in decline? I'm proud to say here in the House today that Australia's coal exports to Japan last year increased by 50 per cent to $16.78 billion. That was an increase of $5.68 billion worth of coal alone—an amazing increase. And yet we had members of the Labor Party, their shadow spokesman for energy, running around in the middle of last year telling all and sundry that thermal coal exports were in decline. Could he have got it more wrong? And is it any wonder? Japan have 45 new coal-fired power stations currently under construction—45—and yet we have zero coal-fired power stations under construction. Japan's economy is going ahead. They understand the importance of low-cost energy, and that is why they are building new coal-fired power stations.


And it's not only Japan that are increasing their consumption of coal. Last year—the numbers are just in—we saw China increase their consumption of coal by 5.2 per cent. We had all the experts in the Labor Party telling us the exports of coal to China were in decline. We saw last year China increase their consumption of coal by 5.2 per cent. To put that in some context: if we took our entire consumption of coal in all of Australia—every single last piece of coal that we burnt and we used to generate electricity—China's increase last year was double what we used. That was just their increase. We've seen the International Energy Agency's forecast for coal demand to increase. They expect the increase of coal for 2022 to be $5.5 billion tonnes, up from the current $5.2 billion tonnes. As the President of the USA said in his State of the Union speech:


… we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal.


It's about time the Labor Party joined with the rest of the world and realised that coal exports are increasing, not decreasing.

"Wilson, Josh, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (10:49):  I'm glad for the opportunity to speak on this motion about the relationship between Australia and Japan—not about coal, as I understand it. I thank the member for Forde for bringing this topic up for debate. Australia and Japan have a considerable recent history of economic and cultural engagement. It's a tradition that has enriched both countries. It's a relationship that continues to underpin our prosperity in a region of relatively sustained but nevertheless fragile peace and stability.


There's no doubt that Japan and Australia, representing the north and south poles of the eastern Indo-Pacific, have vital work to do, in partnership, if further cooperative, peaceful development is to prevail in our region. From the first recorded export of Australian wool to Japan in 1888 through to the 60th anniversary celebrations of the Australia-Japan Agreement on Commerce last year, ours is a relationship built on a core set of shared values and shared ambitions for a thriving Indo-Pacific region. Since the end of World War II we have worked closely with Japan to establish and promote a number of shared objectives.


From our own distinct perspectives and national interests we have worked together in pursuit of peace, trade, democratic governance and a cooperative rules based international order, but there is much more to be done, as Japan's ambassador to Australia, His Excellency Ambassador Kusaka, said last year in Perth:


Merely drumming up support for democratic values on their own will not gain the support of our fellow neighbours in finding common ground for our interests.


We need to be able to offer a credible economic plan that instills confidence among our neighbours …


I absolutely agree with that. I would go further in saying there's potential for Japan and Australia to work together not just for our mutual trade and broader economic interests but in supporting sustainable development in the Pacific, where our neighbours include some of the poorest and least developed nations.


My home state of Western Australia has been at the forefront of the trading relationship between our two countries, with state representative offices in both Kobe and Tokyo, the latter of which recently celebrated its 40th year of operation. Japan is WA's second largest export market, and the value of those traded goods increased 11 per cent last year alone to reach $15.7 billion. Japan is also Western Australia's largest source of imports.


My electorate of Fremantle benefits directly from the strong relationship via both tourism and international students, and the City of Fremantle maintains a vital connection with its sister city of Yokosuka, a key port to the south of Tokyo which I've been fortunate enough to visit. The cities of Fremantle and Cockburn within my electorate are active participants in the Mayors for Peace initiative, which started in Japan in the aftermath of the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was a great privilege in my former role as deputy mayor of Fremantle to join a delegation of Anangu artists from South Australia to install the first Australian sculpture in the Nagasaki Peace Park in 2017.


We must not forget, whenever we talk about trade and economic cooperation, that the precondition of commerce is peace. Indeed, at a time of uncertainty and volatility across the world, including some worrying instabilities in our region, it is crucial that we honour and strengthen country-to-country relationships that are founded on principles that support dialogue and cooperation. At a time when some nations are responding to domestic economic challenges by taking a closed approach to borders and trade, and in some cases slipping towards authoritarian models or modes of governance, the Australia-Japan relationship stands as an example of openness based on robust, democratic institutions and adherence to the rules based international order. It stands as a clear demonstration of the synergies that can be gained when countries, despite their historic, cultural and linguistic differences, work together on the basis of respect and understanding to expand common ground rather than retreat to opposing positions.


As we mark the 60th anniversary of the Australia-Japan Agreement on Commerce, we should remember there was nothing preordained about the quickly formed and substantial nature of our relationship after World War II. The fact that we've overcome what might be reasonably have been regarded as cultural and historical obstacles should be a reminder that we can keep working together even in areas where we take a different starting position. We have a shared interest in rules based and rigorous fisheries management and ocean protection, but a clear difference when it comes to whaling. I believe that ultimately we will reach a common position on that issue. We have a shared interest and even some common experience in respect of atomic weapons, and I believe there's more we can do together towards the cause of nuclear disarmament. As a member of this place I hope that I can join with others in the parliament to support a strong Australia-Japan relationship. That relationship should continue to deepen as we cooperate further in the Indo-Pacific region.

Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (10:54):  I'm very pleased to be able to rise here today on our first day back in the parliament to speak on this commendable motion brought forward by the member for Forde. It acknowledges, among other things, the importance of the trade and economic relationship between Australia and Japan. I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the historical settlement of Japanese people in Australia, particularly in Western Australia. There is undoubtedly a troubled history between our two nations, and Japan and Australia have a most grave shared experience of conflict and war that is to be acknowledged, but we must never allow the past to hold captive our future peace and prosperity. I, for one, have been a frequent visitor to Japan since discovering the ski fields of Hokkaido—not to mention the fine Japanese food and their excellent whisky. I, along with many Australians, make my way to Japan for the occasional dose of snow. More recently, we've tended to visit the old towns in the snow such as Nozawa Onsen, in Honshu, in the Nagano prefecture. It's a beautiful village steeped in tradition, surrounded by beautiful terrain and shared with us visitors by most-welcoming people.


People from Japan first settled as residents in WA in 1879 in Cossack, in WA's north-west. Japanese people participated in a wide variety of trades and labour around that time. Principally, they were engaged in the pearling industry in Broome. By the early 1900s, Broome was the world's largest pearling centre. Testament to the contribution of Japanese divers to that industry there are 900 graves in the Japanese cemetery in Broome, principally those of men who died diving for pearls or from the effects of that risky trade. Today Broome continues to hold the Shinju Matsuri Festival, the Festival of the Pearl, and celebrates the wonderful multicultural population of that industry. I acknowledge the comments earlier by the member for Solomon regarding Mr Fujita. It's a story of reconciliation and hope for a better future together, which we have now realised with the remarkable trade and relationship we enjoy with Japan.


In regard to trade Japan was WA's second-largest export market in 2016-17, accounting for 30 per cent of the state's total merchandise exports. The value of WA's exports to Japan rose 11 per cent in that year, from $14.2 billion to $15.7 billion. Petroleum, mainly liquefied natural gas, accounted for 54.9 per cent of exports to Japan in 2016-17, and the value of that export rose by 3.6 per cent, from $8.3 billion to $8.6 billion, over the last two years. And, of course, we continue to export iron ore to Japan out of Western Australia.


Japan was WA's fifth-largest market for agriculture exports last year. Co-operative Bulk Handling, a very proud cooperative venture, has the largest bulk-handling facility for grain in the Southern Hemisphere. That is located at Kwinana Beach, in my electorate. CBH exports 800,000 tonnes of WA growers' grain to the Japanese market per annum, the majority of which is wheat. Japan was also WA's largest export market for cereal straw and hay and the second-largest market for pearl barley. Australia is the first major agricultural exporter to secure a bilateral trade agreement with Japan. There are very significant advantages in this for Western Australia and, for that matter, the whole of Australia. I am very much a keen supporter of that trade agreement. Of course, trade is two way. Japan was WA's largest import market for 2016-17, accounting for 13.7 per cent of the state's total merchandise imports.


I'd like to reflect for a moment on the sister city relationships between Japan and Australia. WA enjoys many sister city relationships. Late last year my home town of Rockingham celebrated the 20th anniversary of its sister city relationship with Ako. I congratulate Mayor Barry Sammels, Deputy Mayor Deb Hamblin and City of Rockingham councillors past and present for their very great efforts to extend this relationship with Ako.


The state of Western Australia has celebrated the 35th anniversary of its sister state relationship with the Hyogo prefecture. I'd like to acknowledge the very important work of Japan's Consul-General in Western Australia, Mr Tatsuo Hirayama. Since arriving in Perth in September 2016, he has been a frequent visitor to Rockingham and is very busy building relationships across Perth and Western Australia. I look forward to visiting Japan in March. I'm participating in the Australian Political Exchange Council program. I very much look forward to learning from those in Japan and the work in the National Diet and to the visits. I thank the House.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (10:59):  I rise to take the opportunity to contribute to this debate, which acknowledges the importance of the trade and economic relationship between Australia and Japan. In particular, I welcome the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Australia-Japan Agreement on Commerce. Indeed, given the history of World War II, it's quite a remarkable thing that we're recognising that 60 years ago, just after the end of that conflict, Australia and Japan entered into a relationship based upon friendship and, whilst not forgetting the past, acknowledged the need for us to move forward into the future as two peoples in two sovereign nations. Indeed, what a success that relationship has been over the last 60 years! There is no doubt that there is a significant opportunity, moving forward, for that relationship to continue to be strengthened. It is of mutual benefit to our two nations—in terms of job creation and our cooperation in international forums—that our trade relationship has formed the basis of that. It has been of great benefit, Japan being a major importer from Australia of our resources, our agriculture and our technology, which has allowed Japan to be one of the economic success stories of the late 20th century.


Indeed, Japan has played an important role in international forums. Twice as a minister in the previous government I was able to go to Japan, and on a number of occasions I was able to host here in Australia infrastructure delegations from Japan. Japan was critical in forming the MEET, as it was known—the ministerial council on energy and emissions in transport. Japan understood that, in playing an important role in the development of the Kyoto Protocol—the global foundation that came out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Kyoto—we need to work cooperatively as an international community to drive down our emissions, and one of the ways we can do that is in the transport sector. That's why Japan has been at the forefront of the development of electric vehicles and zero-emissions transport.


Japan's success in the postwar period has been put down to many things, but one critical factor is the development of high-speed rail. With the Shinkansen, they were ahead of the rest of the world in having the vision of being able to transport large numbers of people in very short periods of time, and they continue to lead the world in that technology. They have much to offer Australia as we seek to develop a high-speed rail network down the east coast. Just as high-speed rail stacks up in Japan, just as it has led to significant economic development along the routes in regional centres in Japan, Australia has much to gain from high-speed rail. So I look forward to continuing to have discussions with executives from the Japanese rail sector on how their knowledge can provide a basis of support for the development of high-speed rail here in Australia. We know that it stacks up, with a return of more than $2 for every dollar of investment between Sydney and Melbourne, and we know that it could be a major factor in developing our regional economies, taking pressure off the capital cities on the east coast.


I commend the resolution to the House and I look forward to strengthening the friendship between Australia and Japan in the future.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (12:42):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017 that we're debating today could perhaps be called the 'What a Difference a Few Days Makes Bill' because it is emblematic of the chaotic nature of policymaking at the heart of this government and, in particular, by this Treasurer. On 28 November last year, which wasn't that long ago, the Prime Minister said, 'We've made it clear that we are not going to establish a royal commission.' A couple of weeks after this legislation was introduced into the parliament, the Treasurer said on 3 November:


I'm not quite sure how spending $150 million on a QC's complaints desk, otherwise known as what others are pushing for, would help resolve any of those issues.


He was talking about a royal commission into banking and financial services. He quoted the measures in this bill, the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, as evidence that 'the government was taking action now', which is why, he said, they didn't need a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector. And then on 30 November, after 600 days of fighting Labor's call for a royal commission, the government announced a royal commission. That could be regarded as one of the more spectacular backflips of this government—and it's a very long list.


As I said, this goes to the lack of a coherent agenda and coherent policy narrative at the heart of this government. We know that the government doesn't even fully believe in what it is doing: at the time the Prime Minister announced the royal commission, he called it 'regrettable'. I don't think the victims of financial scandals would regard it regrettable; they would see it as essential. Sometimes it is said, and the government has said, the royal commission would take too long. If the government had adopted a royal commission at the time that Labor proposed it, it would now be over. We would be moving on. We would be dealing with the implementation of recommendations. All this wasted time wouldn't have existed, and we would have been getting on with these important challenges as a nation. This has been just the latest example of a government doing anything it can to avoid a royal commission. It's all about avoiding a royal commission, and yet now we have this bill as well as a royal commission.


We will be supporting this bill. In fact, the government can rely on more support from this side of the House than they can from their own when it comes to this bill. It's reported that the member for McMillan called this a contravention of Liberal Party philosophy. There were concerns also expressed by the members for Goldstein and Corangamite. So the government has some internal issues on this bill, but it will be enjoying the support of the opposition. 


The bill does introduce an accountability framework for banks. Who the framework applies to, what the obligations are for the banks and for employees of the banks, deferred remuneration obligations for banks, a civil penalty regime for breaches of these obligations and other related issues are all covered by this legislation, which is said to take effect from 1 July this year. 


We do have some issues and concerns about this bill, and I will be moving an amendment in the consideration-in-detail phase. While I'm not moving an amendment on this particular matter, it strikes me as odd that the government has empowered APRA, not ASIC, in this space, and this is something that will need to be monitored. We have well-respected regulators in Australia. We have had, traditionally, a very clear delineation of responsibility between the regulators. Based on what is being implemented here, it would be a natural fit for ASIC to have these responsibilities that the government has chosen to give APRA. I'm not going to quibble about that in consideration-in-detail amendments or try and change that. I just point that out as we go and say that that will need to be monitored in terms of how this regime is implemented, going forward. 


What I will move a consideration-in-detail amendment about is the start date of the legislation in relation to small- and medium-sized banks. Now, this is a considerable regime. It will take considerable effort on behalf of the banks to comply with it. I'm confident that our large institutions will be able to do that by the proposed start date, but smaller institutions will struggle. Banking competition is an important matter in this country. We have a Productivity Commission inquiry into banking competition. I think most honourable members would concede that more competition in banking would be a good thing. We saw some hollowing-out of competition with the departure of St George and Bankwest, or their being subsumed by parent entities. We all, I think, would support the role of customer-owned banking, credit unions and the like, and smaller banks, and recognise they play an important role in the financial system. We will wait and see what the Productivity Commission recommends; that could potentially play an even more important role going forward. 


What we don't want to do is put them at a substantial disadvantage. I think that this legislation as it's currently framed would put them at a substantial disadvantage. The Australian Bankers' Association noted:


Effective implementation of the BEAR regime will require material effort and reallocation of resources by ADIs and APRA to meet the proposed deadline. 


The Australian Shareholders' Association said:


While we acknowledge the government’s desire to implement the legislation as soon as possible, we are of the view that ADIs will need time to undertake changes to policies, contracts and systems.


The Australian Institute of Company Directors, the AICD, have said that they reiterated their view that BEAR's implementation date should be deferred so that it commences on 20 January 2019. Customer Owned Banking Australia said:


In order to effectively and efficiently implement the BEAR there are a number of things that must happen prior to the implementation date. 


They went on to argue that there was insufficient time to do that. So I do note that this has been raised by a number of stakeholders. Concern about the implementation date was shared by some government senators, who, in their report, recommended the date of implementation of the entire package be delayed for 12 months. But, for small- and medium-sized banks, the Labor Party has suggested previously that the implementation be delayed by 12 months—and that is the amendment that I will move when we get to consideration in detail. 


The Senate inquiry clearly showed that small- and medium-sized banks are not afforded the same access as the big banks to the development of this policy. I make that observation in passing as well.


It was noted in paragraph 2.75 of the explanatory memorandum that discussions were held with the big banks in February 2017 about options to address accountability gaps. But evidence from the Customer Owned Banking Association is that they had no knowledge of or involvement in these meetings. Labor senators made it clear that our position was to delay the implementation for small and medium ADIs by one year. I note the Treasurer's comments in the media that there would be 'a slower pace of implementation for the smaller banks'—we welcome that. That is, in effect, him agreeing with the Labor Party's position. As I understand it, the amendment I move may well receive the support of both sides of the House. Obviously I don't speak for the government. That's a matter for them to talk about in the House, but I would be hopeful of that amendment receiving bipartisan support in this House. 


I do think this is a bill which should receive the bipartisan support of the chamber. We don't, as I said, agree with every single element of it. We have made commentary on different parts of it, but none of that is enough for us not to support the bill as a step forward. None of it obviates the need for a royal commission—a point I would have made if the government had not already announced one. But, the government having announced a royal commission, quite evidently a royal commission is now bipartisan policy as well, so it's not in conflict with the fact that we are going to have a royal commission. 


I note that some have said that this doesn't go far enough. The Consumer Action Law Centre said:


Treasury has restricted the application of the proposed BEAR so that it will apply to poor conduct or behaviour that is of a systemic and prudential nature. This misses the crucial element of the United Kingdom model that ties accountability measures to poor consumer outcomes, not just prudential matters.


CHOICE went on to say:


As it stands, what we've got is a bit of a teddy bear. 


As I said, none of those concerns would be reason to oppose the passage of the legislation. It will receive our support, and I would hope for support for the amendment that I will move.

Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (12:51):  Before being elected to this place, I had several stages to my career. The first was here in Canberra as a policy adviser and director of corporate relations for the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I was privileged to spend four years working with Dr Peter Hendy, Greg Evans and Peter Anderson and learning from them. They all had extensive economic, business, industrial relations and policy reform experience. From them, from our state and territory chambers of commerce members, from our industry association members, like the Master Builders, the Hotels Association and the Printing Industries Association, and from the individual businesspeople who gave their time as volunteers on the ACCI board and on their committees, I learnt firsthand about the impact government regulation has on businesses. 


Government regulation costs businesses of all sizes time and money. It means they are less productive, less profitable and less able to focus on expansion and innovation. Government regulation is imposed by local councils, by state governments and by the federal government. As a newspaper columnist before my election to this place, I regularly wrote about the impact government regulation has on business. As a lifelong Liberal, I know that it's my duty to be true to the principles our party and our members hold dear: small government, low taxes, low regulation and letting business get on with business. As our Liberal Party constitution says, we look 'primarily to the encouragement of individual initiative and enterprise as the dynamic force of progress'. For all of these reasons, I am speaking on this bill today. 


Since 2013 Australia's financial sector has been the subject of no fewer than 24 reviews, reports and inquiries, including three by ASIC, three by the Productivity Commission, one by APRA, three by departments and statutory authorities, one by a House committee and seven by Senate committees. Our national financial institutions are subject to almost 40 regulations of varying degrees at any one time, from state governments, the Commonwealth and industry associations. The compliance cost burden on each of our financial institutions can run into the hundreds of millions of dollars per year. These costs are shifted straight onto consumers, who are hardworking Australians, their families and the businesses that they run and are working hard to maintain and grow. Since 2013 there have been 11 changes to the Banking Act and five changes to the APRA Act, further increasing the compliance burden borne by businesses and, ultimately, their customers. 


Australians expect us as their representatives to establish and maintain laws that reflect community expectations. We must make laws that send a clear message to the banking sector as to what we expect from it, but equally these laws must be effective and efficient in maintaining ethical standards. The long list of reviews, reports, inquiries, active regulators and legislative tinkering over the past five years alone suggests that these laws have been anything but efficient. The establishing of a banking, superannuation and financial services royal commission and the general discontent in the community suggest they have been anything but effective. 


Our job is to protect Australians—individuals, families and businesses. Another inquiry, another report and an expensive royal commission are not necessarily going to give redress to anyone who has been wronged. While the Banking Executive Accountability Regime reflects community expectations, the regime in and of itself is also not going to right wrongs. 


The coalition government has a strong track record of cutting red and green tape for employers and wealth creators, particularly small and medium businesses. We've saved the economy billions per annum in regulatory costs. Now, as the nation's most responsible party for economic management, we must concentrate our attention on effective and efficient regulation in this area. As a fiscally responsible government, we cannot fall into the dangerous bank-bashing mob mentality which, while potentially politically beneficial in the short term, will hurt Australian businesses, their shareholders and employees and, most importantly, their customers in the long term. We must remember that around 210,000 people are employed in the finance industry, comprising 1.7 per cent of total employment in Australia. Of these 210,000 people, around 150,000 are employed by banks, with the rest working at credit unions, building societies and the Reserve Bank of Australia. 


Australia must look to successful financial sectors for the world's best practice when it comes to effective regulation. It's clear that financial centres such as Singapore and Hong Kong have the balance right in terms of regulation, and they enjoy a strong financial services sector because of this. This means jobs; this means businesses. I'm contributing to this debate because I fear we are not adhering to world's best practice when it comes to regulating our financial sector. The Banking Executive Accountability Regime adds yet another layer of regulation to the ever-growing compliance burden faced by our financial institutions, adding another detractor to our competitiveness relative to those international sectors I mentioned earlier. It does this having only been subjected to a three-week consultation paper on the idea of the regime, followed by a one-week consultation period on the draft legislation itself. 


Of primary concern is that the regime creates a vague obligation for accountable persons to take reasonable steps to prevent the institution's reputation or prudential standing being adversely affected. The wording of 'reasonable steps' has been adopted from the United Kingdom's own version of this legislation. However, it speaks about reasonable steps to avoid breaching specific regulations. The obligations created by our legislation are particularly nondescript, and, even though APRA have provided some examples to the sector, their list is by no means exhaustive. For example, what is considered reasonable where a decision taken by an executive might preserve the institution's prudential standing but damage its reputation? What is an accountable person to do in this situation? 


Similarly, the BEAR bill proposes joint liability where two or more accountable persons share obligations within the institution. This means that an accountable person who shares obligations will be liable for a breach by the other person. While having bank executives look over each other's shoulders will help ensure compliance, executives need to know what compliance means. These two measures in particular have potential to slow a financial institution's decision-making process, and with it the potential to slow Australia's economic growth. While the parliament must hold bank executives to account, we need to get the legislation right the first time. 


The condensed time frame that the BEAR has had to be considered by both the industry and the parliament is of concern. On the timeframe for implementing the BEAR bill, I note that it has been consistently raised, both in submissions on consultations and by the Senate economic committee's report on the legislation, that the start date of the regime on 1 July 2018 leaves very little time for institutions to adequately comply. This particularly disadvantages smaller institutions, who don't have as much capacity to absorb new regulations as larger institutions might, and I note the comments of the previous speaker on this very point. The Senate committee recommended that the implementation of the regime be delayed to begin not less than 12 months after the legislation passes. I believe the government should not be burdening smaller players in the financial sector, especially at a time when we want to see a more diverse and competitive industry so that lower costs and more competitive terms and conditions can be provided to consumers. I'm concerned about the burden we're placing on financial institutions, our global competitiveness and, potentially, our economic growth.


To reiterate, Australians expect us as their representatives to establish and maintain laws that reflect community expectations. We must make laws that send a clear message to the banking sector as to what we expect from them, but equally these laws must be effective and efficient in maintaining appropriate ethical standards. Our job here is to protect Australians, whether they're individuals, families or businesses. Equally, our job is to ensure we have the most competitive and thriving businesses in the world in the banking and financial services sectors—and businesses more generally—who generate income for our nation and employ millions of Australians each and every year.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (13:01):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017 represents one of the greatest political backflips of all time. Just 12 months ago the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and members on that side of the House were saying that there were no issues with executive remuneration in the banking industry, there was nothing to see here, there were no problems and we didn't need a royal commission into banking and financial services in Australia—everything in our banking industry was hunky-dory—despite the fact that millions of customers were being ripped off and there were scandals in wealth management, insurance and retail banking. The government chose to ignore those, and it was only when the banks agreed that they were dragged kicking and screaming to agreeing to a royal commission. This bill does represent part of that backflip on the issue of executive remuneration in the banking industry, because for many, many years now there have been cases of rip-offs of customers and scandals, particularly in wealth management and insurance, where customers have lost millions and millions of dollars, lost their homes, lost out on insurance in cases of severe illness and death, lost their jobs and lost their ability to pay the household budget, but no-one was held accountable—particularly the big banks and the Australian deposit institutions that were responsible for those activities and left those hardworking Australians in those difficult positions.


This bill seeks to implement an accountability regime for executive remuneration in our banking industry. It proposes to strengthen the responsibility and accountability framework for senior directors and executives of authorised deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs, and their subsidiaries. The banking executive accountability regime, or the BEAR as it's become known, is part of the government's more accountable and competitive banking system program, which was their response to issues in the banking and financial services industry and their claimed credible alternative to Labor's proposal for a banking royal commission in banking and financial services. It would be remiss of me not to mention the fact that the government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the measures contained in this bill, and that's been put forward as a way to silence calls for a royal commission into banking.


Look at all of the scandals that have occurred over the last decade or so in banking. The wealth management scandals that we saw in the Commonwealth Bank and that have subsequently been identified in all of the big four major banks—which have meant they've had to pay back money to customers in those circumstances, many of whom have been fighting for long periods of time to get recompense, and some of whom are still fighting—were uncovered over the course of the last couple of years. There have been rip-offs in insurance, particularly CommInsure but also in other insurers throughout the country. There was the scandal relating to AUSTRAC and the Commonwealth Bank not reporting transactions through their intelligent deposit machines that were meant to be reported, because they were above certain thresholds contained in our antiterrorism and financing laws. People have been ripped off. Millions of Australian customers have been ripped off. Businesses, including small businesses, have shut down because of some of these rip-offs. Jobs have been lost. The pressure and stress that this put on a number of Australians and their households and businesses was immense, and the government chose to ignore them. The Turnbull government chose to ignore them for many, many years, saying that there wasn't a need for a royal commission into banking.


It is only when the executives of the big four banks wrote to the Prime Minister and said to him, 'We want a royal commission now, because we're sick and tired of the blame game and all of the damage that it is doing to our reputations,' that the Prime Minister rolls over. It's only when the big four banks say, 'It's okay to have a royal commission,' that this Prime Minister and this government roll over and finally give the Australian public what they want.


Then, in the process of doing so, he seeks to obfuscate the issues associated with banking and tries to point the finger at the industry super funds, where there've been no examples of rip-offs and scandals to the degree associated with the big four banks. Yet it's as if the Prime Minister spat the dummy and said, 'Well, if I have to give them a royal commission, I'm going to make sure that I go after the industry super funds as well, because they've got union representatives on their boards.' It says everything about this government's approach to financial services and banking in this country and to dealing with the issues and working in the interests of small businesses, families and pensioners.


It's lamentable that the government has ignored the pleas of the Australian public for greater accountability, particularly in the big four banks. Only the coalition have had such contempt for the Australian people that they would side with the big four banks over the course of the last few years in avoiding a royal commission. It's particularly the phrase 'executive accountability' that didn't seem to exist in their lexicon up until late last year, when they capitulated to calls for a banking royal commission.


It is worth noting what the Treasurer said just a year ago about the regulation of executive remuneration. He said:


In terms of those in senior corporate positions and what they are paid, they are matters for their boards … it is up to those companies to get the balance right, in terms of how they set those arrangements with their shareholders and their overall accountability to the Australian public for the social licence that they have to operate in Australia.


That was the Treasurer less than 12 months ago saying, 'Nothing to see here—no issue with banking accountability,' in terms of what they were paying their executives, despite what had been uncovered through successive parliamentary inquiries and investigations by journalists and the regulatory bodies into what was actually going on with the management of our big four banks and executive remuneration.


Finally, they've acted, and they've acted through this bill—a bill that creates an accountability framework that ADIs must comply with, with exemptions granted by the Treasurer or where it's a foreign ADI not operating a branch in Australia, or where they may have contravened a law of a foreign country. It defines an accountable person, for the purposes of the framework that's being developed, as a person who:


… has actual or effective … responsibility:


(i) for management or control of the ADI; or


(ii) for management or control of a significant or substantial part or aspect of the operations of the ADI or the relevant group of bodies corporate that is constituted by the ADI and its subsidiaries.


The bill sets out the accountability obligations of the ADIs and accountable persons. For instance, an ADI must take reasonable steps to conduct its business with honesty and integrity, and with due care, skill and diligence. It must deal with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way and, in conducting its business, prevent matters from arising that would adversely affect the ADI's prudential standards or prudential reputation. The bill sets out deferred remuneration obligations of an ADI, meaning an ADI must defer a proportion of the remuneration of an accountable person for a period of four years, the proportion generally depending on the size of the ADI. It also sets out notification obligations of an ADI, with ADIs to give APRA statements detailing the roles and responsibilities of each accountable person, and accountability maps identifying the lines of responsibility through the ADI group. It sets out a civil penalty regime for ADIs where they breach obligations—up to one million penalty units, or $210 million, for large ADIs.


A number of issues have been identified with the implementation of this particular package, through a Senate inquiry, and the shadow Treasurer has outlined those. I won't go into those in detail, but they relate particularly to smaller ADIs and their ability to meet the compliance obligations under this proposal within the time frame. Labor is suggesting and the shadow Treasurer will move, in the consideration in detail stage, an amendment to that effect to give more time to some of those smaller ADIs.


In conclusion, the case for greater accountability in the banking sector has been made out repeatedly by the tragic losses and the cases of fraud and deception that have befallen many across all corners of the country. Through the House Economics Committee, which I've been privileged to be a member of, and through the banking inquiries with the big four banks, we've identified some of those issues. But, unfortunately, we were given precious little time questioning the big bank CEOs to get to the bottom of the various injustices that have been perpetrated upon banking customers. Twenty minutes simply isn't enough time to question one of those CEOs about all of the scandals and rip-offs that have been going on in the banking industry over the course of the last decade. Nonetheless, I think the committee was very effective in hearing some of the revelations that have occurred in this industry, particularly around executive remuneration, most notably: the current, soon to be former, boss of CBA, Ian Narev reminding us that 40,000 customers had been charged for financial advice that they never actually received; and CBA admitting that no executives had lost their jobs over the wealth management scandal or the CommInsure scandal or the AUSTRAC financial advice scandal. All the CEOs refused, during those inquiries, to make public the number of executives earning above $1 million. But at the end of the day, we saw that that banking inquiry was hopelessly inadequate to get to the bottom of the toxic banking culture that we've had in this country for some years now.


Labor knew from day one that the only way to shine a light on what was actually going on in this industry was through a fair dinkum royal commission: a fair dinkum royal commission that provided an independent arbiter, with the probative powers necessary to call the banks and get to the bottom of what was going on in this industry. And that's what the Australian people have wanted for some time now. They are sick of the rip-offs and the scandals; that's left a bad taste in their mouths about banking in this country and they wanted a royal commission, but the Prime Minister denied that—only agreeing once the banks had given him the okay for it to occur. For 18 months Labor has been calling for a royal commission and it has been met with only obfuscation and ridicule by the government. Rather than listen to the victims, the government stuck with their talking points slamming the idea. It was only when the banks themselves realised that the writing was on the wall that the government came around.


This is not the first time that this has occurred in financial services. We look back to the Future of Financial Advice reforms, the FoFA reforms, which introduced a 'best interests' duty—a duty that ensures that a financial adviser must act in the interests of their customer, their client: the person that they're supposed to be working for. And what did those opposite do, when Labor introduced those laws in the parliament some years ago when we were in government? They opposed them. They opposed financial advisers operating in the best interests of their customers. It says everything about the government and what they stand for. Then, when they got to government, they tried to overturn those laws. They tried to water down that best-interest duty in the parliament. They got it through this place and then they got it through the Senate. It was only when the Senate saw what was going on in banking—that there was a problem there—that they changed their minds and removed their approval for those changes to be made. The same happened with superannuation reform as a result of the Cooper review into superannuation and the establishment of MySuper accounts. Again, there was opposition from the government to those sorts of things.


Even when Labor introduced its executive accountability regime generally—the two-strikes rule, as it's known—it was again opposed by those opposite because they didn't want to shed a light on what was actually going on in Australian corporations and give shareholders a say in the management of those companies that they had a stake in and that were paying ridiculous salaries and bonuses and providing share schemes for executives who were doing the wrong thing by them. It says everything about the government's approach to banking and finance and whose side they are on. They're certainly not on the side of the customer, of the client, of the small-business person, of the family or of the pensioner when it comes to banking. It was only when the banks agreed to a royal commission that the government rolled over and changed their view. They've chosen a piecemeal approach to solving this problem of executive remuneration and the problems in banking, and it's sad that they have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table on this issue.

Mr LEESER
 (Berowra) (13:16):  I'm pleased to rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017. This bill amends the Banking Act to establish the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, or the BEAR, as it's more commonly known. The BEAR is a strengthened responsibility and accountability framework for the most senior and influential executives and directors in banking groups. To support the BEAR, the bill gives the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, new and strengthened powers.


The banking sector plays an essential role in promoting economic growth and a critical role in the lives of all Australians. In order for it to operate in an efficient, stable and fair way, the community has to have trust in the banking sector. More than perhaps any other sector in the economy, this is the case for banks because we all rely on the banks to provide us with finance to conduct our activities. Whether you are borrowing money to finance the purchase of a home or borrowing money to finance the purchase of a business or to expand a business, the banks are absolutely fundamental to the functioning of the Australian economy.


In Australia, however, a series of incidents involving poor behaviour by banks over recent years has raised the question of whether there may be emerging systemic issues that are undermining public trust in the banks. Public trust is very important in the banking sector precisely because so many of us rely on the banks. In order to have an efficient, effective, secure and stable banking system, we need to ensure that there remains public trust.


Under the BEAR legislation, banks and their most senior executives and directors would be expected to conduct their businesses and responsibilities with honesty, with integrity, with due skill and with care and diligence; deal with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way; and prevent matters from arising that would adversely affect the authorised deposit-taking institutions' prudential reputation or standing. Where these expectations are not met, APRA will be empowered to more easily disqualify individuals, ensure that bank remuneration policies result in financial consequences for individuals and impose substantial fines on banks. Banks will be required to register with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority before appointing people as senior executives and directors. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority will also get additional examination powers which will help it to investigate potential breaches of the BEAR legislation. These mechanisms are intended to deter poor behaviour and ensure that banks and individuals are held to account where they fail to meet the high standards that are expected of them.


The legislation provides further clarity on the accountability obligations of banks and their directors and senior executives, and the enhanced consequences for being in breach of those obligations. In particular, APRA is empowered to impose substantial fines on banks, to more easily disqualify accountable persons and to ensure that bank remuneration policies result in financial consequences for individuals. The regime is due to start from 1 July this year. Banks may, as I said, remain at the centre of some of the most critical decisions in people's lives—buying a home, starting a business and saving for retirement—and it is important that mechanisms are in place to deter poor behaviour and provide for accountability where the high standards of behaviour that we all expect of such an important sector are not being met. 


I heard a lot from the member for Kingsford Smith, who preceded me in this debate, about government inaction and government failures, but I think those opposite need to have a look at their own record in relation to banking matters. Their record of inaction stands in contrast to the Turnbull government's ongoing reform of the financial services sector. Under our government, we've established the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, a one-stop shop to provide victims with compensation now, not years down the track. There is the creation of the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority, which protects consumers from dodgy practices, and industry funding of ASIC to bolster their resources and powers properly. Just last year, the government set up a focused and responsible inquiry into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry. 


From the early days of my candidacy, I have supported calls for a royal commission into the banks, and I'm pleased the government has acted, yet again, as part of its ongoing work into the financial services sector. I've personally been concerned about customer complaints relating to the Commonwealth Bank's takeover of Bankwest in 2008. The Commonwealth Bank's conduct in the aftermath of the global financial crisis has seen it accused of impairing healthy Bankwest loans and forcing customers into foreclosure. I think of the heroic work of my constituent Peter McNamee, who himself was not a victim of the Commonwealth Bank's conduct in this regard but who became a great advocate for victims before the various inquiries that occurred in this place, the inquiry established under Kate Carnell and the inquiries set up by ASIC. He was doing the hard yards to get public policy changed in this space to provide justice for victims. Peter has been a very strong advocate of the banking royal commission, and I'm very pleased that, through his work, many of the victims of the Bankwest issue will now have their chance to put their case before a very distinguished former High Court judge in Ken Hayne, who will make recommendations to the government about what to do going forward in this area. 


These issues have been long-running. They date back to when Labor was in government. The opposition had six years to act on banking misconduct, but they didn't do anything. When Storm Financial collapsed and other crises hit Australia under their government, what did they do? Their silence was deafening. When the coalition proposed a financial system inquiry in opposition, how did they respond? They refused to support it. Despite what the member for Kingsford Smith and others on the other side of the House may claim, when they sat on this side of the House, they were a government defined by inaction, and we've seen it time and time again. It takes the coalition to respond in a responsible and reasonable manner. That's what we've done with the royal commission, that's what we've done with a range of other financial services elements and that's what we're doing with the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which is being established under the legislation that is currently before the House. 


The opposition leader has pursued politics over people here. He has led a campaign where political pointscoring has drowned out the voices of victims. For all his talk, where was he when Labor was in power? If only the opposition leader had been in a position to act then, perhaps in his capacity as minister for financial services! But whether it was the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Treasurer, who was then the Assistant Treasurer, Labor repeatedly rejected in government the need for a royal commission. The contrast of record to rhetoric couldn't be clearer. The Turnbull government's take-action-now approach puts the inaction of previous Labor governments to shame. The establishment of the royal commission and the BEAR are just the latest in the long list of measures implemented by this government. They are the end result of orderly and orthodox processes, where the government has consulted with industry and affected parties in order to consider the best way forward to enhance public confidence and trust in the banking and financial services industries. 


Despite all of the noise we heard from those opposite about the royal commission, despite making a lot of noise over a long period of time, they never suggested anything about terms of reference for a royal commission. If you're serious about a royal commission, you publish your set of terms of reference. No—instead, it was just a political stunt. For all their boasting and bank-bashing, they never suggested these terms of reference. What's worse is that, in the way those opposite have conducted themselves, they have given false hope to the victims of banking misconduct. In this legislation, we have a way forward to ensure that bank executives act properly, ethically and prudentially and are appropriately supervised by the relevant authority.


While the Banking Executive Accountability Regime and a royal commission might uncover instances that lead to recommendations of compensation or, in relation to this particular regime, fines in relation to bank executives, those opposite just made a lot of noise rather than proposing actual policies. On top of their rhetoric, they should be ashamed at the way they have undermined Australia's financial stability through their alarmist attacks. In irresponsibly bashing the banks, they've put politics above people and their own egos above the economy. Our major banks represent almost nine per cent of Australia's GDP and employ more than 400,000 people. Millions of Australians have banking shares either directly or through their superannuation funds. We must be prudent and careful and sensible in the regulation of the banking industry. The vast majority of Australians not only are customers of the banks but have a direct stake in them through their superannuation, but those opposite have gone about this debate in a way that has put the economy at risk. They have put at risk the very system that supports Australian employment and wages. No-one in the Labor Party has done more to bash the banks than the former senator Sam Dastyari. His calls for a royal commission and actions on banks pre-date the official Labor position by some two years—and, where the former senator Sam Dastyari went, the Leader of the Opposition followed.


Time and time again, it has been a coalition government that has had to clean up the mess left behind by Labor, and that's what we're doing with the legislation before the House today. The failure of past Labor governments to adequately support victims of banking misconduct is reflected in their do-nothing approach. They didn't support a financial systems inquiry; they didn't respond to the victims of Bankwest or Storm Financial; and they didn't even bother to write terms of reference for their stunt of a royal commission. Shame on those opposite for leaving a legacy of inaction.


Once again, with the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill, the coalition government has come to pick up the pieces and restore stability and public confidence in our banking sector.

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (13:27):  This bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017, to introduce a banking executive accountability regime is nicknamed the BEAR. To quote financial sector expert Pat McConnell, a visiting fellow at Macquarie University:


Rather than being a terrifying polar or grizzly, it is already an old teddy bear that has had the stuffing knocked out of it.


So, rather than growl, this bear purrs like a pussycat. When it comes to the banking sector, that is how those opposite like it: purr like a pussycat and have your belly scratched.


Pat McConnell further states:


The government's new Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) legislation is a confused mess that is not going to do what it claims to do, which is make bankers accountable for scandals.


It is hardly a ringing endorsement of the government's approach.


This bill appears to echo the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, established by the May government in Britain, which came into force last year. Copying the British Chancellor's homework, our Treasurer proposed the BEAR in last year's budget, initially in order to take effect from 1 July this year. I'm pleased that I understand the Treasurer has now agreed to an amendment put forward in the Senate that that implementation be delayed.


For years, Labor has kept pressure on the government to act on the concerns of the tens of thousands of Australians and small businesses who have smelled something rotten going on in our finance and banking services sectors. It is why Labor has been calling for a banking royal commission. I couldn't understand the member for Berowra, who just spoke on the bill. One minute he was belting Labor for not supporting a banking royal commission early enough, and then he was belting us for supporting one two years ago. I didn't understand his logic, and I don't understand it now.


Labor has been on the record consistently as wanting a banking royal commission to get to the heart of the scandals in the banking sector in this country. Too many people and too many businesses have been ruined by the scandals engulfing this sector. We're pleased that the government's finally come to the table—kicking and screaming—on a banking royal commission. It took too long to get there, and it shouldn't have taken so long. This government's been reluctant to do anything regarding the banks, but finally it's been dragged into action, not because it wanted to, not because of the evidence provided to parliamentary committees of ruined lives and ruined businesses, but the consequence of banking malfeasance—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (12:42):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017 that we're debating today could perhaps be called the 'What a Difference a Few Days Makes Bill' because it is emblematic of the chaotic nature of policymaking at the heart of this government and, in particular, by this Treasurer. On 28 November last year, which wasn't that long ago, the Prime Minister said, 'We've made it clear that we are not going to establish a royal commission.' A couple of weeks after this legislation was introduced into the parliament, the Treasurer said on 3 November:


I'm not quite sure how spending $150 million on a QC's complaints desk, otherwise known as what others are pushing for, would help resolve any of those issues.


He was talking about a royal commission into banking and financial services. He quoted the measures in this bill, the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, as evidence that 'the government was taking action now', which is why, he said, they didn't need a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector. And then on 30 November, after 600 days of fighting Labor's call for a royal commission, the government announced a royal commission. That could be regarded as one of the more spectacular backflips of this government—and it's a very long list.


As I said, this goes to the lack of a coherent agenda and coherent policy narrative at the heart of this government. We know that the government doesn't even fully believe in what it is doing: at the time the Prime Minister announced the royal commission, he called it 'regrettable'. I don't think the victims of financial scandals would regard it regrettable; they would see it as essential. Sometimes it is said, and the government has said, the royal commission would take too long. If the government had adopted a royal commission at the time that Labor proposed it, it would now be over. We would be moving on. We would be dealing with the implementation of recommendations. All this wasted time wouldn't have existed, and we would have been getting on with these important challenges as a nation. This has been just the latest example of a government doing anything it can to avoid a royal commission. It's all about avoiding a royal commission, and yet now we have this bill as well as a royal commission.


We will be supporting this bill. In fact, the government can rely on more support from this side of the House than they can from their own when it comes to this bill. It's reported that the member for McMillan called this a contravention of Liberal Party philosophy. There were concerns also expressed by the members for Goldstein and Corangamite. So the government has some internal issues on this bill, but it will be enjoying the support of the opposition. 


The bill does introduce an accountability framework for banks. Who the framework applies to, what the obligations are for the banks and for employees of the banks, deferred remuneration obligations for banks, a civil penalty regime for breaches of these obligations and other related issues are all covered by this legislation, which is said to take effect from 1 July this year. 


We do have some issues and concerns about this bill, and I will be moving an amendment in the consideration-in-detail phase. While I'm not moving an amendment on this particular matter, it strikes me as odd that the government has empowered APRA, not ASIC, in this space, and this is something that will need to be monitored. We have well-respected regulators in Australia. We have had, traditionally, a very clear delineation of responsibility between the regulators. Based on what is being implemented here, it would be a natural fit for ASIC to have these responsibilities that the government has chosen to give APRA. I'm not going to quibble about that in consideration-in-detail amendments or try and change that. I just point that out as we go and say that that will need to be monitored in terms of how this regime is implemented, going forward. 


What I will move a consideration-in-detail amendment about is the start date of the legislation in relation to small- and medium-sized banks. Now, this is a considerable regime. It will take considerable effort on behalf of the banks to comply with it. I'm confident that our large institutions will be able to do that by the proposed start date, but smaller institutions will struggle. Banking competition is an important matter in this country. We have a Productivity Commission inquiry into banking competition. I think most honourable members would concede that more competition in banking would be a good thing. We saw some hollowing-out of competition with the departure of St George and Bankwest, or their being subsumed by parent entities. We all, I think, would support the role of customer-owned banking, credit unions and the like, and smaller banks, and recognise they play an important role in the financial system. We will wait and see what the Productivity Commission recommends; that could potentially play an even more important role going forward. 


What we don't want to do is put them at a substantial disadvantage. I think that this legislation as it's currently framed would put them at a substantial disadvantage. The Australian Bankers' Association noted:


Effective implementation of the BEAR regime will require material effort and reallocation of resources by ADIs and APRA to meet the proposed deadline. 


The Australian Shareholders' Association said:


While we acknowledge the government’s desire to implement the legislation as soon as possible, we are of the view that ADIs will need time to undertake changes to policies, contracts and systems.


The Australian Institute of Company Directors, the AICD, have said that they reiterated their view that BEAR's implementation date should be deferred so that it commences on 20 January 2019. Customer Owned Banking Australia said:


In order to effectively and efficiently implement the BEAR there are a number of things that must happen prior to the implementation date. 


They went on to argue that there was insufficient time to do that. So I do note that this has been raised by a number of stakeholders. Concern about the implementation date was shared by some government senators, who, in their report, recommended the date of implementation of the entire package be delayed for 12 months. But, for small- and medium-sized banks, the Labor Party has suggested previously that the implementation be delayed by 12 months—and that is the amendment that I will move when we get to consideration in detail. 


The Senate inquiry clearly showed that small- and medium-sized banks are not afforded the same access as the big banks to the development of this policy. I make that observation in passing as well.


It was noted in paragraph 2.75 of the explanatory memorandum that discussions were held with the big banks in February 2017 about options to address accountability gaps. But evidence from the Customer Owned Banking Association is that they had no knowledge of or involvement in these meetings. Labor senators made it clear that our position was to delay the implementation for small and medium ADIs by one year. I note the Treasurer's comments in the media that there would be 'a slower pace of implementation for the smaller banks'—we welcome that. That is, in effect, him agreeing with the Labor Party's position. As I understand it, the amendment I move may well receive the support of both sides of the House. Obviously I don't speak for the government. That's a matter for them to talk about in the House, but I would be hopeful of that amendment receiving bipartisan support in this House. 


I do think this is a bill which should receive the bipartisan support of the chamber. We don't, as I said, agree with every single element of it. We have made commentary on different parts of it, but none of that is enough for us not to support the bill as a step forward. None of it obviates the need for a royal commission—a point I would have made if the government had not already announced one. But, the government having announced a royal commission, quite evidently a royal commission is now bipartisan policy as well, so it's not in conflict with the fact that we are going to have a royal commission. 


I note that some have said that this doesn't go far enough. The Consumer Action Law Centre said:


Treasury has restricted the application of the proposed BEAR so that it will apply to poor conduct or behaviour that is of a systemic and prudential nature. This misses the crucial element of the United Kingdom model that ties accountability measures to poor consumer outcomes, not just prudential matters.


CHOICE went on to say:


As it stands, what we've got is a bit of a teddy bear. 


As I said, none of those concerns would be reason to oppose the passage of the legislation. It will receive our support, and I would hope for support for the amendment that I will move.

Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (12:51):  Before being elected to this place, I had several stages to my career. The first was here in Canberra as a policy adviser and director of corporate relations for the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I was privileged to spend four years working with Dr Peter Hendy, Greg Evans and Peter Anderson and learning from them. They all had extensive economic, business, industrial relations and policy reform experience. From them, from our state and territory chambers of commerce members, from our industry association members, like the Master Builders, the Hotels Association and the Printing Industries Association, and from the individual businesspeople who gave their time as volunteers on the ACCI board and on their committees, I learnt firsthand about the impact government regulation has on businesses. 


Government regulation costs businesses of all sizes time and money. It means they are less productive, less profitable and less able to focus on expansion and innovation. Government regulation is imposed by local councils, by state governments and by the federal government. As a newspaper columnist before my election to this place, I regularly wrote about the impact government regulation has on business. As a lifelong Liberal, I know that it's my duty to be true to the principles our party and our members hold dear: small government, low taxes, low regulation and letting business get on with business. As our Liberal Party constitution says, we look 'primarily to the encouragement of individual initiative and enterprise as the dynamic force of progress'. For all of these reasons, I am speaking on this bill today. 


Since 2013 Australia's financial sector has been the subject of no fewer than 24 reviews, reports and inquiries, including three by ASIC, three by the Productivity Commission, one by APRA, three by departments and statutory authorities, one by a House committee and seven by Senate committees. Our national financial institutions are subject to almost 40 regulations of varying degrees at any one time, from state governments, the Commonwealth and industry associations. The compliance cost burden on each of our financial institutions can run into the hundreds of millions of dollars per year. These costs are shifted straight onto consumers, who are hardworking Australians, their families and the businesses that they run and are working hard to maintain and grow. Since 2013 there have been 11 changes to the Banking Act and five changes to the APRA Act, further increasing the compliance burden borne by businesses and, ultimately, their customers. 


Australians expect us as their representatives to establish and maintain laws that reflect community expectations. We must make laws that send a clear message to the banking sector as to what we expect from it, but equally these laws must be effective and efficient in maintaining ethical standards. The long list of reviews, reports, inquiries, active regulators and legislative tinkering over the past five years alone suggests that these laws have been anything but efficient. The establishing of a banking, superannuation and financial services royal commission and the general discontent in the community suggest they have been anything but effective. 


Our job is to protect Australians—individuals, families and businesses. Another inquiry, another report and an expensive royal commission are not necessarily going to give redress to anyone who has been wronged. While the Banking Executive Accountability Regime reflects community expectations, the regime in and of itself is also not going to right wrongs. 


The coalition government has a strong track record of cutting red and green tape for employers and wealth creators, particularly small and medium businesses. We've saved the economy billions per annum in regulatory costs. Now, as the nation's most responsible party for economic management, we must concentrate our attention on effective and efficient regulation in this area. As a fiscally responsible government, we cannot fall into the dangerous bank-bashing mob mentality which, while potentially politically beneficial in the short term, will hurt Australian businesses, their shareholders and employees and, most importantly, their customers in the long term. We must remember that around 210,000 people are employed in the finance industry, comprising 1.7 per cent of total employment in Australia. Of these 210,000 people, around 150,000 are employed by banks, with the rest working at credit unions, building societies and the Reserve Bank of Australia. 


Australia must look to successful financial sectors for the world's best practice when it comes to effective regulation. It's clear that financial centres such as Singapore and Hong Kong have the balance right in terms of regulation, and they enjoy a strong financial services sector because of this. This means jobs; this means businesses. I'm contributing to this debate because I fear we are not adhering to world's best practice when it comes to regulating our financial sector. The Banking Executive Accountability Regime adds yet another layer of regulation to the ever-growing compliance burden faced by our financial institutions, adding another detractor to our competitiveness relative to those international sectors I mentioned earlier. It does this having only been subjected to a three-week consultation paper on the idea of the regime, followed by a one-week consultation period on the draft legislation itself. 


Of primary concern is that the regime creates a vague obligation for accountable persons to take reasonable steps to prevent the institution's reputation or prudential standing being adversely affected. The wording of 'reasonable steps' has been adopted from the United Kingdom's own version of this legislation. However, it speaks about reasonable steps to avoid breaching specific regulations. The obligations created by our legislation are particularly nondescript, and, even though APRA have provided some examples to the sector, their list is by no means exhaustive. For example, what is considered reasonable where a decision taken by an executive might preserve the institution's prudential standing but damage its reputation? What is an accountable person to do in this situation? 


Similarly, the BEAR bill proposes joint liability where two or more accountable persons share obligations within the institution. This means that an accountable person who shares obligations will be liable for a breach by the other person. While having bank executives look over each other's shoulders will help ensure compliance, executives need to know what compliance means. These two measures in particular have potential to slow a financial institution's decision-making process, and with it the potential to slow Australia's economic growth. While the parliament must hold bank executives to account, we need to get the legislation right the first time. 


The condensed time frame that the BEAR has had to be considered by both the industry and the parliament is of concern. On the timeframe for implementing the BEAR bill, I note that it has been consistently raised, both in submissions on consultations and by the Senate economic committee's report on the legislation, that the start date of the regime on 1 July 2018 leaves very little time for institutions to adequately comply. This particularly disadvantages smaller institutions, who don't have as much capacity to absorb new regulations as larger institutions might, and I note the comments of the previous speaker on this very point. The Senate committee recommended that the implementation of the regime be delayed to begin not less than 12 months after the legislation passes. I believe the government should not be burdening smaller players in the financial sector, especially at a time when we want to see a more diverse and competitive industry so that lower costs and more competitive terms and conditions can be provided to consumers. I'm concerned about the burden we're placing on financial institutions, our global competitiveness and, potentially, our economic growth.


To reiterate, Australians expect us as their representatives to establish and maintain laws that reflect community expectations. We must make laws that send a clear message to the banking sector as to what we expect from them, but equally these laws must be effective and efficient in maintaining appropriate ethical standards. Our job here is to protect Australians, whether they're individuals, families or businesses. Equally, our job is to ensure we have the most competitive and thriving businesses in the world in the banking and financial services sectors—and businesses more generally—who generate income for our nation and employ millions of Australians each and every year.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (13:01):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017 represents one of the greatest political backflips of all time. Just 12 months ago the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and members on that side of the House were saying that there were no issues with executive remuneration in the banking industry, there was nothing to see here, there were no problems and we didn't need a royal commission into banking and financial services in Australia—everything in our banking industry was hunky-dory—despite the fact that millions of customers were being ripped off and there were scandals in wealth management, insurance and retail banking. The government chose to ignore those, and it was only when the banks agreed that they were dragged kicking and screaming to agreeing to a royal commission. This bill does represent part of that backflip on the issue of executive remuneration in the banking industry, because for many, many years now there have been cases of rip-offs of customers and scandals, particularly in wealth management and insurance, where customers have lost millions and millions of dollars, lost their homes, lost out on insurance in cases of severe illness and death, lost their jobs and lost their ability to pay the household budget, but no-one was held accountable—particularly the big banks and the Australian deposit institutions that were responsible for those activities and left those hardworking Australians in those difficult positions.


This bill seeks to implement an accountability regime for executive remuneration in our banking industry. It proposes to strengthen the responsibility and accountability framework for senior directors and executives of authorised deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs, and their subsidiaries. The banking executive accountability regime, or the BEAR as it's become known, is part of the government's more accountable and competitive banking system program, which was their response to issues in the banking and financial services industry and their claimed credible alternative to Labor's proposal for a banking royal commission in banking and financial services. It would be remiss of me not to mention the fact that the government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the measures contained in this bill, and that's been put forward as a way to silence calls for a royal commission into banking.


Look at all of the scandals that have occurred over the last decade or so in banking. The wealth management scandals that we saw in the Commonwealth Bank and that have subsequently been identified in all of the big four major banks—which have meant they've had to pay back money to customers in those circumstances, many of whom have been fighting for long periods of time to get recompense, and some of whom are still fighting—were uncovered over the course of the last couple of years. There have been rip-offs in insurance, particularly CommInsure but also in other insurers throughout the country. There was the scandal relating to AUSTRAC and the Commonwealth Bank not reporting transactions through their intelligent deposit machines that were meant to be reported, because they were above certain thresholds contained in our antiterrorism and financing laws. People have been ripped off. Millions of Australian customers have been ripped off. Businesses, including small businesses, have shut down because of some of these rip-offs. Jobs have been lost. The pressure and stress that this put on a number of Australians and their households and businesses was immense, and the government chose to ignore them. The Turnbull government chose to ignore them for many, many years, saying that there wasn't a need for a royal commission into banking.


It is only when the executives of the big four banks wrote to the Prime Minister and said to him, 'We want a royal commission now, because we're sick and tired of the blame game and all of the damage that it is doing to our reputations,' that the Prime Minister rolls over. It's only when the big four banks say, 'It's okay to have a royal commission,' that this Prime Minister and this government roll over and finally give the Australian public what they want.


Then, in the process of doing so, he seeks to obfuscate the issues associated with banking and tries to point the finger at the industry super funds, where there've been no examples of rip-offs and scandals to the degree associated with the big four banks. Yet it's as if the Prime Minister spat the dummy and said, 'Well, if I have to give them a royal commission, I'm going to make sure that I go after the industry super funds as well, because they've got union representatives on their boards.' It says everything about this government's approach to financial services and banking in this country and to dealing with the issues and working in the interests of small businesses, families and pensioners.


It's lamentable that the government has ignored the pleas of the Australian public for greater accountability, particularly in the big four banks. Only the coalition have had such contempt for the Australian people that they would side with the big four banks over the course of the last few years in avoiding a royal commission. It's particularly the phrase 'executive accountability' that didn't seem to exist in their lexicon up until late last year, when they capitulated to calls for a banking royal commission.


It is worth noting what the Treasurer said just a year ago about the regulation of executive remuneration. He said:


In terms of those in senior corporate positions and what they are paid, they are matters for their boards … it is up to those companies to get the balance right, in terms of how they set those arrangements with their shareholders and their overall accountability to the Australian public for the social licence that they have to operate in Australia.


That was the Treasurer less than 12 months ago saying, 'Nothing to see here—no issue with banking accountability,' in terms of what they were paying their executives, despite what had been uncovered through successive parliamentary inquiries and investigations by journalists and the regulatory bodies into what was actually going on with the management of our big four banks and executive remuneration.


Finally, they've acted, and they've acted through this bill—a bill that creates an accountability framework that ADIs must comply with, with exemptions granted by the Treasurer or where it's a foreign ADI not operating a branch in Australia, or where they may have contravened a law of a foreign country. It defines an accountable person, for the purposes of the framework that's being developed, as a person who:


… has actual or effective … responsibility:


(i) for management or control of the ADI; or


(ii) for management or control of a significant or substantial part or aspect of the operations of the ADI or the relevant group of bodies corporate that is constituted by the ADI and its subsidiaries.


The bill sets out the accountability obligations of the ADIs and accountable persons. For instance, an ADI must take reasonable steps to conduct its business with honesty and integrity, and with due care, skill and diligence. It must deal with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way and, in conducting its business, prevent matters from arising that would adversely affect the ADI's prudential standards or prudential reputation. The bill sets out deferred remuneration obligations of an ADI, meaning an ADI must defer a proportion of the remuneration of an accountable person for a period of four years, the proportion generally depending on the size of the ADI. It also sets out notification obligations of an ADI, with ADIs to give APRA statements detailing the roles and responsibilities of each accountable person, and accountability maps identifying the lines of responsibility through the ADI group. It sets out a civil penalty regime for ADIs where they breach obligations—up to one million penalty units, or $210 million, for large ADIs.


A number of issues have been identified with the implementation of this particular package, through a Senate inquiry, and the shadow Treasurer has outlined those. I won't go into those in detail, but they relate particularly to smaller ADIs and their ability to meet the compliance obligations under this proposal within the time frame. Labor is suggesting and the shadow Treasurer will move, in the consideration in detail stage, an amendment to that effect to give more time to some of those smaller ADIs.


In conclusion, the case for greater accountability in the banking sector has been made out repeatedly by the tragic losses and the cases of fraud and deception that have befallen many across all corners of the country. Through the House Economics Committee, which I've been privileged to be a member of, and through the banking inquiries with the big four banks, we've identified some of those issues. But, unfortunately, we were given precious little time questioning the big bank CEOs to get to the bottom of the various injustices that have been perpetrated upon banking customers. Twenty minutes simply isn't enough time to question one of those CEOs about all of the scandals and rip-offs that have been going on in the banking industry over the course of the last decade. Nonetheless, I think the committee was very effective in hearing some of the revelations that have occurred in this industry, particularly around executive remuneration, most notably: the current, soon to be former, boss of CBA, Ian Narev reminding us that 40,000 customers had been charged for financial advice that they never actually received; and CBA admitting that no executives had lost their jobs over the wealth management scandal or the CommInsure scandal or the AUSTRAC financial advice scandal. All the CEOs refused, during those inquiries, to make public the number of executives earning above $1 million. But at the end of the day, we saw that that banking inquiry was hopelessly inadequate to get to the bottom of the toxic banking culture that we've had in this country for some years now.


Labor knew from day one that the only way to shine a light on what was actually going on in this industry was through a fair dinkum royal commission: a fair dinkum royal commission that provided an independent arbiter, with the probative powers necessary to call the banks and get to the bottom of what was going on in this industry. And that's what the Australian people have wanted for some time now. They are sick of the rip-offs and the scandals; that's left a bad taste in their mouths about banking in this country and they wanted a royal commission, but the Prime Minister denied that—only agreeing once the banks had given him the okay for it to occur. For 18 months Labor has been calling for a royal commission and it has been met with only obfuscation and ridicule by the government. Rather than listen to the victims, the government stuck with their talking points slamming the idea. It was only when the banks themselves realised that the writing was on the wall that the government came around.


This is not the first time that this has occurred in financial services. We look back to the Future of Financial Advice reforms, the FoFA reforms, which introduced a 'best interests' duty—a duty that ensures that a financial adviser must act in the interests of their customer, their client: the person that they're supposed to be working for. And what did those opposite do, when Labor introduced those laws in the parliament some years ago when we were in government? They opposed them. They opposed financial advisers operating in the best interests of their customers. It says everything about the government and what they stand for. Then, when they got to government, they tried to overturn those laws. They tried to water down that best-interest duty in the parliament. They got it through this place and then they got it through the Senate. It was only when the Senate saw what was going on in banking—that there was a problem there—that they changed their minds and removed their approval for those changes to be made. The same happened with superannuation reform as a result of the Cooper review into superannuation and the establishment of MySuper accounts. Again, there was opposition from the government to those sorts of things.


Even when Labor introduced its executive accountability regime generally—the two-strikes rule, as it's known—it was again opposed by those opposite because they didn't want to shed a light on what was actually going on in Australian corporations and give shareholders a say in the management of those companies that they had a stake in and that were paying ridiculous salaries and bonuses and providing share schemes for executives who were doing the wrong thing by them. It says everything about the government's approach to banking and finance and whose side they are on. They're certainly not on the side of the customer, of the client, of the small-business person, of the family or of the pensioner when it comes to banking. It was only when the banks agreed to a royal commission that the government rolled over and changed their view. They've chosen a piecemeal approach to solving this problem of executive remuneration and the problems in banking, and it's sad that they have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table on this issue.

Mr LEESER
 (Berowra) (13:16):  I'm pleased to rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017. This bill amends the Banking Act to establish the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, or the BEAR, as it's more commonly known. The BEAR is a strengthened responsibility and accountability framework for the most senior and influential executives and directors in banking groups. To support the BEAR, the bill gives the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, new and strengthened powers.


The banking sector plays an essential role in promoting economic growth and a critical role in the lives of all Australians. In order for it to operate in an efficient, stable and fair way, the community has to have trust in the banking sector. More than perhaps any other sector in the economy, this is the case for banks because we all rely on the banks to provide us with finance to conduct our activities. Whether you are borrowing money to finance the purchase of a home or borrowing money to finance the purchase of a business or to expand a business, the banks are absolutely fundamental to the functioning of the Australian economy.


In Australia, however, a series of incidents involving poor behaviour by banks over recent years has raised the question of whether there may be emerging systemic issues that are undermining public trust in the banks. Public trust is very important in the banking sector precisely because so many of us rely on the banks. In order to have an efficient, effective, secure and stable banking system, we need to ensure that there remains public trust.


Under the BEAR legislation, banks and their most senior executives and directors would be expected to conduct their businesses and responsibilities with honesty, with integrity, with due skill and with care and diligence; deal with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way; and prevent matters from arising that would adversely affect the authorised deposit-taking institutions' prudential reputation or standing. Where these expectations are not met, APRA will be empowered to more easily disqualify individuals, ensure that bank remuneration policies result in financial consequences for individuals and impose substantial fines on banks. Banks will be required to register with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority before appointing people as senior executives and directors. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority will also get additional examination powers which will help it to investigate potential breaches of the BEAR legislation. These mechanisms are intended to deter poor behaviour and ensure that banks and individuals are held to account where they fail to meet the high standards that are expected of them.


The legislation provides further clarity on the accountability obligations of banks and their directors and senior executives, and the enhanced consequences for being in breach of those obligations. In particular, APRA is empowered to impose substantial fines on banks, to more easily disqualify accountable persons and to ensure that bank remuneration policies result in financial consequences for individuals. The regime is due to start from 1 July this year. Banks may, as I said, remain at the centre of some of the most critical decisions in people's lives—buying a home, starting a business and saving for retirement—and it is important that mechanisms are in place to deter poor behaviour and provide for accountability where the high standards of behaviour that we all expect of such an important sector are not being met. 


I heard a lot from the member for Kingsford Smith, who preceded me in this debate, about government inaction and government failures, but I think those opposite need to have a look at their own record in relation to banking matters. Their record of inaction stands in contrast to the Turnbull government's ongoing reform of the financial services sector. Under our government, we've established the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, a one-stop shop to provide victims with compensation now, not years down the track. There is the creation of the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority, which protects consumers from dodgy practices, and industry funding of ASIC to bolster their resources and powers properly. Just last year, the government set up a focused and responsible inquiry into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry. 


From the early days of my candidacy, I have supported calls for a royal commission into the banks, and I'm pleased the government has acted, yet again, as part of its ongoing work into the financial services sector. I've personally been concerned about customer complaints relating to the Commonwealth Bank's takeover of Bankwest in 2008. The Commonwealth Bank's conduct in the aftermath of the global financial crisis has seen it accused of impairing healthy Bankwest loans and forcing customers into foreclosure. I think of the heroic work of my constituent Peter McNamee, who himself was not a victim of the Commonwealth Bank's conduct in this regard but who became a great advocate for victims before the various inquiries that occurred in this place, the inquiry established under Kate Carnell and the inquiries set up by ASIC. He was doing the hard yards to get public policy changed in this space to provide justice for victims. Peter has been a very strong advocate of the banking royal commission, and I'm very pleased that, through his work, many of the victims of the Bankwest issue will now have their chance to put their case before a very distinguished former High Court judge in Ken Hayne, who will make recommendations to the government about what to do going forward in this area. 


These issues have been long-running. They date back to when Labor was in government. The opposition had six years to act on banking misconduct, but they didn't do anything. When Storm Financial collapsed and other crises hit Australia under their government, what did they do? Their silence was deafening. When the coalition proposed a financial system inquiry in opposition, how did they respond? They refused to support it. Despite what the member for Kingsford Smith and others on the other side of the House may claim, when they sat on this side of the House, they were a government defined by inaction, and we've seen it time and time again. It takes the coalition to respond in a responsible and reasonable manner. That's what we've done with the royal commission, that's what we've done with a range of other financial services elements and that's what we're doing with the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, which is being established under the legislation that is currently before the House. 


The opposition leader has pursued politics over people here. He has led a campaign where political pointscoring has drowned out the voices of victims. For all his talk, where was he when Labor was in power? If only the opposition leader had been in a position to act then, perhaps in his capacity as minister for financial services! But whether it was the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Treasurer, who was then the Assistant Treasurer, Labor repeatedly rejected in government the need for a royal commission. The contrast of record to rhetoric couldn't be clearer. The Turnbull government's take-action-now approach puts the inaction of previous Labor governments to shame. The establishment of the royal commission and the BEAR are just the latest in the long list of measures implemented by this government. They are the end result of orderly and orthodox processes, where the government has consulted with industry and affected parties in order to consider the best way forward to enhance public confidence and trust in the banking and financial services industries. 


Despite all of the noise we heard from those opposite about the royal commission, despite making a lot of noise over a long period of time, they never suggested anything about terms of reference for a royal commission. If you're serious about a royal commission, you publish your set of terms of reference. No—instead, it was just a political stunt. For all their boasting and bank-bashing, they never suggested these terms of reference. What's worse is that, in the way those opposite have conducted themselves, they have given false hope to the victims of banking misconduct. In this legislation, we have a way forward to ensure that bank executives act properly, ethically and prudentially and are appropriately supervised by the relevant authority.


While the Banking Executive Accountability Regime and a royal commission might uncover instances that lead to recommendations of compensation or, in relation to this particular regime, fines in relation to bank executives, those opposite just made a lot of noise rather than proposing actual policies. On top of their rhetoric, they should be ashamed at the way they have undermined Australia's financial stability through their alarmist attacks. In irresponsibly bashing the banks, they've put politics above people and their own egos above the economy. Our major banks represent almost nine per cent of Australia's GDP and employ more than 400,000 people. Millions of Australians have banking shares either directly or through their superannuation funds. We must be prudent and careful and sensible in the regulation of the banking industry. The vast majority of Australians not only are customers of the banks but have a direct stake in them through their superannuation, but those opposite have gone about this debate in a way that has put the economy at risk. They have put at risk the very system that supports Australian employment and wages. No-one in the Labor Party has done more to bash the banks than the former senator Sam Dastyari. His calls for a royal commission and actions on banks pre-date the official Labor position by some two years—and, where the former senator Sam Dastyari went, the Leader of the Opposition followed.


Time and time again, it has been a coalition government that has had to clean up the mess left behind by Labor, and that's what we're doing with the legislation before the House today. The failure of past Labor governments to adequately support victims of banking misconduct is reflected in their do-nothing approach. They didn't support a financial systems inquiry; they didn't respond to the victims of Bankwest or Storm Financial; and they didn't even bother to write terms of reference for their stunt of a royal commission. Shame on those opposite for leaving a legacy of inaction.


Once again, with the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill, the coalition government has come to pick up the pieces and restore stability and public confidence in our banking sector.

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (13:27):  This bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017, to introduce a banking executive accountability regime is nicknamed the BEAR. To quote financial sector expert Pat McConnell, a visiting fellow at Macquarie University:


Rather than being a terrifying polar or grizzly, it is already an old teddy bear that has had the stuffing knocked out of it.


So, rather than growl, this bear purrs like a pussycat. When it comes to the banking sector, that is how those opposite like it: purr like a pussycat and have your belly scratched.


Pat McConnell further states:


The government's new Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) legislation is a confused mess that is not going to do what it claims to do, which is make bankers accountable for scandals.


It is hardly a ringing endorsement of the government's approach.


This bill appears to echo the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, established by the May government in Britain, which came into force last year. Copying the British Chancellor's homework, our Treasurer proposed the BEAR in last year's budget, initially in order to take effect from 1 July this year. I'm pleased that I understand the Treasurer has now agreed to an amendment put forward in the Senate that that implementation be delayed.


For years, Labor has kept pressure on the government to act on the concerns of the tens of thousands of Australians and small businesses who have smelled something rotten going on in our finance and banking services sectors. It is why Labor has been calling for a banking royal commission. I couldn't understand the member for Berowra, who just spoke on the bill. One minute he was belting Labor for not supporting a banking royal commission early enough, and then he was belting us for supporting one two years ago. I didn't understand his logic, and I don't understand it now.


Labor has been on the record consistently as wanting a banking royal commission to get to the heart of the scandals in the banking sector in this country. Too many people and too many businesses have been ruined by the scandals engulfing this sector. We're pleased that the government's finally come to the table—kicking and screaming—on a banking royal commission. It took too long to get there, and it shouldn't have taken so long. This government's been reluctant to do anything regarding the banks, but finally it's been dragged into action, not because it wanted to, not because of the evidence provided to parliamentary committees of ruined lives and ruined businesses, but the consequence of banking malfeasance—

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (13:30):  I rise today to express my outrage at the exclusion of Australian Ben Simmons from this year's NBA All-Star game. In a record-breaking rookie year for the Philadelphia 76ers, Ben is currently averaging nearly 17 points, eight rebounds and seven assists in a game. He's already had five triple doubles, and, frankly, no-one with two brain cells to rub together would want Goran Dragic on their team over Ben. The fact that compatriot 'Jingling' Joe Ingles has also been left out of the three-point competition despite currently sitting at third in the league in three-point percentage makes me think there is some kind of an anti-Australian conspiracy going on at the league head office at the moment. If you thought that Australia was angry about The Simpsons 'Bart vs. Australia' TV episode, you ain't seen nothing yet, Yanks!



There is, however, a more serious point about the golden generation of Australians currently playing in the NBA at the moment. The nine Australians who are currently flying the flag for our nation in the NBA include an Indigenous Australian, four children of immigrants and two refugees. Our representation in the NBA looks like modern Australia: a nation of migrants, and the most successful multicultural nation on earth. We should particularly recognise South Sudanese Australians Thon Maker and Mangok Mathiang for their extraordinary achievement of not just making it to the pinnacle of their profession but overcoming the enormous challenges that they needed to confront on arriving in Australia as refugees. There's been a lot of nonsense said about Australia's African-Australian community over the summer parliamentary recess by politicians around the country, but Thon and Mangok show the potential of every member of this community to overcome obstacles and excel at the highest level.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:21):  I thank the honourable member for his question. It's good to know that he's got the same questions he had last year. Nothing has changed over the break, but there is one little difference—actually, it's rather a big difference. About a year ago the Leader of the Opposition was at the Press Club, and he gave a speech. He said 2017 would be all about jobs, jobs, jobs. How about 403,000 new jobs? How about that—403,000 new jobs last year, with three-quarters of them full time? It is the largest annual jobs growth since records began, because of the policies that we have put in place that are encouraging businesses to invest and employ. Business confidence and consumer confidence are all at highs, and yet we have a Labor leader who is the most anti-business Labor leader we've seen in generations.



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  The member for Isaacs is chuckling there, because he knows I'm being too generous. He's probably the most anti-business Labor leader forever. This guy has declared war on business. He went to the Business Council of Australia and told them they could expect nothing from him. And, indeed, this is the man that, a year ago in that memorable speech at the Press Club, described the Trans-Pacific Partnership as absolutely dead. He said, 'Why is the Prime Minister wasting his time trying to do CPR on the TPP?' 'It's worse than a vanity project,' he said. Well, it's agreed: the TPP is underway with 11 nations—we regret the absence of the US—opening up more opportunities for exports, for investment and for jobs. He has opposed the legislation that has gone through this parliament in the course of the last 18 months, which is creating those 403,000 jobs—the tax cuts are for small and medium, overwhelmingly family-owned, Australian businesses. These are businesses that are investing and employing, and the Leader of the Opposition wants to take those tax cuts away. He wants businesses to pay more tax. He wants families to pay more tax. He wants more tax on investment and on property. He does not have one policy to encourage one business to invest one dollar or hire one employee. Jobs, jobs, jobs—we delivered them— (Time expired)

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:28):  I thank the honourable member for her question. The honourable member clearly wasn't paying attention when the parliament increased the $80,000 tax threshold to $87,000, taking half a million middle-income Australians out of going into the second-highest top tax bracket. That was middle-income tax relief already delivered and legislated—no thanks to the Labor Party, of course. Perhaps she's overlooked the way in which we have ensured that, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, we have a schools funding policy that is consistent with the recommendations of David Gonski and delivers national, consistent, needs based funding to every school so that, regardless of what system it's in or what state it's in, if it has the same needs it'll get the same funding. This is what the honourable member for Sydney used to talk about. The Labor Party never delivered it. We have delivered it and are delivering billions of dollars of additional funding to schools. Now, of course, in making sure every young Australian has the opportunity to realise their dreams and get ahead according to their likes, what we are doing is ensuring that, with Gonski 2.0, the second part of that study, we will get the recommendations to ensure we get the value and the outcomes in terms of better teaching from that massive additional investment.


The honourable member opposite, when she talked about the cost of living, failed to note that Labor have opposed the National Energy Guarantee. They opposed our action on gas. They mocked our action with retailers. Thousands of Australian families are already saving hundreds of dollars on their energy bills thanks to our efforts and the efforts in particular of the energy minister. And, despite, no doubt, the reservations of the member for Eden-Monaro, they have mocked Snowy 2.0, the biggest battery ever built in the Southern Hemisphere and one that will make renewables reliable.


There is not one part of our policy, whether it is on energy, whether it is on tax or whether it is on investment, that is not delivering better times for Australians and reducing the pressure of higher household expenses and living costs. What about child care? Labor voted against that and yet it is delivering more affordable child care for Australians and families on lower and lower-middle incomes. Now, of course, they want to roll back the tax cuts on small and medium businesses. These are not huge businesses but they employ more than half of the private sector workforce, and we're seeing that growth— (Time expired)

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (15:24):  I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to India from 28 October to 4 November 2017, and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted.




Mr ALBANESE:
  It was my pleasure to lead an Australian parliamentary delegation to India between 28 October and 4 November. This was the first delegation to India from the Australian parliament for 17 years. As well as me, the delegation comprised Mr Milton Dick, the member for Oxley; Mr Ian Goodenough, the member for Moore; Senator Pauline Hanson, a senator for Queensland; and Mr David Littleproud, the member for Maranoa. The delegation was supported—very ably, it must be said—by Ms Rachel Callinan.


The delegation participated in a full program of events in New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad. The key objective of the program was to strengthen parliament-to-parliament ties with India by undertaking visits to India's national parliament in New Delhi and the state legislatures of Maharashtra and Telangana. Other aims of the visit were to gain greater insight into the current social, economic, governance and political issues faced by India and its people and to discover opportunities to further the deep relationship between our two countries. The delegation report outlines the series of meetings that took place.


There's no doubt that 17 years is too long between visits from the Australian parliament to India, and all of the delegation would like to see more regular contact, because the relationship between Australia and India is so important. We are close partners; we're both vibrant democracies; and we both share a commitment to stability and prosperity in the region. India is our ninth-largest trade partner, with two-way trade of over $20 billion. More than 60 per cent of the value of Australia's merchandise exports come from three commodities: coal, gold and vegetables. Australia is a natural partner with India. It is a fact that India remains the world's fastest-growing major economy whilst it is implementing major structural economic reforms.


As well as this, the delegation built on the people-to-people relationships that are so important. Over 670,000 Australians are of Indian ancestry and, of those, some 400,000 were born in India. One of the first activities that we had was the launch of the Australian Alumni Association in New Delhi. Of course, we know that there are some 54,000 students from India studying at institutions here in Australia, and this association will mean that they can interrelate with each other and interrelate with Australia on an ongoing basis. I thank also the Australian high commissioner for the work that she and her team did in supporting our delegation. As well as visiting parliaments, we also had the privilege of visiting institutions such as Dr Shroff's Charity Eye Hospital in New Delhi, the TERI-Deakin research centre, Tata Consultancy Services and YES Bank Ltd in Mumbai. In Hyderabad, we visited the T-Hub and we visited the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy to receive a briefing on national security. We were well received.


I must say that, in spite of the fact that the delegation was a very broad delegation, we got on well and were cooperative, and I thank the delegation for that. It is somewhat unusual for an opposition member to lead a delegation of the parliament. It was as a result of Senator Parry pulling out of the delegation due to the circumstances which led to his resignation from the Senate while, in fact, that delegation was taking place. I thank government members for being accepting of that, given my seniority in the parliament. Certainly, in the way that the delegation worked very cooperatively with each other, with the Australian officials and, most importantly, with the parliamentarians, national and state, who we met in India, as well as the representatives of the private sector and other organisations, it was indeed, I think, a delegation of achievement in fostering that important relationship with India.


I commend the delegation report to the House. Senator Hanson will be tabling the report in the Senate this afternoon, and I do say that it is important that the parliamentary officers work closely to ensure that Australian parliamentary visitations don't wait some 17 years before the next visit.

Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (15:31):  On behalf of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation, I present the committee's interim report.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Ms SWANSON:
  by leave—I rise to speak on the interim report of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation.


We have had some changes in the committee in recent months, and, as nominal chair, I would like to thank the author of this report, the member for Groom, Dr John McVeigh, for his work in chairing the committee to date. I have served as his deputy.


I also thank the other committee members and the committee secretariat and support staff for their work. I note that we are looking forward to announcements about replacements for the four government members that have moved on from our committee.


By the nature of the task at hand, the committee has visited many regional and rural areas throughout Australia.


I acknowledge the many individuals and organisations who have made submissions and appeared at hearings during the course of our inquiry so far.


The purpose of this interim report is to provide an update on the work to date and an overview of the work ahead.


At this stage, the committee considers it would be premature to provide recommendations or views on the issues raised.


To date, the committee has received over 187 written submissions and heard from 115 witnesses representing 77 organisations.


More than a quarter of these submissions, 27 per cent, have been from local councils or groupings of councils, with other contributions from individuals, industry bodies, regional development authorities, community groups and non-government organisations.


A third have come from Victoria, a quarter from New South Wales, and 11 per cent each from Queensland and the ACT.


Nearly one in 10 have come from committees belonging to Regional Development Australia, an organisation and network working to identify regional issues, and their contributions are expected to identify themes across the regions.


Between August and November, hearings were held in Canberra; in the New South Wales cities of Orange and Newcastle (neighbouring my electorate of Paterson); in the Victorian cities of Bendigo and Wodonga; in the West Australian cities of Geraldton and Kalgoorlie; in the South Australian city of Murray Bridge; in the Tasmanian cities of Launceston and Burnie; and in Darwin, in the Northern Territory.


The committee has also held private briefings with the department of infrastructure and regional development and the Australian Public Service Commission.


An informal panel was convened to uncover the broad issues related to regional development and decentralisation, and we will likely hold another similar roundtable this year.


The committee intends to hold hearings in the coming months in Townsville, Toowoomba, Armidale and Canberra.


We've requested an extension to the May date for the final report given the quantity of evidence received. The goal will then be to craft recommendations for best-practice approaches to regional development so these can meaningfully inform government policy.


Research by the Regional Australia Institute says the main factors affecting regional communities and economies are: the global economy; technological change; the environment; and, importantly, population.


While governments can't control these things per se, they can provide the right political and policy settings to foster growth.


What we know is that integrated and collaborative approaches from all tiers of government are vital.


The Productivity Commission advises regional growth should be: led by local communities; aligned with regional strengths; supported by targeted investment; and guided by clear objectives and measurable performance indicators.


What is common to best-practice guidelines here and overseas is that regions must focus on their core advantages.


They must have buy-in growth strategies and support from government at all levels.


Regional growth can occur through the decentralisation of Commonwealth agencies and/or through incentivising corporations to decentralise, but it must be done carefully.


It is broadly agreed that technology is key, and that with good policy the benefits can outweigh the costs, but again it must be done with careful consideration.


In closing, I want to say what an honour it was to chair the Newcastle hearing of the committee, neighbouring my own electorate of Paterson in the New South Wales Hunter Valley, and hear from our local councils and organisations.


The Hunter—and I note the member for Hunter and shadow agriculture minister joins us in the chamber today—is the biggest regional economy in Australia. We know about regions because we are one of the most successful regions, with an economic output of nearly $100 billion a year and a population of more than 707,000 people.


We have enjoyed the fruits of the mining boom, but we have also been affected by its downturn, and the loss of big employers such as the hydro aluminium smelter in my home town of Kurri Kurri has had a cost.


As with many rural and regional areas, we have challenges finding work for our young people, with youth unemployment around 10 per cent, but as high as 21 per cent in recent years. While the Hunter has its unique challenges, it also has much in common with other regions we have visited.


I look forward to continuing my work with this committee and commend this report to the House.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-02-05,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (15:38): I thank the member for Paterson for those remarks, and I think it's important that perhaps someone from the government side as well make a presentation on this particular report, considering that the member for Groom has been promoted and will no longer be the chair of this committee.


We commenced the inquiry on 17 July 2017, and I refer to remarks that the member for Groom made at the time:


… the Committee's inquiry is wide ranging and will explore ways to increase the growth and prosperity of regional and rural Australia. While decentralisation of Commonwealth entities has been identified as a potential means to achieve this, the Committee wants to examine, more broadly, how public and private investment can assist in building and sustaining our regional communities.


It has become quite apparent to me through the course of this inquiry that there are no silver bullets. Of course we need private enterprise as well to be investing in these regions, because at the end of the day anything where the government supplies the jobs comes at the cost of other jobs in the economy somewhere, through taxation. So it's very important that we forge these partnerships.


We released an issues paper on 31 August, and that highlighted that we should be seeking to find the best-practice approaches to rural development, decentralisation of Commonwealth entities and corporate decentralisation—once again, that theme of finding more than just a way of moving government departments into the country, even though that is very important.


We called for submissions, and, as the member for Paterson said, 187 have been received. I thank all of those for the effort and time that they've put into those submissions. I particularly thank those that've made themselves available to the 11 inquiry days we've held—10 of those out of Canberra. As, of course, would behove a committee that is looking into decentralisation, we all thought it was very important that we get out of Canberra, that we go and visit the regions and that we talk to these organisations individually.


There are two distinct groups that we've seen large representations from: local government and the RDAs around Australia, which is not particularly surprising. These are both types of organisation that are deeply interested in the goings-on of our regional communities.


The committee has resolved to request an extension. There is a vast amount of material to work our way through, and so we are hoping to produce the final report on 31 May.


In particular, I would like to recognise the fact that the government seems to understand that this is a real opportunity for Australia. The government has directed the ministers to look at all their departments to see what functions it is that they perform that would not necessarily be easy to transport but that could be done not only at least as efficiently but even more efficiently by relocating to country regions. The ministers will all be reporting back to cabinet in due course on those moves. There is a set level of criteria in portfolios, which the minister is assessing.


I would also like to back up the member for Paterson's remarks and thank the former chair, the member for Groom, Dr John McVeigh, for his contribution in putting together this interim report. We will have to go on without him in the future.


I will remark on some of the people that've come before us. I was particularly pleased when we came to Murray Bridge in South Australia—it is not in my electorate but certainly some people from my electorate attended—that we had representations from Professor John Halsey, who is conducting the government's review into regional, remote and rural education, and that we had a representative from Eldercare, who told us about the difficulties presented in providing aged care in smaller rural communities. Both of those industries—education and aged care—are very good demonstrations of decentralisation of industry, so I was very pleased they were both there.


We heard some great contributions from others. Of particular interest was when we went to Orange and had a talk about the long-term benefits of the New South Wales government relocating the department of agriculture to Orange around 20 years ago. All of that has been very interesting. We've much more work to do, I look forward to continuing to work with the member for Paterson. Thank you very much for your indulgence.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (15:43):  I seek leave to congratulate the committee.


Leave granted.




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  You will enjoy the contribution. I genuinely do want to congratulate members of the committee on both sides of the House. I have had many long conversations with the member for Paterson, who tells me the committee has worked very much in a bipartisan way. It's been a hardworking committee, with a lot of travel involved. I'm not sure the member for Paterson still likes me, because, when I asked her to do the job of being the deputy chair of what I thought was an important inquiry, not even I realised how much work and travel would be involved.


I remind the House that the committee very much grew out of the controversy over the forced relocation of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority to Armidale, but thankfully it was broadened to encapsulate regional development more generally. I'm delighted to hear the member say—my goodness! I can't remember your seat for some reason!



Mr Ramsey interjecting—




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  Grey—thank you. Grey, of course. The member for Grey said it is complex and there are no silver bullets. That is absolutely true.


I note the reference the member for Paterson made to the work of the Regional Australia Institute, where it outlined the key drivers of growth in the regions. But it is also a reminder—and I won't abuse the indulgence of the leave that has been given—that there are no quick fixes. A political campaign—to somehow try to convince regional communities that the world would be their oyster if only a government agency or part of a government agency moved to their local area—can do no harm, but it can do harm to the agency and the agency's work. We don't create jobs in Australia by moving jobs from one place to another. And with respect to Canberra, when you move agencies out of Canberra, then you're impacting on all those regional communities around Canberra who are having somewhat of a renaissance as they become commuter towns, as residents go to and from Canberra on a daily basis.


I hope we as a parliament can move past the spin and the rhetoric about decentralisation. All agree we can embrace it where it can be done without adverse impact on the agency, entity or regulator involved, but also recognise that it's not about moving jobs from one place to another; it's about tapping into the key drivers of economic growth in the regions—and, importantly, promoting leadership. The RRI also told us, in some case studies, that the difference between some successful regions and not-so-successful regions or cities is the strength of community leadership. But if we're going to have stronger regions—and we all want that—we have to have all levels of government working together. We certainly have to work in a bipartisan manner, and I'm very pleased the committee is doing that. I lament the fact that so many have had to leave the committee, but, of course, that's the fault of no-one. I hope the committee, with this extension, can get on with its work and make some substantial policy recommendations.

Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (15:31):  On behalf of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation, I present the committee's interim report.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Ms SWANSON:
  by leave—I rise to speak on the interim report of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation.


We have had some changes in the committee in recent months, and, as nominal chair, I would like to thank the author of this report, the member for Groom, Dr John McVeigh, for his work in chairing the committee to date. I have served as his deputy.


I also thank the other committee members and the committee secretariat and support staff for their work. I note that we are looking forward to announcements about replacements for the four government members that have moved on from our committee.


By the nature of the task at hand, the committee has visited many regional and rural areas throughout Australia.


I acknowledge the many individuals and organisations who have made submissions and appeared at hearings during the course of our inquiry so far.


The purpose of this interim report is to provide an update on the work to date and an overview of the work ahead.


At this stage, the committee considers it would be premature to provide recommendations or views on the issues raised.


To date, the committee has received over 187 written submissions and heard from 115 witnesses representing 77 organisations.


More than a quarter of these submissions, 27 per cent, have been from local councils or groupings of councils, with other contributions from individuals, industry bodies, regional development authorities, community groups and non-government organisations.


A third have come from Victoria, a quarter from New South Wales, and 11 per cent each from Queensland and the ACT.


Nearly one in 10 have come from committees belonging to Regional Development Australia, an organisation and network working to identify regional issues, and their contributions are expected to identify themes across the regions.


Between August and November, hearings were held in Canberra; in the New South Wales cities of Orange and Newcastle (neighbouring my electorate of Paterson); in the Victorian cities of Bendigo and Wodonga; in the West Australian cities of Geraldton and Kalgoorlie; in the South Australian city of Murray Bridge; in the Tasmanian cities of Launceston and Burnie; and in Darwin, in the Northern Territory.


The committee has also held private briefings with the department of infrastructure and regional development and the Australian Public Service Commission.


An informal panel was convened to uncover the broad issues related to regional development and decentralisation, and we will likely hold another similar roundtable this year.


The committee intends to hold hearings in the coming months in Townsville, Toowoomba, Armidale and Canberra.


We've requested an extension to the May date for the final report given the quantity of evidence received. The goal will then be to craft recommendations for best-practice approaches to regional development so these can meaningfully inform government policy.


Research by the Regional Australia Institute says the main factors affecting regional communities and economies are: the global economy; technological change; the environment; and, importantly, population.


While governments can't control these things per se, they can provide the right political and policy settings to foster growth.


What we know is that integrated and collaborative approaches from all tiers of government are vital.


The Productivity Commission advises regional growth should be: led by local communities; aligned with regional strengths; supported by targeted investment; and guided by clear objectives and measurable performance indicators.


What is common to best-practice guidelines here and overseas is that regions must focus on their core advantages.


They must have buy-in growth strategies and support from government at all levels.


Regional growth can occur through the decentralisation of Commonwealth agencies and/or through incentivising corporations to decentralise, but it must be done carefully.


It is broadly agreed that technology is key, and that with good policy the benefits can outweigh the costs, but again it must be done with careful consideration.


In closing, I want to say what an honour it was to chair the Newcastle hearing of the committee, neighbouring my own electorate of Paterson in the New South Wales Hunter Valley, and hear from our local councils and organisations.


The Hunter—and I note the member for Hunter and shadow agriculture minister joins us in the chamber today—is the biggest regional economy in Australia. We know about regions because we are one of the most successful regions, with an economic output of nearly $100 billion a year and a population of more than 707,000 people.


We have enjoyed the fruits of the mining boom, but we have also been affected by its downturn, and the loss of big employers such as the hydro aluminium smelter in my home town of Kurri Kurri has had a cost.


As with many rural and regional areas, we have challenges finding work for our young people, with youth unemployment around 10 per cent, but as high as 21 per cent in recent years. While the Hunter has its unique challenges, it also has much in common with other regions we have visited.


I look forward to continuing my work with this committee and commend this report to the House.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (15:38): I thank the member for Paterson for those remarks, and I think it's important that perhaps someone from the government side as well make a presentation on this particular report, considering that the member for Groom has been promoted and will no longer be the chair of this committee.


We commenced the inquiry on 17 July 2017, and I refer to remarks that the member for Groom made at the time:


… the Committee's inquiry is wide ranging and will explore ways to increase the growth and prosperity of regional and rural Australia. While decentralisation of Commonwealth entities has been identified as a potential means to achieve this, the Committee wants to examine, more broadly, how public and private investment can assist in building and sustaining our regional communities.


It has become quite apparent to me through the course of this inquiry that there are no silver bullets. Of course we need private enterprise as well to be investing in these regions, because at the end of the day anything where the government supplies the jobs comes at the cost of other jobs in the economy somewhere, through taxation. So it's very important that we forge these partnerships.


We released an issues paper on 31 August, and that highlighted that we should be seeking to find the best-practice approaches to rural development, decentralisation of Commonwealth entities and corporate decentralisation—once again, that theme of finding more than just a way of moving government departments into the country, even though that is very important.


We called for submissions, and, as the member for Paterson said, 187 have been received. I thank all of those for the effort and time that they've put into those submissions. I particularly thank those that've made themselves available to the 11 inquiry days we've held—10 of those out of Canberra. As, of course, would behove a committee that is looking into decentralisation, we all thought it was very important that we get out of Canberra, that we go and visit the regions and that we talk to these organisations individually.


There are two distinct groups that we've seen large representations from: local government and the RDAs around Australia, which is not particularly surprising. These are both types of organisation that are deeply interested in the goings-on of our regional communities.

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (15:47):  The only reason the government finally acted on banking was its own reptilian political survival instincts. It knew it had to do something—anything—if it was to survive, and as a result we have this timid creature, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017, the BEAR bill. It is not much, but Labor will not stand in its way because at least it's something. It's a first step in the journey of a thousand steps.


The bill gives APRA new and strengthened powers and an extra $4.2 million over four years, plus a further $1 million a year to enforce breaches. Costs are to be met by an increase in APRA financial institutions levies of $8.2 million over four years. There is an extra $1.1 million for Treasury to oversee a more accountable and competitive banking system of which the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, or BEAR, is part. The total change in average annual regulatory cost from the business-as-usual model is about $11½ million across the sector. That is a minuscule impost for a sector which in 2016 posted after-tax profits of more than $30 billion. 


At its core, the BEAR will make certain individuals in banks, credit unions and the like, which are termed 'authorised deposit-taking institutions' or ADIs, legally accountable both for their decisions and for practices that occur under their authority. So if people under the supervision of these accountable persons do certain things that these people should have known about, the ADIs are held accountable for them. The intention is to get rid of the wriggle room for the slippery executives and directors who try to pass the buck onto subordinates or blame vague processes. And I welcome that. The BEAR requires ADIs and people with significant influence over conduct and behaviour to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity, and to carry out effectively the business activities for which they are responsible. The BEAR does this by creating a new definition of 'accountable person', who is a board member with oversight over the bank or ADI, or a senior executive with responsibility for management or control of significant or substantial parts or aspects of the business. Accountable persons must be located in the ADI, not on some beach resort in the Caymans, where they are uncontactable. In the case of an ADI group, they should be located in significant or substantial subsidiaries. Not all subsidiaries will have accountable persons located in them individually, but throughout an ADI group accountable persons must have clear lines of responsibility to cover all business activities of the group. ADIs will be required to tell APRA who its accountable persons are and clearly outline the responsibilities and duties of those people. When it comes to an ADI group, APRA must be given a clear map of who is responsible for what across the myriad business units. Again, the intention is: no place to hide. 


The BEAR will require that up to 40 per cent of an accountable person's variable remuneration—what we loosely call 'bonuses'—is kept in reserve for four years so that it can be stripped from said person if they are found to have failed in their governance duties. In the case of CEOs, who one would think would all be accountable persons under the definitions of this bill, the reserved bonus amount will be 60 per cent, or up to 60 per cent, depending on the size of the institution. As a result of this requirement, I will not be at all surprised if we see a change in remuneration practices for senior executives. Perhaps base pay and allowances will end up being much bigger and much higher, and bonuses perhaps less generous. Time will tell. 


APRA will be granted the power to disqualify with seven days notice, without court order and without giving reasons, any accountable person that APRA determines has failed to comply with their obligations under the BEAR. It will be important that APRA ensures that it operates within tight guidelines to ensure that its own officers act with the utmost care. The phrase 'who watches the watchers' comes to mind. While it is important that APRA be given the authority it needs to act swiftly and decisively, that should not be at the expense of natural justice. 


Labor does not propose to stand in the way of this bill, and I am pleased that the government has accepted some of our amendments. But I do acknowledge the harbouring of some personal concern about handing APRA the authority to disqualify an accountable person, without giving that person a reason. That does not sit well with me. While the bill states that an accountable person, under notice of disqualification, must be given the opportunity to submit a defence, if they wish to do so, there is no minimum time provided for such submissions to be made, beyond the initial seven days notice, before the disqualification comes into effect. Unless I am missing something, it is entirely possible under this legislation that an accountable person can be given notice by APRA one Monday that they are under notice of disqualification, and for that disqualification to take effect the following Monday, with the accountable person not necessarily being informed of the reason for the action. That does not sit well with me at all. I would expect and hope that APRA will exercise discretion and ensure that accountable persons within its sights are afforded natural justice and, at the very least, told why they are about to lose their livelihood. It sets a worrisome precedent that anyone should be forced by a government instrument out of their profession, without the legal right to be told why. 


As well as disqualification, accountable persons and ADIs can face significant civil penalties for breaching their obligations under the BEAR. Big banks could face penalties of up to $210 million. It sounds like a lot of money, but when we're talking about institutions that make billions of dollars in profits, I'm not sure that figure really hits the mark in terms of sending a message to the banks that they need to do the right thing. 


The Treasurer introduced this legislation in September. It was promptly sent to a Senate review committee, which recommended that the bill be passed subject to its implementation being delayed by 12 months from legislative approval, which is in effect a practical delay of six months. Labor and cross-party senators, following input from smaller institutions and APRA, were concerned that those smaller and regional banks and ADIs would find the 1 July 2018 start date challenging to implement. So Labor is pleased that the government seems to have agreed, as I understand it, to this sensible recommendation for the delay.


You won't often find me in agreement with the Australian Bankers' Association, an organisation that is relentless in pursuing what is in the best interests of big banks' profitability, rather than what is in the best interests of bank customers, but I do find myself thinking it may have a point when it comes to one day expanding the scope of the BEAR. The ABA says, not unreasonably in my view, that as well as authorised deposit-taking institutions perhaps other financial institutions, such as insurance and superannuation firms, should come under the ambit of the BEAR. ABA CEO, Anna Bligh, notes that APRA's regulatory oversight already stretches to such bodies, so it wouldn't be much of a stretch for the BEAR to encompass them too. Ms Bligh notes that banks recruit not only from other banks but also from the insurance sector and the superannuation sector. Employment is very mobile across the entire finance sector. It stands to reason, to me at least, that if the BEAR can strengthen accountability and ethical decision-making in the banking sector, then it should be able to do the same across the financial sector as a whole, and that's something that can perhaps be revisited once the BEAR is up and running.


As with all things, the devil will be in the detail, and we'll see how this process runs out once the legislation goes through the House and the parliament. Accountability and transparency are laudable goals that Labor always supports, often in the face of trenchant opposition from those opposite. We will always keep a close eye on the government to ensure that it brings to this place legislation that is even-handed and that works in the best interests of Australian consumers and not just Australian banks. Thank you.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2018-02-05,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (15:57):  I would like to begin this small contribution to the debate by thanking Treasury, the minister, the Hon. Scott Morrison, and staff for taking on changes to legislation to address many of the recommendations that have been derived from a number of parliamentary inquiries where there is a clear direction for government to take. Such legislative application is an example of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017. This bill amends the Banking Act to establish a Banking Executive Accountability Regime, commonly known and frequently referred to in here as 'the BEAR'.


The BEAR is a strengthened responsibility and accountability framework for the most senior and influential executives and directors in banking groups. To support the BEAR, the bill gives the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority—APRA—new and strengthened powers. Contrary to some of the arguments presented by those opposite, this bill is not directing the boards of banks about the money to be paid to their executives. It is, however, a strengthening of the accountability of those very executives, making sure they do the job we expect them to do. This is about re-establishing the confidence and faith we had in our banks as an institution of reliability and the foundation stone of the economy of our nation. Over the last decade in particular, the awareness of the financial activities of our banking institutions has been growing, and there is increased scrutiny and pressure on those organisations. This legislation is part of a suite of changes in legislation and regulation to make our banking industry better.


Working on each issue in this industry has been a thorough and important process. It has, however, been misunderstood in the general public and, to some degree, by the media. Late in 2017, it became very apparent that the public expected a royal commission into banking, rather than the rock-steady changes to regulation. While those opposite say, by throwing it in the debate constantly, that this current bill relates directly to that royal commission, that is patently untrue. This work was already underway. May I remind those opposite: you can't bring in a new bill as a result of the royal commission inquiry until that inquiry is complete. Seriously, do not confuse our public. That banking royal commission is only just beginning.


The banking sector plays an essential role in promoting economic growth and a critical role in the lives of everyday Australians. In order for it to operate in an efficient, stable and fair way, the community has to trust that sector. In Australia, a series of incidents involving poor behaviour by banks over recent years has raised the question of whether there are emerging systemic issues that are undermining trust in our banks.


For more than four years I've been involved in lobbying the government for an investigation like or equal to a royal commission, because I'm well aware of the difficulties faced by so many Australians who've been victims of banking actions and policies. Strategies that I have heard and seen evidence of include the following, one of which is referred to as the bad banking strategy. During inquiries, some statements that resulted in the examination of banking executive behaviour were confusing and seemed to be deliberate misinformation. When asked if they manipulated loans and if this was a banking activity, the response would be something along the lines of: 'Well, what I can say at a general level is, as I've said before, there is absolutely no commercial advantage, and therefore no incentive whatsoever, for this bank or that bank to put borrowers in default. Both parties lose out. There is no incentive.' I've seen conclusive evidence that that, in fact, is not the case, and yet that is part of the inquiry. Homes and businesses have been lost over manipulated loan books with loan-to-value ratios being changed, yet the payments of those mortgages were continuing. There were dozens of other stories, yet no-one in the bank was responsible. There are farmers now living in other people's homes or transitioning in sheds. They were great farmers. What is wrong with our banking industry when the interests of the shareholders are held in much greater esteem than those of the customers?


We all know that the economy has a cycle. It has elastic terms which make economic downturns difficult to predict. However, we do not have (a) adequate rescue options for smaller customers and (b) regulations in place that prevent banks taking the decisions they have done in the past, which have led to very difficult financial circumstances.


Under the BEAR, banks and their most senior executives and directors will be expected to conduct their business and responsibilities with honesty, integrity, due skill, care and diligence. They'll need to deal with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way and prevent matters from arising that would adversely affect the authorised deposit-taking institution's prudential reputation or standing. Where these expectations are not met, APRA will be empowered to more easily disqualify the individuals, ensuring that banks' remuneration policies result in financial consequences for individuals. In fact, people have to take responsibility for the decisions over which they are in charge. APRA will be allowed to impose substantial fines on banks. Banks will be required to register individuals with APRA before appointing them as senior executives and directors. APRA will also get additional examination powers—albeit at a cost, but it's a good investment—which will help to investigate potential breaches of the BEAR.


Personally, I'd really like to see a process where bank executives, failed or successful, are not able to be part of ASIC, APRA or the ACCC, either before or after their banking executive career position. While that is a very personal view, it is not without basis. On many occasions, it was difficult during committee inquiries to get straight answers from different representatives, and it seemed that was a result of the interrelationship between past working experiences of those different organisations. In my opinion, they need to be quite separate.


Properly designed measures, such as the BEAR, will make part of our financial system safer, and we'll feel reassured that integrity is returning to an institution that we have held very precious until the recent past.


Reckless banking practices such as dangerous lending conditions are the responsibility of the banking executive. The board and the executives sign off on any policy change and they should be held accountable. The industry itself knows that the issue is not just a few bad apples. It is a chronic cultural function. They've admitted they need to change the culture, but they have yet to do that. It is to be a process of change. These mechanisms are intended to deter poor bank behaviour and ensure the banks and individuals are held to account, which is what the Australian nation expects of them.

Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (16:05):  The changes to be brought about through the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017, the Banking Executive Accountability Regime and some related measures, have been driven by increased calls over many years now for intervention into the Australian banking sector. The call for increased government intervention into banking has been coming from a wide variety of voices across all sectors in our community. A key concern is the perception here that banking executives are not being properly held to account for the various scandals and mistreatment of customers emanating from Australian banks. For example, we've had the bank bill swap rate rigging scandal, which has now enveloped all four of our major Australian banks; we've had the AUSTRAC bank scandal with the Commonwealth Bank; and we've had many—in fact, way too many—examples of dodgy financial advice being handed out by our banks, or in fact customers being charged for that advice when it was not even provided. The introduction of a senior executive and director accountability regime is significant and it does recognise that it's about making the leaders of our banking sector responsible for the changes that are required in our banks and, in particular, for the cultural change that is required. 


The government, in its explanatory memorandum, does point out that this scheme—the BEAR—comes about from a recommendation of the House Economics Committee, a committee of which I am a member. What the government seemed to skip over in its explanation in the explanatory memorandum is that this recommendation actually came from the opposition, not from its own members of the committee. But what the government has put together here doesn't quite go the full distance. It is actually quite limited. The committee recommendation was essentially based on the UK senior executive accountability regime, but, unlike that regime, which is about both consumer issues and prudential issues, the BEAR that is proposed by the government here is only about prudential ones. That is why we support it but we must also see it expanded. For, in truth, this isn't a real BEAR; it's a clayton's BEAR—it's the banking executive accountability regime you have when you aren't really having one. It's a bit like the government's banking royal commission. 


The government appears also to have confused APRA, the prudential regulatory authority, with its consumer counterpart, ASIC. APRA is the prudential regulator in this country and is responsible for ensuring that banks, amongst others, do not undermine the integrity of our financial system and that, of course, they're able to pay out banking customers when they call on their funds. That is a very important role and it is key to this regime, as it should be. But ASIC, it also needs to be realised, is our key consumer focused regulator, looking at what the outcomes are for consumers and those that are purchasing financial products and using our banking sector, and that is the area that it has responsibility for regulating. So it's responsible for making sure that our banks do act fairly. For example, it is ASIC that is taking the bank bill swap case against the banks. It is ASIC that has been involved in the proceedings in relation to dodgy financial advice from our banks. So I do, in some regard, feel sorry for ASIC, because it's quite clear that, under this government, it's go-to financial regulator has become APRA, excluding ASIC from consideration—in fact, often not even asking it or consulting with it in relation to legislation just like this. 


If we cast back to the flurry of these banking scandals, they were not prudential. The ones I mentioned before— in fact, none of the ones that we've seen—have been prudential. They have been customer-facing scandals and issues, and that's where we see the deficiency in this accountability regime. This deficiency has been acknowledged by ASIC in the evidence it's given to parliamentary committees—that this is a missing component of this regulatory regime when we compare it to the regimes that are in force in other places, such as the United Kingdom. 


I will say that the government has taken on some of the initial feedback that was provided by stakeholders when it first proposed this legislation. So it has relooked at the application to banking subsidiaries. One of the key concerns was: what happens with insurers that sit under banks? It turns out in the process that the banks have largely sold off all of their insurance arms. They're clearly quite concerned. They've also clarified the role of directors in relation to the definition of accountable persons. They've set new start dates. They've tried to deal with the overlap between ASIC and APRA in its disqualification powers mainly to make sure that what they have proposed in this legislation would actually work. They have also dealt with the issue of the start date, as I said. Then there is the issue of how this will apply to small banks, and I'll come to that at the end. 


The other issue that hasn't been addressed to anyone's confidence is the resourcing that this legislation is going to require from APRA. APRA is already very busy doing important work, making sure that the prudential regulation in this country is generally up to scratch and meeting world standards. It has been working with the Reserve Bank of Australia, looking at the level of household debt in this country and the changes that have been required, for example, to interest-only loans. Given that APRA is already going full pelt, to add this burden on top does require the government to make sure that they properly resource APRA to do the job that they're now asking them to do. However, if additional resources are not being given to APRA to enforce the new law that will be coming into place, the question has to be asked: is it the case that the government actually do not intend anything to happen under this legislation, that it is, as I said, a Clayton's piece of legislation that doesn't actually do the job? Or is it the case that, whilst they have put all of this in place, they have no intention of APRA doing any of the work, and they're happy for it to fail? Let me mark this term right here: we need to make sure that, if we're going to do these sorts of things, we resource the bodies that are going to be there to enforce them. 


As I mentioned before, there is an issue about levelling the playing field between large banks and small banks, and that is why Labor have proposed that, in acknowledging this difference, we give a 12-month delay to the start date for our smaller banking institutions to comply with this new framework. As I'm sure everyone will appreciate, there is a world of difference between our large Australian banks—with their huge compliance teams and access to funds to be able to fund the lawyers to get these schemes and the internals that are required within the banks up to speed in order to comply with this law—and our smaller banks. For smaller banks, for smaller ADIs in Australia, to comply, it will take longer. They don't have that regulatory team just sitting there, waiting to go—though sometimes you do wonder about the large banks as well, given their rate of noncompliance of recent years. That is why Labor have proposed a very sensible amendment. As I said, we support the legislation. We just don't think it goes far enough. We've proposed an amendment to make sure that small banks are not disproportionately disadvantaged by the introduction of this regime. 


As I mentioned before, the government has form, terrible form, when it comes to financial services legislation. We've had their attempts to rip up FOFA. We've had their superannuation backflips. We've had them refusing to hold a banking royal commission. We've had the crowd-sourced funding debacle, which they introduced legislation for, which no-one actually liked. They had to come back and fix it up, despite us telling them that at the time. We've had their attempt at multinational tax avoidance legislation, which doesn't even go halfway to doing the job. We've had ASIC and reviews calling for increased corporate penalties in this country for years and years and years, and the government have kept talking the talk but have never delivered the legislation to do it. We've had their attacks on the industry superannuation sector. And we've had the banking royal commission, which they finally announced, which, as I said, is a bit of a Clayton's royal commission, because they've given the terms of reference without any consultation with Labor, who have been calling for a royal commission for many years. They've effectively excluded looking at the regulatory part of the banking sector, which, in my view, means that they're not looking at the whole case for what is required for cultural change. You can't change the culture in Australian banking by just looking at the banking players. You've also got to look at the regulatory environment in which they play and the way in which their regulators operate. 


The government has given the royal commission all of 12 months to get all of that work done. You would think that, after the amount of evidence and the countless inquiries that have happened through this parliament in relation to this issue, it would be abundantly clear that there is a lot of work to be done by a royal commission. By straddling it and really constraining it with a 12-month time frame shows just how much this government was trying to score political points by calling a royal commission and nullify a political issue that was hanging around its neck, instead of getting on with the work of making sure that financial regulation works properly in this country. Now we have the Claytons Banking Executive Accountability Regime. We thank the government for bringing it forward, but it doesn't actually deliver on what is needed. We all knew that this government was out of touch but, when it comes to financial services regulation, we now can see clearly, through the litany of failures through the term of this government, that it is clearly out of its depth as well.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-02-05,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:15):  There is a problem with banks in this country. People do not trust them, and rightly so. Trust in the banks has been eroding for a very, very long time. People wonder why the Australian government gives the banks such a massive leg-up, by effectively underwriting the big banks' activities, because they know they're too big to fail, and then allows them to make world-leading record profits. Yet, at the same time, people find themselves going further and further into debt, paying more and more in bank fees every year, and they wonder where the bank profits are coming from. Well, the bank profits are coming from the people of Australia. The bank profits are coming from an overinflated housing market that sees the banks get rich from writing huge mortgages. The bubble keeps growing and growing and the people in the banks and those at the top keep doing better and better. People know something is wrong with the system.


The big part of the problem, the driver of the problem, is that what the banks pay themselves, their executives and the people at the top is not based on how happy customers are but is based solely, or in very large part, on how much money they make for their shareholders. It is based on whether or not they can find strategies to keep these world-leading record profits going, by hell or high water. So the people at the top of the banks have an interest in making as much money as possible and putting the community last. Money first, community last—that's the way the big banks run in this country, but they rely on the government to step in should they ever get into trouble, as they did during the global financial crisis.


The way the system works is that the salaries of so many of the people at the top are tied to the bonuses they make, which are based on how much profit the banks rein in. Because of this, we have this system and this bubble that is going to keep inflating and get bigger and bigger, unless action is taken. When you see the head of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, for example—an organisation that's been prosecuted in court for allegedly illegal activity—in 2016 have a base salary of $2.65 million and a total salary of $12.3 million, you see how much of a problem there is with this bonus culture inside the banks, where they are forced, by hell or high water, to find ways of making money out of everyday Australians, even if it puts Australians into further and further debt that ultimately they can't afford.


If the culture of an organisation starts at the top, we need to change the way that banking executives are paid. Start saying to them, 'You operate in this country under a social licence.' Everyone has to have a bank account now, whether you work or are unemployed or whatever you are. They have a steady stream of our money coming in and they have the government underwriting them, because they know they are too big to fail. Well, there's a quid pro quo, which is that you don't contribute to inequality in Australian society. You pay a reasonable amount, but no more.


This bill largely leaves all of that untouched. They'll still be able to get away with paying themselves enormous salaries and enormous bonuses, and it's that bonus culture that is putting Australians further and further into debt and seeing the banks continue to make a motza. So this bill can be supported for being a very small drop in the very big bucket that needs to be filled, if we are to regain trust in this country.


But one of the things we should do is seize the opportunity, now that the government has rediscovered that it's time we took on the banks and reined them in, to fix this bill. When this bill comes before the Senate, the Greens and Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, who has been paying very close attention to this and has been all over it like a rash for a very long time, will be introducing some amendments to give this bill some teeth. In this country we legislate for the minimum wage. It's not much, it puts people in poverty, but we legislate for the minimum wage. What we don't have are any controls at the other end. As a result we see these bank bosses who can earn over 100 times the average wage—not the minimum wage, the average wage. Is there any justification for the head of a bank to earn over 100 times the average wage in this country? There is not.


It is time to make Australia more equal, it is time to make the banks behave better and it is time to stop them contributing to inequality in this country, which is why the Greens will be moving to amend this bill. This bill should include hard caps on how much bank executives at the top are able to pay themselves. There is no reason that their base remuneration should be any more than 10 times the average national wage. That would start to make Australia a more equal place. I ask people who say that you can't go around restricting banks: what is the justification for someone in this country earning more than 10 times the average wage? Surely, after you've earned your first million dollars a year, what's the point of the rest of it? You're living a very comfortable life. What can be the justification for saying in Australia, in an egalitarian country, that we're quite happy, through government largesse and government support, to allow someone to earn $12 million a year? That is not what the banks are there for. That's not the social licence they operate under.


We'll move to say that the base rate should be limited to 10 times the average national wage, but, as I said, that variable bonus component is the real problem, and that should be limited to a further five times the average national wage. This will start to make Australia a more equal place again. You shouldn't shed a tear for the bank executives if those amendments get through, because they would still be able to earn over a million dollars. According to the Parliamentary Library, they'd still have $840,000 per annum as the cap for the base salary and about $420,000 per annum for the variable component. They could still count themselves millionaires, but they wouldn't be earning more than 10 times what the average Australian worker does. At a time when everyone else's wages are going backwards, the pay of bank executives is skyrocketing, their profits are skyrocketing and the shareholders, the people who own the banks, are doing very well out of it, but it's all at the expense of everyday people in Australia who are going further and further into debt and getting mortgages that they are struggling to meet, who are paying outrageous bank fees and who are getting advice from their banks about wealth management products that aren't in people's best interests but are just in the banks' best interests. We need to crack that nut and say to banks: 'You operate here under a social licence. We'll let you earn 10 times what the average person does, but above that is just unjustifiable greed that is coming at people's expense.'


When this bill passes the House, as I imagine it will, I hope that consideration is given in the Senate to giving it some teeth, because this bill sees a big problem and then really does nothing about it. It introduces some little moves around the edges but it is turning a blind eye to the core problem, which is that greed still drives this industry and still drives the pay structure in this industry. Until we start saying, 'You get remunerated for something close to the value of your work, not because you've been able to fleece a lot of money out of everyday Australians,' we will continue to have this problem. I commend the amendments that are to be moved in the Senate to this chamber and I hope this parliament won't just be seen to be saying something about the banks but will actually do something to rein in the obscene salaries that we're seeing.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (16:25):  The bill before the House is less than what it seems and much less than what Australians need. I rise to make a brief contribution to the debate on the bill. In particular, I want to support the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, and express some concerns and make two wider points relating to the issue of banking regulation and executive remuneration. The member for Kingsford Smith described the government's approach to regulation in this area as 'piecemeal'—and, characteristically, that was both accurate and generous. The bill before us amends the Banking Act and the APRA Act to put in place some new accountability obligations on executives of authorised deposit-taking institutions. To make this meaningful, the bill will put in place new penalty provisions and additional powers for APRA in the Banking Executive Accountability Regime.


This is a regime that is modelled on that which has been relatively recently put in place in the UK—and so far so good. The regime is much more limited in nature than that which has been introduced in the UK. In terms of its coverage, in terms of the industry and indeed conduct rules and the rest of it, there are things that are worthy of wider consideration through, in particular, the banking royal commission into which this government has been dragged kicking and screaming. This bill was put before the House prior to the government's concession to a royal commission in December last year. Looking at the terms of the bill before us, we could do much more to align the consequences of a failure to meet community standards with the expectations that lead to the social licence our banks have.


The bill before us, so far as it goes, achieves some reasonable objectives, particularly if the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer is agreed to. But there are a couple of concerns I wish to put before the House. First and foremost, there are some on the government benches who clearly don't get it, who don't accept that there is a need for action. I've been very disturbed at reports that a number of government members feel there is no warrant for these sorts of measures. These members have not been paying attention to what has been going on in our banks—in particular, our big banks. I'm very disturbed by these reports, and I hope by their actions on the floor of this place they will prove them wrong.


I'm also concerned at reports about some in the banking industry. In an interview with the Treasurer published in the Fin Review today, I was concerned to read of reports that concerns were apparently expressed to Mr Hartzer in Davos that people don't see where the problem is. If this is the case, they haven't been looking very hard because clearly there are very significant and systemic issues in the Australian banking industry which require detailed and holistic review.


That takes me to the first of the two wider points I wish to mention briefly. Firstly, the government's signature and indeed only economic policy for growth is an enormous company tax cut. Secondly, the four biggest banks are already some of the most profitable businesses in Australia, so a giveaway to those banks would be enormous. That context is important when we're debating this piece of legislation because it reminds us of what is going on in the wider economy and that the piecemeal measures here are no substitute for wholesale reform, particularly in light of the litany of regulatory failures that the member for Burt has detailed.


What is required is a holistic review and widespread cultural change. That cultural change is needed more widely in the Australian business community beyond the banks, though the banks are the exemplars of worst practice. Last year I was pleased to put before the House a private member's bill looking at executive remuneration more generally. It highlighted the positive impact of Labor's two-strikes policy on restraining the extraordinary growth of salaries which has seen the top 0.1 per cent of Australian's income share increase exponentially—and, with that, their share of wealth grow even more. Other members have spoken about the bonus culture which is particularly prevalent in our big banks. These big issues remain.


I note that Malcolm Borland's comments have been referred to in the Bills Digest, very helpfully looking at the mystery of the lack of conformity of bonuses and executive remuneration generally with performance. The mystery has been unpacked quite a bit by such inquiries as that conducted by the Productivity Commission in 2009. There is a lot more work to be done to deal with the issues of banking culture and, indeed, with an executive remuneration system that remains too mysterious, not just for shareholders but also for the social licence it grants to those who are its beneficiaries.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2018-02-05,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (16:30):  Firstly I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. The Banking Executive Accountability Regime, or BEAR, as it has become colloquially known, which this government is implementing represents part of some of the most significant reform to our financial sector we've seen in some period of time.


This bill will increase the accountability of banks as authorised deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs, and their most senior executives and directors, restoring the community's trust and confidence in the institutions that play such a central role in our financial system and the wellbeing of all Australians. Schedule 1 of the bill introduces the BEAR. The BEAR imposes new, heightened accountability obligations for ADIs and their accountable persons. These obligations are focused on matters such as conducting businesses with honesty and integrity and with due care, skill and diligence; being open and cooperative in dealings with APRA, the regulator; and preventing matters arising that would adversely affect the prudential reputation or standing of the ADIs. These accountability obligations go to the heart of ensuring the community can have trust in ADIs and in the way they conduct their business.


ADIs will be required to register their accountable persons with APRA prior to appointment, ensuring APRA has greater visibility over the individuals taking up the roles that shape the conduct of ADIs. ADIs will also be required to provide accountability statements and accountability maps to APRA, ensuring there is a clear allocation of responsibility for an ADI's function to individual accountable persons. The bill also increases the consequences for ADIs and accountable persons that fail to meet the new heightened accountability obligations. These increased consequences will ensure that ADIs and their accountable persons have strong incentives to ensure they meet their obligations. Accountable persons will have a minimum amount of their variable remuneration deferred for at least four years, with the amount to be deferred based on the size of the ADI. ADIs will also be required to include in their remuneration policies provisions for the non-payment of deferred variable remuneration where an accountable person fails to comply with their accountability obligations. Ensuring there are financial consequences for accountable persons who do not meet their obligations will increase their focus on the long-term outcomes of their decisions. APRA will also be provided with stronger disqualification powers by being able to disqualify an accountable person directly rather than apply to the Federal Court. APRA disqualification decisions will be subject to merits and judicial review; however, the more streamlined powers will ensure that APRA can more readily respond where an accountable person does not comply with their accountability obligations.


The bill also introduces substantial new civil penalties for ADIs that breach many requirements of the BEAR that relate to prudential matters. These penalties will range from up to $10.5 million for small ADIs to up to $210 million for large ADIs. These civil penalties will put in place strong financial incentives for ADIs to ensure they meet their obligations under the BEAR. Finally, schedule 2 to the bill introduces a number of powers to allow APRA to examine witnesses. These powers will apply in relation to the entire Banking Act and will particularly support APRA's enforcement of the BEAR. They broadly replicate powers that APRA already has in relation to other institutions, including the superannuation sector.


Australia's financial system is strong and it is resilient. However, the series of issues in recent years—and prior to that—have demonstrated that it's not immune from problems. Banks have not always acted with the highest levels of integrity and accountability, which the community expects of them, and this has eroded trust in these institutions. That is why it is important that the BEAR commence as soon as possible: to ensure that accountability gaps in the banking sector are addressed promptly. For this reason, the BEAR will commence on 1 July 2018. That said, the government has provided for transitional arrangements for elements that will require longer to implement, such as the remuneration requirements and the accountability documentation.


Following meetings with APRA, the government had been developing additional transitional arrangements that would have provided APRA with the flexibility it needed to allow staged implementation for small ADIs and provide additional time, until at least 1 January 2019, for these entities to comply with the BEAR. I had held discussions with the chair of APRA some time last year that provided APRA with administrative flexibility to roll these measures out for small- and medium-sized ADIs. As a result, we are quite comfortable with suggestions and proposals that are being put forward that would recognise that formally in this legislation. This will allow APRA to focus on implementing the BEAR for the large ADIs, a key priority because of how many Australian customers are touched by these institutions. In discussions with the opposition, they have informed us that they will be proposing to delay the commencement of the BEAR for both small- and medium-sized ADIs until 1 July 2019 in order to facilitate the expeditious passage of these important and critical reforms. The government is happy to agree to this amendment. It is consistent with the administrative arrangements we were already seeking to put in place with APRA in any case.


It is vital that Australians see these reforms implemented and that these rules are legislated as soon as possible. We thank the opposition for their support, both in this chamber and in the other place, in ensuring this bill's expeditious passage through the parliament. These coalition government reforms are too important to delay. While we are reluctant to see any unnecessary delay, our first priority is protecting Australian banking customers and enshrining appropriate protections in legislation. This bill will ensure that the banks at the heart of our financial sector meet community expectations by clarifying accountability obligations, clarifying the responsibilities of senior executives and imposing more significant consequences where these obligations are not met. The BEAR will ensure the banks shift their focus to ensuring there is a strong outcome for all Australians and that they are accountable for all of those outcomes, including the stewardship of their important social licence. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (16:37):  I move opposition amendment (1):


(1) Schedule 1, Part 3, page 32 (after line 20), at the end of the Part, add:




18


Application to small and medium ADIs



(1) Despite item 15 and subitem 16(1), Part IIAA of the Banking Act 1959 as inserted by this Act applies in relation to the following on and after 1 July 2019:


(a) a medium ADI;


(b) a small ADI;


(c) an accountable person of a medium ADI;


(d) an accountable person of a small ADI.


(2) Despite subitem (1), if:


(a) an accountable person's variable remuneration is payable under a contract entered into before the commencement of Part IIAA of the Banking Act 1959 as inserted by this Act; and


(b) apart from this subitem, the application of Division 4 of that Part in relation to the variable remuneration would result in an acquisition of property (within the meaning of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the Constitution) from a person otherwise than on just terms (within the meaning of that paragraph);


that Division does not apply in relation to the variable remuneration to the extent that it would result in such an acquisition.


Note: Because this subitem prevents Division 4 of Part IIAA of the Banking Act 1959 from giving rise to such an acquisition of property in relation to variable remuneration payable under such a contract, compensation will not be payable under section 69E of that Act.


(3) Despite item 17, transitional requirements determined by APRA under that item apply in relation to a medium ADI, or a small ADI, on and after 1 July 2019.


As I flagged in my second reading debate speech, this amendment delays the implementation of the BEAR as it applies to small- and medium-sized authorised deposit-taking institutions until 1 July 2019. Those institutions will be those declared to be such by the Treasurer.


I think this is a sensible amendment. As I said before, small- and medium-sized enterprises, banks and other deposit-taking institutions play a vital role in improving competition in the financial sector. I think that would be something both sides of the House would agree with. Indeed, we would like to see more competition from small- and medium-sized enterprises in the banking and financial services space. It was going to be a very onerous task for these ADIs to comply with this by 1 July 2018, probably an impossible task, therefore this amendment is sensible. I appreciate the fact that the government will support this amendment. It's nice to win one occasionally. I commend it to the House.

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (15:47):  The only reason the government finally acted on banking was its own reptilian political survival instincts. It knew it had to do something—anything—if it was to survive, and as a result we have this timid creature, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017, the BEAR bill. It is not much, but Labor will not stand in its way because at least it's something. It's a first step in the journey of a thousand steps.


The bill gives APRA new and strengthened powers and an extra $4.2 million over four years, plus a further $1 million a year to enforce breaches. Costs are to be met by an increase in APRA financial institutions levies of $8.2 million over four years. There is an extra $1.1 million for Treasury to oversee a more accountable and competitive banking system of which the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, or BEAR, is part. The total change in average annual regulatory cost from the business-as-usual model is about $11½ million across the sector. That is a minuscule impost for a sector which in 2016 posted after-tax profits of more than $30 billion. 


At its core, the BEAR will make certain individuals in banks, credit unions and the like, which are termed 'authorised deposit-taking institutions' or ADIs, legally accountable both for their decisions and for practices that occur under their authority. So if people under the supervision of these accountable persons do certain things that these people should have known about, the ADIs are held accountable for them. The intention is to get rid of the wriggle room for the slippery executives and directors who try to pass the buck onto subordinates or blame vague processes. And I welcome that. The BEAR requires ADIs and people with significant influence over conduct and behaviour to conduct themselves with honesty and integrity, and to carry out effectively the business activities for which they are responsible. The BEAR does this by creating a new definition of 'accountable person', who is a board member with oversight over the bank or ADI, or a senior executive with responsibility for management or control of significant or substantial parts or aspects of the business. Accountable persons must be located in the ADI, not on some beach resort in the Caymans, where they are uncontactable. In the case of an ADI group, they should be located in significant or substantial subsidiaries. Not all subsidiaries will have accountable persons located in them individually, but throughout an ADI group accountable persons must have clear lines of responsibility to cover all business activities of the group. ADIs will be required to tell APRA who its accountable persons are and clearly outline the responsibilities and duties of those people. When it comes to an ADI group, APRA must be given a clear map of who is responsible for what across the myriad business units. Again, the intention is: no place to hide. 


The BEAR will require that up to 40 per cent of an accountable person's variable remuneration—what we loosely call 'bonuses'—is kept in reserve for four years so that it can be stripped from said person if they are found to have failed in their governance duties. In the case of CEOs, who one would think would all be accountable persons under the definitions of this bill, the reserved bonus amount will be 60 per cent, or up to 60 per cent, depending on the size of the institution. As a result of this requirement, I will not be at all surprised if we see a change in remuneration practices for senior executives. Perhaps base pay and allowances will end up being much bigger and much higher, and bonuses perhaps less generous. Time will tell. 


APRA will be granted the power to disqualify with seven days notice, without court order and without giving reasons, any accountable person that APRA determines has failed to comply with their obligations under the BEAR. It will be important that APRA ensures that it operates within tight guidelines to ensure that its own officers act with the utmost care. The phrase 'who watches the watchers' comes to mind. While it is important that APRA be given the authority it needs to act swiftly and decisively, that should not be at the expense of natural justice. 


Labor does not propose to stand in the way of this bill, and I am pleased that the government has accepted some of our amendments. But I do acknowledge the harbouring of some personal concern about handing APRA the authority to disqualify an accountable person, without giving that person a reason. That does not sit well with me. While the bill states that an accountable person, under notice of disqualification, must be given the opportunity to submit a defence, if they wish to do so, there is no minimum time provided for such submissions to be made, beyond the initial seven days notice, before the disqualification comes into effect. Unless I am missing something, it is entirely possible under this legislation that an accountable person can be given notice by APRA one Monday that they are under notice of disqualification, and for that disqualification to take effect the following Monday, with the accountable person not necessarily being informed of the reason for the action. That does not sit well with me at all. I would expect and hope that APRA will exercise discretion and ensure that accountable persons within its sights are afforded natural justice and, at the very least, told why they are about to lose their livelihood. It sets a worrisome precedent that anyone should be forced by a government instrument out of their profession, without the legal right to be told why. 


As well as disqualification, accountable persons and ADIs can face significant civil penalties for breaching their obligations under the BEAR. Big banks could face penalties of up to $210 million. It sounds like a lot of money, but when we're talking about institutions that make billions of dollars in profits, I'm not sure that figure really hits the mark in terms of sending a message to the banks that they need to do the right thing. 


The Treasurer introduced this legislation in September. It was promptly sent to a Senate review committee, which recommended that the bill be passed subject to its implementation being delayed by 12 months from legislative approval, which is in effect a practical delay of six months. Labor and cross-party senators, following input from smaller institutions and APRA, were concerned that those smaller and regional banks and ADIs would find the 1 July 2018 start date challenging to implement. So Labor is pleased that the government seems to have agreed, as I understand it, to this sensible recommendation for the delay.


You won't often find me in agreement with the Australian Bankers' Association, an organisation that is relentless in pursuing what is in the best interests of big banks' profitability, rather than what is in the best interests of bank customers, but I do find myself thinking it may have a point when it comes to one day expanding the scope of the BEAR. The ABA says, not unreasonably in my view, that as well as authorised deposit-taking institutions perhaps other financial institutions, such as insurance and superannuation firms, should come under the ambit of the BEAR. ABA CEO, Anna Bligh, notes that APRA's regulatory oversight already stretches to such bodies, so it wouldn't be much of a stretch for the BEAR to encompass them too. Ms Bligh notes that banks recruit not only from other banks but also from the insurance sector and the superannuation sector. Employment is very mobile across the entire finance sector. It stands to reason, to me at least, that if the BEAR can strengthen accountability and ethical decision-making in the banking sector, then it should be able to do the same across the financial sector as a whole, and that's something that can perhaps be revisited once the BEAR is up and running.


As with all things, the devil will be in the detail, and we'll see how this process runs out once the legislation goes through the House and the parliament. Accountability and transparency are laudable goals that Labor always supports, often in the face of trenchant opposition from those opposite. We will always keep a close eye on the government to ensure that it brings to this place legislation that is even-handed and that works in the best interests of Australian consumers and not just Australian banks. Thank you.

Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (15:57):  I would like to begin this small contribution to the debate by thanking Treasury, the minister, the Hon. Scott Morrison, and staff for taking on changes to legislation to address many of the recommendations that have been derived from a number of parliamentary inquiries where there is a clear direction for government to take. Such legislative application is an example of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017. This bill amends the Banking Act to establish a Banking Executive Accountability Regime, commonly known and frequently referred to in here as 'the BEAR'.


The BEAR is a strengthened responsibility and accountability framework for the most senior and influential executives and directors in banking groups. To support the BEAR, the bill gives the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority—APRA—new and strengthened powers. Contrary to some of the arguments presented by those opposite, this bill is not directing the boards of banks about the money to be paid to their executives. It is, however, a strengthening of the accountability of those very executives, making sure they do the job we expect them to do. This is about re-establishing the confidence and faith we had in our banks as an institution of reliability and the foundation stone of the economy of our nation. Over the last decade in particular, the awareness of the financial activities of our banking institutions has been growing, and there is increased scrutiny and pressure on those organisations. This legislation is part of a suite of changes in legislation and regulation to make our banking industry better.


Working on each issue in this industry has been a thorough and important process. It has, however, been misunderstood in the general public and, to some degree, by the media. Late in 2017, it became very apparent that the public expected a royal commission into banking, rather than the rock-steady changes to regulation. While those opposite say, by throwing it in the debate constantly, that this current bill relates directly to that royal commission, that is patently untrue. This work was already underway. May I remind those opposite: you can't bring in a new bill as a result of the royal commission inquiry until that inquiry is complete. Seriously, do not confuse our public. That banking royal commission is only just beginning.


The banking sector plays an essential role in promoting economic growth and a critical role in the lives of everyday Australians. In order for it to operate in an efficient, stable and fair way, the community has to trust that sector. In Australia, a series of incidents involving poor behaviour by banks over recent years has raised the question of whether there are emerging systemic issues that are undermining trust in our banks.


For more than four years I've been involved in lobbying the government for an investigation like or equal to a royal commission, because I'm well aware of the difficulties faced by so many Australians who've been victims of banking actions and policies. Strategies that I have heard and seen evidence of include the following, one of which is referred to as the bad banking strategy. During inquiries, some statements that resulted in the examination of banking executive behaviour were confusing and seemed to be deliberate misinformation. When asked if they manipulated loans and if this was a banking activity, the response would be something along the lines of: 'Well, what I can say at a general level is, as I've said before, there is absolutely no commercial advantage, and therefore no incentive whatsoever, for this bank or that bank to put borrowers in default. Both parties lose out. There is no incentive.' I've seen conclusive evidence that that, in fact, is not the case, and yet that is part of the inquiry. Homes and businesses have been lost over manipulated loan books with loan-to-value ratios being changed, yet the payments of those mortgages were continuing. There were dozens of other stories, yet no-one in the bank was responsible. There are farmers now living in other people's homes or transitioning in sheds. They were great farmers. What is wrong with our banking industry when the interests of the shareholders are held in much greater esteem than those of the customers?


We all know that the economy has a cycle. It has elastic terms which make economic downturns difficult to predict. However, we do not have (a) adequate rescue options for smaller customers and (b) regulations in place that prevent banks taking the decisions they have done in the past, which have led to very difficult financial circumstances.


Under the BEAR, banks and their most senior executives and directors will be expected to conduct their business and responsibilities with honesty, integrity, due skill, care and diligence. They'll need to deal with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way and prevent matters from arising that would adversely affect the authorised deposit-taking institution's prudential reputation or standing. Where these expectations are not met, APRA will be empowered to more easily disqualify the individuals, ensuring that banks' remuneration policies result in financial consequences for individuals. In fact, people have to take responsibility for the decisions over which they are in charge. APRA will be allowed to impose substantial fines on banks. Banks will be required to register individuals with APRA before appointing them as senior executives and directors. APRA will also get additional examination powers—albeit at a cost, but it's a good investment—which will help to investigate potential breaches of the BEAR.


Personally, I'd really like to see a process where bank executives, failed or successful, are not able to be part of ASIC, APRA or the ACCC, either before or after their banking executive career position. While that is a very personal view, it is not without basis. On many occasions, it was difficult during committee inquiries to get straight answers from different representatives, and it seemed that was a result of the interrelationship between past working experiences of those different organisations. In my opinion, they need to be quite separate.


Properly designed measures, such as the BEAR, will make part of our financial system safer, and we'll feel reassured that integrity is returning to an institution that we have held very precious until the recent past.


Reckless banking practices such as dangerous lending conditions are the responsibility of the banking executive. The board and the executives sign off on any policy change and they should be held accountable. The industry itself knows that the issue is not just a few bad apples. It is a chronic cultural function. They've admitted they need to change the culture, but they have yet to do that. It is to be a process of change. These mechanisms are intended to deter poor bank behaviour and ensure the banks and individuals are held to account, which is what the Australian nation expects of them.

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (16:05):  The changes to be brought about through the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2017, the Banking Executive Accountability Regime and some related measures, have been driven by increased calls over many years now for intervention into the Australian banking sector. The call for increased government intervention into banking has been coming from a wide variety of voices across all sectors in our community. A key concern is the perception here that banking executives are not being properly held to account for the various scandals and mistreatment of customers emanating from Australian banks. For example, we've had the bank bill swap rate rigging scandal, which has now enveloped all four of our major Australian banks; we've had the AUSTRAC bank scandal with the Commonwealth Bank; and we've had many—in fact, way too many—examples of dodgy financial advice being handed out by our banks, or in fact customers being charged for that advice when it was not even provided. The introduction of a senior executive and director accountability regime is significant and it does recognise that it's about making the leaders of our banking sector responsible for the changes that are required in our banks and, in particular, for the cultural change that is required. 


The government, in its explanatory memorandum, does point out that this scheme—the BEAR—comes about from a recommendation of the House Economics Committee, a committee of which I am a member. What the government seemed to skip over in its explanation in the explanatory memorandum is that this recommendation actually came from the opposition, not from its own members of the committee. But what the government has put together here doesn't quite go the full distance. It is actually quite limited. The committee recommendation was essentially based on the UK senior executive accountability regime, but, unlike that regime, which is about both consumer issues and prudential issues, the BEAR that is proposed by the government here is only about prudential ones. That is why we support it but we must also see it expanded. For, in truth, this isn't a real BEAR; it's a clayton's BEAR—it's the banking executive accountability regime you have when you aren't really having one. It's a bit like the government's banking royal commission. 


The government appears also to have confused APRA, the prudential regulatory authority, with its consumer counterpart, ASIC. APRA is the prudential regulator in this country and is responsible for ensuring that banks, amongst others, do not undermine the integrity of our financial system and that, of course, they're able to pay out banking customers when they call on their funds. That is a very important role and it is key to this regime, as it should be. But ASIC, it also needs to be realised, is our key consumer focused regulator, looking at what the outcomes are for consumers and those that are purchasing financial products and using our banking sector, and that is the area that it has responsibility for regulating. So it's responsible for making sure that our banks do act fairly. For example, it is ASIC that is taking the bank bill swap case against the banks. It is ASIC that has been involved in the proceedings in relation to dodgy financial advice from our banks. So I do, in some regard, feel sorry for ASIC, because it's quite clear that, under this government, it's go-to financial regulator has become APRA, excluding ASIC from consideration—in fact, often not even asking it or consulting with it in relation to legislation just like this. 


If we cast back to the flurry of these banking scandals, they were not prudential. The ones I mentioned before— in fact, none of the ones that we've seen—have been prudential. They have been customer-facing scandals and issues, and that's where we see the deficiency in this accountability regime. This deficiency has been acknowledged by ASIC in the evidence it's given to parliamentary committees—that this is a missing component of this regulatory regime when we compare it to the regimes that are in force in other places, such as the United Kingdom. 


I will say that the government has taken on some of the initial feedback that was provided by stakeholders when it first proposed this legislation. So it has relooked at the application to banking subsidiaries. One of the key concerns was: what happens with insurers that sit under banks? It turns out in the process that the banks have largely sold off all of their insurance arms. They're clearly quite concerned. They've also clarified the role of directors in relation to the definition of accountable persons. They've set new start dates. They've tried to deal with the overlap between ASIC and APRA in its disqualification powers mainly to make sure that what they have proposed in this legislation would actually work. They have also dealt with the issue of the start date, as I said. Then there is the issue of how this will apply to small banks, and I'll come to that at the end. 


The other issue that hasn't been addressed to anyone's confidence is the resourcing that this legislation is going to require from APRA. APRA is already very busy doing important work, making sure that the prudential regulation in this country is generally up to scratch and meeting world standards. It has been working with the Reserve Bank of Australia, looking at the level of household debt in this country and the changes that have been required, for example, to interest-only loans. Given that APRA is already going full pelt, to add this burden on top does require the government to make sure that they properly resource APRA to do the job that they're now asking them to do. However, if additional resources are not being given to APRA to enforce the new law that will be coming into place, the question has to be asked: is it the case that the government actually do not intend anything to happen under this legislation, that it is, as I said, a Clayton's piece of legislation that doesn't actually do the job? Or is it the case that, whilst they have put all of this in place, they have no intention of APRA doing any of the work, and they're happy for it to fail? Let me mark this term right here: we need to make sure that, if we're going to do these sorts of things, we resource the bodies that are going to be there to enforce them. 


As I mentioned before, there is an issue about levelling the playing field between large banks and small banks, and that is why Labor have proposed that, in acknowledging this difference, we give a 12-month delay to the start date for our smaller banking institutions to comply with this new framework. As I'm sure everyone will appreciate, there is a world of difference between our large Australian banks—with their huge compliance teams and access to funds to be able to fund the lawyers to get these schemes and the internals that are required within the banks up to speed in order to comply with this law—and our smaller banks. For smaller banks, for smaller ADIs in Australia, to comply, it will take longer. They don't have that regulatory team just sitting there, waiting to go—though sometimes you do wonder about the large banks as well, given their rate of noncompliance of recent years. That is why Labor have proposed a very sensible amendment. As I said, we support the legislation. We just don't think it goes far enough. We've proposed an amendment to make sure that small banks are not disproportionately disadvantaged by the introduction of this regime. 


As I mentioned before, the government has form, terrible form, when it comes to financial services legislation. We've had their attempts to rip up FOFA. We've had their superannuation backflips. We've had them refusing to hold a banking royal commission. We've had the crowd-sourced funding debacle, which they introduced legislation for, which no-one actually liked. They had to come back and fix it up, despite us telling them that at the time. We've had their attempt at multinational tax avoidance legislation, which doesn't even go halfway to doing the job. We've had ASIC and reviews calling for increased corporate penalties in this country for years and years and years, and the government have kept talking the talk but have never delivered the legislation to do it. We've had their attacks on the industry superannuation sector. And we've had the banking royal commission, which they finally announced, which, as I said, is a bit of a Clayton's royal commission, because they've given the terms of reference without any consultation with Labor, who have been calling for a royal commission for many years. They've effectively excluded looking at the regulatory part of the banking sector, which, in my view, means that they're not looking at the whole case for what is required for cultural change. You can't change the culture in Australian banking by just looking at the banking players. You've also got to look at the regulatory environment in which they play and the way in which their regulators operate. 


The government has given the royal commission all of 12 months to get all of that work done. You would think that, after the amount of evidence and the countless inquiries that have happened through this parliament in relation to this issue, it would be abundantly clear that there is a lot of work to be done by a royal commission. By straddling it and really constraining it with a 12-month time frame shows just how much this government was trying to score political points by calling a royal commission and nullify a political issue that was hanging around its neck, instead of getting on with the work of making sure that financial regulation works properly in this country. Now we have the Claytons Banking Executive Accountability Regime. We thank the government for bringing it forward, but it doesn't actually deliver on what is needed. We all knew that this government was out of touch but, when it comes to financial services regulation, we now can see clearly, through the litany of failures through the term of this government, that it is clearly out of its depth as well.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-02-05,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:15):  There is a problem with banks in this country. People do not trust them, and rightly so. Trust in the banks has been eroding for a very, very long time. People wonder why the Australian government gives the banks such a massive leg-up, by effectively underwriting the big banks' activities, because they know they're too big to fail, and then allows them to make world-leading record profits. Yet, at the same time, people find themselves going further and further into debt, paying more and more in bank fees every year, and they wonder where the bank profits are coming from. Well, the bank profits are coming from the people of Australia. The bank profits are coming from an overinflated housing market that sees the banks get rich from writing huge mortgages. The bubble keeps growing and growing and the people in the banks and those at the top keep doing better and better. People know something is wrong with the system.


The big part of the problem, the driver of the problem, is that what the banks pay themselves, their executives and the people at the top is not based on how happy customers are but is based solely, or in very large part, on how much money they make for their shareholders. It is based on whether or not they can find strategies to keep these world-leading record profits going, by hell or high water. So the people at the top of the banks have an interest in making as much money as possible and putting the community last. Money first, community last—that's the way the big banks run in this country, but they rely on the government to step in should they ever get into trouble, as they did during the global financial crisis.


The way the system works is that the salaries of so many of the people at the top are tied to the bonuses they make, which are based on how much profit the banks rein in. Because of this, we have this system and this bubble that is going to keep inflating and get bigger and bigger, unless action is taken. When you see the head of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, for example—an organisation that's been prosecuted in court for allegedly illegal activity—in 2016 have a base salary of $2.65 million and a total salary of $12.3 million, you see how much of a problem there is with this bonus culture inside the banks, where they are forced, by hell or high water, to find ways of making money out of everyday Australians, even if it puts Australians into further and further debt that ultimately they can't afford.


If the culture of an organisation starts at the top, we need to change the way that banking executives are paid. Start saying to them, 'You operate in this country under a social licence.' Everyone has to have a bank account now, whether you work or are unemployed or whatever you are. They have a steady stream of our money coming in and they have the government underwriting them, because they know they are too big to fail. Well, there's a quid pro quo, which is that you don't contribute to inequality in Australian society. You pay a reasonable amount, but no more.


This bill largely leaves all of that untouched. They'll still be able to get away with paying themselves enormous salaries and enormous bonuses, and it's that bonus culture that is putting Australians further and further into debt and seeing the banks continue to make a motza. So this bill can be supported for being a very small drop in the very big bucket that needs to be filled, if we are to regain trust in this country.


But one of the things we should do is seize the opportunity, now that the government has rediscovered that it's time we took on the banks and reined them in, to fix this bill. When this bill comes before the Senate, the Greens and Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, who has been paying very close attention to this and has been all over it like a rash for a very long time, will be introducing some amendments to give this bill some teeth. In this country we legislate for the minimum wage. It's not much, it puts people in poverty, but we legislate for the minimum wage. What we don't have are any controls at the other end. As a result we see these bank bosses who can earn over 100 times the average wage—not the minimum wage, the average wage. Is there any justification for the head of a bank to earn over 100 times the average wage in this country? There is not.


It is time to make Australia more equal, it is time to make the banks behave better and it is time to stop them contributing to inequality in this country, which is why the Greens will be moving to amend this bill. This bill should include hard caps on how much bank executives at the top are able to pay themselves. There is no reason that their base remuneration should be any more than 10 times the average national wage. That would start to make Australia a more equal place. I ask people who say that you can't go around restricting banks: what is the justification for someone in this country earning more than 10 times the average wage? Surely, after you've earned your first million dollars a year, what's the point of the rest of it? You're living a very comfortable life. What can be the justification for saying in Australia, in an egalitarian country, that we're quite happy, through government largesse and government support, to allow someone to earn $12 million a year? That is not what the banks are there for. That's not the social licence they operate under.


We'll move to say that the base rate should be limited to 10 times the average national wage, but, as I said, that variable bonus component is the real problem, and that should be limited to a further five times the average national wage. This will start to make Australia a more equal place again. You shouldn't shed a tear for the bank executives if those amendments get through, because they would still be able to earn over a million dollars. According to the Parliamentary Library, they'd still have $840,000 per annum as the cap for the base salary and about $420,000 per annum for the variable component. They could still count themselves millionaires, but they wouldn't be earning more than 10 times what the average Australian worker does. At a time when everyone else's wages are going backwards, the pay of bank executives is skyrocketing, their profits are skyrocketing and the shareholders, the people who own the banks, are doing very well out of it, but it's all at the expense of everyday people in Australia who are going further and further into debt and getting mortgages that they are struggling to meet, who are paying outrageous bank fees and who are getting advice from their banks about wealth management products that aren't in people's best interests but are just in the banks' best interests. We need to crack that nut and say to banks: 'You operate here under a social licence. We'll let you earn 10 times what the average person does, but above that is just unjustifiable greed that is coming at people's expense.'


When this bill passes the House, as I imagine it will, I hope that consideration is given in the Senate to giving it some teeth, because this bill sees a big problem and then really does nothing about it. It introduces some little moves around the edges but it is turning a blind eye to the core problem, which is that greed still drives this industry and still drives the pay structure in this industry. Until we start saying, 'You get remunerated for something close to the value of your work, not because you've been able to fleece a lot of money out of everyday Australians,' we will continue to have this problem. I commend the amendments that are to be moved in the Senate to this chamber and I hope this parliament won't just be seen to be saying something about the banks but will actually do something to rein in the obscene salaries that we're seeing.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (16:25):  The bill before the House is less than what it seems and much less than what Australians need. I rise to make a brief contribution to the debate on the bill. In particular, I want to support the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon, and express some concerns and make two wider points relating to the issue of banking regulation and executive remuneration. The member for Kingsford Smith described the government's approach to regulation in this area as 'piecemeal'—and, characteristically, that was both accurate and generous. The bill before us amends the Banking Act and the APRA Act to put in place some new accountability obligations on executives of authorised deposit-taking institutions. To make this meaningful, the bill will put in place new penalty provisions and additional powers for APRA in the Banking Executive Accountability Regime.


This is a regime that is modelled on that which has been relatively recently put in place in the UK—and so far so good. The regime is much more limited in nature than that which has been introduced in the UK. In terms of its coverage, in terms of the industry and indeed conduct rules and the rest of it, there are things that are worthy of wider consideration through, in particular, the banking royal commission into which this government has been dragged kicking and screaming. This bill was put before the House prior to the government's concession to a royal commission in December last year. Looking at the terms of the bill before us, we could do much more to align the consequences of a failure to meet community standards with the expectations that lead to the social licence our banks have.


The bill before us, so far as it goes, achieves some reasonable objectives, particularly if the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer is agreed to. But there are a couple of concerns I wish to put before the House. First and foremost, there are some on the government benches who clearly don't get it, who don't accept that there is a need for action. I've been very disturbed at reports that a number of government members feel there is no warrant for these sorts of measures. These members have not been paying attention to what has been going on in our banks—in particular, our big banks. I'm very disturbed by these reports, and I hope by their actions on the floor of this place they will prove them wrong.


I'm also concerned at reports about some in the banking industry. In an interview with the Treasurer published in the Fin Review today, I was concerned to read of reports that concerns were apparently expressed to Mr Hartzer in Davos that people don't see where the problem is. If this is the case, they haven't been looking very hard because clearly there are very significant and systemic issues in the Australian banking industry which require detailed and holistic review.


That takes me to the first of the two wider points I wish to mention briefly. Firstly, the government's signature and indeed only economic policy for growth is an enormous company tax cut. Secondly, the four biggest banks are already some of the most profitable businesses in Australia, so a giveaway to those banks would be enormous. That context is important when we're debating this piece of legislation because it reminds us of what is going on in the wider economy and that the piecemeal measures here are no substitute for wholesale reform, particularly in light of the litany of regulatory failures that the member for Burt has detailed.


What is required is a holistic review and widespread cultural change. That cultural change is needed more widely in the Australian business community beyond the banks, though the banks are the exemplars of worst practice. Last year I was pleased to put before the House a private member's bill looking at executive remuneration more generally. It highlighted the positive impact of Labor's two-strikes policy on restraining the extraordinary growth of salaries which has seen the top 0.1 per cent of Australian's income share increase exponentially—and, with that, their share of wealth grow even more. Other members have spoken about the bonus culture which is particularly prevalent in our big banks. These big issues remain.


I note that Malcolm Borland's comments have been referred to in the Bills Digest, very helpfully looking at the mystery of the lack of conformity of bonuses and executive remuneration generally with performance. The mystery has been unpacked quite a bit by such inquiries as that conducted by the Productivity Commission in 2009. There is a lot more work to be done to deal with the issues of banking culture and, indeed, with an executive remuneration system that remains too mysterious, not just for shareholders but also for the social licence it grants to those who are its beneficiaries.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (16:30):  Firstly I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. The Banking Executive Accountability Regime, or BEAR, as it has become colloquially known, which this government is implementing represents part of some of the most significant reform to our financial sector we've seen in some period of time.


This bill will increase the accountability of banks as authorised deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs, and their most senior executives and directors, restoring the community's trust and confidence in the institutions that play such a central role in our financial system and the wellbeing of all Australians. Schedule 1 of the bill introduces the BEAR. The BEAR imposes new, heightened accountability obligations for ADIs and their accountable persons. These obligations are focused on matters such as conducting businesses with honesty and integrity and with due care, skill and diligence; being open and cooperative in dealings with APRA, the regulator; and preventing matters arising that would adversely affect the prudential reputation or standing of the ADIs. These accountability obligations go to the heart of ensuring the community can have trust in ADIs and in the way they conduct their business.


ADIs will be required to register their accountable persons with APRA prior to appointment, ensuring APRA has greater visibility over the individuals taking up the roles that shape the conduct of ADIs. ADIs will also be required to provide accountability statements and accountability maps to APRA, ensuring there is a clear allocation of responsibility for an ADI's function to individual accountable persons. The bill also increases the consequences for ADIs and accountable persons that fail to meet the new heightened accountability obligations. These increased consequences will ensure that ADIs and their accountable persons have strong incentives to ensure they meet their obligations. Accountable persons will have a minimum amount of their variable remuneration deferred for at least four years, with the amount to be deferred based on the size of the ADI. ADIs will also be required to include in their remuneration policies provisions for the non-payment of deferred variable remuneration where an accountable person fails to comply with their accountability obligations. Ensuring there are financial consequences for accountable persons who do not meet their obligations will increase their focus on the long-term outcomes of their decisions. APRA will also be provided with stronger disqualification powers by being able to disqualify an accountable person directly rather than apply to the Federal Court. APRA disqualification decisions will be subject to merits and judicial review; however, the more streamlined powers will ensure that APRA can more readily respond where an accountable person does not comply with their accountability obligations.


The bill also introduces substantial new civil penalties for ADIs that breach many requirements of the BEAR that relate to prudential matters. These penalties will range from up to $10.5 million for small ADIs to up to $210 million for large ADIs. These civil penalties will put in place strong financial incentives for ADIs to ensure they meet their obligations under the BEAR. Finally, schedule 2 to the bill introduces a number of powers to allow APRA to examine witnesses. These powers will apply in relation to the entire Banking Act and will particularly support APRA's enforcement of the BEAR. They broadly replicate powers that APRA already has in relation to other institutions, including the superannuation sector.


Australia's financial system is strong and it is resilient. However, the series of issues in recent years—and prior to that—have demonstrated that it's not immune from problems. Banks have not always acted with the highest levels of integrity and accountability, which the community expects of them, and this has eroded trust in these institutions. That is why it is important that the BEAR commence as soon as possible: to ensure that accountability gaps in the banking sector are addressed promptly. For this reason, the BEAR will commence on 1 July 2018. That said, the government has provided for transitional arrangements for elements that will require longer to implement, such as the remuneration requirements and the accountability documentation.


Following meetings with APRA, the government had been developing additional transitional arrangements that would have provided APRA with the flexibility it needed to allow staged implementation for small ADIs and provide additional time, until at least 1 January 2019, for these entities to comply with the BEAR. I had held discussions with the chair of APRA some time last year that provided APRA with administrative flexibility to roll these measures out for small- and medium-sized ADIs. As a result, we are quite comfortable with suggestions and proposals that are being put forward that would recognise that formally in this legislation. This will allow APRA to focus on implementing the BEAR for the large ADIs, a key priority because of how many Australian customers are touched by these institutions. In discussions with the opposition, they have informed us that they will be proposing to delay the commencement of the BEAR for both small- and medium-sized ADIs until 1 July 2019 in order to facilitate the expeditious passage of these important and critical reforms. The government is happy to agree to this amendment. It is consistent with the administrative arrangements we were already seeking to put in place with APRA in any case.


It is vital that Australians see these reforms implemented and that these rules are legislated as soon as possible. We thank the opposition for their support, both in this chamber and in the other place, in ensuring this bill's expeditious passage through the parliament. These coalition government reforms are too important to delay. While we are reluctant to see any unnecessary delay, our first priority is protecting Australian banking customers and enshrining appropriate protections in legislation. This bill will ensure that the banks at the heart of our financial sector meet community expectations by clarifying accountability obligations, clarifying the responsibilities of senior executives and imposing more significant consequences where these obligations are not met. The BEAR will ensure the banks shift their focus to ensuring there is a strong outcome for all Australians and that they are accountable for all of those outcomes, including the stewardship of their important social licence. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-02-05,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (17:59):  I'm very proud to stand in this chamber as the member representing the first community in Australia that had the gumption to attack one of the great social evils within its midst—in particular, excessive alcohol consumption. That community is Ceduna and the surrounding communities of Yalata, Oak Valley, Koonibba and a number of homeland communities around Ceduna. Ceduna isn't an Indigenous town as such—about 20 per cent of the population is Indigenous—and problem drinking is not just an Indigenous issue. That's why I was so proud of the community, with the charge led by their mayor, Allan Suter, and a number of Indigenous representatives who walked the mile with us and saw the introduction of the cashless welfare card in Ceduna. 


I was very pleased with the interim report on the trial, which came down a little over 12 months ago, but was particularly pleased with the final report. The trial has been extended. I thank members opposite for their support of that extension, but I am incredibly mystified by their intention to try to deny the current legislation. 


Let me tell you how good the cashless welfare card has been in Ceduna. It is extremely popular with the broader population, but also, from my interactions, with the majority of those who are on welfare, because the welfare card is so designed that it really won't impact on your lifestyle at all if you are managing your life well. If you are taking the payments that the Commonwealth gives you to care for yourself and your family in a correct manner, it will not have an impact. Increasingly in this world, as we all know, in the supermarket and in almost any shop you can just wave the card and it debits the account. One of the problems with the BasicsCard is that it came with a level of shame. The BasicsCard looks different—the blue card. When people that hold a BasicsCard go into a supermarket, everyone can see that they are on the blue card. But a cashless welfare card looks just like everybody else's debit card, so there is no shame. That's a great move forward. 


So it is that I come to some of the key evaluations in the final report. In the first six months great improvements were made, with a reduction in alcohol and illegal drug use and gambling. After the wave 2 data, the second evaluation, we found that those reductions were not only sustained but also broadened, with a larger proportion of cashless debit card participants reporting reduced levels of those behaviours. I will start with one, being the reduction in gambling. For those people in the Australian community who gamble responsibly, it's a good thing—it is no problem if you manage it correctly. For those who have less disposable income to lose on gambling machines, there can be very harmful results for their families. If you are on a welfare payment, you must remember that that payment is for you to look after yourself and your primary responsibility—your family. 


The intake of poker machines was shown to have dropped by 12 per cent. That does not sound like a big reduction, but the figures from the South Australian government survey actually cover another four communities besides Ceduna in the cashless welfare area. Those figures, which include Cummins, Lock, Streaky Bay and Elliston, where there are poker machine outlets, are likely to be much, much higher—I would suggest around a 50 per cent reduction, but certainly 40 per cent. That is considerable. The shops in the region have reported increased turnovers. In the case of Oak Valley, a remote Indigenous community some 300 kilometres out, there was one food truck every two weeks. Now there's a food truck every week. What a wonderful outcome for the people living in that community!


In the wave 1 examination, we found that 25 per cent reported they were drinking less frequently. In wave 2, that went to 41 per cent. In wave 2, people were asked how often they have more than six drinks on one occasion. Thirty-seven per cent more people said they are drinking less drinks than previously. Thirty-eight per cent of participants who reported drinking alcohol stated that they drank alcohol weekly or more often, which was a substantial reduction from the 63 per cent that were measured in wave 1, which we had considered to be a reduction on what existed prior to the welfare card. This is having an incredible impact.


Let me tell you a story, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was out in Ceduna—I visit it frequently—visiting the drying out centre about three or four years ago. They have a drying out centre there with 12 beds. I was talking to the staff—it was all quiet during the day—and I said, 'What was it like last night?' It was full. I asked, 'What was it like?' There were two couples. The men were bad enough. The women were far worse. That was the nursing staff's assessment. One lady was eight months pregnant, and she could not stop throwing up. Now, we know what damage fetal alcohol syndrome is causing in these communities. How can we stand in this place and deny a path that has shown it has effective results?


If this were a positive education type of touchy-feely thing that was working to the extent that these figures we are given tell us, it would be acclaimed not just in Australia but worldwide as an incredible breakthrough. That's why I'm so mystified, now that the Labor Party has walked away from what I thought was a very good mutual understanding that we would go softly, softly, consult with communities and build trust. It's worth pointing out that, when the 20 per cent designated figure was arrived at in Ceduna, we reached that by negotiation with the Ceduna community. It was suggested at one stage that 15 per cent of their income should be delivered in cash. They insisted on 20 per cent. The minister at the time, Minister Tudge, agreed to the 20 per cent. They had their fingers on this reform. I said to them at the time, 'You've got the chance, really, to set the parameters for the rest of Australia to address itself to.' And it has so happened. After that time Kununurra, of course, came on.


For so many things, across so many indicators, there have been great outcomes. In fact, it's really hard to find the flaw in the process. It comes back to this basic tenet that, if you're managing your income well and you're doing the right thing with your income, it won't affect you. As I said, 48 per cent of people are gambling less and 48 per cent of people are taking fewer drugs. I remember speaking to the mayor on one occasion. There was a little protest group and I said, 'Who's that over there?' He was a little dismissive but he said, 'I'll tell you who doesn't like this program. It's the drug dealers.' What a worry! The drug dealers don't like the cashless debit card, because, I can tell you, they don't carry around the little card reader. They're not interested in plastic sales. They're only interested in cash. So it is of great benefit. I've had approaches from a few people in the area who feel as though it's an infringement on their civil rights. One gentleman said that he can no longer buy meat from local farmers that has been killed on-farm. That's actually an illegal activity anyway, just quietly. People shouldn't be supplying meat to anyone from local farms, and certainly not for cash. If you're doing the right thing, it will not infringe.


As I have said before, I'm so proud of this community. They've really stuck their necks out. I said to them along the way: 'I believe you're forging a path for Australia. You are showing what may well become the way that welfare will be delivered right across the country because if it works in Ceduna, why on earth wouldn't it work in Port Augusta? And if it works in Port Augusta, why wouldn't it work in Adelaide? And if it works in Adelaide, why wouldn't it work in Sydney?' But it isn't as if the government has made a decision to do that. What it's doing is trialling this process around Australia. We've already got two communities participating that have a high Indigenous mix in their social profile, although Kununurra's Indigenous mix in their social profile is a little higher than Ceduna's. We also have Kalgoorlie, which is a bit of a step up, although its profile is a little less Indigenous, and Bundaberg is less so again. That's why it's so important to get this program into these areas and start knocking the barnacles off it. That's why it's been so good in Ceduna. When issues have come up in Ceduna, we've been able to address them quite quickly and then alter the template for what we might do in another place. I remember being contacted by an op shop. They said, 'We don't have a proper connection to be able to get the plastic card to work.' We managed to fix that quite quickly. These are the little teething issues.


I think there are some myths out there. I've been told anecdotally that a number of families and individuals have shifted from Ceduna to Port Augusta, around 500 kilometres away, to get away from the cashless welfare card. That's an absolute furphy, because you can't get away from it. If you are listed in a community at the time the cashless welfare card is implemented, you cannot just change your address and leave those requirements behind. And that cashless welfare card will work the same all over Australia. Sure, there are more things to be done with it. We will have to use more finesse in working on this card, which is why it's so important it now goes into larger communities with different social make-ups.


I fully support the card. I'm the member who has had to stick his neck out over this card. Let me tell you how popular it is: people from all over my electorate come up to me and say, 'You're on the right track.' We believe that people need to manage the income allocated to them from the taxpayer in a correct and proper manner; that they use it for their good health, their benefit and especially for the benefit of their families; that they manage those families correctly; that they get their kids to school, they get shoes on those kids' feet and they feed them correctly. It's hard to do that if you're feeding a drug habit, it's hard to do that if you're feeding money into poker machines and it's hard to do that if you're drunk all the time. This measure directly addresses those issues. Sure it comes with some challenges for some people, but they are the exact people who need our help. To shy away and turn our backs on them is a retrograde step. We need to step up to the plate.


I make the point that the progression to the cashless debit card in Ceduna came about as a result of the coroner's findings that six deaths in and around Indigenous communities in Ceduna happened basically because of overindulgence in alcohol. People were killed on the road; people died in unsheltered places. The report is a harrowing read, quite frankly. The community decided collectively that they had to do something about it. They had to stand up and be counted, which is why, as I said, I'm so proud of them. I strongly commend this bill, and I hope that those on the other side of this parliament will consider their stance and reconsider supporting the bill. Thank you.

"Burney, Linda, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Ms BURNEY
 (Barton) (18:14):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. The matter of the cashless debit card is a complex one. Labor has consulted many communities and many key stakeholders from around the country. We've received a wide diversity of opinions from both communities and individuals within those communities. We have heard from some communities and individuals who strongly oppose the cashless debit card. We heard from some communities and some individuals who strongly support it. Labor understands that there are areas where there is a community desire to try something new to address drug and alcohol abuse, poverty and the implications of those things, but we also understand that not all communities want this. We understand that there are certain aspects of this measure which are arbitrary and unnecessary.


The member for Grey should support Labor's amendments because he has himself admitted that there are barnacles on this scheme that need knocking off. He said in his speech just a moment ago that there needs to be more finesse. He has actually admitted there are problems with the way in which this scheme is being implemented. He mentioned St Vincent de Paul. One of the things that Labor heard very much in relation to this card was the inability for it to be used at markets and in thrift shops. We've also heard that, when there was a power outage in one of these communities, it meant that people could not use this card for over a week.


But the other thing that really has convinced Labor to take the position that we are taking is that it is a blanket approach, and there is no way for people to come off that card if they are put onto it. There is no pathway. The evaluation that has been done in relation to this particular measure was one of the most flawed evaluations and pieces of work that I have read for a very long time. In fact, it admitted that the very purpose for which this card was set up—and that was to cut back and reduce violence—has not been achieved in the communities where it has been trialled.


This legislation stems from the 2017 budget, when the government proposed establishing trials of the cashless debit card in a further two locations from 1 September 2017. This bill proposes to allow the government to do this by repealing section 124PF of the Social Security (Administration) Act, which provides a number of limitations on the government's cashless debit card trials. Currently, the section has three relevant functions: first, for the existing trial to end on 30 June 2018; second, to limit the trial to three discrete trial areas; and, third, for the trial areas to encompass no more than 10,000 participants in total. These limitations mean that the government can establish one further trial site and all trials will end on 30 June this year. It will be up to the parliament to authorise additional trials above and beyond those prescribed under this section. Since the introduction of the existing trials, the government proposed establishing additional trial sites in the Goldfields of Western Australia and Bundaberg in Queensland.


Of course, Labor referred this bill to a Senate inquiry, appropriately, to allow for more comprehensive assessment of the efficacy of this bill. In particular, the Senate inquiry heard from communities in both existing trial sites, as well as in the proposed additional trial sites in Western Australia and Queensland. The Senate inquiry made a number of concerning findings. First, there was insufficient consultation with these communities; in particular, there was no clear framework or process to establish whether there was community desire for trials to be established in the relevant trial sites. That is very concerning, and it seemed to me to be one of the most fundamental points. Second, and just as concerning, was the finding that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the trials were effective. Third, the inquiry heard that the Orima evaluations of the trial, which I have just referred to and which the government has sought to rely on, were unreliable and were not based on any empirical methods of evaluation. As I said, it was a very poor evaluation and found that the card made no difference to the levels of violence in those communities. Labor is also concerned that the existing trials in Ceduna and Kalgoorlie have not been running long enough for substantive conclusions to be made.


It is clear that we require more rigorous and comprehensive information regarding the card's efficacy. Labor does not believe in a blanket approach to income management, and we do not support a national rollout of the cashless debit card. We know that the vast majority of income support recipients are more than capable of managing their own finances. We know that the vast majority of income support recipients require support on a temporary basis until such time as they are able to regain basic financial security. Labor supports community-driven approaches to tackling deep-seated social issues which perpetuate the cycle of poverty and violence. We believe in continued contact and consultation with communities with chronic unemployment in relation to income management and on whether the card is an appropriate measure for these communities.


We understand that some, not all, communities are simply so desperate to break the chronic cycle of unemployment and poverty and all that that means that they are open to trying measures such as the cashless debit card. To that end, Labor will support the use of the card where a community decides that this measure is what they wish to implement. From our discussions with local communities in Ceduna and East Kimberley, it seems as if some members of those communities wish for those trials to be extended. Labor will move to amend the bill to extend the end date of the trials to 30 June 2019 so that a proper and comprehensive evaluation can take place. Labor will not support the rollout of the card anywhere or at any time without important limitations.


The Liberals seek a blank cheque on this measure, and we are not prepared to provide that blank cheque. We do not believe in the vague and insufficiently credible evidence to justify the pursuit of these trials. The evidence and the evaluation that the government has sought to rely on for further trials is inconclusive at best, and there is some concern about the way in which those conclusions in that evaluation were arrived at. There simply is not credible evidence to support the establishment of further trials. We will not support the establishment of further trials in the Bundaberg or Goldfields regions or any further trials. However, as I've said, we are willing to move an amendment to existing trial sites so that there can be proper evaluation.


Labor understands that the complexity of chronic unemployment, poverty and entrenched social issues cannot and will not simply be solved by income management alone. With the many years that I have worked in the social services area, the human services area and the Indigenous area, I find that this is somehow being viewed by some members opposite as some sort of magic bullet. A cashless debit card is not a magic bullet to solve the many, many years of history of chronic and complex problems that exist in these communities. To paint it as such is nothing short of a scandal.


Labor will propose a number of amendments to this bill and to the use of this measure. As I have said previously, Labor will propose to amend the bill to ensure that the existing trial sites in Ceduna and East Kimberley be given the opportunity to extend their trials to 30 June 2019 to allow a comprehensive and proper evaluation. Labor will also propose an amendment to ensure that no new trial sites can be established, by proposing to reduce the provision from three trial sites to the existing two. This is a really important discussion. It is not up to people that will never be affected to make decisions on behalf of these communities. It is not up to the local council and it is not up to individual members of parliament—those people will not be put on income management. It is up to those people that will be affected by these measures to have a proper say. It is not clear how the decisions have been arrived at in relation to the Goldfields and Bundaberg, and that is unacceptable. We are questioning whether or not there has, in fact, been proper consultation and discussion with those who will be affected in those two proposed trial sites.


Labor will only consider the introduction of a new trial site if the Liberal government can show that they have an agreed, formal consultation process with the community as well as an agreed definition of 'consent'. How on earth can you apply these measures to thousands of people without those two things? Labor understands that the holistic, community-driven approach is the best way to address chronic poverty and unemployment, so Labor will propose the guarantee of funding for wraparound services in the trial sites formally within the legislation. This goes to my point that this is not a magic bullet.


Ensuring basic welfare for all Australians, broader than the social safety net in itself, is an important thing to understand. We do not believe that the Turnbull government can be trusted when it comes to income support. That has been seen in the way the Social Services portfolio has been managed. That includes things like the proposed introduction of drug testing, 22 million calls being unanswered in Centrelink and, of course, the robo-debt debacle.


I will conclude by saying this: the government proposes the cashless debit card not because it is genuinely interested in lifting up our most vulnerable citizens but because it seeks to perpetrate an inaccurate and unfair narrative: that our most vulnerable Australians cannot be trusted with their own spending needs. I urge the government to reflect on going out and supporting these new trial sites. I urge the government, and the members of the crossbench in particular, to give serious consideration to the amendments that Labor proposes for this bill. We are not for one moment saying that there aren't chronic problems. We aren't for one moment saying that there doesn't need to be government intervention in a very meaningful way in many of these communities. We know that employment is important to changing the life choices and chances for many people who are currently welfare dependent, but the thought that a cashless debit card is some sort of magic bullet that is going to fix all those social ills is absolutely a nonsense.


We have thought about this very deeply. We have consulted wisely. We have considered very, very carefully the position Labor is taking on this. It is not a position that we have come to quickly, and it is not a position that we have come to in some sort of a kneejerk reaction. It is a position that we have come to through proper consultation and discussion, as I have said, with the people currently on the cashless debit card or, as the government is proposing, in the communities of those additional trial sites. We're simply saying to the government: 'Look at these amendments. Consider them carefully. Let's make sure that any measures that are going to be addressing the deep-seated issues in those communities are measures that are going to work and that have the wrap-around services that make sure income management can be done in a way that gives people pride, options and choice.' None of those things exist in this current legislation. Labor is simply saying to the members of the government and the crossbench, 'Give serious consideration to these amendments.' It has been the result of a Senate inquiry. I oppose the bill as it currently stands.

"Pitt, Keith, MP",Nats,2018-02-05,"



Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (18:29):  Firstly, can I just say that I have great disappointment in the loss of the Labor Party's bipartisan support on this very important program, one which is clearly difficult to implement. It is a tough policy. I've admitted that publicly many times. I've also said on many occasions that it is not a magic bullet but it is a tool that we have in the toolbox. It is a policy which we can implement, and it's one which will make a great difference.


Can I say to the member for Barton: you missed one of the critical recommendations of the Senate inquiry, and that is the overall recommendation that the legislation should be supported. That was the outcome from the Senate inquiry.


It's not a blanket approach, and I'm going to talk specifically about my electorate, the electorate of Hinkler. It is not just the city of Bundaberg. It is the city of Bundaberg and Hervey Bay; it is the outlying areas such as Bargara, Childers, Woodgate and Booyal; and it is all of those smaller communities such as Toogoom and Burrum Heads. It does cover a very broad range. The consultation has been extensive, and I will talk about that in detail as we continue. It has extensive community support, and I'll talk about exactly how we managed to ascertain that early on before we worked forward with the Department of Social Services.


In terms of ways off the card, if you're on Newstart there's a very clear one: you can go to work. If you are employed, clearly you will not be on the card; you do not need Newstart. It is targeted specifically at those in my electorate who are aged 35 or under and are on particular payments, which we'll discuss a little bit later on. I say to those people in the Bundaberg area: we are continuing with the rollout. I'm disappointed that Labor is not supporting the recommendations for something which quite clearly works.


In terms of our community, I can only tell you that I was born there. It's part of my community. My family is there, I grew up there and my kids go to school there. I've had businesses there. I know extensively the difficulties we have, and I've got to tell you they've gotten worse. They've not gotten better; they have gotten worse. We need to do something which will make some changes, and the amendments proposed in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017 will do that.


You don't have to believe me, as I'm sure the Labor Party won't. I can show you some absolute demonstrations from my local community, including the local press. The first one is an article in the Fraser Coast Chronicle by Blake Antrobus—this was last year—saying that $5 million a month is lost on pokies, just in the Fraser Coast. That is without Bundaberg. That's almost another $5 million, so some $10 million every single month for 12 months.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  Order! I remind the member not to use props in the House.




Mr PITT:
  Of course. I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will use it for reference only. This is just one front page: $10 million lost in pokies—$10 million. The second one was in the Bundaberg NewsMail: 'Ice rife in Bundy homes; Bundaberg the worst for parental drug abuse'. And then there's '$30K inheritance blown on drugs'. On the other side of the coin, on another front page, was a gentleman who was looking for 30 people to come and work at his scallop-shucking business—positions he just can't fill. So we have challenges on both sides of the coin: we have employment available that people simply won't do, and we have real challenges around drugs and alcohol. This is one way forward. It is a policy which is on the table that has been demonstrated to work. I can go on and on and on here. We have dozens and dozens. In fact, there were so many in the local newspapers that my staff couldn't give them all to me. There were literally dozens over a very short period of time—'Thief takes off with aunt's ashes' and 'Mother's horror as husband slain in home'. We need to do something about this.


I've said publicly, and I'll say it again, it is not a magic bullet. There is no way that we can address every single issue simply with this change in policy, but it will make a difference, because it has been shown to make a difference in the two trial sites. It quarantines 80 per cent of a person's welfare payment onto the card. As we've said, the remaining 20 per cent is available for cash. It is a debit card like every other debit card.


I notice that the member for Grey, Rowan Ramsay, spoke about the challenges when the power goes out. I've got to tell you that it's the same challenge for every other card. Regardless of which card you have in your wallet, if the machine won't work, none of them will work. This is quite simply something which people use regularly and, in fact, if you're under the age of 35 I would suggest that nearly everything goes onto your debit card—very, very few of them carry cash.


The Minister for Human Services at the time, Alan Tudge, announced Hinkler as the next trial site on 21 September. It was announced in the budget for those two new locations, and the proposal for my electorate is different. After extensive community consultation, what's been determined is quite simply that, if you are 35 years or under and you're on a payment—which is Newstart, youth allowance, jobseeker, parenting payment single or parenting payment partnered—you will be included in this rollout. That is substantial. In the Hinkler electorate, that is 6,711 individuals at the time that we put the data together. I recognise that is a lot, but we do need to do something about this, because here are the numbers. It's very straightforward. In my electorate, of those people who are under 30 and are on welfare today, 90 per cent had a parent who was also on welfare during the past 15 years, the majority of whom were on welfare for at least nine of those 15 years. The second one—and this is the most disturbing—is that it is projected that, without intervention, 57 per cent of those under 30 and on welfare will still be on income support in 10 years time.


We are failing a generation of children. We are failing them. Quite simply, this is something we can address, and we can do it with the cashless card, along with a lot of other measures. I've spoken about what we need to do for unemployment—how we drive infrastructure, how we continue to drive the economy. And along with the investment there'll be an additional $1 million for community services. That's on top of the already 70 federally funded services across the region, which includes drug and alcohol services, financial capability, employment, and family and children's programs. Earlier this year a further $½ million was dedicated to drug and alcohol programs. Surely we need to start to address the cause. We've got very bad statistics. We've got a very low demographic. In fact, the Local Government Association of Australia just put out its State of the regions report and the area of Wide Bay, the statistical region that includes my electorate and of course part of Wide Bay, Mr O'Brien's, indicated that this region has the lowest per capita income of anywhere in the country, at some $34,000—as it has had for some 20 years.


So we need to address that. We need to ensure that there are jobs. But we also need to ensure that people are actually using their money on the requirements for life. I don't think any taxpayer would be offended that people are restricted in purchasing take-away alcohol, by not using the money provided by the taxpayer for the purchase of illicit substances or to pour down the throat of a pokie machine to the tune of $10 million a month in the region. I don't think that is unreasonable in any circumstance.


Regarding the community consultation, my office originally did some mail-outs, up until the announcement. We contacted 32,000 constituents to get an indication of their views. That's a substantial portion of an electorate of just over 100,000 voters—32,000, in the form of a direct mail-out. We phone polled about 500 people. We sent an additional 5,500 direct emails, and we had many calls both in and out of the office. To date the feedback we've received shows 75 per cent in favour of the cashless debit card being introduced, 23 per cent against and two per cent undecided. That was just from the initial consultation to determine whether there was support in the community for us to look at this very, very difficult policy—and it is a difficult policy—in terms of the rollout of the cashless card.


Minister Tudge put in a letter to the editor of the NewsMail, the local paper, on 12 October 2017 about the consultation that was conducted on top of that by the Department of Social Services. They are very professional people. This is the Public Service. It's what they do. They've already been involved in the trial rollouts in other areas. They understand where the difficulties are, and all of those have been addressed. We conducted 182 consultations across Hinkler. That is not 182 individuals; that is 182 meetings with groups and with some individuals who have difficulty working in a group, across the board with those frontline service providers. Importantly, 55 of those consultations were local service providers, those on the front line, with disadvantaged families. We consulted with over 70 community members through direct correspondence or meetings. We held two broad community information sessions, another 26 consultations with local church groups, 25 with local government and three meetings with the state government. We also consulted with the relevant peak bodies.


That was just at that date in October. They continue to work, they continue to push forward, talking to people who are affected and ensuring that this will be functional, that it will roll out correctly with as little difficulty as absolutely possible, because this is about one thing: ensuring better outcomes for our community—and not just the individuals but the children who are affected.


What shocked me was what's come out of this community consultation. I thought, 'Okay, perhaps it'll be an age demographic—those on Newstart.' But what came back, particularly from those frontline service providers, was that we must include parenting payment, because the people who are being affected the most are children. We've had the former local Labor state member come out and absolutely decry it: 'We don't have a problem.' Schools run breakfast clubs. In fact, they run so many breakfast clubs that the state Labor government had to put another $2 million into it—more money for these difficult issues.


If we want to talk about those people in the community who don't have a dog in this fight—and let's call it what it is—this is a difficult challenge for the idealists. This is about a practical outcome. One of those is a gentleman called Brian Courtice. Mr Courtice is the former federal Labor member for Hinkler, a very well known former member of the Labor Party, and he is 100 per cent supportive. I ask the rhetorical question: why is he so supportive? Because he knows what is happening to kids in our community. I can tell you that he is so supportive. He has written letters. He has spoken publicly. He has done media. He's been on TV and radio and all of those things because he is concerned about his community and exactly what is going on and he thinks this will help, and I agree with him. Now, I'm just the local member. I've worked there and I've lived there, but I don't deal with it on a day-to-day basis like our frontline community services. I'll be taking their advice, and their advice is that this will make a real difference.


I know that the member for Grey spoke about the Orima report, and I'm not going to buy into too much of that; I'll leave that as stated. But what we do know is that we have support from those people who are not idealists. I spoke about the gambling issue previously and about the amount of money that has been spent. I would like to make special mention of Deputy Mayor George Seymour in Hervey Bay. I know George. I get on with George quite well. He is an intelligent, passionate man who's concerned about his community. But on the one hand he is complaining about the amount of money we are pouring down the gullet of poker machines, and on the other hand he is not supportive of the cashless debit card. This is one way to make a real difference. If we are not here to do that, what is our role? We are local members, first and foremost, to represent our community and their interests and the difficulties that they continue to have. My community, I have to say, needs the support.


I say to the Labor Party: you don't need to believe me. You can believe our local newspapers. You can believe the former federal Labor member for Hinkler, Brian Courtice. You can believe all of those people in the community who are willing to put their names on a piece of paper, to stand up, to be involved, to be in the community reference group and to do media—and they have been absolutely pilloried. People on social media have been basically giving them a very hard time, with all the threats. I know every member of parliament gets threats. We all do; that is just part of the territory. But these are people who have basically been out serving our community for years, and they are telling me, the department and the minister that this is a way that we can address a real challenge in our community. So I would say to the Labor Party once again: please reconsider, because it is not your community which is being affected.; it is ours, and they are absolutely supportive.


I agree there are people out there who are idealistically opposed, and that is their right. This is a democratic country. They are entitled to protest and they are entitled to start their protest groups. But the overwhelming majority of the support in the community is for the cashless card—more than 70 per cent. In fact, I've never seen a policy of government, on either side, supported as strongly as this. It has been quite incredible. I get stopped on the street. I get pulled up by people who say: 'Please do not give up on this. It is something that we need to do.' I see them out there every single day. We take phone calls in my office constantly, from people saying: 'We've got to do this. It is necessary.'


Once again, can I just implore those opposite: please reconsider. We've spoken about the Senate inquiry. Their results were clear. They support the rollout of the cashless card in the additional areas. It is funded. It is in the budget. It is ready to go. There is an opportunity here to make a difference in a community which needs the help. We have an unemployment rate of around nine per cent and a youth unemployment rate of around 23 per cent. In fact, the adjusted unemployment rate, the one used by the Local Government Association—if you remove those on a disability pension, for example—is over 16 per cent, the worst in the country. I say to all of those who may be listening to this broadcast, and with absolute humility: we do need the help. This is one way we can do it.


I once again implore those opposite: please support this legislation. I know there are those in your group who are idealistically opposed, and they are entitled to that view, but listen to my communities, the people of Bundaberg, the people of Hervey Bay and the people of Hinkler, please. I support this bill wholeheartedly, and we need to have it passed. Thank you.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (18:44):  I rise in this place today to tell the Turnbull government quite simply that the community in Herbert will not support the cashless debit card in our electorate. In fact, the people in Herbert would much prefer to have funds funnelled into prevention and early intervention strategies.


I have worked for 15 years in the community sector and dealt with many people with drug and alcohol problems and with people who are very vulnerable, and it has become incredibly clear to me that punishing people at the end of a very dreadfully complex and hard life journey is not the answer. The answer is in early intervention and prevention. The other interesting thing that I've learnt over those years is that unless people are invested in their own behavioural change nothing changes. To think that we can simply put a cashless card in someone's hand and they will change their behaviour and do what we want them to do is absolute nonsense.


However, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017 does provide a framework for additional cashless debit card locations. But it does not enable the rollout of the card in any specific location without consultation with the people in communities who are most affected. All trials of the card would still require a legislative instrument to be tabled in parliament, and, as I have said, changes in behaviour do not come about through punishment. These instruments are disallowable, which means that the rollout of the card can be agreed to or opposed in specific locations and not others, taking into account the views and/or wishes of the community involved. This is an important point because it means that the potential passage of this bill will not automatically mean that the card can be just rolled out in Hervey Bay, for example. This can still be disallowed through a disallowable instrument in the Senate.


Labor will not support this card being rolled out without proper and due consultation with the communities involved. To have proper consultation before we implement such an expensive so-called solution, it is absolutely imperative that we have a decent evaluation so that we are aware of what we are aiming to achieve and whether it will actually work. It is unfair and completely ill informed to suggest that all people are the same and that success in one trial will deliver a one-size-fits-all solution to all communities. As is evident in my community, rolling out this card is a big decision for any community and for this parliament. It simply cannot be rushed without the express permission and consultation of the individual communities affected. It is also disappointing that the minister has not allowed the time for greater scrutiny and deliberation on this bill before bringing it on for debate today. Labor want to see the findings of the Senate inquiry before determining our final position and, whilst we know that there have been recommendations by the Senate, one of those recommendations was very clearly that there has not been proper and due process in evaluation.


Labor also wants time to conduct consultations with local community leaders in the newly proposed sites of Kalgoorlie, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. The government have not said when they will introduce the particular disallowable instruments that will enable the card to be put in place in these locations. Therefore, Labor reserves the right to support or oppose specific locations on a case-by-case basis. The Turnbull government is hell bent on targeting the most vulnerable citizens. The implementation of the card is an assumption that all those who are 35 years of age and under and receiving Newstart, youth allowance, jobseeker payments, parenting payment single or parenting payment partnered are using their money inappropriately. I ask the members of the Turnbull government: how would each of you feel if you were to be labelled an alcoholic? How would the members of this government feel about being automatically labelled a gambler? How would they feel about being labelled a drug addict? I assume that they would not be very impressed. Essentially, this is what the cashless debit card is doing to those who are already struggling to survive.


I represent the electorate of Herbert, which also includes the remote community of Palm Island. Palm Island is a small community of over 3,500 people. The island has an unemployment rate of over 29 per cent and an underemployment rate of 20 per cent. According to the 2016 census, 24.1 per cent of households on Palm Island had a weekly household income of less than $650. The census also showed that, of people aged 15 years and over on Palm Island, 74.9 per cent did unpaid domestic work in the week before the census.


Palm Island is a developing community and a hidden gem in North Queensland. Given that Palm Island doesn't have a big economy, people look at the debit card as a way back, certainly not a way forward. The Palm Island council and the residents of Palm Island want job creation. They want economic development opportunities. These are what they see as greater priorities for the island, and I have to say I agree.


Townsville has an unemployment rate of around 9.1 per cent and a youth unemployment rate around 20 per cent. To date we have seen no investment in our region by the Turnbull government, and after two years we are still waiting for a NAIF announcement. Palm Island, Townsville and the entirety of northern Australia need investment—investment in infrastructure projects, tourism and education—which will not only kick-start our economies but create employment with a number of new industries, hence reducing welfare payments because people will be employed.


Labor's position on the cashless welfare card trial has always been to support trial areas where the community has a desire to try something new to address the drug and alcohol abuse problems. I am always open to considering genuine efforts to assist and support people in my community who are struggling with drug dependency to access appropriate treatment. I don't believe that income support is best utilised to support a drug habit. However, vulnerable people's lives are very, very complex. There is no easy solution, and I can assure you punishment is not a solution. As community representatives, we must remember that we are talking about people's lives. There are entrenched social issues that cannot and will not be solved by income management alone. We must address the core issue—that is, establishing the flow-on of drug and alcohol abuse to occur. Issues such as children attending school, having a roof over your head, being able to afford to pay your bills and buy food and having access to health care would be a very good start.


The vast majority of income support recipients are more than capable of managing their own finances. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights conducted a review of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, which noted that the cashless debit card engages and limits three human rights: the right to social security, the right to a private life and the right to equality and nondiscrimination. By reducing a person's choice in how and where they access and spend their social security payments, the cashless debit card program limits the right to a private life.


Labor have said we will never support a blanket approach to income management. We will not support a trial where the community insists it does not want it. By talking with individual communities, we will make decisions on a location-by-location basis. That means that we will get regional solutions that suit regional communities.


Since introducing the legislation, the government has announced that the Goldfields in Western Australia will be a trial site, along with areas currently being trialled in the East Kimberley and in Ceduna, South Australia. Labor's consultations with the communities in the East Kimberley and Ceduna showed that the communities wanted the trial, and therefore Labor supported these trials being established. We also support an extension of these trials to ensure that adequate evaluation can take place. However, since the trials, there have been some community leaders in Kununurra shifting their support away from the cards because community solutions are crucial. This shift must be acknowledged by the government and taken into consideration. The government must act in favour of the communities' wants and needs. Labor will continue to consult with individual communities to ensure their requests are met, whilst addressing social hardships and challenges.


The Turnbull government released the evaluation of the trials on 1 September. The evaluation showed mixed results. There have been serious concerns regarding Kununurra and Ceduna particularly. If you look at the report, 78 per cent of people said there had been little to no change and some people said they were worse off. The Senate inquiry committee heard from the people of Kununurra, who stated that the card isn't working. Police reported increased levels of violence, and the NGOs in the town are reported as saying that kids were going hungry. You can't just put a card in place without anything else and expect conditions and behaviour to change, particularly when our first nations people within that area stated that they weren't asked about the card, they weren't consulted and they weren't asked for their opinion regarding solutions to address these complex issues.


Trials also require solid and robust evaluation. I have received numerous emails and messages from members of my community who are against the implementation of the cashless welfare card in Townsville. There is a grave fear of the invasion of privacy and that the cashless welfare card is a bandaid attempt at dealing with a more complex social matter. The people in my community would prefer the funding of this card to be implemented in other areas. I have mentioned the fact that early intervention and prevention is where we will make significant behavioural changes, coupled with education.


Townsville, for example, is on level 3 water restrictions and is in desperate need of water infrastructure investment. Federal Labor has pledged $100 million towards securing a long-term solution to Townsville's water needs, as well as $200 million towards developing hydro-electricity at the Burdekin Falls Dam. These are only two suggestions for where the money could be better spent in my region, where jobs could be created for people who are trying to survive on welfare. It is no mean feat to try and live your life, raise a family, pay your rent, put food on the table and get your kids educated on welfare.


If the government is looking for further suggestions as to how the money could be spent to address some of the prevention and early intervention strategies that have been raised in my community, I have a list as long as my arm and I would be very happy to pass it on.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2018-02-05,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah) (18:56):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, because, when an adult's right to unconditional welfare denies a child his or her right to sustenance, we have a problem. I don't think anyone who has looked at the situation in large parts of remote Australia and some parts of metropolitan Australia could possibly deny that we have a problem.


The purpose of this legislation is to extend and expand some trials which have been going on now for a couple of years. This is a legacy of the Abbott government, and I'm pleased that the Turnbull government wants to extend and expand the trials that my government began. I should, in speaking to this legislation, commend the former Minister for Human Services, Alan Tudge, who has certainly been the principal architect within government of these trials.


We do have a problem of welfare money being spent not on the essentials of life but on alcohol, drugs and gambling. We all know that there are many parts of Australia where, very regrettably, the booze, the drugs and the gambling are contributing to an epidemic of family dysfunction. For instance, in the Kimberley, which I'm reasonably familiar with from two trips to Kununurra over the last couple of years, the suicide rate is almost double the WA Indigenous average. In some parts of the Kimberley, domestic assault rates are 20 times the West Australian state average. This card is colour blind, although so far it has operated predominantly in Indigenous communities. I should say that, around the country, Indigenous women are 34 times more likely to be hospitalised from assault than non-Indigenous women, and almost 90 per cent of partner violence among Indigenous people is alcohol related. Even though in the Kimberley many Indigenous people don't drink at all, because they have seen the ravages of alcohol, per capita alcohol consumption is almost double the national average.


So there is a problem, and I doubt that anyone in this chamber, regardless of his or her ideological preconceptions, could possibly deny that there is a problem. And it is reasonable for this parliament to say that, particularly in places where local people want this cashless debit card, we should put it in place so that we can be absolutely sure that the vast majority of welfare spending is for the necessities of life. It's not for alcohol, it's not for drugs and it's not for gambling. It's for rent, it's for food, it's for clothing, it's for education, it's for health and it's for transport. And, let's face it, if you are a welfare dependent person, wouldn't you need 80 per cent plus of your welfare income to spend on the necessities of life? It's true that a single person on Newstart only gets $650 a fortnight, but a single parent with four children in private rental gets almost $2,150 a fortnight. The problem is that in too many cases not enough of this money is being spent where it should be spent. 


The cashless debit card has a long history. You might remember that my government commissioned Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest to do a comprehensive report on ending Indigenous disadvantage. One of the principal recommendations of that report was the introduction of this cashless debit card. But, as members opposite were keen to stress, the government accepted that this should only be introduced where local leaders believed it was necessary for their communities. I want to congratulation the Indigenous leaders of Ceduna in South Australia and Kununurra in East Kimberley in Western Australia for their courage in saying that this cashless debit card would help their communities. 


I've heard a suggestion opposite that the cashless card is somehow punishing people. That is dead wrong. The cashless debit card is an acceptance by the relevant community leaders that there is a problem. I'm not saying that everyone is an alcoholic, a gambler or an addict. I'm just saying that in this community there is a problem of people spending money suboptimally—sometimes through poor choices, sometimes perhaps because of a poor local culture—and that this is necessary in order to do the right thing by the most vulnerable people in those communities. There is no proposal from this government—not then, not now—to extend the card beyond communities where it is wanted. Down the track perhaps it might be good to extend it further, but that is not contemplated by this legislation. It is absolutely required by this legislation that it can only go where communities want it, and even under this legislation new trials will be subject to disallowance by this parliament. 


So, Twiggy Forrest made the recommendation and the trials got under way in Kununurra and Ceduna. I saw Kununurra when the trial had been in place for just a couple of months. I was told by local police, local health workers, local community workers and local community leaders that the trial had made a very, very positive difference. In August last year back in Kununurra, when the trial had been place for 15 months, that message was repeated and reinforced. I perfectly accept that some members opposite might have had complaints from some individuals, but I have been there. I have spoken to people on the ground. I have spoken to welfare recipients. I have spoken to those who deal with the social problems that misuse of alcohol, drugs et cetera creates, and there is a near-universal view amongst the people on the ground that these trials must continue. In order for even the existing trials to continue, this legislation must pass, because if this legislation doesn't pass the existing trials will automatically terminate by law in the middle of this year. So it is essential for the continuation of the existing trials, let alone for new trials, for this legislation to pass.


While there was a fair bit of gratuitous abuse of the government from the member for Herbert, it was encouraging to hear her concession that Labor had not yet finalised its position. May I say that this is the kind of legislation, the kind of issue, where we should put our ideology to one side and ask ourselves what we can do as a parliament in practice to solve problems. Let's forget about whether we are pro free market or pro big government. Whether we believe that people are victims who need government help or they are responsible citizens who need to stand on their own two feet, let's put all that stuff aside for a moment and be practical. The most practical thing we can do in this parliament right now is to pass this legislation so that the existing trials can continue and even be expanded in the months ahead.


Yes, there have been some problems with the technology, but as we all know technology is improving all the time. I can't go to the petrol station with a government fuel card and buy anything other than fuel. It ought to be possible for technology to be further stroked and refined so that with the cashless debit card you can go to any store in Australia that takes a debit card and not be able to get out cash and not be able to buy alcohol or anything that is illegal or harmful. The technology will come good. It's better than it was and it will get better still, but the trial has to continue. It has to have the potential to be expanded. I should point out for the benefit of members opposite that none of this is about cutting spending. It's not about slashing welfare. It's simply about ensuring that existing welfare payments, existing Commonwealth spending, are as effective as possible, and that should be something that unites every single member in this House.


This is important legislation. It's carefully targeted legislation. It addresses a real problem that everyone here would say does need to be addressed, so I really do hope that members opposite will give this particular piece of legislation the careful and generous consideration, in the spirit of goodwill, that it deserves. We cannot have rivers of cash, particularly rivers of taxpayers' cash, turning into rivers of grog in some of the most difficult, marginalised and vulnerable communities of our country. This is no panacea. Yes, there are all sorts of other problems that won't be addressed by this legislation, but it will make a difference. On its own it won't get the kids to school. On its own it won't get the adults to work. But on its own it will help to make communities more safe, and that is a big step in the right direction to a better life for some of the most vulnerable people in our society.


One of the things that please me most about this particular legislation is that the next two communities in line for the cashless debit card are much less predominantly Indigenous than the first two. Yes, there is a significant Indigenous issue in Kalgoorlie, but in Hervey Bay and Bundaberg the Indigenous welfare population is by no means the largest component of the group that would be impacted by this card. If you are someone doing the right thing by your family, you have nothing to fear and much to gain from this card. If you are failing to do the right thing by your family, this card will help you to be a better person and to do the right thing by the people who need you. I commend the bill to the House.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (19:10):  I too rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. I will return in a minute to some of the comments made by the previous speakers from the government side, particularly the members for Warringah, Hinkler and Grey. But, just to put this in context, this is talking about expanding and continuing a trial of a cashless debit card, which is basically a card that, if you're on welfare, quarantines 80 per cent of the payments for government approved appropriate purchases such as rent, food, transportation and education, while 20 per cent of your welfare payments are able to be used as cash and for other things, whatever they might be.


The trials have taken place in Ceduna in South Australia, an area represented by the member for Grey, Rowan Ramsey, and also in the Kimberley. I particularly draw people interested in this topic to the comments by the member for Grey, a government representative who has seen the trial rolled out on the ground. I haven't heard from the member for Durack about the trial in her area, but I look forward to responses from those that have experienced it. Obviously the member for Hinkler has not had the trial rolled out in his area of Bundaberg and Hervey Bay, but he has talked about community reaction to it. The Goldfields will be the later trials. That would effectively be at the whim of the government by a delegated instrument rather than necessarily consulting with the community.


I note that, of those opposite, the member for Warringah in particular was very proud of this policy being rolled out when he was Prime Minister—obviously not something that particularly affects the area of Warringah. It has had significant impacts on the Indigenous groups in Ceduna in the member for Grey's area and also in the Kimberley. I guess it's a bit of a philosophical argument as well as a practical solution. I certainly remember the member for Warringah talking about some of these areas and talking about living in remote parts of the Kimberley or even some of the APY Lands in South Australia as being a 'lifestyle choice' rather than a reflection of 65,000 years of connection with a particular part of Australia. The member for Warringah talked about the benefits that come from this.


I think there is a bit of an attempt to set up a false dichotomy here—that without the cashless debit card there can be no focus on how people are caring for their children. That is totally wrong. Anyone who's had any dealings with the department of child safety or even the police, for that matter, knows that any parent who is not providing their children with the necessities of life can be questioned under the Criminal Code, the Child Protection Act in Queensland and similar legislation in every other state or territory.


We have to understand what this is about. It may be motivated by the best intentions for the children; however, I would suggest that this legislation needs extra scrutiny, because it's going to significantly affect Australians. I think the member for Hinkler talked about how his electorate office was contacted by people—not like in a postal survey about marriage equality or anything like that, but just people picking up the phone.


I understand that there are community leaders in Ceduna, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, the Goldfields and the Kimberley who indicate this should be trialled. We need to make sure that the community consultation is thorough, rather than rushed, because, without proper consultation and proper scrutiny, we will not necessarily achieve the best in any community. I think the member for Herbert touched on this from her experience of working with community groups. It's that concept of 'nothing about us without us'. Communities need to own the policy and how it will be rolled out, because it needs drivers. That's the curse of central government: of Canberra directing how 24.5 million Australians work. In this circumstance you need to make sure the local community understands it, owns it and has some responsibility for it.


Labor insisted that this bill be referred to a Senate committee to allow for proper scrutiny of the significant changes that this bill proposes, because it is a significant infringement—taking away the rights and dignity people have. We can dress it up and say, 'It's just another card in your wallet,' but it's much more than that, as we heard from the witnesses that gave evidence in that Senate inquiry. We need to have proper processes and proper scrutiny. This shouldn't be rushed, because, as I said, we need to balance taking away people's rights.


The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee tabled their report on this bill on 6 December last year. Committee members from the Labor Party and the Greens tabled dissenting reports where they criticised the bill. The government announced in their 2017 budget that it would roll out the cashless debit card in two further locations from 1 September last year. The proposed locations were the Goldfields in WA and the Bundaberg-Hervey Bay region in Queensland. They are communities that do not have the same percentage of Indigenous Australians as the first two trial sites. 


The bill does provides the framework for additional locations but doesn't specifically enable the rollout in those locations. The government would need to take a legislative instrument into parliament for further rollout. Legislative instruments are, of course, disallowable, so for any particular location there will be an opportunity for the parliament to support or oppose the rollout. That is an important point, but the government has not yet said when those disallowable instruments will be tabled in parliament. 


Labor believes that there should not be any new trial sites introduced. Labor will seek to move an amendment in the Senate to that effect. Labor would only consider the introduction of the new trial site if the Liberals can demonstrate that they have an agreed, formal consultation process with the community and an agreed definition of 'consent'. They must also have established a comprehensive evidence base through a robust evaluation process. 


Labor knows the damage that drug and alcohol abuse and gambling can do to individuals and communities. We know that this is a problem that needs to be tackled as a community, by a community. The Australian Drug Foundation has given some alarming statistics. By the age of 12 a child will have seen more than 1,300 alcohol ads on television. Parents are the most likely source of alcohol for 12- to 17-year-olds. Eight out of every 10 Australians over the age of 14 drink alcohol. One in 10 workers say they have experienced the negative effects of a co-worker's misuse of alcohol. One in five Australians over the age of 14 drinks at levels that puts them at risk of alcohol-related harm over their lifetime. Australians aged over 70 years are the most likely group to drink alcohol on a daily basis. Alcohol and other drugs cost Australian workplaces $6 billion per year in lost productivity. Illicit drug use is most common among people aged 20 to 40 years. The report Alcohol's burden of disease in Australia, released four years ago, found that alcohol causes 15 deaths and hospitalises 430 Australians every day, and the number of deaths in Australia caused by alcohol had increased 62 per cent in the 10 years prior to 2014. These are worrying statistics, particularly for those of us who have young children.


We need to tackle this problem. As the member for Herbert said, we need to tackle it with our communities. What works in the Kimberley won't necessarily work in Moreton. We know that income management alone will not solve entrenched social issues. Governments need to provide additional support for any communities participating in these trials. We supported the first cashless debit trials in the East Kimberley and Ceduna. I visited Ceduna during the trials and have met and spoken with some of the Indigenous Australians there over the years. Also, when my partner was a lawyer working with the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, she dealt with some of the members of that community. I'm reasonably familiar with the Ceduna community and I know about the rollout there, and I refer to the comments made by the member for Grey. 


When I was on the Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs, I went to Ceduna as part of their inquiry. We heard from the officer in charge of Ceduna police station that boredom contributes to young people drinking, particularly in the sporting off-season or when parents are absent due to their own drinking. We certainly saw some of that in our visit to that community. We also heard about the dangers of humbugging. We know that income management was introduced into the Northern Territory in 2007 to minimise humbugging, to ensure that the funds intended for children's welfare were used for that purpose. The Australian Crime Commission, in their submission to the inquiry, said: 


There is evidence to suggest that drinkers on income management are able to maintain high levels of consumption through the Indigenous domestic moral economy (demand sharing) and the substantial outflow and largesse from their drinking cohorts who are employed.


One of the inquiry's 23 recommendations was:


That all strategies developed or funded by the Commonwealth or other governments are developed in partnership with the relevant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and/or their organisations.


'Nothing about us without us.' 


Labor supported the cashless debit card being rolled out in Ceduna because we consulted with community leaders and we secured additional funding for the wraparound services that are so essential. As so many speakers have mentioned, this is not a silver bullet. You need the wraparound services if the changes are to have any chance of success, particularly when it comes to drug and alcohol counselling services and increased mental health support services. I note that a memorandum of understanding was signed with the Ceduna region community leaders so that they owned the process. 


Sadly, the evidence to the Senate committee inquiry into this bill was that people from the Goldfields and Bundaberg—the sites proposed for the new trials—felt disempowered by the consultation process and that it was not representative of their community. The state member for Bundaberg at the time, Leanne Donaldson, said the consultation process had been 'selective and secretive'. There was criticism to the Senate committee about consultation with the Indigenous community. A member of the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Aboriginal community said:


They weren't really consulted … Every time there is something happening and they want to consult Aboriginal people, they haven't got an Aboriginal person there to explain in simple terms what's going on. 


Sadly, whilst we are supportive of the outcomes, we can't support the bill in its current form. At best, the evaluations conducted by Orima are inconclusive. Those evaluations were heavily criticised by academics in the field of social science. The current trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley have not been running long enough to provide sufficient conclusions about their success. Labor's own consultations with these communities have resulted in mixed feedback, with some community groups advocating support and others very critical of the impact on the community. Labor supports the current trials in Ceduna and East Kimberley continuing to the middle of 2019 so that conclusions can be drawn with confidence from the success or failure of the trials and what works best. Obviously the cashless debit card is not the only answer, as three previous speakers from the other side have said. It is also true to say that in some communities it is not the answer at all. Labor does not believe in a national rollout of the cashless debit card. Many communities are driving their own initiatives to tackle drug and alcohol abuse, and I particularly I mention my home town of St George, which has been dealing head-on with an ice problem. Labor wholeheartedly supports these local initiatives—local solutions, local empowerment. 


Labor does understand that some communities want assistance to address chronic alcohol and drug related abuse, and it is important that we listen to those communities about what their needs are and how they think those needs should be addressed by them. We do not take the patronising view that all recipients of welfare are incapable of managing their personal finances. We know that the vast majority of welfare recipients are more than capable of controlling and managing their own finances. They are good citizens, doing the right thing by their families and communities. It is important we recognise that. It is also crucial that the wraparound services are provided for these communities where the trials are occurring. Labor calls on those opposite to support Labor's amendment for funding these critical wraparound services. Fairness is something that runs through Labor's veins—fairness for all Australians, whether they are millionaires or whether they receive welfare.

Mr MORTON
 (Tangney) (19:25):  Mr Deputy Speaker Hastie, like you, I am in our parliament to do everything I can to make lives better. I am in this place to empower people to take control of their lives and for the government, if need be, to co-invest in people's futures, to help aspirational Australians reach their full potential. This is my absolute focus when we consider social policy and our welfare system, and it is my focus when we consider the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. 


Sadly, the lazy application of cashless welfare in some cases is making lives worse, not better. Even in my own family, I have seen how drugs and welfare can mix and the detrimental impact that welfare as easy cash can have on families, particularly children. The cashless debit card is changing lives for the better. The strongly independent evaluation results of the trial tell us just how big the positive impact is. We know that the card is not a silver bullet, and we acknowledge that, but it is an important tool in the fight against alcohol and drug abuse and the violence and crime that comes with that. 


This bill removes the current limitations on the cashless debit card to three discrete locations and no more than 10,000 people who are able to access the card, and it deletes the 30 June 2018 end date of the current program. Removing these limitations will support the extension of the cashless debit card in East Kimberley and Ceduna and enable the expansion of the card to further sites, including the Goldfields in Western Australia and Hinkler in Queensland. The trial of the cashless debit card in East Kimberley and Ceduna has been effective in reducing alcohol consumption, illegal drug use and gambling: 25 per cent of participants and 13 per cent of family members reported drinking alcohol less frequently; 32 per cent of participants and 15 per cent of family members reported gambling less; 24 per cent reported using illegal drugs less often; and 31 per cent reported being able to look after their children better and being able to save more money. 


I don't just speak in this place as someone who has read reports. I think it is important as parliamentarians that we look firsthand at the issues that we are trying to solve. I visited Kununurra and Wyndham to see the trial of the cashless debit card. It was so important for my understanding to learn from community leaders and locals how the card was making their lives even better. I met with many people in Kununurra and Wyndham who supported the card, and I met with those who didn't. The number of pick-ups made by the Kununurra community patrol was almost 20 per cent lower last year compared to the year before. Admissions to the Wyndham sobering-up unit were 49 per cent lower than before the trial. Ambulance alcohol-related call-outs were down by 30 per cent, and sales at the Wyndham bottle shop had dropped by 40 per cent. It was really interesting that some sales were up. When I visited the supermarket, I asked what they were selling more of or less of. They reported that, as a result of the drop in the economy overall, sales were down, but there was one particular product that was still being sold in Wyndham at the same level, and that was baby products. The sales of baby products remained constant when other products in that same store were dropping as a result of the economic downturn. 


I met with community leaders, who helped me get to the nuts and bolts of this policy. I sat with mums at the Wyndham Early Learning Activity Centre. I met with the chamber of commerce and a number of health and cultural organisations. When meeting with the police in Kununurra, I heard about the issues which they have to deal with day and night, but I was so pleased to hear that alcohol-fuelled call-outs were down. I spent a 12-hour overnight shift with the volunteers of the St John's Ambulance in Kununurra, who were out from 6 pm to 6 am. In Kununurra, the ambulance service is provided by volunteers, and in each and every one of the call-outs—which I can't go into detail about with you today—alcohol played a significant part. Alcohol played a part in the sickness and injuries of every visit we made. It played a part also in the haze of the information we received on some of the calls. Those volunteers don't have a full brief on the situation they're heading into because the information from the person dialling triple 0 is sketchy and inaccurate due to the influence of alcohol and drugs. Attendance with police protection is the norm, and ongoing conflict on— (Time expired)

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2018-02-05,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey—Government Whip) (17:59):  I'm very proud to stand in this chamber as the member representing the first community in Australia that had the gumption to attack one of the great social evils within its midst—in particular, excessive alcohol consumption. That community is Ceduna and the surrounding communities of Yalata, Oak Valley, Koonibba and a number of homeland communities around Ceduna. Ceduna isn't an Indigenous town as such—about 20 per cent of the population is Indigenous—and problem drinking is not just an Indigenous issue. That's why I was so proud of the community, with the charge led by their mayor, Allan Suter, and a number of Indigenous representatives who walked the mile with us and saw the introduction of the cashless welfare card in Ceduna. 


I was very pleased with the interim report on the trial, which came down a little over 12 months ago, but was particularly pleased with the final report. The trial has been extended. I thank members opposite for their support of that extension, but I am incredibly mystified by their intention to try to deny the current legislation. 


Let me tell you how good the cashless welfare card has been in Ceduna. It is extremely popular with the broader population, but also, from my interactions, with the majority of those who are on welfare, because the welfare card is so designed that it really won't impact on your lifestyle at all if you are managing your life well. If you are taking the payments that the Commonwealth gives you to care for yourself and your family in a correct manner, it will not have an impact. Increasingly in this world, as we all know, in the supermarket and in almost any shop you can just wave the card and it debits the account. One of the problems with the BasicsCard is that it came with a level of shame. The BasicsCard looks different—the blue card. When people that hold a BasicsCard go into a supermarket, everyone can see that they are on the blue card. But a cashless welfare card looks just like everybody else's debit card, so there is no shame. That's a great move forward. 


So it is that I come to some of the key evaluations in the final report. In the first six months great improvements were made, with a reduction in alcohol and illegal drug use and gambling. After the wave 2 data, the second evaluation, we found that those reductions were not only sustained but also broadened, with a larger proportion of cashless debit card participants reporting reduced levels of those behaviours. I will start with one, being the reduction in gambling. For those people in the Australian community who gamble responsibly, it's a good thing—it is no problem if you manage it correctly. For those who have less disposable income to lose on gambling machines, there can be very harmful results for their families. If you are on a welfare payment, you must remember that that payment is for you to look after yourself and your primary responsibility—your family. 


The intake of poker machines was shown to have dropped by 12 per cent. That does not sound like a big reduction, but the figures from the South Australian government survey actually cover another four communities besides Ceduna in the cashless welfare area. Those figures, which include Cummins, Lock, Streaky Bay and Elliston, where there are poker machine outlets, are likely to be much, much higher—I would suggest around a 50 per cent reduction, but certainly 40 per cent. That is considerable. The shops in the region have reported increased turnovers. In the case of Oak Valley, a remote Indigenous community some 300 kilometres out, there was one food truck every two weeks. Now there's a food truck every week. What a wonderful outcome for the people living in that community!


In the wave 1 examination, we found that 25 per cent reported they were drinking less frequently. In wave 2, that went to 41 per cent. In wave 2, people were asked how often they have more than six drinks on one occasion. Thirty-seven per cent more people said they are drinking less drinks than previously. Thirty-eight per cent of participants who reported drinking alcohol stated that they drank alcohol weekly or more often, which was a substantial reduction from the 63 per cent that were measured in wave 1, which we had considered to be a reduction on what existed prior to the welfare card. This is having an incredible impact.


Let me tell you a story, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was out in Ceduna—I visit it frequently—visiting the drying out centre about three or four years ago. They have a drying out centre there with 12 beds. I was talking to the staff—it was all quiet during the day—and I said, 'What was it like last night?' It was full. I asked, 'What was it like?' There were two couples. The men were bad enough. The women were far worse. That was the nursing staff's assessment. One lady was eight months pregnant, and she could not stop throwing up. Now, we know what damage fetal alcohol syndrome is causing in these communities. How can we stand in this place and deny a path that has shown it has effective results?


If this were a positive education type of touchy-feely thing that was working to the extent that these figures we are given tell us, it would be acclaimed not just in Australia but worldwide as an incredible breakthrough. That's why I'm so mystified, now that the Labor Party has walked away from what I thought was a very good mutual understanding that we would go softly, softly, consult with communities and build trust. It's worth pointing out that, when the 20 per cent designated figure was arrived at in Ceduna, we reached that by negotiation with the Ceduna community. It was suggested at one stage that 15 per cent of their income should be delivered in cash. They insisted on 20 per cent. The minister at the time, Minister Tudge, agreed to the 20 per cent. They had their fingers on this reform. I said to them at the time, 'You've got the chance, really, to set the parameters for the rest of Australia to address itself to.' And it has so happened. After that time Kununurra, of course, came on.


For so many things, across so many indicators, there have been great outcomes. In fact, it's really hard to find the flaw in the process. It comes back to this basic tenet that, if you're managing your income well and you're doing the right thing with your income, it won't affect you. As I said, 48 per cent of people are gambling less and 48 per cent of people are taking fewer drugs. I remember speaking to the mayor on one occasion. There was a little protest group and I said, 'Who's that over there?' He was a little dismissive but he said, 'I'll tell you who doesn't like this program. It's the drug dealers.' What a worry! The drug dealers don't like the cashless debit card, because, I can tell you, they don't carry around the little card reader. They're not interested in plastic sales. They're only interested in cash. So it is of great benefit. I've had approaches from a few people in the area who feel as though it's an infringement on their civil rights. One gentleman said that he can no longer buy meat from local farmers that has been killed on-farm. That's actually an illegal activity anyway, just quietly. People shouldn't be supplying meat to anyone from local farms, and certainly not for cash. If you're doing the right thing, it will not infringe.


As I have said before, I'm so proud of this community. They've really stuck their necks out. I said to them along the way: 'I believe you're forging a path for Australia. You are showing what may well become the way that welfare will be delivered right across the country because if it works in Ceduna, why on earth wouldn't it work in Port Augusta? And if it works in Port Augusta, why wouldn't it work in Adelaide? And if it works in Adelaide, why wouldn't it work in Sydney?' But it isn't as if the government has made a decision to do that. What it's doing is trialling this process around Australia. We've already got two communities participating that have a high Indigenous mix in their social profile, although Kununurra's Indigenous mix in their social profile is a little higher than Ceduna's. We also have Kalgoorlie, which is a bit of a step up, although its profile is a little less Indigenous, and Bundaberg is less so again. That's why it's so important to get this program into these areas and start knocking the barnacles off it. That's why it's been so good in Ceduna. When issues have come up in Ceduna, we've been able to address them quite quickly and then alter the template for what we might do in another place. I remember being contacted by an op shop. They said, 'We don't have a proper connection to be able to get the plastic card to work.' We managed to fix that quite quickly. These are the little teething issues.


I think there are some myths out there. I've been told anecdotally that a number of families and individuals have shifted from Ceduna to Port Augusta, around 500 kilometres away, to get away from the cashless welfare card. That's an absolute furphy, because you can't get away from it. If you are listed in a community at the time the cashless welfare card is implemented, you cannot just change your address and leave those requirements behind. And that cashless welfare card will work the same all over Australia. Sure, there are more things to be done with it. We will have to use more finesse in working on this card, which is why it's so important it now goes into larger communities with different social make-ups.


I fully support the card. I'm the member who has had to stick his neck out over this card. Let me tell you how popular it is: people from all over my electorate come up to me and say, 'You're on the right track.' We believe that people need to manage the income allocated to them from the taxpayer in a correct and proper manner; that they use it for their good health, their benefit and especially for the benefit of their families; that they manage those families correctly; that they get their kids to school, they get shoes on those kids' feet and they feed them correctly. It's hard to do that if you're feeding a drug habit, it's hard to do that if you're feeding money into poker machines and it's hard to do that if you're drunk all the time. This measure directly addresses those issues. Sure it comes with some challenges for some people, but they are the exact people who need our help. To shy away and turn our backs on them is a retrograde step. We need to step up to the plate.


I make the point that the progression to the cashless debit card in Ceduna came about as a result of the coroner's findings that six deaths in and around Indigenous communities in Ceduna happened basically because of overindulgence in alcohol. People were killed on the road; people died in unsheltered places. The report is a harrowing read, quite frankly. The community decided collectively that they had to do something about it. They had to stand up and be counted, which is why, as I said, I'm so proud of them. I strongly commend this bill, and I hope that those on the other side of this parliament will consider their stance and reconsider supporting the bill. Thank you.

"Burney, Linda, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Ms BURNEY
 (Barton) (18:14):  I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. The matter of the cashless debit card is a complex one. Labor has consulted many communities and many key stakeholders from around the country. We've received a wide diversity of opinions from both communities and individuals within those communities. We have heard from some communities and individuals who strongly oppose the cashless debit card. We heard from some communities and some individuals who strongly support it. Labor understands that there are areas where there is a community desire to try something new to address drug and alcohol abuse, poverty and the implications of those things, but we also understand that not all communities want this. We understand that there are certain aspects of this measure which are arbitrary and unnecessary.


The member for Grey should support Labor's amendments because he has himself admitted that there are barnacles on this scheme that need knocking off. He said in his speech just a moment ago that there needs to be more finesse. He has actually admitted there are problems with the way in which this scheme is being implemented. He mentioned St Vincent de Paul. One of the things that Labor heard very much in relation to this card was the inability for it to be used at markets and in thrift shops. We've also heard that, when there was a power outage in one of these communities, it meant that people could not use this card for over a week.


But the other thing that really has convinced Labor to take the position that we are taking is that it is a blanket approach, and there is no way for people to come off that card if they are put onto it. There is no pathway. The evaluation that has been done in relation to this particular measure was one of the most flawed evaluations and pieces of work that I have read for a very long time. In fact, it admitted that the very purpose for which this card was set up—and that was to cut back and reduce violence—has not been achieved in the communities where it has been trialled.


This legislation stems from the 2017 budget, when the government proposed establishing trials of the cashless debit card in a further two locations from 1 September 2017. This bill proposes to allow the government to do this by repealing section 124PF of the Social Security (Administration) Act, which provides a number of limitations on the government's cashless debit card trials. Currently, the section has three relevant functions: first, for the existing trial to end on 30 June 2018; second, to limit the trial to three discrete trial areas; and, third, for the trial areas to encompass no more than 10,000 participants in total. These limitations mean that the government can establish one further trial site and all trials will end on 30 June this year. It will be up to the parliament to authorise additional trials above and beyond those prescribed under this section. Since the introduction of the existing trials, the government proposed establishing additional trial sites in the Goldfields of Western Australia and Bundaberg in Queensland.


Of course, Labor referred this bill to a Senate inquiry, appropriately, to allow for more comprehensive assessment of the efficacy of this bill. In particular, the Senate inquiry heard from communities in both existing trial sites, as well as in the proposed additional trial sites in Western Australia and Queensland. The Senate inquiry made a number of concerning findings. First, there was insufficient consultation with these communities; in particular, there was no clear framework or process to establish whether there was community desire for trials to be established in the relevant trial sites. That is very concerning, and it seemed to me to be one of the most fundamental points. Second, and just as concerning, was the finding that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the trials were effective. Third, the inquiry heard that the Orima evaluations of the trial, which I have just referred to and which the government has sought to rely on, were unreliable and were not based on any empirical methods of evaluation. As I said, it was a very poor evaluation and found that the card made no difference to the levels of violence in those communities. Labor is also concerned that the existing trials in Ceduna and Kalgoorlie have not been running long enough for substantive conclusions to be made.


It is clear that we require more rigorous and comprehensive information regarding the card's efficacy. Labor does not believe in a blanket approach to income management, and we do not support a national rollout of the cashless debit card. We know that the vast majority of income support recipients are more than capable of managing their own finances. We know that the vast majority of income support recipients require support on a temporary basis until such time as they are able to regain basic financial security. Labor supports community-driven approaches to tackling deep-seated social issues which perpetuate the cycle of poverty and violence. We believe in continued contact and consultation with communities with chronic unemployment in relation to income management and on whether the card is an appropriate measure for these communities.


We understand that some, not all, communities are simply so desperate to break the chronic cycle of unemployment and poverty and all that that means that they are open to trying measures such as the cashless debit card. To that end, Labor will support the use of the card where a community decides that this measure is what they wish to implement. From our discussions with local communities in Ceduna and East Kimberley, it seems as if some members of those communities wish for those trials to be extended. Labor will move to amend the bill to extend the end date of the trials to 30 June 2019 so that a proper and comprehensive evaluation can take place. Labor will not support the rollout of the card anywhere or at any time without important limitations.


The Liberals seek a blank cheque on this measure, and we are not prepared to provide that blank cheque. We do not believe in the vague and insufficiently credible evidence to justify the pursuit of these trials. The evidence and the evaluation that the government has sought to rely on for further trials is inconclusive at best, and there is some concern about the way in which those conclusions in that evaluation were arrived at. There simply is not credible evidence to support the establishment of further trials. We will not support the establishment of further trials in the Bundaberg or Goldfields regions or any further trials. However, as I've said, we are willing to move an amendment to existing trial sites so that there can be proper evaluation.


Labor understands that the complexity of chronic unemployment, poverty and entrenched social issues cannot and will not simply be solved by income management alone. With the many years that I have worked in the social services area, the human services area and the Indigenous area, I find that this is somehow being viewed by some members opposite as some sort of magic bullet. A cashless debit card is not a magic bullet to solve the many, many years of history of chronic and complex problems that exist in these communities. To paint it as such is nothing short of a scandal.


Labor will propose a number of amendments to this bill and to the use of this measure. As I have said previously, Labor will propose to amend the bill to ensure that the existing trial sites in Ceduna and East Kimberley be given the opportunity to extend their trials to 30 June 2019 to allow a comprehensive and proper evaluation. Labor will also propose an amendment to ensure that no new trial sites can be established, by proposing to reduce the provision from three trial sites to the existing two. This is a really important discussion. It is not up to people that will never be affected to make decisions on behalf of these communities. It is not up to the local council and it is not up to individual members of parliament—those people will not be put on income management. It is up to those people that will be affected by these measures to have a proper say. It is not clear how the decisions have been arrived at in relation to the Goldfields and Bundaberg, and that is unacceptable. We are questioning whether or not there has, in fact, been proper consultation and discussion with those who will be affected in those two proposed trial sites.


Labor will only consider the introduction of a new trial site if the Liberal government can show that they have an agreed, formal consultation process with the community as well as an agreed definition of 'consent'. How on earth can you apply these measures to thousands of people without those two things? Labor understands that the holistic, community-driven approach is the best way to address chronic poverty and unemployment, so Labor will propose the guarantee of funding for wraparound services in the trial sites formally within the legislation. This goes to my point that this is not a magic bullet.


Ensuring basic welfare for all Australians, broader than the social safety net in itself, is an important thing to understand. We do not believe that the Turnbull government can be trusted when it comes to income support. That has been seen in the way the Social Services portfolio has been managed. That includes things like the proposed introduction of drug testing, 22 million calls being unanswered in Centrelink and, of course, the robo-debt debacle.


I will conclude by saying this: the government proposes the cashless debit card not because it is genuinely interested in lifting up our most vulnerable citizens but because it seeks to perpetrate an inaccurate and unfair narrative: that our most vulnerable Australians cannot be trusted with their own spending needs. I urge the government to reflect on going out and supporting these new trial sites. I urge the government, and the members of the crossbench in particular, to give serious consideration to the amendments that Labor proposes for this bill. We are not for one moment saying that there aren't chronic problems. We aren't for one moment saying that there doesn't need to be government intervention in a very meaningful way in many of these communities. We know that employment is important to changing the life choices and chances for many people who are currently welfare dependent, but the thought that a cashless debit card is some sort of magic bullet that is going to fix all those social ills is absolutely a nonsense.


We have thought about this very deeply. We have consulted wisely. We have considered very, very carefully the position Labor is taking on this. It is not a position that we have come to quickly, and it is not a position that we have come to in some sort of a kneejerk reaction. It is a position that we have come to through proper consultation and discussion, as I have said, with the people currently on the cashless debit card or, as the government is proposing, in the communities of those additional trial sites. We're simply saying to the government: 'Look at these amendments. Consider them carefully. Let's make sure that any measures that are going to be addressing the deep-seated issues in those communities are measures that are going to work and that have the wrap-around services that make sure income management can be done in a way that gives people pride, options and choice.' None of those things exist in this current legislation. Labor is simply saying to the members of the government and the crossbench, 'Give serious consideration to these amendments.' It has been the result of a Senate inquiry. I oppose the bill as it currently stands.

Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (18:29):  Firstly, can I just say that I have great disappointment in the loss of the Labor Party's bipartisan support on this very important program, one which is clearly difficult to implement. It is a tough policy. I've admitted that publicly many times. I've also said on many occasions that it is not a magic bullet but it is a tool that we have in the toolbox. It is a policy which we can implement, and it's one which will make a great difference.


Can I say to the member for Barton: you missed one of the critical recommendations of the Senate inquiry, and that is the overall recommendation that the legislation should be supported. That was the outcome from the Senate inquiry.


It's not a blanket approach, and I'm going to talk specifically about my electorate, the electorate of Hinkler. It is not just the city of Bundaberg. It is the city of Bundaberg and Hervey Bay; it is the outlying areas such as Bargara, Childers, Woodgate and Booyal; and it is all of those smaller communities such as Toogoom and Burrum Heads. It does cover a very broad range. The consultation has been extensive, and I will talk about that in detail as we continue. It has extensive community support, and I'll talk about exactly how we managed to ascertain that early on before we worked forward with the Department of Social Services.


In terms of ways off the card, if you're on Newstart there's a very clear one: you can go to work. If you are employed, clearly you will not be on the card; you do not need Newstart. It is targeted specifically at those in my electorate who are aged 35 or under and are on particular payments, which we'll discuss a little bit later on. I say to those people in the Bundaberg area: we are continuing with the rollout. I'm disappointed that Labor is not supporting the recommendations for something which quite clearly works.


In terms of our community, I can only tell you that I was born there. It's part of my community. My family is there, I grew up there and my kids go to school there. I've had businesses there. I know extensively the difficulties we have, and I've got to tell you they've gotten worse. They've not gotten better; they have gotten worse. We need to do something which will make some changes, and the amendments proposed in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017 will do that.


You don't have to believe me, as I'm sure the Labor Party won't. I can show you some absolute demonstrations from my local community, including the local press. The first one is an article in the Fraser Coast Chronicle by Blake Antrobus—this was last year—saying that $5 million a month is lost on pokies, just in the Fraser Coast. That is without Bundaberg. That's almost another $5 million, so some $10 million every single month for 12 months.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  Order! I remind the member not to use props in the House.




Mr PITT:
  Of course. I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will use it for reference only. This is just one front page: $10 million lost in pokies—$10 million. The second one was in the Bundaberg NewsMail: 'Ice rife in Bundy homes; Bundaberg the worst for parental drug abuse'. And then there's '$30K inheritance blown on drugs'. On the other side of the coin, on another front page, was a gentleman who was looking for 30 people to come and work at his scallop-shucking business—positions he just can't fill. So we have challenges on both sides of the coin: we have employment available that people simply won't do, and we have real challenges around drugs and alcohol. This is one way forward. It is a policy which is on the table that has been demonstrated to work. I can go on and on and on here. We have dozens and dozens. In fact, there were so many in the local newspapers that my staff couldn't give them all to me. There were literally dozens over a very short period of time—'Thief takes off with aunt's ashes' and 'Mother's horror as husband slain in home'. We need to do something about this.


I've said publicly, and I'll say it again, it is not a magic bullet. There is no way that we can address every single issue simply with this change in policy, but it will make a difference, because it has been shown to make a difference in the two trial sites. It quarantines 80 per cent of a person's welfare payment onto the card. As we've said, the remaining 20 per cent is available for cash. It is a debit card like every other debit card.


I notice that the member for Grey, Rowan Ramsay, spoke about the challenges when the power goes out. I've got to tell you that it's the same challenge for every other card. Regardless of which card you have in your wallet, if the machine won't work, none of them will work. This is quite simply something which people use regularly and, in fact, if you're under the age of 35 I would suggest that nearly everything goes onto your debit card—very, very few of them carry cash.


The Minister for Human Services at the time, Alan Tudge, announced Hinkler as the next trial site on 21 September. It was announced in the budget for those two new locations, and the proposal for my electorate is different. After extensive community consultation, what's been determined is quite simply that, if you are 35 years or under and you're on a payment—which is Newstart, youth allowance, jobseeker, parenting payment single or parenting payment partnered—you will be included in this rollout. That is substantial. In the Hinkler electorate, that is 6,711 individuals at the time that we put the data together. I recognise that is a lot, but we do need to do something about this, because here are the numbers. It's very straightforward. In my electorate, of those people who are under 30 and are on welfare today, 90 per cent had a parent who was also on welfare during the past 15 years, the majority of whom were on welfare for at least nine of those 15 years. The second one—and this is the most disturbing—is that it is projected that, without intervention, 57 per cent of those under 30 and on welfare will still be on income support in 10 years time.


We are failing a generation of children. We are failing them. Quite simply, this is something we can address, and we can do it with the cashless card, along with a lot of other measures. I've spoken about what we need to do for unemployment—how we drive infrastructure, how we continue to drive the economy. And along with the investment there'll be an additional $1 million for community services. That's on top of the already 70 federally funded services across the region, which includes drug and alcohol services, financial capability, employment, and family and children's programs. Earlier this year a further $½ million was dedicated to drug and alcohol programs. Surely we need to start to address the cause. We've got very bad statistics. We've got a very low demographic. In fact, the Local Government Association of Australia just put out its State of the regions report and the area of Wide Bay, the statistical region that includes my electorate and of course part of Wide Bay, Mr O'Brien's, indicated that this region has the lowest per capita income of anywhere in the country, at some $34,000—as it has had for some 20 years.


So we need to address that. We need to ensure that there are jobs. But we also need to ensure that people are actually using their money on the requirements for life. I don't think any taxpayer would be offended that people are restricted in purchasing take-away alcohol, by not using the money provided by the taxpayer for the purchase of illicit substances or to pour down the throat of a pokie machine to the tune of $10 million a month in the region. I don't think that is unreasonable in any circumstance.


Regarding the community consultation, my office originally did some mail-outs, up until the announcement. We contacted 32,000 constituents to get an indication of their views. That's a substantial portion of an electorate of just over 100,000 voters—32,000, in the form of a direct mail-out. We phone polled about 500 people. We sent an additional 5,500 direct emails, and we had many calls both in and out of the office. To date the feedback we've received shows 75 per cent in favour of the cashless debit card being introduced, 23 per cent against and two per cent undecided. That was just from the initial consultation to determine whether there was support in the community for us to look at this very, very difficult policy—and it is a difficult policy—in terms of the rollout of the cashless card.


Minister Tudge put in a letter to the editor of the NewsMail, the local paper, on 12 October 2017 about the consultation that was conducted on top of that by the Department of Social Services. They are very professional people. This is the Public Service. It's what they do. They've already been involved in the trial rollouts in other areas. They understand where the difficulties are, and all of those have been addressed. We conducted 182 consultations across Hinkler. That is not 182 individuals; that is 182 meetings with groups and with some individuals who have difficulty working in a group, across the board with those frontline service providers. Importantly, 55 of those consultations were local service providers, those on the front line, with disadvantaged families. We consulted with over 70 community members through direct correspondence or meetings. We held two broad community information sessions, another 26 consultations with local church groups, 25 with local government and three meetings with the state government. We also consulted with the relevant peak bodies.


That was just at that date in October. They continue to work, they continue to push forward, talking to people who are affected and ensuring that this will be functional, that it will roll out correctly with as little difficulty as absolutely possible, because this is about one thing: ensuring better outcomes for our community—and not just the individuals but the children who are affected.


What shocked me was what's come out of this community consultation. I thought, 'Okay, perhaps it'll be an age demographic—those on Newstart.' But what came back, particularly from those frontline service providers, was that we must include parenting payment, because the people who are being affected the most are children. We've had the former local Labor state member come out and absolutely decry it: 'We don't have a problem.' Schools run breakfast clubs. In fact, they run so many breakfast clubs that the state Labor government had to put another $2 million into it—more money for these difficult issues.


If we want to talk about those people in the community who don't have a dog in this fight—and let's call it what it is—this is a difficult challenge for the idealists. This is about a practical outcome. One of those is a gentleman called Brian Courtice. Mr Courtice is the former federal Labor member for Hinkler, a very well known former member of the Labor Party, and he is 100 per cent supportive. I ask the rhetorical question: why is he so supportive? Because he knows what is happening to kids in our community. I can tell you that he is so supportive. He has written letters. He has spoken publicly. He has done media. He's been on TV and radio and all of those things because he is concerned about his community and exactly what is going on and he thinks this will help, and I agree with him. Now, I'm just the local member. I've worked there and I've lived there, but I don't deal with it on a day-to-day basis like our frontline community services. I'll be taking their advice, and their advice is that this will make a real difference.


I know that the member for Grey spoke about the Orima report, and I'm not going to buy into too much of that; I'll leave that as stated. But what we do know is that we have support from those people who are not idealists. I spoke about the gambling issue previously and about the amount of money that has been spent. I would like to make special mention of Deputy Mayor George Seymour in Hervey Bay. I know George. I get on with George quite well. He is an intelligent, passionate man who's concerned about his community. But on the one hand he is complaining about the amount of money we are pouring down the gullet of poker machines, and on the other hand he is not supportive of the cashless debit card. This is one way to make a real difference. If we are not here to do that, what is our role? We are local members, first and foremost, to represent our community and their interests and the difficulties that they continue to have. My community, I have to say, needs the support.


I say to the Labor Party: you don't need to believe me. You can believe our local newspapers. You can believe the former federal Labor member for Hinkler, Brian Courtice. You can believe all of those people in the community who are willing to put their names on a piece of paper, to stand up, to be involved, to be in the community reference group and to do media—and they have been absolutely pilloried. People on social media have been basically giving them a very hard time, with all the threats. I know every member of parliament gets threats. We all do; that is just part of the territory. But these are people who have basically been out serving our community for years, and they are telling me, the department and the minister that this is a way that we can address a real challenge in our community. So I would say to the Labor Party once again: please reconsider, because it is not your community which is being affected.; it is ours, and they are absolutely supportive.


I agree there are people out there who are idealistically opposed, and that is their right. This is a democratic country. They are entitled to protest and they are entitled to start their protest groups. But the overwhelming majority of the support in the community is for the cashless card—more than 70 per cent. In fact, I've never seen a policy of government, on either side, supported as strongly as this. It has been quite incredible. I get stopped on the street. I get pulled up by people who say: 'Please do not give up on this. It is something that we need to do.' I see them out there every single day. We take phone calls in my office constantly, from people saying: 'We've got to do this. It is necessary.'


Once again, can I just implore those opposite: please reconsider. We've spoken about the Senate inquiry. Their results were clear. They support the rollout of the cashless card in the additional areas. It is funded. It is in the budget. It is ready to go. There is an opportunity here to make a difference in a community which needs the help. We have an unemployment rate of around nine per cent and a youth unemployment rate of around 23 per cent. In fact, the adjusted unemployment rate, the one used by the Local Government Association—if you remove those on a disability pension, for example—is over 16 per cent, the worst in the country. I say to all of those who may be listening to this broadcast, and with absolute humility: we do need the help. This is one way we can do it.


I once again implore those opposite: please support this legislation. I know there are those in your group who are idealistically opposed, and they are entitled to that view, but listen to my communities, the people of Bundaberg, the people of Hervey Bay and the people of Hinkler, please. I support this bill wholeheartedly, and we need to have it passed. Thank you.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (18:44):  I rise in this place today to tell the Turnbull government quite simply that the community in Herbert will not support the cashless debit card in our electorate. In fact, the people in Herbert would much prefer to have funds funnelled into prevention and early intervention strategies.


I have worked for 15 years in the community sector and dealt with many people with drug and alcohol problems and with people who are very vulnerable, and it has become incredibly clear to me that punishing people at the end of a very dreadfully complex and hard life journey is not the answer. The answer is in early intervention and prevention. The other interesting thing that I've learnt over those years is that unless people are invested in their own behavioural change nothing changes. To think that we can simply put a cashless card in someone's hand and they will change their behaviour and do what we want them to do is absolute nonsense.


However, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017 does provide a framework for additional cashless debit card locations. But it does not enable the rollout of the card in any specific location without consultation with the people in communities who are most affected. All trials of the card would still require a legislative instrument to be tabled in parliament, and, as I have said, changes in behaviour do not come about through punishment. These instruments are disallowable, which means that the rollout of the card can be agreed to or opposed in specific locations and not others, taking into account the views and/or wishes of the community involved. This is an important point because it means that the potential passage of this bill will not automatically mean that the card can be just rolled out in Hervey Bay, for example. This can still be disallowed through a disallowable instrument in the Senate.


Labor will not support this card being rolled out without proper and due consultation with the communities involved. To have proper consultation before we implement such an expensive so-called solution, it is absolutely imperative that we have a decent evaluation so that we are aware of what we are aiming to achieve and whether it will actually work. It is unfair and completely ill informed to suggest that all people are the same and that success in one trial will deliver a one-size-fits-all solution to all communities. As is evident in my community, rolling out this card is a big decision for any community and for this parliament. It simply cannot be rushed without the express permission and consultation of the individual communities affected. It is also disappointing that the minister has not allowed the time for greater scrutiny and deliberation on this bill before bringing it on for debate today. Labor want to see the findings of the Senate inquiry before determining our final position and, whilst we know that there have been recommendations by the Senate, one of those recommendations was very clearly that there has not been proper and due process in evaluation.


Labor also wants time to conduct consultations with local community leaders in the newly proposed sites of Kalgoorlie, Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. The government have not said when they will introduce the particular disallowable instruments that will enable the card to be put in place in these locations. Therefore, Labor reserves the right to support or oppose specific locations on a case-by-case basis. The Turnbull government is hell bent on targeting the most vulnerable citizens. The implementation of the card is an assumption that all those who are 35 years of age and under and receiving Newstart, youth allowance, jobseeker payments, parenting payment single or parenting payment partnered are using their money inappropriately. I ask the members of the Turnbull government: how would each of you feel if you were to be labelled an alcoholic? How would the members of this government feel about being automatically labelled a gambler? How would they feel about being labelled a drug addict? I assume that they would not be very impressed. Essentially, this is what the cashless debit card is doing to those who are already struggling to survive.


I represent the electorate of Herbert, which also includes the remote community of Palm Island. Palm Island is a small community of over 3,500 people. The island has an unemployment rate of over 29 per cent and an underemployment rate of 20 per cent. According to the 2016 census, 24.1 per cent of households on Palm Island had a weekly household income of less than $650. The census also showed that, of people aged 15 years and over on Palm Island, 74.9 per cent did unpaid domestic work in the week before the census.


Palm Island is a developing community and a hidden gem in North Queensland. Given that Palm Island doesn't have a big economy, people look at the debit card as a way back, certainly not a way forward. The Palm Island council and the residents of Palm Island want job creation. They want economic development opportunities. These are what they see as greater priorities for the island, and I have to say I agree.


Townsville has an unemployment rate of around 9.1 per cent and a youth unemployment rate around 20 per cent. To date we have seen no investment in our region by the Turnbull government, and after two years we are still waiting for a NAIF announcement. Palm Island, Townsville and the entirety of northern Australia need investment—investment in infrastructure projects, tourism and education—which will not only kick-start our economies but create employment with a number of new industries, hence reducing welfare payments because people will be employed.


Labor's position on the cashless welfare card trial has always been to support trial areas where the community has a desire to try something new to address the drug and alcohol abuse problems. I am always open to considering genuine efforts to assist and support people in my community who are struggling with drug dependency to access appropriate treatment. I don't believe that income support is best utilised to support a drug habit. However, vulnerable people's lives are very, very complex. There is no easy solution, and I can assure you punishment is not a solution. As community representatives, we must remember that we are talking about people's lives. There are entrenched social issues that cannot and will not be solved by income management alone. We must address the core issue—that is, establishing the flow-on of drug and alcohol abuse to occur. Issues such as children attending school, having a roof over your head, being able to afford to pay your bills and buy food and having access to health care would be a very good start.


The vast majority of income support recipients are more than capable of managing their own finances. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights conducted a review of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, which noted that the cashless debit card engages and limits three human rights: the right to social security, the right to a private life and the right to equality and nondiscrimination. By reducing a person's choice in how and where they access and spend their social security payments, the cashless debit card program limits the right to a private life.


Labor have said we will never support a blanket approach to income management. We will not support a trial where the community insists it does not want it. By talking with individual communities, we will make decisions on a location-by-location basis. That means that we will get regional solutions that suit regional communities.


Since introducing the legislation, the government has announced that the Goldfields in Western Australia will be a trial site, along with areas currently being trialled in the East Kimberley and in Ceduna, South Australia. Labor's consultations with the communities in the East Kimberley and Ceduna showed that the communities wanted the trial, and therefore Labor supported these trials being established. We also support an extension of these trials to ensure that adequate evaluation can take place. However, since the trials, there have been some community leaders in Kununurra shifting their support away from the cards because community solutions are crucial. This shift must be acknowledged by the government and taken into consideration. The government must act in favour of the communities' wants and needs. Labor will continue to consult with individual communities to ensure their requests are met, whilst addressing social hardships and challenges.


The Turnbull government released the evaluation of the trials on 1 September. The evaluation showed mixed results. There have been serious concerns regarding Kununurra and Ceduna particularly. If you look at the report, 78 per cent of people said there had been little to no change and some people said they were worse off. The Senate inquiry committee heard from the people of Kununurra, who stated that the card isn't working. Police reported increased levels of violence, and the NGOs in the town are reported as saying that kids were going hungry. You can't just put a card in place without anything else and expect conditions and behaviour to change, particularly when our first nations people within that area stated that they weren't asked about the card, they weren't consulted and they weren't asked for their opinion regarding solutions to address these complex issues.


Trials also require solid and robust evaluation. I have received numerous emails and messages from members of my community who are against the implementation of the cashless welfare card in Townsville. There is a grave fear of the invasion of privacy and that the cashless welfare card is a bandaid attempt at dealing with a more complex social matter. The people in my community would prefer the funding of this card to be implemented in other areas. I have mentioned the fact that early intervention and prevention is where we will make significant behavioural changes, coupled with education.


Townsville, for example, is on level 3 water restrictions and is in desperate need of water infrastructure investment. Federal Labor has pledged $100 million towards securing a long-term solution to Townsville's water needs, as well as $200 million towards developing hydro-electricity at the Burdekin Falls Dam. These are only two suggestions for where the money could be better spent in my region, where jobs could be created for people who are trying to survive on welfare. It is no mean feat to try and live your life, raise a family, pay your rent, put food on the table and get your kids educated on welfare.


If the government is looking for further suggestions as to how the money could be spent to address some of the prevention and early intervention strategies that have been raised in my community, I have a list as long as my arm and I would be very happy to pass it on.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2018-02-05,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah) (18:56):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017, because, when an adult's right to unconditional welfare denies a child his or her right to sustenance, we have a problem. I don't think anyone who has looked at the situation in large parts of remote Australia and some parts of metropolitan Australia could possibly deny that we have a problem.


The purpose of this legislation is to extend and expand some trials which have been going on now for a couple of years. This is a legacy of the Abbott government, and I'm pleased that the Turnbull government wants to extend and expand the trials that my government began. I should, in speaking to this legislation, commend the former Minister for Human Services, Alan Tudge, who has certainly been the principal architect within government of these trials.


We do have a problem of welfare money being spent not on the essentials of life but on alcohol, drugs and gambling. We all know that there are many parts of Australia where, very regrettably, the booze, the drugs and the gambling are contributing to an epidemic of family dysfunction. For instance, in the Kimberley, which I'm reasonably familiar with from two trips to Kununurra over the last couple of years, the suicide rate is almost double the WA Indigenous average. In some parts of the Kimberley, domestic assault rates are 20 times the West Australian state average. This card is colour blind, although so far it has operated predominantly in Indigenous communities. I should say that, around the country, Indigenous women are 34 times more likely to be hospitalised from assault than non-Indigenous women, and almost 90 per cent of partner violence among Indigenous people is alcohol related. Even though in the Kimberley many Indigenous people don't drink at all, because they have seen the ravages of alcohol, per capita alcohol consumption is almost double the national average.


So there is a problem, and I doubt that anyone in this chamber, regardless of his or her ideological preconceptions, could possibly deny that there is a problem. And it is reasonable for this parliament to say that, particularly in places where local people want this cashless debit card, we should put it in place so that we can be absolutely sure that the vast majority of welfare spending is for the necessities of life. It's not for alcohol, it's not for drugs and it's not for gambling. It's for rent, it's for food, it's for clothing, it's for education, it's for health and it's for transport. And, let's face it, if you are a welfare dependent person, wouldn't you need 80 per cent plus of your welfare income to spend on the necessities of life? It's true that a single person on Newstart only gets $650 a fortnight, but a single parent with four children in private rental gets almost $2,150 a fortnight. The problem is that in too many cases not enough of this money is being spent where it should be spent. 


The cashless debit card has a long history. You might remember that my government commissioned Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest to do a comprehensive report on ending Indigenous disadvantage. One of the principal recommendations of that report was the introduction of this cashless debit card. But, as members opposite were keen to stress, the government accepted that this should only be introduced where local leaders believed it was necessary for their communities. I want to congratulation the Indigenous leaders of Ceduna in South Australia and Kununurra in East Kimberley in Western Australia for their courage in saying that this cashless debit card would help their communities. 


I've heard a suggestion opposite that the cashless card is somehow punishing people. That is dead wrong. The cashless debit card is an acceptance by the relevant community leaders that there is a problem. I'm not saying that everyone is an alcoholic, a gambler or an addict. I'm just saying that in this community there is a problem of people spending money suboptimally—sometimes through poor choices, sometimes perhaps because of a poor local culture—and that this is necessary in order to do the right thing by the most vulnerable people in those communities. There is no proposal from this government—not then, not now—to extend the card beyond communities where it is wanted. Down the track perhaps it might be good to extend it further, but that is not contemplated by this legislation. It is absolutely required by this legislation that it can only go where communities want it, and even under this legislation new trials will be subject to disallowance by this parliament. 


So, Twiggy Forrest made the recommendation and the trials got under way in Kununurra and Ceduna. I saw Kununurra when the trial had been in place for just a couple of months. I was told by local police, local health workers, local community workers and local community leaders that the trial had made a very, very positive difference. In August last year back in Kununurra, when the trial had been place for 15 months, that message was repeated and reinforced. I perfectly accept that some members opposite might have had complaints from some individuals, but I have been there. I have spoken to people on the ground. I have spoken to welfare recipients. I have spoken to those who deal with the social problems that misuse of alcohol, drugs et cetera creates, and there is a near-universal view amongst the people on the ground that these trials must continue. In order for even the existing trials to continue, this legislation must pass, because if this legislation doesn't pass the existing trials will automatically terminate by law in the middle of this year. So it is essential for the continuation of the existing trials, let alone for new trials, for this legislation to pass.


While there was a fair bit of gratuitous abuse of the government from the member for Herbert, it was encouraging to hear her concession that Labor had not yet finalised its position. May I say that this is the kind of legislation, the kind of issue, where we should put our ideology to one side and ask ourselves what we can do as a parliament in practice to solve problems. Let's forget about whether we are pro free market or pro big government. Whether we believe that people are victims who need government help or they are responsible citizens who need to stand on their own two feet, let's put all that stuff aside for a moment and be practical. The most practical thing we can do in this parliament right now is to pass this legislation so that the existing trials can continue and even be expanded in the months ahead.


Yes, there have been some problems with the technology, but as we all know technology is improving all the time. I can't go to the petrol station with a government fuel card and buy anything other than fuel. It ought to be possible for technology to be further stroked and refined so that with the cashless debit card you can go to any store in Australia that takes a debit card and not be able to get out cash and not be able to buy alcohol or anything that is illegal or harmful. The technology will come good. It's better than it was and it will get better still, but the trial has to continue. It has to have the potential to be expanded. I should point out for the benefit of members opposite that none of this is about cutting spending. It's not about slashing welfare. It's simply about ensuring that existing welfare payments, existing Commonwealth spending, are as effective as possible, and that should be something that unites every single member in this House.


This is important legislation. It's carefully targeted legislation. It addresses a real problem that everyone here would say does need to be addressed, so I really do hope that members opposite will give this particular piece of legislation the careful and generous consideration, in the spirit of goodwill, that it deserves. We cannot have rivers of cash, particularly rivers of taxpayers' cash, turning into rivers of grog in some of the most difficult, marginalised and vulnerable communities of our country. This is no panacea. Yes, there are all sorts of other problems that won't be addressed by this legislation, but it will make a difference. On its own it won't get the kids to school. On its own it won't get the adults to work. But on its own it will help to make communities more safe, and that is a big step in the right direction to a better life for some of the most vulnerable people in our society.


One of the things that please me most about this particular legislation is that the next two communities in line for the cashless debit card are much less predominantly Indigenous than the first two. Yes, there is a significant Indigenous issue in Kalgoorlie, but in Hervey Bay and Bundaberg the Indigenous welfare population is by no means the largest component of the group that would be impacted by this card. If you are someone doing the right thing by your family, you have nothing to fear and much to gain from this card. If you are failing to do the right thing by your family, this card will help you to be a better person and to do the right thing by the people who need you. I commend the bill to the House.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (19:10):  I too rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. I will return in a minute to some of the comments made by the previous speakers from the government side, particularly the members for Warringah, Hinkler and Grey. But, just to put this in context, this is talking about expanding and continuing a trial of a cashless debit card, which is basically a card that, if you're on welfare, quarantines 80 per cent of the payments for government approved appropriate purchases such as rent, food, transportation and education, while 20 per cent of your welfare payments are able to be used as cash and for other things, whatever they might be.


The trials have taken place in Ceduna in South Australia, an area represented by the member for Grey, Rowan Ramsey, and also in the Kimberley. I particularly draw people interested in this topic to the comments by the member for Grey, a government representative who has seen the trial rolled out on the ground. I haven't heard from the member for Durack about the trial in her area, but I look forward to responses from those that have experienced it. Obviously the member for Hinkler has not had the trial rolled out in his area of Bundaberg and Hervey Bay, but he has talked about community reaction to it. The Goldfields will be the later trials. That would effectively be at the whim of the government by a delegated instrument rather than necessarily consulting with the community.


I note that, of those opposite, the member for Warringah in particular was very proud of this policy being rolled out when he was Prime Minister—obviously not something that particularly affects the area of Warringah. It has had significant impacts on the Indigenous groups in Ceduna in the member for Grey's area and also in the Kimberley. I guess it's a bit of a philosophical argument as well as a practical solution. I certainly remember the member for Warringah talking about some of these areas and talking about living in remote parts of the Kimberley or even some of the APY Lands in South Australia as being a 'lifestyle choice' rather than a reflection of 65,000 years of connection with a particular part of Australia. The member for Warringah talked about the benefits that come from this.


I think there is a bit of an attempt to set up a false dichotomy here—that without the cashless debit card there can be no focus on how people are caring for their children. That is totally wrong. Anyone who's had any dealings with the department of child safety or even the police, for that matter, knows that any parent who is not providing their children with the necessities of life can be questioned under the Criminal Code, the Child Protection Act in Queensland and similar legislation in every other state or territory.


We have to understand what this is about. It may be motivated by the best intentions for the children; however, I would suggest that this legislation needs extra scrutiny, because it's going to significantly affect Australians. I think the member for Hinkler talked about how his electorate office was contacted by people—not like in a postal survey about marriage equality or anything like that, but just people picking up the phone.


I understand that there are community leaders in Ceduna, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, the Goldfields and the Kimberley who indicate this should be trialled. We need to make sure that the community consultation is thorough, rather than rushed, because, without proper consultation and proper scrutiny, we will not necessarily achieve the best in any community. I think the member for Herbert touched on this from her experience of working with community groups. It's that concept of 'nothing about us without us'. Communities need to own the policy and how it will be rolled out, because it needs drivers. That's the curse of central government: of Canberra directing how 24.5 million Australians work. In this circumstance you need to make sure the local community understands it, owns it and has some responsibility for it.


Labor insisted that this bill be referred to a Senate committee to allow for proper scrutiny of the significant changes that this bill proposes, because it is a significant infringement—taking away the rights and dignity people have. We can dress it up and say, 'It's just another card in your wallet,' but it's much more than that, as we heard from the witnesses that gave evidence in that Senate inquiry. We need to have proper processes and proper scrutiny. This shouldn't be rushed, because, as I said, we need to balance taking away people's rights.


The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee tabled their report on this bill on 6 December last year. Committee members from the Labor Party and the Greens tabled dissenting reports where they criticised the bill. The government announced in their 2017 budget that it would roll out the cashless debit card in two further locations from 1 September last year. The proposed locations were the Goldfields in WA and the Bundaberg-Hervey Bay region in Queensland. They are communities that do not have the same percentage of Indigenous Australians as the first two trial sites. 


The bill does provides the framework for additional locations but doesn't specifically enable the rollout in those locations. The government would need to take a legislative instrument into parliament for further rollout. Legislative instruments are, of course, disallowable, so for any particular location there will be an opportunity for the parliament to support or oppose the rollout. That is an important point, but the government has not yet said when those disallowable instruments will be tabled in parliament. 


Labor believes that there should not be any new trial sites introduced. Labor will seek to move an amendment in the Senate to that effect. Labor would only consider the introduction of the new trial site if the Liberals can demonstrate that they have an agreed, formal consultation process with the community and an agreed definition of 'consent'. They must also have established a comprehensive evidence base through a robust evaluation process. 


Labor knows the damage that drug and alcohol abuse and gambling can do to individuals and communities. We know that this is a problem that needs to be tackled as a community, by a community. The Australian Drug Foundation has given some alarming statistics. By the age of 12 a child will have seen more than 1,300 alcohol ads on television. Parents are the most likely source of alcohol for 12- to 17-year-olds. Eight out of every 10 Australians over the age of 14 drink alcohol. One in 10 workers say they have experienced the negative effects of a co-worker's misuse of alcohol. One in five Australians over the age of 14 drinks at levels that puts them at risk of alcohol-related harm over their lifetime. Australians aged over 70 years are the most likely group to drink alcohol on a daily basis. Alcohol and other drugs cost Australian workplaces $6 billion per year in lost productivity. Illicit drug use is most common among people aged 20 to 40 years. The report Alcohol's burden of disease in Australia, released four years ago, found that alcohol causes 15 deaths and hospitalises 430 Australians every day, and the number of deaths in Australia caused by alcohol had increased 62 per cent in the 10 years prior to 2014. These are worrying statistics, particularly for those of us who have young children.


We need to tackle this problem. As the member for Herbert said, we need to tackle it with our communities. What works in the Kimberley won't necessarily work in Moreton. We know that income management alone will not solve entrenched social issues. Governments need to provide additional support for any communities participating in these trials. We supported the first cashless debit trials in the East Kimberley and Ceduna. I visited Ceduna during the trials and have met and spoken with some of the Indigenous Australians there over the years. Also, when my partner was a lawyer working with the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, she dealt with some of the members of that community. I'm reasonably familiar with the Ceduna community and I know about the rollout there, and I refer to the comments made by the member for Grey. 


When I was on the Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs, I went to Ceduna as part of their inquiry. We heard from the officer in charge of Ceduna police station that boredom contributes to young people drinking, particularly in the sporting off-season or when parents are absent due to their own drinking. We certainly saw some of that in our visit to that community. We also heard about the dangers of humbugging. We know that income management was introduced into the Northern Territory in 2007 to minimise humbugging, to ensure that the funds intended for children's welfare were used for that purpose. The Australian Crime Commission, in their submission to the inquiry, said: 


There is evidence to suggest that drinkers on income management are able to maintain high levels of consumption through the Indigenous domestic moral economy (demand sharing) and the substantial outflow and largesse from their drinking cohorts who are employed.


One of the inquiry's 23 recommendations was:


That all strategies developed or funded by the Commonwealth or other governments are developed in partnership with the relevant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and/or their organisations.


'Nothing about us without us.' 


Labor supported the cashless debit card being rolled out in Ceduna because we consulted with community leaders and we secured additional funding for the wraparound services that are so essential. As so many speakers have mentioned, this is not a silver bullet. You need the wraparound services if the changes are to have any chance of success, particularly when it comes to drug and alcohol counselling services and increased mental health support services. I note that a memorandum of understanding was signed with the Ceduna region community leaders so that they owned the process. 


Sadly, the evidence to the Senate committee inquiry into this bill was that people from the Goldfields and Bundaberg—the sites proposed for the new trials—felt disempowered by the consultation process and that it was not representative of their community. The state member for Bundaberg at the time, Leanne Donaldson, said the consultation process had been 'selective and secretive'. There was criticism to the Senate committee about consultation with the Indigenous community. A member of the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Aboriginal community said:


They weren't really consulted … Every time there is something happening and they want to consult Aboriginal people, they haven't got an Aboriginal person there to explain in simple terms what's going on. 


Sadly, whilst we are supportive of the outcomes, we can't support the bill in its current form. At best, the evaluations conducted by Orima are inconclusive. Those evaluations were heavily criticised by academics in the field of social science. The current trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley have not been running long enough to provide sufficient conclusions about their success. Labor's own consultations with these communities have resulted in mixed feedback, with some community groups advocating support and others very critical of the impact on the community. Labor supports the current trials in Ceduna and East Kimberley continuing to the middle of 2019 so that conclusions can be drawn with confidence from the success or failure of the trials and what works best. Obviously the cashless debit card is not the only answer, as three previous speakers from the other side have said. It is also true to say that in some communities it is not the answer at all. Labor does not believe in a national rollout of the cashless debit card. Many communities are driving their own initiatives to tackle drug and alcohol abuse, and I particularly I mention my home town of St George, which has been dealing head-on with an ice problem. Labor wholeheartedly supports these local initiatives—local solutions, local empowerment. 


Labor does understand that some communities want assistance to address chronic alcohol and drug related abuse, and it is important that we listen to those communities about what their needs are and how they think those needs should be addressed by them. We do not take the patronising view that all recipients of welfare are incapable of managing their personal finances. We know that the vast majority of welfare recipients are more than capable of controlling and managing their own finances. They are good citizens, doing the right thing by their families and communities. It is important we recognise that. It is also crucial that the wraparound services are provided for these communities where the trials are occurring. Labor calls on those opposite to support Labor's amendment for funding these critical wraparound services. Fairness is something that runs through Labor's veins—fairness for all Australians, whether they are millionaires or whether they receive welfare.

Mr MORTON
 (Tangney) (19:25):  Mr Deputy Speaker Hastie, like you, I am in our parliament to do everything I can to make lives better. I am in this place to empower people to take control of their lives and for the government, if need be, to co-invest in people's futures, to help aspirational Australians reach their full potential. This is my absolute focus when we consider social policy and our welfare system, and it is my focus when we consider the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. 


Sadly, the lazy application of cashless welfare in some cases is making lives worse, not better. Even in my own family, I have seen how drugs and welfare can mix and the detrimental impact that welfare as easy cash can have on families, particularly children. The cashless debit card is changing lives for the better. The strongly independent evaluation results of the trial tell us just how big the positive impact is. We know that the card is not a silver bullet, and we acknowledge that, but it is an important tool in the fight against alcohol and drug abuse and the violence and crime that comes with that. 


This bill removes the current limitations on the cashless debit card to three discrete locations and no more than 10,000 people who are able to access the card, and it deletes the 30 June 2018 end date of the current program. Removing these limitations will support the extension of the cashless debit card in East Kimberley and Ceduna and enable the expansion of the card to further sites, including the Goldfields in Western Australia and Hinkler in Queensland. The trial of the cashless debit card in East Kimberley and Ceduna has been effective in reducing alcohol consumption, illegal drug use and gambling: 25 per cent of participants and 13 per cent of family members reported drinking alcohol less frequently; 32 per cent of participants and 15 per cent of family members reported gambling less; 24 per cent reported using illegal drugs less often; and 31 per cent reported being able to look after their children better and being able to save more money. 


I don't just speak in this place as someone who has read reports. I think it is important as parliamentarians that we look firsthand at the issues that we are trying to solve. I visited Kununurra and Wyndham to see the trial of the cashless debit card. It was so important for my understanding to learn from community leaders and locals how the card was making their lives even better. I met with many people in Kununurra and Wyndham who supported the card, and I met with those who didn't. The number of pick-ups made by the Kununurra community patrol was almost 20 per cent lower last year compared to the year before. Admissions to the Wyndham sobering-up unit were 49 per cent lower than before the trial. Ambulance alcohol-related call-outs were down by 30 per cent, and sales at the Wyndham bottle shop had dropped by 40 per cent. It was really interesting that some sales were up. When I visited the supermarket, I asked what they were selling more of or less of. They reported that, as a result of the drop in the economy overall, sales were down, but there was one particular product that was still being sold in Wyndham at the same level, and that was baby products. The sales of baby products remained constant when other products in that same store were dropping as a result of the economic downturn. 


I met with community leaders, who helped me get to the nuts and bolts of this policy. I sat with mums at the Wyndham Early Learning Activity Centre. I met with the chamber of commerce and a number of health and cultural organisations. When meeting with the police in Kununurra, I heard about the issues which they have to deal with day and night, but I was so pleased to hear that alcohol-fuelled call-outs were down. I spent a 12-hour overnight shift with the volunteers of the St John's Ambulance in Kununurra, who were out from 6 pm to 6 am. In Kununurra, the ambulance service is provided by volunteers, and in each and every one of the call-outs—which I can't go into detail about with you today—alcohol played a significant part. Alcohol played a part in the sickness and injuries of every visit we made. It played a part also in the haze of the information we received on some of the calls. Those volunteers don't have a full brief on the situation they're heading into because the information from the person dialling triple 0 is sketchy and inaccurate due to the influence of alcohol and drugs.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (19:30):  In recent times, there has been an increasing level of debate about the significance of Australia Day being held on 26 January. There is no doubt that this has the potential to be a divisive debate. Indeed, it looks like some in the commentariat are looking for an argument, not a solution. Finding a way forward is more important than re-running old arguments. Our nation needs to reconcile itself with the past as a precondition of creating a better future, one in which we all embrace a common vision of what it means to be Australian in the 21st century. Instead of emphasising our differences, let us create a platform for unity. Australia Day is a time for acknowledging both the good and the bad about our past, assessing where we are as a nation today and contemplating our vision for the future.


All Australians must acknowledge that this commemoration of the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788 is a difficult one for the First Australians. The arrival of Europeans disrupted the longest continuous civilisation on Earth and was accompanied by dispossession, violence, disease and trauma which are still felt today with the tragic gap in life expectancy, education and health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. It is understandable that many Indigenous Australians refer to 26 January as 'Survival Day'. Every Australia Day is a reminder that there is much unfinished business to achieve reconciliation, including recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in our Constitution, but also practical measures to close the gap on living standards, jobs, education and health outcomes.


The story of modern Australia is also one of migration since the 18th century. We are a nation which has welcomed millions of people from all parts of the globe, seeking a better life for themselves, their families and the generations to come. On Australia Day this year, as in other years, tens of thousands of people pledged their allegiance to our country and became citizens. Australia has been enriched by its multiculturalism—people who are loyal to Australia but have contributed their language, music, culture and of course food from their countries of birth. Australia has enormous natural advantages, but it is our people that make us the envy of the world and indeed 'the lucky country', and we're confident enough that it's only a matter of time before we have an Australian head of state. 


One of the tasks of political leadership is to bring people together on the journey of change in a way that promotes unity and isolates division. It seems to me that the purpose of Australia Day—to consider Australia's past, present and future—provides an opportunity. I'm a strong supporter of constitutional change to recognise the First Australians, and I'm in favour of a republic. A referendum held on 26 January to recognise First Australians in our Constitution, along with a second question about the move to being a republic, would be an exciting opportunity to forge a path forward for Australia's future. It would mean Australia had a day that recognised our modern history of new arrivals; our continuous history of Indigenous Australians, dating back at least 65,000 years; and our declaration of confidence that we are a modern, independent state with an Australian as its head. I don't declare that this proposal is the idea, just an idea, to avert a divisive debate about when to celebrate Australia Day.


I note Noel Pearson's proposition in The Australian two weeks ago about celebrating both 25 January and 26 January. To me it has a certain logic because, increasingly, I witness more discussion about issues confronting the First Australians, past, present and future, around Australia Day. The Uluru Statement from the Heart has advanced a constructive proposal for a voice for first nations after extensive engagement, and that is not a proposal for a third chamber of parliament.


Australians want harmony based on mutual respect. The impasse on advancing reconciliation must be broken, and decision-makers, civil society and, most crucially, First Australians must be engaged in forging a new path forward. A necessary element will be ensuring that the First Australians have a sense of ownership over our national day of celebration.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (10:30):  Several days ago I received an email from a resident of my electorate, and I want to read part of it. It says: 


I have been a dialysis patient and disability pensioner for 24 years. I have no chance of getting a kidney transplant. I attend a private dialysis clinic so as not to strain the public health system. Private health subscriptions are increasing at a faster rate than my pension is. I am struggling financially. 


That's a real story of a real person who is struggling to meet her health needs. 


Since 2013, in the past five years under this coalition government, private health insurance costs have risen by 27 per cent, adding over $1,000 per annum in cost to most families. Over the same period, CPI increases have been about 10 per cent. In other words, private health insurance costs have increased by about 2½ times the CPI rise. 


The increases come at a time when private health insurers are making healthy profits. Last year they made $1.8 billion, with some of the biggest health insurance providers making a return of over 20 per cent on their money. Even more concerning is that around 40 per cent of policies now contain exclusions—compared with just 8.6 per cent 10 years ago. So families are effectively paying a lot more and getting a lot less. Not surprisingly, people are dropping their private health insurance. In 2017, private hospital coverage dropped to the lowest level since 2011. It is important to note that the private health insurance industry receives around $6 billion a year in taxpayer subsidies. 


Enough is enough, and I am pleased to see that a Shorten Labor government will cap the increases in private health insurance for two years. Labor will also task the Productivity Commission with the most significant review of the private health system in 20 years, to ensure that private health insurance provides value for money. For people in regional, rural and remote Australia—where private health insurance take-up rates are already about 10 per cent lower than for the rest of the country and where health status is much worse than in the cities—Labor's commitment to cap private health insurance rates to two per cent will make a welcome difference. It is time that Australians got value for their health dollars, and under this government what we have seen is, time and time again, the cost of health increasing and the services decreasing.

   (iii) stand up for the moderate voices in Myanmar which are being widely suppressed by the threat of persecution by the Myanmar military.



Deputy Speaker Buchholz, I'm very grateful for the opportunity to speak on this very important motion which seeks to raise the ongoing humanitarian crisis of the Rohingyas in the Rakhine province in Myanmar, as they remain displaced in camps on the Bangladesh border. There are an estimated 850,000 refugees, men, women and children, with over half a million of them arriving since August last year.


We're only just seeing the extent of the atrocities as they are being revealed to us by the international media, the aid agencies and the parliamentarians who have visited the refugee camps. UNICEF reports that almost 60 per cent of the refugees living in tents and temporary shelters are children, and 21 per cent are children under five years of age. In its report, UNICEF speaks of the Rohingya children as outcasts and desperate. The children face a perilous future. They have witnessed unspeakable atrocities as they fled their homes. They are suffering from malnutrition. Many have been separated from their families and are in desperate need of vaccinations, sanitation, food, counselling and schooling. The UN Secretary-General, the US Secretary of State and many others around the world have condemned Myanmar's ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, and we must also condemn this. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch report widespread acts of sexual violence and rape perpetrated by men wearing security uniforms, and describe seeing children being beaten to death, ruthless killings and the destruction of homes and property.


Myanmar has a long history of dehumanising the Rohingya. It refuses to recognise their nationality and to grant them many rights on an equal basis with other citizens. This abhorrent denial facilitates the violence and accompanies the treatment that the Rohingya have experienced as recently, of course, as August last year. Displacement and persecution is an all too familiar story, so much so that Australia has in recent years received many Rohingya refugees, and many are living in my home state of Victoria. According to the ABS, there are currently about 2,000 Rohingya living in Australia. The Australian Burmese Rohingya Organisation—ABRO—who I met with, tell me that they are facing significant barriers for their own successful resettlement in Australia, and this includes finding work and access to adequate English language training. Despite their own personal challenges here, they can never be at ease whilst their family and friends continue to suffer back home. They have been very active in calling out the recent atrocities perpetrated by Myanmar security forces, and, following the most recent mass displacement of Rohingyas, they are calling on the Australian government to increase our refugee intake of Rohingyas and to work hard to guarantee third-country resettlement for those we cannot settle here.


Australia has a very special relationship with Myanmar. We are one of its three major donors for economic development and building capacity for democracy. We must and we do have the capacity to press the government of Myanmar to cease persecuting the Rohingya minority. It's not only our duty as a country that values human rights and democracy but also our responsibility to ensure that Australian aid money to Myanmar is benefiting and building capacity for all, without exception and without discrimination. We need to send a strong message to Myanmar that we will not tolerate these human rights violations. Our duty is to ensure that the Myanmar government upholds its duty of care to the Rohingya people—a duty of care that can allow them to return home and to live in safety and without fear of further persecution.


I want to commend Oxfam's work in providing relief to over 185,000 Rohingya people. They, along with Save the Children, have provided many briefings to us in this place about the situation in the camps, and I want to thank them for their candour. These wonderful agencies require our continued support so that this crisis does not deepen further. On a local level, I'd like to commend the work of Hasene Australia, a local charity in my electorate. Last year this organisation helped raised $57,000 for the crisis and sent volunteers overseas who are providing more than 6,000 families with food, shelter and financial support.


I want to welcome the steps announced by Myanmar's government to work with Bangladesh to repatriate many of the refugees. However, I join with ABRO and other NGOs who remind us that many of the people have been repatriated before. Any new plans for repatriation must be voluntary and must be undertaken alongside effective security protection for the returnees. Oxfam reports that many refugees, especially women, remain deeply traumatised by their experiences and are gravely concerned about being forcibly returned to the birthplace of their trauma.

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-02-05,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (11:06):  I second the motion. Elie Wiesel, the great Jewish writer who survived Auschwitz and wrote the book Night, quoted:


When adults wage war, children perish.


I was, I guess, a witness to some of that a few weeks ago when I was in Cox's Bazar at the Rohingya refugee camps. The striking thing that confronts us firstly is the number of children there—children with smiles on their faces but dirt on their faces, barefoot and running around, at risk of a major disease outbreak in 60 days when the monsoon season comes—who are the victims of this trauma. People might say to me, 'Why would a member for regional Victoria be interested in the children in the refugee camp at Cox's Bazar?' I say to them that we are the beneficiaries of a very robust and prosperous country and that very robust and prosperous country affords us great opportunity but also great responsibility, and that is to ensure that the values that we hold dear are reflected in other parts of the world.


It is warming to my heart to know that Australia is the third-largest donor to the refugee camps in Cox's Bazar. I was able to go there with Senator Lisa Singh from the Australian Labor Party to see the work that took place. Senator Singh and I co-chair the Parliamentary Friends of UNICEF. I want to reflect on what I saw—a story of what is the worst of humanity, coupled with some of the best of humanity. The worst of humanity, which is quite confronting, was to hear the stories of women who were raped by soldiers whilst they watched their husbands being hung. They didn't want to take their eyes away from their husbands as they died because they wanted to at least give some sort of support. Rape was used as an act of terror. It is not the case that 600,000 or 700,000 people shift for small atrocities; they shift because they are fleeing for their life. We heard stories of the unfolding crisis of 40,000 babies that might be born. Those women are carrying those babies not knowing if they were fathered by their now dead husbands or if they were fathered as a result of rape. The aid organisations have to think through how they will deal with the issues of abandonment if those babies turn out to be fathered as a result of rape.


Standing on a hill, looking as far as the eye could see, you could see a bamboo and tent city that essentially was forest six months ago, showing the rapidness with which people had arrived—they were basically starving after trekking up to eight days. We were told how, with 60 days before the monsoon season, they needed to shift 80,000 people from areas where they are at risk of landslide when the rain starts. We heard that drainage needs to be put in place in order to ensure that disease doesn't perpetrate through that group of people.


But we also saw the compassion of our aid workers. Can I just say on the record: I saw no waste. The great criticism that Australians make is of the waste that's in the aid program, but I saw no waste. I saw hardworking, diligent people. A lady said to me—she's from Perth and has been involved in the aid program work for a long time—that she cries at a Kleenex tissue ad, but, she said, 'I can't cry here because that doesn't help these people. I'm here to work. I'm here to make people's lives better.' They are doing a tremendous job, on things like sanitation—100 people to a toilet—and water supply. I have to say that the farmer in me—I have set up water supplies on my own farm—got talking about bar pressure and pumps and how to set water up. We saw medicine and we saw also education.


The challenge, of course, is: what is the future for those people? People without hope cannot be left to stagnate. And this is the challenge, because the Myanmar government doesn't want to take them back. They don't want to go back in a hurry. The Bangladesh government doesn't want to absorb them, and I think there is probably a real discussion to be had about the way the World Bank and the countries of the world create trading zones, investment and opportunities. I don't think that these people are going to be going back to Myanmar in a hurry. It's simply not safe. Ultimately, we need to create hope for these people because, otherwise, it does sadly become a breeding ground for disenchanted young men and women.


I say we should be proud of Australia's contribution, but, of course, we will need to do more. It was a privilege to go with such hardworking people. We saw the worst of humanity, but we also saw the best of it.

 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (11:11):  I'm pleased to join the member for Calwell and to follow the member for Mallee on such an important issue in our parliament. I note the member for Lilley, the member for Gellibrand and the member for Newcastle will also be speaking on this important issue. We've heard the figures about the number of Rohingya refugees who have had to flee Myanmar over the course of the last 12 months. Following a brutal outbreak of violence in late August, the crisis, of course, has worsened—the crisis faced by the minority Rohingya Muslim community has escalated. We heard from the member for Mallee of his recent trip. I've spoken to the member for Gellibrand about what he saw on his trip. I too would join those members in commending the work of Save the Children in this crisis.


It was reported in late August that over 650,000 members of this community have taken refuge in Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, after having been forced to flee their homes in Myanmar's northern Rakhine province. As others have noted, people don't flee in those numbers because they're economic refugees; they flee in those numbers because they are terrified for their lives. This has added to the extraordinary numbers of displaced people around the globe. On February 3 it was reported that five mass graves were found holding the bodies of Rohingya Muslims, and we know that in the future we will be looking back on this and standing in this place discussing the atrocities uncovered. The United Nations has described the situation as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing, and what we need to do now is to be part of the solution, in terms of both diplomacy and aid, to support those people who have fled and to put pressure through diplomatic processes to ensure that these atrocities cease. In December, Doctors without Borders reported that at least 6,700 people had died in 2017, approximately 730 of whom were children younger than five years of age, and that these deaths were attributable to the attacks in Rakhine. Sitting in Australia, it is difficult to imagine the impact that kind of terror might have.


The provision of aid for the refugees is absolutely critical. We need to remind the Myanmar government of their duty and their duty of care towards these people. We need to be part of that diplomatic pressure, but we also need to be part of the solution. We need to ensure that these hundreds of thousands of people are getting the targeted support that they need in Bangladesh. We need to ensure that people have access to vaccinations, to education, to trauma counselling and, most importantly, to shelter and safety, in the first order. 


We've heard again today about the monsoons coming, and about the work that will need to be done to ensure safety and shelter for those who are already there as well as to ensure that no more need flee. SBS News reported on 3 February that an estimated 80,000 tents in the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh will have to be repositioned due to the upcoming monsoon season. This is a current issue that needs to be addressed immediately. Like others in this place, I am proud that Australia is part of that solution, with the $31 million that we have contributed to assist in this crisis. 


It is difficult to be in Australia and to think about the pressures that those people are under. It certainly gives us a clear focus on the issues facing us globally. It gives us cause to think about the contributions that we as a country can make to assist the millions of displaced people across the globe at this point in time. But, as the member for Calwell noted, this one matters to a population, particularly in Victoria, of those who are already here. Their hearts break, and we need to give them the support that they need as well as ensure that we are giving support to those who are doing the work on the ground supporting these people.

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (11:16):  I thank the member for Calwell for moving this important motion today. The exodus of the Rohingya people from the northern Arakan and the Rakhine state of Myanmar—and the persecution, attacks, killings and human rights abuses that precipitated it—is a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions, which is unfolding in our own region. United Nations officials have described the crimes committed against Rohingya as a 'textbook example of ethnic cleansing'. Human Rights Watch called them 'crimes against humanity'. 


Those who have been able to escape this terror confront a new horror—trying to survive in the extraordinarily overcrowded and under-resourced refugee camps of Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh. In the time between the tabling of this motion last year and today's parliamentary debate, the number of Rohingya forced to flee into refugee camps in Bangladesh has increased to over 650,000. It is the fastest-growing refugee crisis in the world. 


I want to thank one of my constituents, Mat Tinkler, from Save the Children, for telling me about the reality of life in these conditions at the Cox's Bazar refugee camp, after his recent visit to the site. Those who arrive at Cox's Bazar have frequently been walking on foot for days, sometimes weeks, in the face of aggressive persecution during their escape. As a result, they are often exhausted, sick and starving—not to mention traumatised and separated from family members. Almost 70 per cent of those arriving are children or pregnant and breastfeeding women. The provision of food and clean water, shelter and sanitation, medical care and protective services for children to so many vulnerable people arriving in this short a period of time is extremely challenging. Many more lives are being lost in these camps as a result. The fate of hundreds of thousands of human beings is currently in the balance. 


There are many things that the international community, the Australian government and the general public can do in response to this crisis. I want to recognise Senator Singh, from the other place, and the member for Mallee for their recent visit to Cox's Bazar and their work in helping to raise awareness of this crisis with UNICEF. I want to also congratulate the ABC for its Myanmar-Bangladesh crisis appeal. 


On behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I want to echo, in this chamber and in this debate, the call of our shadow minister for foreign affairs. We call for the full implementation of the Kofi Annan report and the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, which seek to prevent violence, maintain peace and foster reconciliation. We call on the government to work to establish an independent UN investigation into human rights abuses in Myanmar and to continue holding the government of Myanmar, especially the military, to account for their conduct, and for their continued obligation to respect the human rights of all people. We call for the government to support unimpeded humanitarian access to the camps in Bangladesh and to work closely with our regional partners on medium- and long-term responses to the refugee crisis, seeking to ensure that the Rohingya population has a secure place to live in peace. The situation presents State Counsellor and Nobel Laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and the government more broadly, with an opportunity to exercise moral authority to protect the human rights of the country's citizens and to mediate a peaceful resolution to the current crisis. We believe it is in Myanmar's own interests for this conflict to be responded to and fairly resolved.


I want to add to this a comment about the importance of the government and the general public investing in Australian aid to support not only the immediate humanitarian needs of those affected by this crisis but also the longer-term development needs of those impacted by violence in the Rakhine State, including support for Rohingya refugees who may wish to return to Myanmar on a voluntary basis in the future, when and if it is safe to do so. I encourage my constituents to donate to the aid agencies who are providing humanitarian support on the ground in these refugee camps, including the Australian Red Cross, Australia for UNHCR, Save the Children and many more.


The current crisis has been building for many years. And, like the Rwandan crisis of a generation ago, in the future people will look back on this crisis and judge the actions taken by the international community to protect the lives of the human beings caught in the middle of it. That is why in April last year I travelled to the Rakhine State in Myanmar to meet with Rohingya people living in the internally displaced persons camps and to hear the stories of Rohingya refugees living elsewhere in the region, in Malaysia and Thailand. Even at that time, before the present catastrophe, it was clear to me that the relationship between the Rohingya and the broader Myanmar community and the government held the seeds of a future catastrophe. I heard many stories of the horrible conditions confronting Rohingya in the Rakhine State—the official and social persecution they faced and the heartbreaking stories of loss that resulted from it.


I wonder what has become of the many people I met in the Rohingya community in the Rakhine State last April. I know that the least I owe them is to add my voice to the call in this parliament for the Australian community and the Australian public to do everything we can to support the services being provided in Cox's Bazar today.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (11:22):  I want to start by thanking the member for Calwell for bringing this motion on the Rakhine State in Myanmar before the House of Representatives. From many of the contributions you can tell the depth of concern that is rightly being reflected in the House today, and I think it's very fitting that on our first day back in parliament we're debating this topic. And I'd like to frame my comments today around a visit I made last November to Cox's Bazar, where I accompanied the CEO of Oxfam, Dr Helen Szoke, and the CEO of CARE Australia, Sally Moyle, and their respective teams in order to try to understand firsthand the situation facing Rohingya refugees fleeing the north Rakhine State across to Bangladesh.


Whilst intellectually I thought I was prepared for that visit and had done my reading and talked to as many people as I could, absolutely nothing could have prepared me for the sight of Cox's Bazar. To describe this as the fastest-growing humanitarian crisis simply as a matter of fact does little to really portray the situation in Bangladesh right now, and I would like upfront to send the most sincere thanks to the Bangladeshi government, who have, notwithstanding the very poor nature of their country and the struggles of their own people, displayed the most extraordinarily generous spirit in providing a safe haven for Rohingya people fleeing persecution and violence from the north of Rakhine State.


I had the real pleasure of meeting with many women parliamentarians whilst I was in Bangladesh. I was able to send my personal thanks for their generosity. At a time when many member states in the world are pulling up the drawbridges of their communities and closing their borders, this has not been the approach of the Bangladeshi government. As I said, notwithstanding the fact that they have their own deep challenges when it comes to looking after their own citizens, they have never blinked or even contemplated the possibility of not providing safe haven and assistance for the Rohingya refugees.


We owe the Bangladeshi government enormous thanks and enormous gratitude. Every ounce of support is needed that the Australian government can provide to the Bangladeshi government and to the humanitarian actors who are, thankfully, in Cox's Bazaar in large numbers to ensure that there is some emergency aid being delivered to the men, women and children in those camps. The role they play is so essential. Like my colleagues before me, I absolutely encourage Australians to donate, to contribute in any way they can, to that appeal. Unlike with many natural disaster appeals, a lot of people struggle to understand what is happening in this particular situation. So I don't think we've seen the generosity that we normally see from Australians—and, indeed, from other nations around the world—in providing some additional financial assistance. I thank the Australian government for the contribution we have made there, but it is a drop in the ocean. I don't think we should kid ourselves otherwise.


Certainly I know from my discussions with people in those camps there won't be repatriations any time soon without some assurance that there will be safe places for them to return to. That they are able to return to their ancestral lands and villages, not some so-called temporary camp closed off somewhere, is absolutely vital. That is not to mention the question of citizenship, which remains a core issue that needs to be redressed.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2018-02-05,"



Mr SWAN
 (Lilley) (11:27):  This is a massive humanitarian crisis. When it comes to humanitarian crises, they don't get much bigger than this. It is occurring with great speed. Some 688,000 Rohingyas have been forced to flee to refugee camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, and those who remain are subject to ethnic cleansing. I think we've all seen the pictures of villages on fire and people being tortured, and we know that there are reports of rapes, killings and executions. This is a massive tragedy.


In the area in which I live, we have something like five per cent of Australia's Rohingya population. I've had the privilege to meet with members of the Rohingya community and their advocates, both in my electorate and here in parliament. I've heard, time and time again, the harrowing stories from a people who have been denied their identity and denied their statehood. These are people who have escaped persecution and terror but whose fear for their lives and the lives of their families is seared into their brows. Last year, I met with Mohammed Sadek, a young Rohingya refugee living in my local area. He spoke about the escalation of violence in Myanmar, the killing of his people and the systemic burning of villages. He urged this parliament to take quick and decisive action before, as he put it, the Rohingya as a people are exterminated in Myanmar. I also went to a rally outside Parliament House, a year or so ago, organised by Nor Zaman, another impressive local young Rohingya leader. He spent 15 years in a refugee camp before he managed to come to Australia. He's currently in his early 30s, and he's fighting the fight for his people and his family who have been left behind.


That activity and that activism from Rohingya in this country are vital in informing the Australian people and, most particularly, the people in this parliament of the urgency before us to do something to assist the refugees and, more importantly, to do something for those who are left behind, and then, of course, a plan for the future if these people are to be dealt with in a decent way outside the borders of modern Myanmar.


In 1948, when Myanmar gained independence from the British, the Rohingya people were promised an autonomous state, but they were rebuffed by the new leadership. The persecution of the Rohingya people continued through subsequent decades. Rohingya social and political organisations were closed, privately-owned Rohingya businesses were transferred to the government and Rohingya people were subject of forced labour, arbitrary detention and physical assault. So there have been concerted policies of discrimination against the Rohingya people for decades, and there are now more than one million of them. They are subject to a health crisis. Harvard University researchers have described a vicious cycle that begins with poor health in infancy that then feeds into malnutrition, waterborne illnesses and so on. And Rohingya children are denied a public education, which exposes an entire generation of Rohingya to the risk of illiteracy.


The recent escalation is of a different order to all of that past discrimination, because in August last year—described in testimony to the UN Human Rights Council as the assault, torture, rape and murder of innocent Rohingya people—there was a huge escalation of persecution of Rohingya in that country. In a horrifying example of disproportionate response, after a series of small attacks on police and army posts in August, Myanmar's military launched a catastrophic wave of so-called clearance operations. Of course, we now know what that means.


The task before the Australian government and the task before the United Nations is urgent—the violence continues. Our government, and I know they are working on this, has a responsibility to do everything they possibly can to change the behaviour of the authorities in Myanmar and to participate in developing a plan for the future for a group of people who've been excluded, persecuted and who are now the subject of ethnic cleansing. The task before us is urgent.


Debate adjourned.

Mr GEE
 (Calare) (16:00):  One of the reasons I entered this parliament was to bridge the great divide between the city and the country. Our electorate lies on the western side of the Great Dividing Range—the 'sandstone curtain', as we call it. It not only is a physical divide between the city and the country but also, for many in the regions, represents a divide of opportunity, of representation, of development and of population between those east of it and those west of it. The great divide exists in education, in access to medical services and in social disadvantage. We in central-western New South Wales want our region to grow and prosper so that it continues to provide an unbeatable quality of life for generations to come. There is no better way to literally bridge the great divide than to build a new expressway over the top of it or, indeed, tunnel underneath it—or both. Sydney is bursting at the seams. With each passing week its suburbs march closer to the mountains. An expressway from Sydney's north-west into Lithgow, in the vicinity of the Bells Line of Road, would open up the communities of the west. Billions upon billions of dollars have been spent on the Pacific Highway upgrade; it's costing over $50 million per kilometre. We in the central-west don't dispute that it's needed, but we believe that it's time western New South Wales got its fair share. Let's not dither for another generation. This project needs to happen, and all levels of government should be supporting it. The renewed push for an expressway into central-western New South Wales is on.

Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (16:45):  I move:


That this House:




(1) notes that:





(a) plastic bags are detrimental to the environment;





(b) Australians use an estimated 5 billion plastic bags a year, which represents over 20 million bags used every day;





(c) research has indicated that as of 2013, approximately 5
.25
 trillion pieces of plastic have been floating in our world's oceans—these are mostly microplastics of less than 5 millimetres in size and are 
regularly eaten by marine life, through which they enter the global food chain and are consumed by humans;





(d) thousands of marine mammals and seabirds die every year around the world as a result of plastic litter;





(e) plastic bags are particularly bad for the environment because they take from between 20 and 1,000 years to biodegrade and can travel long distances via air and water;





(f) South Australia led the nation with the phasing out of lightweight non-biodegradable plastic shopping bags, which state legislation defines as a carry bag, the body of which comprises (in whole or in part) polyethylene with a thickness of less than 35 microns and includes handles;





(g) South Australia's ban on plastic shopping bags came into force on 4 May 2009; and





(h) the South Australian Environmental Protection Authority estimates that the state's ban on plastic shopping bags has resulted in almost 400 million fewer plastic bags in that state each year; and





(2) calls on the:





(a) state governments yet to enact a ban on lightweight non-biodegradable plastic shopping bags to do so with speed and urgency; and





(b) Australian Government to work with the state Governments to implement a national ban on lightweight non-biodegradable plastic shopping bags by the end of 2018.



Last year, students from Kangaroo Island Community Education, in my electorate, shared their research with me about the impact we humans have on the environment. The year 4 and 5 students were so passionate about the environment that they started several local environmental initiatives, including a clean-up at the local beach and a soft-plastics bin in their schoolyard. In Australian classrooms, our children are taught how human activity is contributing to the deterioration of our environment. In our own households, so often it is our children who are leading the way by encouraging their families to make more environmentally friendly choices.


The class I visited also investigated and reported on a number of different environmental schemes, including the importance of a national plastic bag ban across Australia. The class explored the issue further than the ban, identifying what they could do in their own households to reduce waste and correctly recycle soft plastics. It's so important that we get rid of soft plastics because all of our marine life seem to see them as jellyfish, and we are killing our marine animals. I want to sincerely thank the students of Kangaroo Island Community Education; their infectious enthusiasm encouraged me to put forward this important motion.


South Australia was the first state, in 2009, to introduce a widespread ban on single-use plastic shopping bags. On average, these lightweight single-use bags are only used for a total of 12 minutes. Scientific research cited by the World Economic Forum indicates that, as of 2013, approximately 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic are floating in the world's oceans. The forum has predicted that this number will rise to a phenomenal 250 trillion tonnes in 2025. EcoWatch now estimate that 40 per cent of the world's ocean surface contains plastic debris. Each single-use plastic bag takes between 20 and 1,000 years to biodegrade. Because of their lightweight nature they are also prone to travelling long distances via air and water. These non-biodegradable plastic bags are killing thousands of marine animals every year and are causing irreversible damage to our marine ecosystems.


A 2011 review by researchers at the University of South Australia on the South Australian ban found that approximately 80 per cent of the community supported the ban on plastic bags in my state and that twice as many households now regularly carry their own reusable bags to the shops compared to before the ban came into effect. Another key conclusion of the 2011 review was that consideration should be given to extend the ban to cover other types of plastics, especially those that are thicker and heavier.


I'm encouraged by the states and territories which have already implemented this ban, including the ACT, the Northern Territory and Tasmania. I note that Queensland and Western Australia have committed to banning the bag this year. Banning plastic bags is not a new phenomenon. Single-use plastic bags have been banned nationally in several countries around the world, including Morocco, Italy and Belgium, and many other nations have localised or partial bans, such as Canada, the United States, Brazil and Botswana.


Last year, I wrote to both the New South Wales and Victorian premiers, urging them to join the rest of the country in banning the plastic bag. A plastic bag ban is not a difficult policy, because they can simply look at what South Australia has done and adopt our comprehensive policies on this. We have essentially blazed the trail for Victoria and New South Wales. I was encouraged by the comments from the Victorian environment minister to reduce the impact of plastic bags in Victoria. I understand that the Victorian parliament has now made a commitment to ban the plastic bag and is currently undertaking a consultation process. However, I must say that I was incredibly disappointed with the New South Wales Premier's response to me. She welcomed the leadership of Woolworths, Coles and Harris Farm Markets to phase out single-use plastic bags but was then pointedly silent about committing to any such leadership herself. I would urge the Premier of New South Wales to consult with her community. This can be done, and it is the most populous state in our nation.


Reusable and biodegradable bags have been around for some time and are affordable alternatives. A ban on lightweight single-use plastic bags provides a clear incentive for people to use materials kinder to our environment. Implementing a single-use plastic bag ban in every state and territory sends a strong, consistent message that all Australians will make small changes. We are an island nation. We are surrounded by water and we must do better to take care of our marine environment. I strongly support those states and territories who already have their bans on bags or are in the process of heading towards that, and again I strongly encourage the New South Wales government to take a leadership role in this. It can be done. For nine years in South Australia we have had a plastic bag ban, and it's about time that our most populous state join the team.

Mr VASTA
 (Bonner) (16:51):  Just recently a young Manly West local, Nicola, wrote to me with a very upsetting story. She was out for a run on the local foreshore when she came across a dead hawksbill sea turtle. The turtle had died after eating a plastic bag. This is a common death for many turtles these days, and it's a horrible one. The awful thing is that this turtle was just one of the many dead marine animals she has seen since she moved into the area only seven months ago. According to UNESCO, plastic debris kills over a million sea birds and over 100,000 marine animals every year. Meanwhile, according to Keep Australia Beautiful data, there has been an increase in litter around the bayside area. 


Clearly, something needs to be done. It heartens me to know that so many locals use their own time to go along the waterfront and pick up rubbish left behind by others. Local volunteer groups do regular litter clean-ups in the area. One constituent tells me that he fills up bags of rubbish during daily walks, but when he returns the next day it has all returned. As Keep Australia Beautiful's CEO, David Curtin, said to me: 'If all we ever do is pick up after litterbugs, we will always be cleaning up. Education is the key.' 


There are already some fantastic education programs in place in my electorate. The Moreton Bay Discovery Centre is a great educational resource for the community. I was happy to secure $400,000 for the centre's construction and fit-out. The centre is an important tourism hub that will teach locals and visitors to the area how to keep Moreton Bay healthy for local marine life. It will also run a Moreton Bay discovery children's program when it opens. This is a great way to teach children the importance of protecting the bay. Another great initiative in Bonner is the renowned Tangalooma EcoMarines program, which includes an early learning centre program for preschool children. 


This government supports moves by a number of states, including Queensland from 1 July, to phase out single-use plastic bags. We also welcome industry moves to do the same. Coles and Woolworths have announced that they will no longer be using single-use plastic bags by the end of 2018. At the Manly Harbour Village markets in my electorate, stall holders have reusable fabric shopping bags available for customers. The Manly Harbour Village Chamber of Commerce is also in discussions with the village traders about using fabric shopping bags. 


The Minister for the Environment and Energy has said it's inevitable that Australia will be free of single-use plastic bags over time. Until then, I intend to do my part. I will be launching a 'clean up the bay' initiative and working alongside local environment groups to keep the bayside beautiful and rubbish-free for marine life. I have plans to get as many locals involved as possible. Together we can clean up and teach others to be inspired to do the same.

Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (16:54):  In my speech today I would like to thank the member for Mayo and the member for Bonner on their really important initiative that we've brought to this House and to thank the member for Mayo for the work that she does for her communities, particularly with schools, listening to what they say and then bringing these topics to parliament. I'd also like to acknowledge the work done by the government of Victoria and the many individuals and community groups in my electorate who are taking a lead in this area through the Boomerang Bags movement.


I say to the Victorian government, thank you for your work. It's acknowledged and appreciated. In October 2017, the Labor government committed to banning single-use, lightweight plastic bags. They invited input from all Victorians on how to design a ban that's fair, effective and lasting. I do like it when our Victorian government consults with the community on such an important topic. The survey closed on 25 January, and we're expecting the results to be collated and analysed by early March. We look forward to that information.


Today I'd like to talk in particular about the many, many groups in my electorate and the work they're doing on not only understanding about plastic bags but also recycling, including the Boomerang Bags movement. Deputy Speaker Claydon, I'm not sure if you're familiar with the Boomerang Bags movement, but co-founders Tania Potts and Jordyn de Boer up in Burleigh Heads got the idea happening. Now, thanks to amazing supporters all around the country, community groups and individuals are coming together and making bags. To do a bit of a call out for my electorate, in Alexandra, down in the south end of my electorate in the Goulburn Valley, between 300 and 400 bags have been sewn and distributed. In Bright, the P-12 secondary college has taken the lead. In Beechworth, between 3,500 and 5,000 bags were distributed in 2017. In Benalla, 80 bags have been made. In the Kiewa Valley, which is a small rural dairy community, 50 bags have been made. Down in the Kinglake area, a thousand bags have been sewn, with an aim of 3,000 to reach their ultimate goal of zero plastic bags in Kinglake. In Mansfield, the CWA—Country Women's Association—has joined up with the Up2Us Landcare group, and they've made 150 bags, which have been given out right around the community. In Moyhu, another small rural horticultural community, people have got together and made 50 bags. In Mount Beauty, in Tawonga, people have been meeting twice a week, and they've sewn 430 bags—a huge effort! Myrtleford has made 80 bags. Wangaratta—I love you, Wangaratta, for what you've done—went to the mills that make material and got the material that was going to be sent to landfill. They rescued that material; they stopped it going to landfill. They've made over 3,000 plastic bags. They actually stopped that plastic landfill, so that's a terrific effort.


In Yackandandah, my local community, over 500 recycled bags have been made. It's been great because they've been working with our local FoodWorks supermarket which, way ahead of the team, came out and said that they weren't going to have any more plastic bags. On the weekend, I was in Yackandandah. I had my recycled bag. Everyone has been putting their bags together in the big bin, and people can help themselves. It's working superbly—from Yarck to Yea, Bonnie Doon and Wodonga.


I'll finish with Wodonga and its Sustainable Activity Centre. Not only are they making recycled material bags; they also have a repair cafe. It's not about plastic bags; it's about making sure that things that have broken down can get fixed and don't get put into landfill. They've also got a battery collection service there.


It gives me such hope, Member for Mayo. We're calling on a top-down approach from the government to get their act together, and we're absolutely being led by our communities, doing all this bottom-up work. They're getting out there, they're solutions focused and they're doing what our communities do so well—they're taking the lead, and they're calling on us now, as members of parliament, to get our government to do what it needs to do. So thank you very much for bringing this really important motion to the parliament. I'm really pleased that you've written to the different states to say, 'Get your act together.' We're looking for the Commonwealth to continue to play a lead role in this. It gives me great pleasure to support this motion.

Mr EVANS
 (Brisbane) (16:59):  I agree very strongly with the call for action at the end of this motion. It's why I fought so hard for one of my election commitments, which involves catching rubbish in the Brisbane River before it moves out to Moreton Bay and the open ocean. I also want to say, with a great deal of respect to all honourable members speaking on this topic, whose passion should be commended and that matches my own passion, that this motion could be further developed in its approach and its language not just around the sentiments but when it comes to considering the options at play and the practical solutions in front of us. So I want to use my time today to very constructively put on the record some considerations that might help to advance this parliamentary debate from where the policy's been in recent years to where it is now, having regard to the science and the evidence and some of my knowledge from the industry I used to work in before coming to this place.


Plastic bags are detrimental to the environment. Logically, the next question has to be: if we propose to ban them, what are the substitutes that people will turn to, and are they more, or less, detrimental? Paper bags, for instance, can use far more water and electricity, depending on their make, and therefore can have a worse carbon footprint. And those synthetic bags that a lot of retailers sell now are probably the heaviest and most resource-intensive of all the options. If we use them enough times, ultimately they become a better option for the environment. But the evidence suggests that at this stage people aren't presently using them nearly enough times, on average, to make them the best choice. Heavier-grade plastics, on the other hand, do use more plastic than lightweight single-use plastic bags, so they can take as long or longer to degrade. Yet the facts suggest that because they're heavier they don't travel as easily through the air or through the water, so they're much less likely to enter the waterways and the open ocean. That's why schemes such as those introduced in South Australia and the ACT particularly focus their efforts on phasing out lightweight, single-use plastic bags, allowing retailers and customers to substitute other plastic bags, like heavier-grade plastics or indeed biodegradable or compostable plastics.


And that's an issue I want to mention in passing. I've said consistently in other debates in this place, from burqa bans to night-life lockouts, that calls for blanket bans can sometimes be a clunky, poor choice for policymakers—always motivated by good intentions but too often giving rise to unintended consequences. Sometimes better and more sophisticated or nuanced policy responses are available. In this case, I want to inform honourable members that I'm onboard with this concept of phasing out, specifically, lightweight plastic bags, so long as we also help consumers, especially poor consumers, who might end up paying a bit more, and industry, especially small businesses, to transition and gain the best awareness they can as to substitutes, which we can show are better overall.


One further note on that in passing: honourable members need to know that South Australia was the pioneer in this place. Some of the definitions around biodegradability and compostability have moved on since then, and all of us in this place maybe should be suggesting that South Australia and other states really look at that fund that this government put aside recently, in the last budget, to assist all the states to upgrade their laws and achieve harmony between the different laws to make sure that we don't end up with that impact of different laws and red tape across different states.


And I want to point out that some of the numbers in this motion I think might not be quite right. One bag per person per day—in other words, about 20 million bags a day—was certainly what some studies showed about 10 years ago. More recent studies showed that it's probably about halved since then, and mostly that's due to education and awareness around the community, as well as some of the bans that have already been instituted in some of the minor jurisdictions.


In conclusion, I want to express very fine sentiments with respect to this motion. If honourable members come to me, for instance, with a firm proposal to put some resources behind the research and evidence gathering done on plastic bags and, in particular, their substitutes—which is very possible with the agencies out there—which helps the industry, potentially, and small business in particular to transition. In that way we won't inadvertently undermine the competitive neutrality between different retailers or between big and small businesses and their ability to transition. It also helps the states to achieve uniform, consistent laws across the country, which then would very likely attract cross-party support, including from me, because it would have the makings of a genuine, workable way forward.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (17:04):  I rise to speak in support of the motion by the member for Mayo on plastic bags and commend her for it. I'm old enough to remember a time before we brought our shopping home in lightweight plastic bags, when the shop assistant carefully packed the goods into a large brown paper bag. Now, I know brown paper bags don't have a good history in Queensland, because they were always breaking, if the goods were too heavy, or disintegrating, if the cold goods turned the paper soggy. Lightweight plastic bags were a revolution—easy to carry and very strong—but few turned their minds to what would happen to those plastic bags after we used them or reused them.


Australians use an astounding five billion bags a year. In Queensland alone, 900 million single-use plastic shopping bags are used annually. What happens to those 900 million bags? The majority end up in landfill, where they will take up to 1,000 years to biodegrade. Shamefully, 16 million of them end up as litter. Not only does that make our community spaces untidy but plastic bags are ingested by wildlife. The plastic doesn't break down in an animal's digestive system and can actually cause it to starve. Ninety per cent of seabird species and 30 per cent of sea turtles have ingested plastic debris. As Queensland is home to the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, this is a shameful tragedy. The Great Barrier Reef is home to six of the world's seven species of marine turtle.


Polluting our precious environment is not only environmentally bad but also economically bad. The Great Barrier Reef is a huge drawcard for tourists in the Sunshine State, and experiencing the beautiful marine life is a highlight of any reef visit. Tourism directly and indirectly employs 225,000 Queenslanders and contributes nearly $13 billion to our economy.


The Queensland government has recognised the importance of protecting our natural resources like the Great Barrier Reef. In 2016, the Palaszczuk government released a discussion paper on implementing a ban of lightweight plastic bags. It received more than 26,000 submissions, and 96 per cent of the respondents supported introducing a ban and 60 per cent of respondents also supported widening the ban to include biodegradable bags. The Palaszczuk government has listened to Queenslanders. From 1 July this year, lightweight plastic shopping bags will be banned. I congratulate the Queensland Labor government for joining the other states and territories that have already banned plastic bags, but I especially congratulate Queensland for bravely going even further than the other states. Queensland is now leading the way by also including biodegradable bags under this ban. Biodegradable bans can be as dangerous for wildlife and as bad for the environment as lightweight plastic shopping bags. There are certain conditions that need to be met for biodegradable plastic bags to break down—firstly, a temperature of 50 degrees Celsius, which is not a temperature ever found in our oceans. As biodegradable bags don't float, they sink to the bottom of the ocean, where they will never be exposed to the UV rays that help break them down. In fact, the conditions necessary to break them down are never found anywhere. Instead, they just break into ever-smaller particles which make their way into our oceans, our waterways and our wildlife. So it makes sense to ban biodegradable bags. There is no sense moving away from harmful plastic shopping bags to just replace them with biodegradable bags that are only slightly less harmful. The Queensland government has allowed for a transition period before the ban comes into effect on 1 July. It is hoped that Queenslanders will wholeheartedly embrace the transition away from harmful plastic bags. I encourage my fellow Queenslanders to make the change to environmentally friendly, reusable bags—for example, like this one I'm holding. Do it today. There's no reason to wait until 1 July to stop using plastic bags. Make it a part of your shopping routine. Collect the reusable bags before you leave home or store them in your car. Don't forget them when you're going to the shops. It is better for the Queensland environment, it is better for our economy and, obviously, it's better for the planet.


I encourage the New South Wales state government, which is now, sadly—can you believe it?—the only state or territory government not to implement a ban on plastic bags, to not delay any further. It's just like the State of Origin: you can't beat us—but now, this time, you can join us.


Banning plastic bags is necessary. Plastic bags litter. They pose a real threat to the land and marine environments and, obviously, to our economy and the tourism associated with it. All Australians benefit from protecting our fragile environment. Again, I commend the member for Mayo for this motion.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (17:09):  When Windsor Public School student Lily Spies was nine years old last year, she did a project at school on single-use plastic bags and their impact on the environment. The harmful effects that they had so moved her that, like the member who moved this motion, she saw something had to be done. She was a key speaker at Hawkesbury City Council when it considered a motion last July to ban plastic bags. The motion was successful, and there was a commitment by the council to advocate at a state and federal level for a ban. Lily—more to the point—now 10, has not stopped her campaigning to address environmental issues in her school and also at a local government level and in the wider community. She's inspired. Her work has been noticed, and it was a delight to be there to see Lily as a co-winner of the Environmental Award at the Hawkesbury City Council's Australia Day Awards—and all because Lily saw that plastic bags were not the way to go.


Like Lily, many people of the Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains area have long been committed to protecting our beautiful local environment. There's no doubt that the use of plastic bags in local businesses and supermarkets has come to the forefront, and there's already action being taken. I know many of us here have talked about remembering the pre-plastic bag days—that does date us—when you did get a paper bag for your groceries. Organisations such as the Hawkesbury Environment Network, the Ban the Bag Blue Mountains group, Boomerang Bags, in both the Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains, and local councillors in both the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury have all been vocal and committed to phasing out the use of plastic bags in our area.


Many of our retailers already offer paper and cloth bags, in spite of there being no all-over New South Wales policy on this. I must note the great effort by the Springwood Chamber of Commerce and the shopkeepers there, who, as part of their 'shop local' push, have come up with a local, cloth bag that people can use time and time again. They, and many others in my electorate of Macquarie, know that the plastic bags stocked at the checkout and stowed away under our sinks have far-reaching impacts when they hit our environment. The estimated 520 million bags that Australians use each day contribute to the 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic in our oceans. I don't need to explain the devastating impact that it has on wildlife, and I think a simple photo of a sea turtle that has ingested plastic really says it all. A third of our sea turtles and half of our seabirds have ingested plastic, according to the CSIRO. Indeed, our community groups, our businesses and the government initiatives that have already occurred in some states recognise the importance of removing plastic from the natural environment. We already spend around $4 million a year, by the way, to clean up littered bags.


Most Australian states have made a move. South Australia was the first to enact the ban in 2009, so that's nearly a decade of a ban. Under their plan, the plastic bags of less than 35 microns in thickness, with handles, were prohibited. This left shoppers with a choice: to either bring their own reusable bags to the counter or pay up to 25 cents per biodegradable bag. It's a pretty simple scheme. Since then, the South Australian Environmental Protection Authority has estimated that the measures have resulted in 400 million fewer plastic bags in that state. These changes were welcomed by the people of South Australia, with nine in 10 shoppers choosing to take reusable bags to the supermarket after the ban.


The ACT has followed suit in banning non-biodegradable bags in 2010. They've found that the ban has reduced the volume of plastic bag waste in landfill by a third. And I certainly know I have to remember to take my green bags with me when I do my shop before parliament sits for a week. When reviewing the ban in 2013, the ACT government found that almost three-quarters of constituents wanted to keep the ban in place. So New South Wales remains the only state that refuses to commit to banning the bag, with both Queensland and Western Australia having recently come on board.


It doesn't need to be something that is left purely to the states. We, as a federal parliament, should be actively improving how we look after the environment and working with the states so that there's no reason we couldn't achieve a national ban by the end of the year. I'm quite aware that this isn't necessarily the most exciting piece of environmental legislation, but it is one that we know would make a difference. I think encouraging these changes is something that this parliament can do.

:



In respect of the Prime Minister's election promise that every Australian would have access to the NBN by 2016, (a) why has the rollout in regional and rural areas, including in the electoral division of Richmond, been delayed by up to three years, (b) why will over 30,000 premises in the electoral division of Richmond not have access to the NBN for more than two years, (c) why are there delays in regional and rural Australia, and (d) what measures is the Minister taking to address these delays.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2018-02-05,"




Mr Fletcher:

The amended answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:



The Australian Government has put the National Broadband Network (NBN) on track to provide high‑speed broadband services to every home and business in Australia by 2020. This is much quicker than would have been the case under the previous Government. The Strategic Review released just a few months after the September 2013 election showed that the project was in a fundamentally worse position than the previous Government had at any time disclosed to Parliament or the Australian public. Three years into the rollout it was two years behind schedule. At that time the then Shareholder Ministers for NBN Co Limited (nbn) advised that the accumulated delays and state of the nbn company meant the Government's aim of ensuring nationwide access to fast broadband by 2016 could not be achieved.


(a) The rollout in regional and rural areas has not been delayed. By 7 September 2017, 81 per cent of homes and businesses outside major urban areas were in ready for service areas or had network construction underway. The rollout to homes and businesses to be served by fixed wireless and satellite is particularly advanced, with over three‑quarters of premises to be served by fixed wireless now able to order services and all premises eligible for satellite across the country able to connect to Sky Muster satellite services since April 2016.


(b) It is not correct that there will be 30,000 premises awaiting NBN access in the electorate of Richmond in two years' time. As at 7 September 2017, just under 37,000 homes and businesses, were already able to access services in the electorate. By the end of 2018 just over 21,000 additional premises are expected to be in ready for service areas with the remaining premises (fewer than 8,000 homes and businesses) mainly expected to be able to order services during the first half of 2019. This means that almost all premises in the electorate of Richmond will be able to connect to an NBN service by the middle of 2019.


(c) As noted above, the rollout is progressing very well in regional Australia. Naturally there are some changes in timing as nbn coordinates the massive logistics involved in a project of this size. Since 2017, nbn has been advising when locations can expect to be able to order services. Prior to that, the company had been advising when network construction would commence. There is an intrinsic time gap between these two points as in most cases network construction begins well before services will become available.


(d) The Government has already taken prudent steps to allow the network to be rolled out as quickly as possible. This has included giving nbn flexibility in network design, installing a highly experienced board and management team and providing ongoing funding through a loan to allow the company to focus on the rollout at this point in network construction.
