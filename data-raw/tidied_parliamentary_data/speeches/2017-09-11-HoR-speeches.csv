Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (10:01):  Today, I present the 15th report of the Petitions Committee for the 45th Parliament, together with 29 petitions and three ministerial responses to petitions previously presented.


The Petitions Committee is heartened to see that Australians from all across the country are raising their collective voices by petitioning the House about issues that matter to them and to their communities.


The petitions that I present to the House today include eight paper petitions and 21 electronic petitions. The topics of these petitions encompass community concerns about issues including electricity prices, same-sex marriage, family violence and tertiary education. To demonstrate the spectrum of views presented in petitions put before the Petitions Committee, I present petitions today which reflect both sides of the climate change debate.


This report includes three petitions the committee has received about climate change, coordinated by a group called Micah, a coalition of churches and Christian organisations. These petitions are identical, except that they originate from different electorates around Australia. The committee has received 15 of these petitions to date, containing a total of over 13,000 signatures, which will all be referred to the environment minister for response.


This initiative is a great example of individuals and communities joining together to engage with the parliament about a matter that they care deeply about.


The committee wants to help Australians to better connect with the petitions process, by making it easier for them to petition the House online.


To this end, the committee continues to seek feedback from petitioners and other stakeholders, for its inquiry into the House electronic petitions system.


I am pleased to report that the committee received more than 100 responses to the survey launched in the last week, on the committee's webpage. These survey responses will prove extremely valuable, as the committee formulates its recommendations for future enhancements to the e-petitions process.


I will continue to provide updates to the House on the work of the Petitions Committee and the inquiry into e-petitions.

Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (10:04):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth, I wish to make a statement concerning the committee's inquiry into the trade system and the digital economy. Trade drives economic growth and is now being done in different ways. The digital economy is an important part of how our business will operate into the future, yet Australia is losing digital innovators to overseas.


The new economy poses new challenges for market access restrictions, intellectual property rights, cybersecurity and data privacy. Australians now live and trade in a digital world and a global economy. This means that our trade system needs to both enable and protect Australians online in a way that it did not need to 10 years ago.


Industry is also turning to digital solutions to modernise their supply chain. For example, blockchain tools are digitising shipping, providing end-to-end supply-chain transparency, and our trade systems need to be forward-thinking enough to cope with these new technologies. It is a paddock-to-the-plate approach to trade.


This inquiry will look at whether our trade system is meeting the needs of the digital economy and if there are any changes we need to make and how we are to undertake trade negotiations to make sure we drive growth in this sector. We are keen to hear from digital innovators—from start-ups and digital disrupters to established online platforms. We want to hear what the barriers to trade are that the government needs to address. What are the challenges they face and how can we keep them working for Australia? We also want to hear from the business sector on cyber-resilience and what more needs to be done to support them.

Mr MORTON
 (Tangney) (10:06):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I present the committee's report entitled The strategic importance of Australia's Indian Ocean Territories, together with minutes of proceedings.


I have to say: without any hint of bias, we have some of the most spectacular coastlines along Western Australia.


It may be a common perception that Australia's western boundary is the beautiful coast of Western Australia.


In actual fact, the westernmost reaches of Australia are the boundaries created by the Indian Ocean Territories, that are closer to our Indonesian neighbours than they are to the Australian mainland.


Despite the distance, the small sun-drenched communities of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands remain uniquely Australian.


The deep connection of the local communities to their diverse ethnic and cultural heritage complements their Australian way of life.


As part of the inquiry, I was fortunate to join my committee colleagues meeting with local communities on Christmas Island, West Island and Home Island to see this beautiful corner of our nation.


While many Australians may associate the region as a key plank of Australia's defence and border protection activities, the committee's inquiry also highlighted vibrant communities, deeply committed to Australian values.


The present inquiry and report is quite different to those carried out previously by this committee.


While several previous inquiries have examined economic and governance issues in the Indian Ocean Territories, the purpose of our inquiry has been to take a step back and to consider these territories from a broader, strategic perspective.


In this process, the committee has affirmed that the recommendations of previous reports remain as relevant as ever.


The present inquiry reinforces and builds on the work of earlier committees.


This inquiry, referred by the Minister for Local Government and Territories in November last year, considered a number of issues.


The inquiry canvassed the changing regional security environment and security contingencies in the Indian Ocean region—home to growing economies and an important trade route for Australia. The region is witnessing growing competition among major powers and these rapidly expanding interests in the region require a deeper understanding of this dynamic strategic environment.


Heightened activity in the region brings both opportunities and challenges for Australia.


In hearing evidence, the committee concluded that Australia's Indian Ocean Territories play a vital role in Australia's engagement with the broader Indo-Pacific region, extending our strategic reach well beyond the Australian mainland.


We heard that this dynamic region is undergoing significant changes.


To ensure that the parliament continues to engage with the Indian Ocean Territories from a strategic perspective, the committee has been keen to ensure that this committee conducts a similar inquiry on a regular basis—and in our report we have suggested five years as an appropriate time frame.


The committee considered Australia's strategic infrastructure assets on the islands, particularly those that further Australia's defence capabilities. In particular, the upgrade of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Airport runway, and the development of medium- and long-term solutions for the Christmas Island Warf.


The committee's report also recognises the importance of continued and strengthened engagement with regional partners through bilateral and multilateral exercises with regional partners. Such operations will ensure Australia continues to contribute to broader regional stability.


Noting the strategic importance of the islands, the committee recommended that the Australian government consider extending these capabilities in the Indian Ocean Territories, potentially through activities including surveillance, naval patrols, a military reserve or cadet unit, and training exercises.


The committee recommended that, where possible, the Australian government and its agencies engage with the local community, businesses and suppliers of goods and services, considering proposals for funding and planning on the islands.


Through its inquiry, the committee had the opportunity to hear from a wide variety of stakeholders.


These included Australian government agencies and analysts with a deep understanding of the defence and strategic considerations that underpin Australia's commitment to the Indian Ocean Territories.


On behalf of the committee, I thank all organisations and individuals who contributed to the inquiry by making written submissions or appearing at our hearings and roundtable discussions.


I wish to also thank my committee colleagues, who in engaging with the inquiry brought a range of perspectives and experiences to the report and the inquiry process more broadly.


In particular, I would like to thank the member for Berowra and Senator McCarthy who also took part in the committee's visit to the Indian Ocean Territories.


Finally, the committee thanks the residents of the Indian Ocean Territories who provided an important local perspective to this inquiry.


Their warm hospitality and candour provided the committee with a vital understanding of the region along with the challenges and opportunities that it presents.


The committee has a renewed understanding of the strategic importance of the Indian Ocean Territories, which we convey to the parliament and to the Australian government through this report.


I commend the report to the House.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (10:11):  Firstly, can I thank the member for Tangney for chairing the committee in the latter stages and for taking the committee to visit the Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Can I also thank his predecessor, the member for Canning, who initiated the inquiry and terms of reference and who left to go to a another committee. The member for Tangney replaced him and did it very adequately, and I thank him for the work he has done. I also thank the committee secretariat, who are sitting here in the parliament, for the work they have done. I also thank my committee colleagues, including my comrade to my left, the member for Canberra—she is not always on my left, but in this particular instance she is on my left. I want to thank her for her encouragement and engagement with the process, as a person with long-term and longstanding interests in territory matters generally, but particularly, of course, in the ACT. She has a longstanding interest in the Indian Ocean Territories.


The Indian Ocean Territories I'm familiar very familiar with, having been their member in this place since I first got elected here in 1987. I'm very familiar with the issues raised in this report. Of course, it is not the first time that issues to do with strategic matters relating to the Indian Ocean Territories have been discussed—not in this place but elsewhere. There have been elements of white papers previously, of course. We know that, historically, the First World War saw the sinking of the Emden by the mighty Australian Sydney off the Cocos Islands. The remains of that magnificent ship, the Emden, rest on the bottom near North Keeling Island in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. We know that both territories were occupied by the Japanese during the last war.


They have been places where those we have fought have seen opportunity, and they are important to us now because we've used them, for some time now, as transit points. During the respective Gulf Wars we had our major heavy lift aircraft fly through Cocos Islands on a regular basis. We know that the P-3 Orions fly through Cocos and, to a lesser extent, Christmas Island, and are stationed at Cocos regularly. So they are seen as important in terms of our strategic interests, and that will be the case in the future. When we went through this inquiry, we heard a great deal from people with expertise in the areas of strategic and defence matters—including the Department of Defence—all of whom said that these island territories were of importance to Australia's strategic interests.


The recommendations of the report bear some consideration—and I'm sure they will be considered by the government and, hopefully, adopted—but I want to make a point about a couple of them, one of which concerns the development of infrastructure on the island territories. Certainly, in the case of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, there is a need to extend the runway and harden the runway. That needs to be done, but it needs to be done in consultation with the local communities. As other investment, where it happens, needs to be done on Christmas Island for similar purposes, there needs to be contemplation of engagement with the local community, where possible providing local community members with job opportunities and small-business opportunities. There's clearly a need for significant investment on the Cocos islands in particular, and to a lesser extent on Christmas Island.


We know that they are both important for Australia's surveillance of its territories. We now have naval vessels in and around those territories on a regular basis for our own border protection purposes. The people on the islands are very receptive to Defence Force personnel and to engaging with Defence Force personnel. Indeed, some argued for the development of a cadet unit on Christmas Island and on the Cocos islands. That's potentially going to be difficult, I suspect, but nevertheless it shows the level of interest from people on the island territories around accepting their role as part of the broader Australian community and as Australian citizens, and they need to be commended for that.


They are a wonderful people, and it's in our strategic interests to make sure that those two communities remain viable in the long term. That means that other investments, not directly to do with defence, are undertaken. We need to make sure that the long-term economic interests and economic development of those two island communities are at the forefront of our thinking when we're talking about our strategic interest, because, if we don't invest and don't continue to invest in their economic and social development, then we'll soon lose the vision which they have for themselves and we currently have for them also.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",IND,2017-09-11,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (10:28):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill seeks to amend the Fair Work Act 2009 to narrow the circumstances under which an enterprise agreement can be terminated when it has passed its nominal expiry date. Under the current act, an expired agreement that is still in force can be terminated unilaterally by the employer if the Fair Work Commission considers it appropriate and not contrary to the public interest. This bill would simply prevent the commission from terminating any agreement if it would result in less favourable terms and conditions for any employee covered by the agreement. It would also invalidate any decision of the Fair Work Commission to terminate an agreement since 22 April 2015 if the decision would not have met the new requirements in this bill.


This bill responds to significant concern about expired agreements being terminated by employers in order to force employees on to lower wages and conditions. The bill is necessary because the practice has become more common in recent years, particularly since the Fair Work Commission decision in Aurizon Operations Limited; Aurizon Network Pty Ltd; and Australia Eastern Railroad Pty Ltd on 22 April 2015. 


The Aurizon decision—which is how I will summarise it—more than two years ago is credited with creating a troubling precedent that has led to some employers resorting to what has been described as the 'nuclear option' of industrial tactics. In short, employers threaten to, and indeed do, go to the Fair Work Commission to terminate expired workplace agreements and return workers to less generous awards rates. Faced with this, workers are forced onto less favourable enterprise agreements, thereby losing the wages and conditions they and others had fought for over many decades. As far as negotiating tactics go, they don't come any stronger or more potent.


Regrettably, transport, power and mining businesses have wholeheartedly embraced this nuclear option. And in the fallout workers have lost thousands of dollars in pay and had their leave cut, and in some cases regional communities and towns have been left devastated.


In the 2015 Aurizon decision, the full bench of the Fair Work Commission ordered that a number of expired enterprise agreements covering Aurizon and its employees would terminate the following month. The commission found that the termination of the agreements was not contrary to the public interest and said that, 'the bargaining parties needed to set their attention on appropriate terms and conditions of employment that focussed, not on the past, but on the circumstances that prevail in 2015 and those which are foreseeable beyond'.


In essence, this decision significantly shifted the commission's approach to the termination of agreements that have reached their nominal expiry date but are still in force. As a result, a string of cases have followed where employers have successfully applied to the Fair Work Commission to rip up expired enterprise agreements despite justified protests from unions and workers. These include the high-profile case of Griffin Coal. In that instance, wages were slashed by 43 per cent and this cut retrospectively applied to accrued annual leave and long-service leave. As you can imagine, the impact of this decision on the town of Collie in Western Australia has been devastating. It's not just individuals, but whole communities, who are suffering due to this loophole which must be closed.


Today, sadly, the termination of agreements in the Fair Work Commission is commonplace. Hard-won wages and conditions are being driven down and employers enjoy a massive unfair advantage in negotiations for new agreements. Indeed the Aurizon precedent has been blamed for a reported explosion of enterprise agreement terminations from 156 in 2014, to 517 in 2016.


These are obviously troubling statistics, in a time of record low-wages growth, particularly when you consider that each of the hundreds of terminated agreements potentially represent entire workforces, or communities as in the case of Collie, driven onto lower wages and conditions. We can't allow this to go on. We can't have workers going backwards. We don't want nuclear warfare in our enterprise bargaining. This is not the path to productivity. This is not the path to fairness.


Which brings me back to the bill I present today, because the simplest approach to stopping employers from using the nuclear option, is for this parliament to change the law as it applies to termination of expired enterprise bargaining agreements.


This bill would create a level playing field for employees and employers because it would prevent the Fair Work Commission from terminating an agreement if it would result in employees going backwards. It would also invalidate any decision of the commission to terminate an agreement since the Aurizon decision in 2015 if the subsequent decisions would not have met the new requirements in this bill.


Just last month, in a landmark decision that sent shockwaves across the country, Murdoch University became the first public institution to use the nuclear option, when the Fair Work Commission ended the enterprise agreement covering staff at that Western Australian university. Of course this was a devastating and shocking move by Murdoch University for the individual workers who now face the real possibility of lessened conditions including significant cuts to salaries, super contributions and leave.


But it is also a decision with wider ramifications and one that will send a shiver down the spine of staff at universities around the country—including at the University of Tasmania where staff are working under the shadow of an expired enterprise agreement. Yes, Murdoch University has agreed to maintain some workplace conditions for six months, but the National Tertiary Education Union is predicting dire consequences for staff including cuts to salaries of between 20 and 30 per cent; cuts to superannuation contributions of up to 17 per cent; reductions of redundancy payments of up to 80 per cent; the withdrawal of paid parental leave; and the loss of two days of personal leave.


How are staff at Murdoch University supposed to negotiate a new enterprise agreement in this situation when the employer has its finger ready at the trigger? Frankly it's a terrible power imbalance that gives employers a most formidable weapon and puts staff between a rock and a hard place. Of course there will be enormous pressure on workers, trying to bargain in this unfair environment, to sign onto new agreements with lesser conditions than they would have accepted had they been negotiating on a level playing field. No wonder the NTEU has been inundated with emails from concerned staff from Murdoch since the decision a few weeks ago. No wonder staff at other universities, including at UTAS in my electorate, are watching on in fear. What a terrible situation to put workers in.


Shamefully, sitting on the sidelines cheering on Murdoch University is Education Minister Simon Birmingham, who is cutting the teaching budgets of universities nationally. He would be relishing the prospect of up to 30 universities across the country cutting staff costs using the threat of terminated enterprise agreements.


Surely this is an unintended consequence of the Fair Work Act, one that is being used as a weapon against employees. The rules of fair play have been broken and it's just too easy at the moment for employers to undercut their workers' wages and conditions. Frankly the Aurizon precedent has opened a door that must be shut.


The aim of the Fair Work Act is to achieve productivity, and fairness, through an emphasis on enterprise bargaining. The bill I present to the parliament this morning would help achieve that because it would simply return us to the original aim of the act. In other words it would help recreate a more level playing field for workers, and their employers, by returning the emphasis to fairness and productivity.


There's nothing complicated about any of this. The bill would simply prevent the Fair Work Commission from terminating an agreement if it would result in less favourable terms and conditions for any employee covered by the agreement. It would also invalidate any decision of the Fair Work Commission to terminate an agreement since 22 April 2015 if the decision would not have met the new requirements in the bill.


In closing, I thank the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the National Tertiary Education Union for their advice on this bill as well as their support and advocacy on behalf of workers. It's my hope now that the government, and the opposition, will put their political self-interest aside and focus on the public interest and get behind this bill that we have before the parliament today.


I also thank the member for Melbourne for seconding this bill, and for his tireless efforts fighting for workers' rights. Once again it's left to the crossbench to stand up for sensible reform.


It's time the Fair Work Act lived up to its name, and intent, and I urge the parliament to support this bill.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (11:11):  I move:


That this House:


(1) supports the right of Israel to defend its citizens against terrorist attacks by organisations or by individuals;


(2) calls on the Palestinian Authority to cease incitement of its population to attack Israel and Israelis;


(3) further calls on the Palestinian Authority to take seriously the task of educating its people on the options, process and potential for peace;


(4) urges the Palestinian Authority to abide by the Oslo Accords and specifically to cease attacking Israel in an unfounded manner in international forums;


(5) further urges the Israel and the Palestinian Authority to return to negotiations in good faith and without preconditions;


(6) acknowledges and affirms the Jewish connection to the Jewish holy sites in Jerusalem and elsewhere in Israel; and


(7) condemns the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement as inherently anti-Semitic and calls on all Australian political parties and institutions to disavow it.


The road to peace for Israel is long and it's hard and it shouldn't be. Israel is the only free democracy in the Middle East. It's the only country that guarantees, respects and lives by the great liberal democratic principles of freedom of speech, of expression of gathering, of protests and all the norms we take for granted. Israel is the light in, at times, a dark place. You would think that peace would flow seamlessly from this. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and there remains too much opposition and oppression against Israel, not only in parts of Australia but also across elements of the international community.


Accordingly, as the chairman of the Australian Parliamentary Israel Allies Caucus, I place this motion unequivocally before the House of Representatives of the Australian parliament to affirm that we in this parliament support the right of Israel to defend its citizens against terrorist attacks by organisations or by individuals. We call on the Palestinian Authority to cease incitement of its population to attack Israel and Israelis. We further call on the Palestinian Authority to take seriously the task of educating its people on the options, process and potential for peace. We urge the Palestinian Authority to abide by the Oslo accords and, specifically, to cease attacking Israel in an unfounded manner in international forums. We urge the Israeli and Palestinian Authorities to return to negotiations in good faith and without preconditions. We acknowledge and affirm the Jewish connection to the Jewish holy sites in Jerusalem and elsewhere in Israel, we condemn unequivocally and unilaterally the Boycott, Divestments and Sanctions movement as inherently anti-Semitic, and we call on all Australian political parties and institutions to disavow it. 


My considered view is that peace could be achieved relatively quickly if goodwill prevailed across the Middle East, but I fear that there are many obstacles to peace remaining, and the main obstacle is Palestinian intransience, an intransience I have witnessed firsthand and can speak to with some authority. The last 17 years have seen numerous efforts at peace. It's a matter of historical fact that in 2008 then Israeli PM Ehud Olmert made Palestinian Authority President Abbas a generous offer of a Palestinian state in all of Gaza and most of West Bank with land from inside Israel's pre-1967 borders to compensate for the rest so that ,after the land swaps, the Palestinians would receive the equivalent of 100 per cent of West Bank. There was to be a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem, shared sovereignty over the city's holy sites, and compensation for Palestinian refugees and their descendants with a very limited right for some of them to settle in Israel. As Abbas has recently confirmed, he rejected this offer out of hand. This was a far more generous offer than the one in 2000-01 where, with the involvement of Bill Clinton, peace offers to the Palestinians were again refused without even a counter-offer. Instead, Yasser Arafat launched his Intifada which saw a wave of terrorism take the lives of over 1,000 Israelis, and was only ended by Israeli security measures including checkpoints and the security barrier.


Furthermore, in 2005 Israel withdrew from the Gaza strip as a continuance of the process of engagement. Since then, Palestinians in Gaza have fired more than 10,000 rockets and mortars into Israel and have used vast amounts of international aid to construct elaborate tunnels from Gaza into Israel to facilitate planned mass terrorist attacks on the Israeli community. Israel has been forced to fight three wars to temporarily stop the rockets and destroy the tunnels. If the Palestinian Authority believe this is a road to peace, they are sorely mistaken.


Following the election of Benjamin Netanyahu as Israeli Prime Minister, Israel's effort for peace continued. In 2009, he instituted a 10-month total moratorium on the building of houses in the settlements. This would mean, of course, that young adults in settlements who wanted to move out of home were forced to move right away from their communities, from their families. It was, however, a confidence-building measure designed to encourage negotiations. Again, Abbas refused to talk for nine months and then only agreed in the last month to continue the moratorium.


In 2013 and 2014, Netanyahu yet again tried again with further confidence-building measure. He agreed to release in four quarterly instalments Palestinian prisoners who were in Israeli jails for murdering Israelis. Unfortunately, the talks did not prove fruitful. Martin Indyk, the US negotiator, said: 


Netanyahu moved to the zone of possible agreement. I saw him sweating bullets to find a way to reach an agreement.


He added: 


We tried to get Abu Mazen to the zone of possible agreement but we were surprised to learn he had shut down. We were ready to go beyond policy positions the U.S. had taken on the core issues to bridge the gaps and resolve it, and therefore there was something in it for him – and he didn’t answer us. Abbas [effectively] checked out of the talks in mid-February.


The talks ultimately failed when Abbas decided that he would instead seek a unity government with the terror organisation Hamas, something which is not acceptable to Israel and much of the international community. Netanyahu has continued on several occasions to re-affirm his support for a Palestinian state and offered to meet and negotiate anywhere, at any time, without pre-conditions. Abbas, unfortunately, has failed to take up the offer. 


So the question has to be asked: why is there this intransigence by the Palestinian Authority? There are many reasons. Could it be that a peace deal would actually mean a genuine acceptance of Israel's right to exist, including an undertaking that there would be no further claims against Israel and that the refugees and millions of their descendants—also regarded as refugees, under a definition unique only to Palestinians—could settle in the new Palestinian state but there would be no right of return to Israel?


What we as legislators have to accept is that governments have a responsibility to deliver peace, security and the basis for prosperity for their people. This is what this motion calls on the Palestinian Authority to do; it calls on them to responsibly govern. Since negotiations last broke down, in 2014, the Palestinians have now pursued a strategy of using various international organisations, from the UN down, to put pressure on Israel and have sought to gain recognition of their state from as many governments and bodies as possible. In this way, they hope to avoid having to make the compromise necessary for a genuine peace and to be awarded their state in a way that enables them to continue to make claims against Israel, including the right to return. This is recipe not for peace but for continuing conflict.


At the same time, the Palestinian Authority has continued to incite and encourage terrorism against Israel. This has included the Palestinians calling for Israeli blood to be shed to defend the Temple Mount from non-existent Israeli plans to, apparently, change the status quo. This particular call led to the car and knife attacks which have killed over 40 Israelis since late 2015 and wounded hundreds of others. At other times, the incitement and encouragement is more general but just as pernicious—such as awarding generous lifetime pensions to terrorists captured by Israel or to the families of terrorists who are killed, and naming streets, facilities and even children's soccer tournaments after terrorists. I have personally witnessed the faces of suicide bombers displayed from multiple streetlights within the Palestinian territory as a form of acknowledgement—in the same way that we acknowledge events or amazing achievements in Australia by hanging faces or flags from our streetlights. This is not taking the Palestinian people on a journey to accepting peace. This is entrenching the intransigence and the horrible status quo.


Supporting the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state just encourages these destructive Palestinian tactics. As long as they are able to believe that they just need to keep doing more of the same to achieve a state, without any concession of Israel's right to exist, they will continue to do so. What is needed for peace is for the international community to make it clear to the Palestinians that they must cease their intransigence and support for terrorism if they wish to advance their cause, whilst making it clear also to Israel that it will be supported as long as it continues to negotiate in good faith.


Some cite settlements as a main obstacle to peace. While the settlements are certainly one of the more important issues that need to be resolved, they are not an obstacle. Even Palestinian leaders have admitted they occupy less than two per cent of the land in the West Bank. Since 2003 there have not been any new settlements established, although a new one has recently been announced to replace one that's being dismantled, and those that exist have not been expanded beyond their existing geographic boundaries. Furthermore, most growth in the settlement populations have been in settlements that it is generally accepted Israel will keep as part of land swaps in any peace agreement. Thus, it is simply incorrect to say that the growth in settlements is in any way compromising the chance of a two-state peace. The settlements did not prevent Israel making its generous offers of Palestinian statehood in 2000 and 2001 and again in 2008.


The so-called boycott, divestment and sanctions movement is completely and utterly condemned as inherently anti-Semitic, and I call on all Australian political parties and institutions to disavow it immediately. There are challenges all over the world, but it's only to Israel that such racist hatred is directed. Charles Krauthammer writes well when he says:


And don't tell me this is merely about Zionism. The ruse is transparent. Israel is the world's only Jewish state. To apply to the state of the Jews a double standard that you apply to none other, to judge one people in a way you judge no other, to single out that one people for condemnation and isolation — is to engage in a gross act of discrimination.


This motion calls on all parties to return to the negotiating table, and I encourage them to do so.

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (11:21):  I second the motion and I congratulate the member for Fadden on moving this resolution. The issue of Israel defending its citizens against terrorist attacks by individuals or organisations would seem to be self-evidently sensible, but it affects the safety of people around the world because, of course, we all know that defending our populations against terrorism is indivisible in these days. The jihadist threat that is around the world doesn't exist just in Marseille or in parts of Marawi in the Philippines. It exists all over the world, and we need to confront it wherever it exists. Of course, from the point of view of equality and fairness, if a third of car rammings in the world are in Israel, we need to know this. It's a shame we don't, but the pioneering of jihadist violence against publics around the world often begins in Israel. What happens there is of great relevance all around the world.


We've seen the Palestinian Authority continue inciting its population over the last 10 years, a period where there should have been negotiations. Most people don't understand what that means. These jihadists terrorists are not unique in their methods. The car rammings, the stabbings et cetera that we've seen—we saw a terrible one recently where at a Sabbath Friday evening meal an 18-year-old terrorist came into the house of a person who was having a ceremony for the welcoming of their grandson and stabbed three of the family to death. The odious thing about this, as the member for Fadden pointed out, is that the Palestinian Authority pays incentives, usually from international relief funds that they get, to people and their families who are involved in these things. If they get killed, the family gets the pension. If not, they do. It's estimated that a third of the PA's budget is spent on these odious pensions to terrorists or their families. And of course this only encourages—incentivises—people to do these kinds of things. It's an absolute shame. 


This resolution also has an important point about acknowledging the Jewish connection with the holy sites in Jerusalem and elsewhere in Israel. Recently UNESCO, to its eternal shame, classified the Old City of Jerusalem as a Muslim site only. For the great city of Jerusalem we have to respect all of the great Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. History doesn't change because of a bunch of countries that make these ridiculous decisions in Geneva. The Temple Mount in Jerusalem existed 600 years before the forming of Islam. So it's absolutely and self-evidently crazy for UNESCO to decree the city which Christianity and Judaism have as their holy city as a solely Islamic city without acknowledging the affinity which that place existed with long before those days.


Let me conclude with some points on the BDS. The founder of the BDS, Omar Barghouti, makes it very clear that the aim of this program is not—not—to change this or that Israeli policy. He makes it clear that the aim of the BDS is to replace, to eliminate, Israel 'from the river to the sea', as the extremists say. So this is not only aesthetically revolting and politically revolting; we have in the leaflets of this BDS movement that Estee Lauder and Vidal Sassoon should be boycotted. What do Estee Lauder and Vidal Sassoon have in common with a political campaign against Israel? They don't have anything in common with it. They're Jewish firms that are international. Both happen to be in the cosmetic area.


It's outrageous. It's a perpetuation of the 1930s for this movement to continue that kind of behaviour. I pay tribute to some of my colleagues, Wayne Swan, Kevin Rudd, Premier Andrews and David Feeney, who all joined me at anti-BDS sit-ins at the chocolate shops all around Australia, and Max Brenner.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2017-09-11,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (11:26):  I would like to begin by thanking Stuart Robert, the member for Fadden, for bringing this motion to the attention of the House, and particularly for standing up for the rights and freedoms of the state of Israel, which have too often been ignored in this place.


The reality is that as a nation we have allies: allies who stand with us through thick and thin and whom we should reciprocate with. Israel is one of those states that should continue to enjoy the support of this country and this government and will continue to do so. My only hope is that we can say the same at some future point, should there be another government of a different political persuasion, because the reality is that we know there is not the same commitment as often sits on this side of the House. Every member of this side of the House believes strongly in the right of Israel to exist, to exist freely, to exist without threat or intimidation and to be able to provide a homeland for the Jewish people. I can say, as a member of this House with an electorate which has a very high percentage of the Jewish community in Melbourne, that my position is resolute and uncompromising.


In the end, the heart of this debate and this issue is whether we, as a nation, stand for enlarging the freedom of all people to live their lives in safety and peace. There are many other debates where we take a very similar position and should continue to do so. Having visited Jerusalem myself, I have seen the consequences firsthand of what happens when some people seek to deny that liberty and that peace—particularly some of the efforts of the Palestinian authorities and those who support them to deceive the public, or to make misrepresentations or to create misunderstanding about what actually occurs, particularly under the state of Israel.


In fact, on one of my visits to Israel many years ago, we were given a briefing about the activities of Palestinian Media Watch. This organisation scrutinised Palestinian media in particular and how they sought to misrepresent information to build a perception of victimhood that was not always in accordance with reality. Sometimes these examples can bring a certain degree of scepticism. I myself, being a first-time visitor, brought scepticism to some of the claims that were presented to me until we went to Bethlehem. We went to a refugee camp to speak directly to Palestinians about some of the challenges that they faced.


While we were there, we saw a group of young children throwing rocks at IDF soldiers. This eventually escalated to the point where the IDF tear gassed. I can say that I can tick off being tear gassed by the IDF on my bucket list. That's not a point of humour: it's just a point of reality, and anybody else who has been tear gassed will know that it's not a particularly pleasant experience. But the critical point came afterwards. What we saw were misrepresentations in the Palestinian media that we were attacked by the IDF. That was not true. In fact, they were provoked by those who were encouraged to throw rocks and commit violence against IDF soldiers, who then acted to defend themselves. This is just one of many examples where we see misrepresentations to try to build a sense of sympathy with the Palestinian cause—which I think many people have, but it should be rooted in facts and reality.


I have previously spoken in this chamber about my frustration with the conduct of UNESCO in trying to deny and erase from history the connection between Jewish people and the Temple Mount. If you look at the effort made by some people who want to disconnect that relationship, it amounts to a cultural genocide of people's past and their connection, and we should not be ashamed or afraid to call it out. I acknowledge the select number of members opposite who are prepared to do that for making the same principle. As somebody who has Armenian heritage and knows exactly what it means to have had not just an actual genocide but a cultural genocide against their people, I say we must remain determined always to stand up against these measures, because it's not just about erasing people; the intention is to erase people's memory and legacy and the culture and traditions that inform them and continue to inform their future.


Finally, in giving my support very strongly to this motion, I want to reflect on the ongoing discussion about whether our embassy should be based in Jerusalem. As a proud supporter of Israel, a proud supporter of recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and a proud Australian, I can see no reason that we should not be able to relocate our embassy to Jerusalem, on the basis that it is safe for Australians..

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (11:31):  I thank the member for Fadden for raising this important issue in the parliament today. Israel and Australia as we know, have had warm relations and strong economic ties due to our strong people-to-people links and our commercial relationship. The trade between our two nations is worth around $1.2 billion. We cooperate internationally with Israel in many fields, including international development assistance. Importantly, this includes Australian international development assistance in Gaza and the West Bank, which supports human development, institution building and economic growth, which is so critical for peace in that region.


As a new member of this place, I rise today to add my support as a strong supporter of Israel and, of course, as a strong supporter of the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As we know, former Labor leader HV 'Doc' Evatt, as President of the United Nations General Assembly from 1948 to 1949, was prominent in the negotiations that led to the creation of Israel. Evatt wrote in his memoirs:


I regard the establishment of Israel as a great victory of the United Nations.


Earlier this year I had the pleasure of visiting Israel as part of a delegation alongside other new members of this place. It was an honour to visit and be guided by experts through a series of in-depth meetings alongside parliamentary colleagues, officials, academics, union and community leaders, and other Israeli and Palestinian representatives.


This year represents the 100th anniversary since British politician Arthur Balfour, later Lord Balfour, presented a declaration of the British government stating the case for the Jewish homeland. 2017 is also the 90th anniversary of the Zionist Federation of Australia, and I'd like to welcome and acknowledge those with us today in the gallery, including ZFA President Dr Danny Lamm, Secretary Mr Sam Tatarka, former President Dr Ron Weiser, and my good friend the President of the State Zionist Council of Queensland chair, Mr Tony Leverton, who are with us today.


Many people in our party and indeed across this chamber, like many people across the world, care deeply about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and are concerned about the ongoing conflict. The starting point of the conflict between Israel and Palestine is self-determination for Jews in Israel and for Palestinians in Palestine. Acceptance of the rights of both peoples, indigenous to the same land, means the only way forward must be for the two parties to negotiate an agreed outcome, recognising both peoples' links to the land and especially the Jewish people's 3,000-year ties to Jerusalem. In my opinion, unilateral recognition does nothing to aid negotiation. Indeed, it only hardens the positions of those in conflict. For all those of us who hold true to the values of the rule of law and negotiated resolution of disputes, there can no place for terrorism in achieving statehood for the Palestinians. The march to statehood for Palestinians, as it does for Israeli Jews, includes preparing their population for peace, acceptance of the two states living side by side in peace and recognition of the holy places of Jewish, Christian and Islamic history in the area. It means free trade unions in the region, a free media and free speech, and the rights of people of all genders and religious persuasions to live freely and without fear. 


I note that the member for Fadden spoke of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement. Labor rejects the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign against Israel, and I add my voice to rejecting the BDS campaign. 


I recognise that both Israelis and Palestinians will need to make hard concessions, but conflict is not winner take all. Those who seek Israel's destruction give terrible, false hope to Palestinians. That is the lesson of so many years of wars fought between Israel and its neighbours. We seek the day when the legitimate rights and aspirations of both Jews and Palestinians to live side by side in peace will come. That can and must come from both sides negotiating directly. Two peoples in one land takes discussion and dialogue. 


Labor, whether in government or in opposition, will continue to work with the parties within the conflicts, our allies and the wider international community to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Alongside my Labor colleagues, we remain committed to peace in that region. I particularly acknowledge the good work and advocacy, over many years, of my good friend the member for Melbourne Ports, Michael Danby. I salute all of the work he has done for many years, and I welcome the opportunity to enter the debate today.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2017-09-11,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (11:36):  I rise today in support of the motion put forward by the member for Fadden in respect of Israel's right to defend its citizens against terrorist attacks. I am reminded that Australia has had a long involvement with Israel. On 31 October, it will be the 100th anniversary of the charge of the Light Horse Brigade which led to the liberation of Jerusalem in December 1917. It shows that Australia has had a long involvement. 


It is a pleasure to support the member for Fadden and the work he has done in this space for a very long time. Ever since we entered the parliament in 2007—and I am sure he did it before that—he has been a strong supporter of the state of Israel and very vocal and committed in his beliefs. I would also like to acknowledge the member for Melbourne Ports, who has been a consistent advocate and supporter for the state of Israel. I know that during the time I have been in parliament he has never shied away from making his thoughts and ideas known about that particular issue. I would also like to thank the member for Fadden for his passionate speech on this issue, which I know he holds very close to his heart. 


Like all conflicts, the issues surrounding that of Palestine and Israel are complex. I strongly support the member for Fadden's calls for Israeli and Palestinian authorities to return to negotiations in good faith and without preconditions. Peace is the goal. I'm sure the member for Fadden and the member for Eden-Monaro, both of whom have served in our military forces, more than anyone, understand the pursuit of peace because they know how bad war can be. Congratulations to those two gentlemen. I am guessing the member for Eden-Monaro will be speaking on this? 




Dr Mike Kelly:
  Yes. 




Mr IRONS:
  Thank you. In 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip with the intention that Palestinians would be able to set-up a peaceful autonomous region within Israel. The expected flow-on effects of this were that it would lead to further withdrawal from the West Bank. Instead, the Palestinians retaliated with rocket and mortar fire, and the situation was further exacerbated when Hamas took over the Gaza Strip after a coup in 2007. Ten years on, Palestine has sought to use international organisations such as the United Nations to put pressure on Israel and to gain recognition of their state from as many government and non-governmental bodies as possible. In doing so, Palestine has avoided the need to compromise in the path to long-term and genuine peace whilst continuing to voice claims against Israel, particularly the claim to the right of return. As the member for Fadden has noted, this is not a recipe for peace but has continued to cause friction and encourage further conflict. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that, in the preceding 12 months, the General Assembly had adopted 20 resolutions critical of Israel compared to just one in response to the war in Syria, which has resulted in more than 250,000 people killed or driven from their homes. 


I would like to expand on this for the benefit of the chamber: the world has been shocked by the number of people displaced because of the conflict in Syria and Iraq. The brutality of the Assad regime and the Islamic extremists are an enormous threat to security within the region and to the safety of civilian populations. We have heard of indiscriminate violence, slaughter of innocent and unarmed civilians and continued persecutions of religious groups. 


On the other side of the world, the decisions of the North Korean military regime are deeply concerning. I encourage all states to consider their paths and move towards a peaceful future, which is what this motion that the member for Fadden has brought to the House is about. I echo the sentiments of the Prime Minister, from earlier this year, in saying that the coalition government will not support one-sided resolutions criticising Israel of the kind recently adopted by the UN Security Council. We deplore the boycott campaigns designed to delegitimise the Jewish state. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions—BDS—movement encourages conflict, allows for the persecution of civilians and is in no way an effective strategy to achieve peace within the region. In an article attacking the BDS campaign, Charles Krauthammer writes:


And don't tell me this is merely about Zionism. The ruse is transparent. Israel is the world's only Jewish state. To apply to the state of the Jews a double standard that you apply to none other, to judge one people in a way you judge no other, to single out that one people for condemnation and isolation—is to engage in a gross act of discrimination.


And discrimination against Jews has a name. It's called anti-Semitism.


It's a privilege to support the member for Fadden in his motion for peace.

"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro) (11:41):  I'm proud to be able speak in support of this motion, because it does reflect the unwavering support of both the coalition and Labor for the survival of Israel and its ability to live within secure and peaceful borders and for the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a state of their own. The honourable member referred to the centenary of Beersheba coming up. A number of us, from both sides of parliament, will be attending that ceremony. It will be a chance to, once again, highlight the relationship in two world wars between our soldiers and the Jewish community, who carefully looked after them. They provided welfare services, and members of my own family, in both world wars, benefited greatly from that. And it helped inform the policy of the Labor government, post-Second World War, to be a midwife to the creation of the state.


Creating the two-state solution requires being open-minded and keeping open eyes about the issues involved here. We have to acknowledge the issues and the impediments to achieving that outcome that exist on the Palestinian side. When I had the Middle East desk in strategy group, when I was still in the Army, I convinced the Howard government to send an Australian Army officer over to the Palestinian Authority to help build its security sector, as part of US General Ward's team. That was coming along reasonably well, until the 2006 elections when Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip. In 2007, as was mentioned, Hamas totally ousted any democratic form of institution that we were working on there or that existed, and we had to end that relationship because of our problems with Hamas.


This really highlights what is at the heart of those impediments. No democratic government in the Western world should have any business supporting an entity like Hamas, who routinely execute gay and lesbian men and women by throwing them off buildings, who have not had an election since 2006—in fact, we're 11 years into the four-year term of Mahmoud Abbas at the present time—and who repress free trade unions, routinely execute opponents and really oppress women in the Gaza Strip. No woman in Australia would have a good time living in the Gaza Strip as it exists at the present time.


We also have widespread corruption in the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which is really corrosive and undermining of their ability to set up governance institutions. So, when we talk about whether or not we should recognise a Palestinian state, we should understand that, under international law, their ability to do that does not exist at the present time because of the division between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. There's no ability for them to enter into international agreements that will be binding on the territories. Obviously, we need to have fresh elections. We need to maintain leverage in affording recognition to ensure that those key areas that we have grievances with over their human rights abuses should be addressed. These are genuine and real impediments.


Of course, there could have been a Palestinian state if the Arab leadership of the region had accepted the Partition Plan in 1947, all the way through to 1967. After 1967 it would have been possible had the surrounding neighbours accepted Israel's offer to hand back the territories, but, of course, the famous three noes—no peace, no recognition, no negotiation—were issued. There could have been a Palestinian state, as the member for Fadden highlighted, had there been acceptance of the offers on the table by Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert and, as has come to light most recently, by Senator John Kerry even.


So it has been the Palestinian leadership that has really done a disservice to the long-suffering Palestinian people. Our efforts should be directed at helping to build their capability to become a state, to overcome these impediments and to govern and to overcome their human rights issues.


I also fully endorse the Labor Party and coalition stance against the BDS campaign. It is, essentially, an anti-Semitic campaign. It carries dark resonance of the thirties, when they were out there daubing stars of David on business shopfront windows and the numerus clausus era in the universities of the age, when the number of Jews was limited or Jews were excluded from university education altogether. Universities, of all places, should be places where open and free debate should be conducted. It's been quite disgusting how many activities have been conducted to prevent free speech and to prevent the engagement, discussion and dialogue that should be essential to moving the peace process in the Middle East forward.


I urge support for this motion. I urge support for the state of Israel in its ongoing battle against the forces of evil and terrorism. We're engaged in the very same struggle. We are locked in those same trenches with our friends of Israel. We need also to advance the cause of peace.


Debate adjourned.

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (13:30):  This is a government that is failing regional Australians every single day, and nowhere more than in my state of Tasmania. This government fails on infrastructure in Tasmania, with no new funding in the 2017 budget. The only infrastructure funding for Tasmania was for old projects, many of them initiated by Labor.


They can't even get that right. The Midland Highway, which runs through my electorate, is a mess. It's being administered by the Hodgman state Liberal government. The road surfacing is a disgrace. It's being torn up and has to be done again. That's because this government is not doing its job properly with funding and with making sure that the state government in Tasmania does its job properly. The RACT's Darren Moody says that the funding failure from the federal budget is holding Tasmania back and will cost business and cost jobs.


This federal government is failing on health in Tasmania. There was a shambles of a regional health funding changeover from preventive health to chronic care—an absolute shambles. Even Liberal senators, who usually can't be seen or heard, were crying out about this shambles of a regional health funding changeover and what happened there. There was a petition that I presented to this parliament in the last sitting which had 550 signatures from people across my electorate who said that regional health funding was a shambles and they wanted their services back. There have been unexplained delays in the commencement for a trial site as to youth suicide. It is absolutely disgraceful, the way this government is failing regional Australians. (Time expired)

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (15:15):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2016 (second report), together with the minutes of proceedings, and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted.




Mr COLEMAN:
  On 1 August 2017 the RBA decided to leave official interest rates on hold at 1.5 per cent. In making this decision, the governor commented that 'holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time'.


At the public hearing held before the committee on 11 August 2017, the governor noted that the global economy has strengthened and, as a result, the RBA expects domestic economic conditions to improve. The RBA forecasts Australia's GDP growth to rise above two per cent in late 2017, to 2¾ to 3¾ per cent over the year to December 2018. Continued growth is being supported by accommodative monetary policy, an increase in LNG exports, and employment growth.


Underlying inflation is somewhat higher than late last year, and the RBA forecasts that it will reach around two per cent over the second half of 2017, at the bottom end of the RBA's target. Headline inflation is expected to lie between two and three per cent over the year to December 2019, with the consumer price index (CPI) forecast to rise to around two percent by the end of 2017.


Since its low point in January 2016, the Australian dollar has appreciated considerably against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis. The governor stated that the current exchange rate will 'contribute to subdued price pressures in the economy'. The governor added that an appreciating exchange rate would be expected to result in slower economic growth and inflation than currently forecast, and the exchange rate is an issue which continues to be of great interest to the RBA and the committee.


Since the beginning of 2017, around 165,000 full-time jobs have been created in Australia, average hours worked have increased, and labour force participation has risen. The RBA expects that the recent strong growth in employment and increased household income will support consumption growth, moderated by high levels of household debt and lower wage growth.


Business investment in Australia is expected to increase gradually as growth in demand increases. The RBA noted that conditions are currently favourable for stronger growth in business investment, including low interest rates and reduced tax rates for small and medium sized businesses.


Overall, Australia's economic growth outlook, according to the Reserve Bank, is positive, with the transition to lower levels of mining investment almost complete—and indeed we've seen the impact of that in recent business investment figures. Increases in the production of LNG are expected to help to contribute to GDP growth in Australia of between two and three per cent for the year to the end of 2017.


On behalf of the committee, I thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Lowe, and his colleagues for appearing at the hearing before our committee in Melbourne on 11 August 2017.


I commend the report to the House.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (15:18):  by leave—I concur with the member for Banks in thanking the governor and various representatives of the Reserve Bank for once again appearing before the House economics committee. It was a wide-ranging discussion of issues associated with monetary policy, energy policy, income, inequality and banking.


I do wish to make a few comments regarding the situation with the banking sector in Australia and energy policy. These are all contained in the committee's comprehensive report, particularly at page 17 of the report, where we were having a discussion with the Reserve Bank governor regarding the situation in the banking sector in Australia, most notably the allegations against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia that have been levelled by AUSTRAC in respect of breaches of Australia's anti-money-laundering and terrorism financing laws.


The governor made three important points in respect of banking culture in Australia. First he said:


On trust, I think it's fair to say that trust in banking has been strained.


…   …   …


On service: I think it's fair to say that service has taken a back seat to sales.


…   …   …


… I think we can all identify examples where the desire for short-term profit has probably led to not enough attention to risk management issues. So the focus needs to be on rebuilding trust and delivering high-quality service to customers, and a strong focus on risk management. Those are the things that we need to focus on.


From Labor's perspective, we totally agree with the Governor of the Reserve Bank. It's our view and certainly the view of the people of Australia that the best way to do that is to establish a royal commission into the banking industry in Australia to get to the bottom of exactly what's going on in this industry; uncover some of the scandals, the rip-offs and the hurt and financial pain that it's caused for many Australians; and have an independent arbiter look at the issues and put together a set of recommendations that a government could adopt to improve confidence, trust, stability and those issues that the Reserve Bank governor mentioned: trust, service and risk management in the Australian banking industry.


In respect of energy policy, there was a wide-ranging conversation with the Reserve Bank representatives about the parlous state of Australia's energy sector and the fact that energy prices have been increasing for some years and are putting a lot of stress on household budgets. The Reserve Bank governor made the point that it's becoming quite dire. He made the point very well that the major focus, the major factor, that's causing the problems in the energy sector in Australia is the lack of certainty regarding business investment. He said:


There is uncertainty about the policy environment and that is delaying investment. That is not in dispute. The investment uncertainty is not just in electricity generation; it's affecting investment decisions in other parts of the economy, because businesses aren't sure about the future price of electricity, so it's another reason to wait.


…   …   …


The higher prices of electricity are also affecting household budgets, particularly for lower income households, who spend a disproportionately high share of their income on electricity. It's crimping their budgets and having an effect on consumption, and it's going to have an effect on the CPI as well. So investment uncertainty, spending decisions and the CPI are the perspectives that we're looking at this from.


He went on to say:


… providing some certainty about the future structure of the electricity generation industry would be useful for the country, for investment, on prices and on household budgets.


That's not the Labor Party speaking there; that's the Reserve Bank governor of Australia, in many respects the chief economist in this country. That's his view of what is going on in Australia at the moment.


The lack of certainty with respect to energy policy that has been created by the Turnbull government is having a serious effect on business investment, business profitability and household budgets in this country. It is the fact that this Turnbull government argues amongst itself and can't make up its mind on a clean energy target that is having a massive effect on energy reliability, on investment in the industry and, ultimately, on households' budgets. The ball is well and truly in the government's court. It needs to come to a decision on a clean energy target.


Finally, the governor made important points, most notably about inequality:


It's a legitimate issue, people are rightly worried about it, but on many measures we're doing better than some other countries.


The wages share of income in this country has been falling for some decades now. In the last 10 years, the incomes of those in the top 10 per cent of the income brackets have grown by 72 per cent, whereas the incomes in the bottom tenth of Australian household income earners have grown by only 23 per cent. That statistic alone says it all about the state of income inequality in this country. It's a very real issue, and I'm glad the RBA governor pointed this out. I commend the report to the House.

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (15:15):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2016 (second report), together with the minutes of proceedings, and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted.




Mr COLEMAN:
  On 1 August 2017 the RBA decided to leave official interest rates on hold at 1.5 per cent. In making this decision, the governor commented that 'holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time'.


At the public hearing held before the committee on 11 August 2017, the governor noted that the global economy has strengthened and, as a result, the RBA expects domestic economic conditions to improve. The RBA forecasts Australia's GDP growth to rise above two per cent in late 2017, to 2¾ to 3¾ per cent over the year to December 2018. Continued growth is being supported by accommodative monetary policy, an increase in LNG exports, and employment growth.


Underlying inflation is somewhat higher than late last year, and the RBA forecasts that it will reach around two per cent over the second half of 2017, at the bottom end of the RBA's target. Headline inflation is expected to lie between two and three per cent over the year to December 2019, with the consumer price index (CPI) forecast to rise to around two percent by the end of 2017.


Since its low point in January 2016, the Australian dollar has appreciated considerably against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis. The governor stated that the current exchange rate will 'contribute to subdued price pressures in the economy'. The governor added that an appreciating exchange rate would be expected to result in slower economic growth and inflation than currently forecast, and the exchange rate is an issue which continues to be of great interest to the RBA and the committee.


Since the beginning of 2017, around 165,000 full-time jobs have been created in Australia, average hours worked have increased, and labour force participation has risen. The RBA expects that the recent strong growth in employment and increased household income will support consumption growth, moderated by high levels of household debt and lower wage growth.


Business investment in Australia is expected to increase gradually as growth in demand increases. The RBA noted that conditions are currently favourable for stronger growth in business investment, including low interest rates and reduced tax rates for small and medium sized businesses.


Overall, Australia's economic growth outlook, according to the Reserve Bank, is positive, with the transition to lower levels of mining investment almost complete—and indeed we've seen the impact of that in recent business investment figures. Increases in the production of LNG are expected to help to contribute to GDP growth in Australia of between two and three per cent for the year to the end of 2017.


On behalf of the committee, I thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr Lowe, and his colleagues for appearing at the hearing before our committee in Melbourne on 11 August 2017.


I commend the report to the House.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (15:18):  by leave—I concur with the member for Banks in thanking the governor and various representatives of the Reserve Bank for once again appearing before the House economics committee. It was a wide-ranging discussion of issues associated with monetary policy, energy policy, income, inequality and banking.


I do wish to make a few comments regarding the situation with the banking sector in Australia and energy policy. These are all contained in the committee's comprehensive report, particularly at page 17 of the report, where we were having a discussion with the Reserve Bank governor regarding the situation in the banking sector in Australia, most notably the allegations against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia that have been levelled by AUSTRAC in respect of breaches of Australia's anti-money-laundering and terrorism financing laws.


The governor made three important points in respect of banking culture in Australia. First he said:


On trust, I think it's fair to say that trust in banking has been strained.


…   …   …


On service: I think it's fair to say that service has taken a back seat to sales.


…   …   …


… I think we can all identify examples where the desire for short-term profit has probably led to not enough attention to risk management issues. So the focus needs to be on rebuilding trust and delivering high-quality service to customers, and a strong focus on risk management. Those are the things that we need to focus on.


From Labor's perspective, we totally agree with the Governor of the Reserve Bank. It's our view and certainly the view of the people of Australia that the best way to do that is to establish a royal commission into the banking industry in Australia to get to the bottom of exactly what's going on in this industry; uncover some of the scandals, the rip-offs and the hurt and financial pain that it's caused for many Australians; and have an independent arbiter look at the issues and put together a set of recommendations that a government could adopt to improve confidence, trust, stability and those issues that the Reserve Bank governor mentioned: trust, service and risk management in the Australian banking industry.


In respect of energy policy, there was a wide-ranging conversation with the Reserve Bank representatives about the parlous state of Australia's energy sector and the fact that energy prices have been increasing for some years and are putting a lot of stress on household budgets. The Reserve Bank governor made the point that it's becoming quite dire. He made the point very well that the major focus, the major factor, that's causing the problems in the energy sector in Australia is the lack of certainty regarding business investment. He said:


There is uncertainty about the policy environment and that is delaying investment. That is not in dispute. The investment uncertainty is not just in electricity generation; it's affecting investment decisions in other parts of the economy, because businesses aren't sure about the future price of electricity, so it's another reason to wait.


…   …   …


The higher prices of electricity are also affecting household budgets, particularly for lower income households, who spend a disproportionately high share of their income on electricity. It's crimping their budgets and having an effect on consumption, and it's going to have an effect on the CPI as well. So investment uncertainty, spending decisions and the CPI are the perspectives that we're looking at this from.


He went on to say:


… providing some certainty about the future structure of the electricity generation industry would be useful for the country, for investment, on prices and on household budgets.


That's not the Labor Party speaking there; that's the Reserve Bank governor of Australia, in many respects the chief economist in this country. That's his view of what is going on in Australia at the moment.


The lack of certainty with respect to energy policy that has been created by the Turnbull government is having a serious effect on business investment, business profitability and household budgets in this country. It is the fact that this Turnbull government argues amongst itself and can't make up its mind on a clean energy target that is having a massive effect on energy reliability, on investment in the industry and, ultimately, on households' budgets. The ball is well and truly in the government's court. It needs to come to a decision on a clean energy target.


Finally, the governor made important points, most notably about inequality:


It's a legitimate issue, people are rightly worried about it, but on many measures we're doing better than some other countries.


The wages share of income in this country has been falling for some decades now. In the last 10 years, the incomes of those in the top 10 per cent of the income brackets have grown by 72 per cent, whereas the incomes in the bottom tenth of Australian household income earners have grown by only 23 per cent.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (15:25):  To conclude my remarks on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017: what we've seen, in the measures that the government wants to introduce to delay payments to people who apply for welfare assistance, is a desperate move from a desperate government. Then we saw, in question time today, an answer from the minister which has outdone Chemical Ali during the war in Iraq, when he was denying what was happening there. Just as in the sketch in Monty Python and the Holy Grail where the Black Knight was denying what was happening to him at the time, the minister, totally out of touch with reality, suggested that the process that people are going through with Centrelink at the moment has been improved and that there are no problems with it. Nothing could be further from the truth than that.


What the government is saying is: 'We're going to put you through an even more difficult process than you already go through right now. You won't get your payments commenced until the process is finished—not at the time you start—by a department that is totally either underresourced or overwhelmed with applications.' The government knows exactly what it's doing. It is deliberately and intentionally wanting to delay the start of the payments in order to save a few dollars so that it can then try and balance its budget. Nothing could be more unjust and unfair than what this government is proposing.


The last matter, as to the unfairness, goes to the treatment that this government wants to dish out to people who are 55 years and over, where it is now saying that you can no longer fulfil your commitment to society by volunteering in your community; you will have to, like the rest of the people looking for support payments, go through applying for jobs or be in paid employment. I made the point earlier, at the beginning of my remarks, that there simply are not jobs out there. When there are far more people looking for jobs than there are jobs available, employers will not give people who are 55 years and over much of a look-in at all. It is going to be incredibly difficult for them to get jobs which are simply not there. And yet, again, this government is saying to them: 'If you don't go through this process, we will also take away payments from you.'


It is getting about as low as it possibly can when it starts putting those sorts of pressures on people who are clearly depending on the welfare system not because they want to but because they have no choice. We will have more of those people over the coming months—particularly in the region that I represent, because of the closure of Holden—and, quite frankly, to bring in this legislation and make their life even more difficult than it currently is just shows the depths that this government will sink to in order to try and balance its budget.


For those reasons, of course, I will not be supporting this legislation and will be supporting the amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga. The government may well be trying to get the legislation through by saying that, amongst the 18 measures contained in this legislation, there are some good ones, but the bad ones clearly outnumber the good ones, and this legislation should not be supported.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (15:28):  I wish to join with my colleagues in rising to speak against the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 and condemning the actions of this government. There are many proposed measures contained in this legislation that those on our side cannot in good conscience support. These include the axing of the bereavement allowance—an especially callous and cruel part of this legislation. The bereavement payment is a very short-term payment offered to those whose partners have recently died. In addition to the axing of the bereavement payment, this legislation seeks to push the starting date for some participation payments to new roles. It removes the intent-to-claim provisions that have been longstanding in the Centrelink regime. It also looks at changes to what constitutes a reasonable excuse. Finally, of course, it seeks to introduce a proposed trial for drug testing of those on social security.


This legislation is wrong in so many ways, but I particularly want to focus today on the component of this legislation that goes to the drug-testing trial of the social security recipients. It is shameful that this government has attempted to frame this policy as some type of health measure—as if targeting and punishing vulnerable and addicted Australians is somehow in their best interests and, indeed, in the best interests of our community. This policy is nothing more than a crass savings measure, and not a very good one at that. This policy will, in all likelihood, end up costing taxpayers more and achieving very little. The proposed trial is far from good, evidence-based policy making. It runs against all expert advice. It is so poorly thought out that some experts warn that, if rolled out, it may actually increase crime and drug use in our community. This trial could also inadvertently impact the medical treatment and rehabilitation of people suffering from drug and alcohol addiction.


Mr Speaker, you will not find a single organisation working in the field of drug and alcohol rehabilitation that will support this punitive policy. What you will find, however, is a great number of medical experts, addiction specialists and widespread community groups who have strongly urged the government against introducing this policy. I want to list just some of those organisations that have spoken out against this proposed drug-testing trial, because it's important that their considered opinions are noted and their opposition is recorded as part of this debate. These respected organisations include: the Australian Medical Association; the Royal Australasian College of Physicians; the Australasian Chapter of Addiction Medicine; the Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs; the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists; St Vincent's Health Australia; the Rural Doctors Association of Australia; Harm Reduction Australia; the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation; the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre; the Penington Institute; the Kirby Institute at UNSW; the Victorian Alcohol and Drug Association; 360 Edge, a specialist alcohol and other drug consultancy; the Australian Council of Social Service; UnitingCare Australia; Homelessness Australia; the St Vincent de Paul Society; the Wayside Chapel; Anglicare; Catholic Social Services Australia; the National Social Security Rights Network; Community Mental Health Australia; the Public Health Association of Australia; the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services; and the Ted Noffs Foundation. There are others, but time does not allow me to continue the list.


Rest assured that you will not find one medical expert who has come out to defend this as sound drug and alcohol addiction policy. Why? Because it is not. Even the CEO of Jobs Australia, David Thompson, has slammed the policy, saying he thinks all it will do is stop people asking for help because 'they feel the whole process … is really quite demeaning and humiliating'. If the government is trying to pretend that this is somehow a policy justifiable on health grounds, they are deceiving both themselves and the Australian people. The government needs to listen to the experts. The experts have made it crystal clear that this drug-testing trial will not work.


A doctor in my electorate, in Newcastle, recently contacted me, pleading for this policy not to go ahead. She is a doctor who is a medical specialist trained in paediatrics, epidemiology and genetics, and has had considerable experience working with families damaged by Stolen Generation pain, violence and abuse. She has written to me saying:


Many of the children of these families, as well as children with learning difficulties, autistic traits and severe anxiety turn to self-medication with alcohol and drugs in adolescence, or adulthood.


The idea that stopping their pocket money will remove this need or prevent substance abuse is childish and petulant. How can we as a developed nation continue to let ourselves fall into these punitive and silly games to make our politicians look 'strong'.


That's what doctors in my electorate are saying.


Australians go to their doctors and listen to them for medical advice. It's time that Malcolm Turnbull did the same. Mr Turnbull needs to listen to a doctor like Dr Anna Kelly, a general practitioner working in my electorate of Newcastle, who has also written a powerful letter arguing for this policy not to go ahead. Dr Kelly writes:


As a General Practitioner working in Newcastle, I have treated hundreds of people with drug and alcohol problems.


They often come from very difficult backgrounds; have a history of trauma including sexual abuse and domestic violence. Many have grown up in homes where drug and alcohol abuse and violence has been the norm. They miss out on education due to their difficult circumstances, leave home early to escape the hardship and experimenting with drugs leads to a drug and alcohol addiction problem.


With time, support, effort, empathy and access to resources, I have seen many get through their problem and break the poverty/drug and alcohol/violence generational cycle. Unfortunately due to lack of resources, it is difficult to get the right help at the right time for many of them.


I also see the children and extended families of people affected with drug and alcohol problems. They are ready to get help/support, but can't do it alone.


If drug and alcohol addicted people are prevented from receiving their Centrelink payments they will be forced into crime. People may be wanting to stop their addiction, but may not be able to do it alone.


If we stop their income, crime will increase, and seeking help will be even more difficult.


The funds used to police such a program would be much better spent in drug and alcohol rehabilitation services and for services to help the children and families of drug and alcohol affected people. Leave the punitive activities to our police force and fund adequately the services to help people.


That's the message from doctors in my electorate of Newcastle. These are doctors and medical experts who deal with the problem of drug and alcohol addiction every day. They are lining up to denounce this cruel and misguided policy proposal.


Nobody doubts that we face significant problems with drug addiction in our community, but there is simply no evidence that this trial will work. The problem of drug addiction requires a medical response. A punitive approach where the government is pursuing people on welfare who may or may not have a drug issue is not a reasonable way to deal with this important matter of public health. There is not a single extra cent in the health budget for any of the proposed drug trial sites. Precious taxpayer dollars would be better spent investing in support and rehabilitation services for those living with drug and alcohol addictions and their families. Without extra funding for treatment this trial will likely put pressure on an already overstretched and under-resourced system with long waiting lists, displacing people seeking help and further exacerbating the problem.


If this government had done even the smallest amount of research, they would have seen that drug testing of income support recipients has been trialled many times in many other countries, with no evidence to suggest that it is an effective measure to treat drug use in any of them. I take just one example—from New Zealand, our closest neighbour. The New Zealand government introduced a drug-testing program amongst welfare recipients in 2015. Only 22 of the 8,001 participants tested returned a positive result for illicit drug use. Just 22; that is just 0.2 per cent, a very small minority.


The point I'm trying to make here is that this flawed policy is not new. It has been tried before, and each time the result has been the same: it has not detected many positive results, and it has been very costly to deliver, which goes some way to explain why this government is refusing to give an estimate of the program's cost. However, regardless of the as yet unknown costs of this program, it is very difficult to see from any of the international evidence that this is an effective use of precious taxpayers' dollars. What we see here is just a cheap, populist and lazy policy from a government that is so worried about its own jobs that it has given up on trying to help vulnerable Australians. The idea that you would test tens of thousands of people and a few people may be found to have a positive test for the use of illicit drugs is not an effective use of those taxpayers' dollars, and it certainly will not help those few people who have genuine substance abuse problems—the very people that we should be seeking to reach out to.


The government should be focusing its resources on helping vulnerable people seek treatment for drug addiction, not making tokenistic gestures to appear tough. Drug and alcohol addictions are complex public health problems, and they require a public health policy response. I wish to close with a quote from Dr Marianne Jauncey, from the Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs, because I think it perfectly sums up just why this is such a bad policy. She says:


At a time when we desperately need money for frontline services—


this proposal means—


it's being spent in a way all the available evidence tells us won't work.


She goes on to say:


Doctors don't necessarily speak with a united voice—we're a very varied group of specialists and people with different backgrounds across the country, so when you do hear doctors speaking with a united voice I think people should listen.


I agree with Dr Jauncey. She is absolutely right.


Labor have listened to the expert advice from health professionals, and we oppose this drug-testing trial of social security recipients. It's time that the Turnbull government dumped this expensive trial that everyone says simply will not work. I stand with my Labor colleagues condemning this legislation, and I stand in support of the amendments moved by the member for Jagajaga.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (15:42):  I think when it comes to the legislation before the House today, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017, what we've got is legislation that really reeks of politics. That's what this is about. If we cast our minds back to the budget night, where I think the Minister for Human Services was going to go down the sewer and collect human waste material and test it, it was, at that point, a very half-baked idea. Of course, it's months and months later, and now we finally see, after the government trying to play the politics around drug-testing trials for welfare recipients, legislation that really has a bit of politics in it, some administrative changes and elements that are deeply flawed.


There are a number of changes that Labor have been very clear that we're happy to support, if split from other measures in the bill—things like, for example, streamlining tax file number collection and aligning social security and disability discrimination law. They are sensible things and things that we would support. As I think the shadow minister said, they are hardly reform, hardly an amazing reforming government agenda, but they are sensible measures nonetheless.


But there are some really, really important aspects that we will not support. I'd like to draw the attention of the House to those. The first one I would like to bring the House's attention to is abolishing the wife pension. The wife pension is a non-activity-test payment that has been closed to new applicants since 1 July 1995. When you look at this measure, the majority—I understand—will be transferred onto the age pension and carer's payment with a small minority having a cut. I think it says about 2,900 women will be transferred onto the jobseeker payment. These are a number of women who have not worked for a long time. It is pretty mean-spirited of the government to take this very small group of women who have not worked for a long time and say, 'We're going to phase out this payment for you'. It's not a huge amount of money. It really shows this government's callous attitude to anyone receiving an income support payment. 


Then we also have the other callous measure that has the potential to cut the payments of those receiving a bereavement allowance. This is for those who have lost their partners. It is a short-term payment of 14 weeks. This government has said, 'No, no, no'. It can be longer for a pregnant woman if they lose their partner. Now this government is going to snatch that away from them. Really, this is not welfare reform. This is just being mean-spirited. 


The one that I really think is not just mean-spirited but shows how out of touch this government is with those looking for a job are the changes to the activity test for people 55 to 59. Currently, people in this age group have to fulfil their activity test to get their Newstart payment by looking for work or volunteering for 30 hours per fortnight. This government is going to say that recipients would need to fulfil their 30 hours per fortnight of activity, but only half of that can be voluntary work. The rest of the time, they've got to go out and look for work. That's a nice concept. If the government has ever spoken to anyone between the ages of 55 and 59, trying to find work out there, they would know that these are not bludgers. These are not people flouting the system and deliberately trying to escape their requirements. 


I have spoken to so many who have found themselves in a situation where they've been made redundant, lost their job or been only able to achieve part-time work. They desperately want to work more and no-one will employ them. This comment comes to me time and time again. In fact, I have had older Australians looking for work say that they first put their resume in with their age and they get no interviews. So they think: 'Well, okay. I'm going to put my resume in without my age.' They get an interview but do not get the job. One could only suggest that it is down to what I believe is significant age discrimination when it comes to workplace employment. 


This is the real life experience of those older Australians desperately looking for work. The government says, 'Go and retrain'. They go back and retrain and they still can't get work. This government says to them, 'Look, you're finding it difficult to get a job.' They may then find a voluntary organisation that they feel passionate about, giving them 30 hours a fortnight. The government says: 'No, that's not good enough for the activity test. You've got to go and put yourself through the ringer time and time again. You can only do half of that work voluntarily. For the other half, you've got to keep turning up to interviews and keep getting rejections over and over and over again.'


You know what? The government does not understand how demoralising that is for people—how demoralising it is for people just turning up and putting their resume in over and over again. All they can say is, 'I've got the skills, I've got the passion and I want to work, but guess what: they just won't employ me.' This is something I hear from older Australians over and over again. So this measure to ensure that 55- to 59-year-olds cannot achieve their activity test by volunteering, once again, is just so mean spirited. It really shows that the government does not understand what the reality is out there.


We are going to be facing this in South Australia soon. We have so many people that are going to find themselves redundant with the closure of Holden—not just those directly working at Holden but also those working in manufacturing and industries associated with the automotive industry. I tell you: some of those people have given 20, 30 or 40 years of loyal service, and they still want to work after this. But it is going to be hard for them to find jobs, and really this government, through this measure, just shows that it has no concept whatsoever of the age discrimination that older Australians face going back into the workforce.


Whether it's the bereavement allowance, the wife pension or cutting the number of voluntary hours that count for your activity test, this is not reform. This is just mean-spirited picking on vulnerable people and trying to make out that they are somehow stealing from the taxpayer when, indeed, what they are asking for is just a little bit of support, and you want to rip that away.


I will finish my comments with the drug trials proposed in this piece of legislation. This is to pick welfare recipients and put them through a trial of drug testing and then change their payments or their access to payments as a result. When it comes to legislation and good public policy, we know that, when you put in a policy, you should have an outcome in mind. One would assume that any policy around drug and alcohol testing would be designed to try and minimise drug and alcohol use. That's what you'd think the outcome would be. Well, we know the measure before the House today will do nothing whatsoever to tackle addiction in our community.


Drug and alcohol addiction is a powerful, powerful thing. It is a medical issue that needs to be tackled properly in a medical way. We also know that you need to be ready and have the capacity to deal with that addiction. Being made homeless and desperate is not going to put you in a frame of mind to tackle your addiction. It's not just me and it's not just Labor; there is a list of bodies, which many of my colleagues have gone through before, from the AMA to every addiction organisation to ACOSS, all saying that this measure will not work. It will not do what the government claims it will do—that is, reduce drug addiction and alcohol abuse.


I am the first one to want to tackle the scourge of addiction in our community. I am the first one to say, 'Let's make sure that we give all the support and resources to those that want to make their lives better by tackling their addiction and their drug and alcohol dependency.' But you don't do that with a punitive measure with no drug and alcohol treatment.


What I found astounding is the admission from the government that they hadn't even checked what services for drug and alcohol treatment were available in the trial sites. You would think that, if there were going to be some sort of program to tackle drug and alcohol addiction through cutting people's payments, they'd say, 'Well, let's do it in a place where there are actually some services where people who want to get help can get help.' But they did not even check that. They did not even look at that critical piece of information, which brings me back to the point where I started: this drug and alcohol trial is condemned by medical professionals. It's condemned by those representing many vulnerable and disadvantaged people. It hasn't worked overseas, and many of my colleagues have gone through that. 


So there is a fundamental question before the House: why is this legislation being introduced when it's not going to work? The only answer I can come up with is politics. The government is divided and desperate. It has a weak Prime Minister. He is a Prime Minister who can barely hold his party together, who's being attacked by the Left and by the Right of his party. He is so fundamentally weak that he cannot do anything except play politics with vulnerable people.


I urge the government to rethink this damaging policy, this policy that will not work, this policy that's all about politics. Be a better government. Govern in the interest of Australians and not this rank political agenda that is desperately being used to try to hold the Right and the Left together.

"Collins, Julie, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (15:55):  This so-called welfare reform bill, as we've just heard from the member for Kingston, is really about the government trying to play politics. It's really about the government trying to pick on vulnerable people. You would have thought that they'd had enough of that, because they have tried much of this before.


There are three measures in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 that I am particularly concerned about and that I want to talk about today. Similarly to the previous member, I am particularly concerned about the change in the activity test for 55- to 59-year olds. People would know that at the moment people over the age of 55 who are out of work and are receiving Newstart can go and volunteer for 30 hours per week. That's 30 hours per week in which they are going out in their own time—paying for it themselves, often with transport—to get to their volunteer posts out and about in the community, to do good things supporting other vulnerable people, and this government wants to penalise them. It is just astounding. You would think it would be a sensible measure if, indeed, there were jobs out there for over-55-year-olds but there aren't. We have heard from many on this side the concerns around that and age discrimination.


I've been holding forums around the country with older Australians as part of my shadow portfolio duties, and one of the things that are raised with me every single time is the discrimination that older Australians face when trying to get work. The report Willing to Work, put out by the former Age and Disability Discrimination Commissioner Susan Ryan, says:


The right to work, free from discrimination on any basis, is a fundamental human right. Too many older Australians … are denied this right and as a result are prevented from enjoying the independence, dignity and sense of purpose that work brings.


Sadly, in Australia today this is still true. The report is only a year and a half old. It clearly shows the discrimination that older Australians face when trying to seek work. Many of these older Australians have been employed for most of their life. Indeed, many of them have been made redundant after years and years of work in the same job and then need to reskill. First, those reskilling programs are not available for most people and, second, it is so hard for these people to re-enter the workforce, yet when they're out there volunteering, trying to support other members in the community, the government is trying to penalise them. I do not understand where the government is coming from on this. The age discrimination commissioner's report says their survey found:


… 27% of people over the age of 50 had recently experienced discrimination in the workplace. One third of the most recent episodes of discrimination reported occurred when applying for a job.


They go in, they put in their resumes and their CVs and they get knocked back. They continually get knocked back on the basis of their age, even though that is not what they are told. Many of them, as you heard from the member for Kingston, don't even put their age on their CVs or resumes anymore, because they know that they will be discriminated against because of their age. And this government wants to penalise them even further. So I am really concerned about this aspect of the bill.


The other part of the bill that I am concerned about is in regard to the demerit provisions for Newstart jobseekers and the way in which they will work. I am particularly concerned that the government has removed the ability of employment service providers and, indeed, Centrelink to use their discretion and to waive demerits when there are exceptional circumstances.


I have seen this government try to move this bill two or three times before, and we've had to knock it off two or three times before because, of course, we know that doing things like that only leads to more homelessness. It only leads to more issues in the community because the people that the government is talking about penalising are already extremely vulnerable. And the government has no evidence that cutting more people off welfare or Newstart payments is actually going to improve their ability to find a job. What it actually wants to do is disengage people and not use its discretion for waivers when people are really vulnerable. I'm really concerned that this will actually have adverse impacts on those vulnerable members of our community.


The third part of the bill that I wanted to talk about today is of course the one that has been raised so many times in this place, and that is about the drug testing of welfare recipients in those trial sites. We've heard from so many experts, from the AMA to ACOSS, that this will not work. We've got no evidence from the government that this will work and, indeed, all the evidence from overseas would suggest that it won't work. We've also heard, unfortunately, that the government yet again hasn't done its homework. The government hasn't done its homework in terms of what services are available for those people whose tests do come up positive to say that, yes, there is alcohol or drug addiction. Indeed, has this government actually put in more support services in those trial sites? What are the waiting lists already for those people in those trial sites when it comes to seeking support for their addictions today?


Quite unusually for the government, they of course are making a hash of this just like they do everything else. They cannot implement any policy without mucking it up. We see it time and time again. We see it with this welfare reform bill; we saw it with the NBN; we saw it with the census; and we're going to see it, no doubt, with the household survey. They cannot organise anything. We've had minister after minister come in here and try to do more and more welfare reform that just leaves more and more people vulnerable. Quite frankly, I've had enough of it and my constituents have enough of it. It's about time the government stopped picking on vulnerable people and actually got on and did their job properly, because people out there in our communities know that there are not enough jobs for every jobseeker. They've got to stop picking on vulnerable jobseekers, go out there and create more jobs with less underemployment and less casualisation of the labour force. They need to improve wages growth. Indeed, they've got a lot of work to do, and this welfare reform bill doesn't do any of that. All it does is continually pick on vulnerable people.

Mr PORTER
 (Pearce—Minister for Social Services) (16:02):  I thank all the members, including those opposite, for their contributions to the debate on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017. By way of summing up the second reading debate, I note that the bill simplifies the welfare system. It strengthens conditionality for jobseekers, particularly those with drug and alcohol issues, and it introduces a new targeted and workable compliance framework. The point of the simplification—and I do note that the member for Jagajaga is here, thank her for her presence and also note that in her Growing Together manifesto it was said by Labor that consideration should be given to simplifying the working-age payment system. Of course, that wasn't done under the period of the previous government, but now we have before parliament a plan which is to simplify the welfare system in a very substantive way. I might deal with those three issues—complexity, mutual obligation and the compliance framework—separately.


With respect to complexity, we know we have a very complex welfare system. This bill seeks to turn seven payments into one to create a new jobseeker payment, so from 20 March 2020 the bill would introduce a new single jobseeker payment which would replace the seven existing payments as the main payment for people of working age. These changes would ensure a single set of rules and rates for people of working age with the capacity to work and aim to firmly entrench employment as the desired outcome for Australians who seek the jobseeker payment. That is a very significant simplification reform. In fact, given its scale, it's interesting that only two issues really have been raised with respect to consolidating seven payments into one. Those relate to two payments: bereavement allowance and the wife pension.


I'd like to thank the member for Mayo. In her speech on the second reading she did raise a genuine issue with respect to the potential for pregnant women receiving bereavement allowance to spend longer than 14 weeks on the payment and therefore be financially worse off under the proposed arrangements. Again I thank her for raising that issue and speaking to me separately about it. We realise that that's a special category and will continue to work with her and the Nick Xenophon Team on that particular issue.


The second issue relates to what are effectively 200 wife pensioners who reside overseas and would no longer be eligible for the wife pension from a future point in time. Those individuals are presently aged between 45 and 62. Where they don't reside in a country with an international agreement, like every single other person in the welfare system that is able to work they would not be eligible to be continually funded by the taxpayer while they're overseas. That payment as it presently exists simply does not reflect community values, and it shouldn't be continued after 22 years so that we support able Australians to live overseas and never look for work even though they are of working age. That would maintain a range of existing inequities in the social security system. It reinforces outdated social norms and it would do a huge disservice to the taxpayer.


With respect to the issue of mutual obligations, again this is very significant reform. Most complaints from members opposite related to the changes to the activity test for persons aged between 55 and 59. The bill will also strengthen the employment focus of mutual obligations and better target mature-aged jobseekers with the labour market. Labor's criticism of the measure to increase the activity requirements for those aged between 55 and 59 is twofold. There are two criticisms: first, somehow this change is unfair or not in the best interests of those people aged between 55 and 59, and, second, it could affect rates of volunteering.


The truth of the situation is that neither of those criticisms is correct. There is a central question of principle here. As a government, we take the view that jobseekers aged between 55 and 59 are not going to benefit from being totally excused from any effort to prepare for or search for work. In fact, the contrary idea—that it is actually in a person's interest to be in a system that requires some effort to search for work—is supported by many sources. The Department of Employment's data shows that, in the year ending December 2016, over all age groups, 32.4 per cent of jobseekers who participated in voluntary work were in employment three months later. Comparatively, 48.5 per cent of jobseekers who participated in jobactive were in employment three months later. Reputable data also exists to show that mature-aged people are 13 times more likely to find work when actively looking for it. Critically, alongside this reform is the fact that the government is investing over $110 million in mature-aged re-skilling packages to help older Australians retain and find work.


The government also rejects the argument that the reforms for the 55 to 59 age bracket would see volunteer groups somehow lose volunteers. In claiming a negative impact on volunteering, members opposite continually and conveniently ignore the fact that, of the 40,000 jobseekers aged 55 to 59, only around 7½ thousand presently use volunteering alone to meet their 30 hours of activity. Also, of course, members opposite ignored the fact that our reforms will, for the first time, require that 45,000 jobseekers aged over 60 will have some mutual obligations, where at present there are none, and be required to undertake 10 hours of activity per fortnight, all of which could be met through volunteering. That means a boost to the volunteering sector by providing a net increase of up to 337,000 volunteering hours a fortnight. How can it be considered a disadvantage to volunteering groups when it could provide up to 337,000 hours more volunteering a fortnight?


This bill also contains changes for faster connection to employment services. From 1 January 2018, the bill will encourage jobseekers to connect more quickly with their employment service providers. Some members opposite have raised concerns on how this measure would impact on jobseekers in rural and remote areas. Again, the fact is that, under current arrangements, jobseekers in regional areas are exempt from RapidConnect where transport would not allow attendance at their initial appointment in a timely manner, and that safeguard remains.


Some issues were raised with respect to the removal of intent-to-claim provisions. Under this bill, the social security claimants would receive payments from the date they provide all material necessary to be assessed that is within their control, rather than from the date of first contact with the Department of Human Services expressing an intention to claim. That is opposed by Labor, but the fact is that, at present, an applicant can provide only their name and the payment which they intend to claim and be back paid to the date that they first made contact with the department. This arrangement simply does not align with community expectations and, again, does a massive disservice to the taxpayer. It is simply not an unreasonable request for applicants to provide the very basic required information when lodging a claim. This measure will improve the integrity and administrative complexity of the welfare system, and, again, adequate provisions and exemptions exist for people who do not have the ability to provide all relevant documents, including those who may be disabled or live in remote areas and those who are homeless or affected by domestic violence.


The bill, under the heading of strengthening mutual obligation requirements, deals with a range of substance abuse measures. It introduces three measures to strengthen requirements for jobseekers with substance abuse issues and provides improved pathways for them to pursue appropriate treatment.


Firstly, the bill establishes a two-year trial of drug testing for 5,000 recipients of Newstart and youth allowance from 1 January 2018. Members opposite oppose this trial, doing so on the basis that they say there is no evidence that it's guaranteed to work. Of course, the first point is that this position ignores the fact that it is a trial, designed to determine whether the welfare system can be effectively used to compel people into treatment. Further, that is the same argument that has been run against the cashless welfare card and against the No Jab, No Pay immunisation policy to link vaccination to family tax benefit payments, and yet both of those policies have proven very substantial and successful in changing behaviours and improving individual lives.


The exact reason that there is no evidentiary guarantee for a trial like this, or that it will work, is that it has never been done before in the way that we are doing it. Despite multiple false statements by members opposite, this trial will not cut people off from income support if they test positive for drugs. It is very different in that respect to the trials that have been conducted overseas. Instead, after a first test, our trial will limit the amount of income support that is provided in cash and, following a second positive test, it refers the individual to a doctor for an assessment on what treatment may be required.


I think the member for Barton typified the opposition's position in opposing this in her second reading contribution. She said that the trial won't work because, 'this requires a medical response'. Of course, a medical response is exactly what we are proposing. Every decision regarding treatment will be made by a qualified medical professional, paid for and provided by the government. The member for Barton also gave Labor's objection to the trial on the basis that income management was described as not being an effective tool to help people with substance abuse problems. Indeed, what I think was revealed in several contributions from members opposite was an equal opposition to the trial as to the consequences of a positive drug test being income management.


I must say to the member for Jagajaga that I share her views where she noted that income management is a useful and important tool for protecting vulnerable people—particularly for protecting children. It makes sure that welfare payments are spent on the essentials of life—things like food, clothing and rent—and not on alcohol or drugs. The Labor position also conveniently ignores the considerable body of evidence that exists around the effectiveness of compelling people into drug treatment.


The reason for trialling a new approach where there is not an evidentiary guarantee of success is to trial, test and learn. Equally, the fact that there may not be a guarantee of success is distinct from a lack of evidence to suggest that the trial of a new approach could reasonably be considered worthwhile. I worked in drug courts and, in fact, much of what we have done is based on the process there. Drug courts, of course, effectively mandate treatment and they have been very successful in mandating treatment for drug and alcohol problems. The data and evidence shows that this type of compulsion for treatment can be very effective. The Magistrates Early Referral Into Treatment Program—the MERIT Program—in New South Wales has resulted in the number of people in employment rising from 20 per cent at program entry to 27.5 per cent at exit. The Victorian Drug Court had a study which showed that 79 per cent of people appearing before it were unemployed. It showed that the benefits of the drug treatment compulsory order program included improved health and wellbeing, reductions in drug and alcohol risk and enhanced employment prospects and overarching life skills.


A 2008 study published by the Crime and Misconduct Commission in Queensland examined the issue of mandatory versus voluntary treatment for drug and alcohol problems. It concluded as follows:


Our findings do not support the current treatment philosophy of waiting for people with drug and/or alcohol abuse problems to get themselves psychologically motivated and prove their readiness to receive treatment. On the contrary, the findings indicate that mandatory treatment seems a promising option to help offenders with drug and alcohol abuse problems.


This trial has been developed to test whether the welfare system can be used in a similar way to drug courts. If it does not work, of course there will be a need to try something else. If it does work, we will have improved the lives of people with those drug problems.


Two other measures in this bill also ensure that jobseekers with substance abuse issues remain actively engaged in appropriate activities, including treatment to address their barriers to work rather than being exempt from all mutual obligation requirements. From 1 January 2018, jobseekers will no longer be exempt from their mutual obligation or participation requirements if the reason they are unable to meet their obligations is predominantly due to drug or alcohol dependency. From 1 January 2018, the government will also tighten the reasonable excuse rules to allow for the closing of a loophole so that alcohol and drug dependency will not be accepted as a reasonable excuse for not meeting obligations when the jobseekers are not also actively engaged in treatment.


Again, Labor sought to characterise these changes as punitive, but what they failed to point out or to mention is that this change is accompanied by, and will run parallel to, one of the most important changes in this reform package—that is that for the first time all jobseekers will be able to have drug and alcohol treatment efforts count towards their mutual obligation requirements.


The fundamental principle the government reforms embody is simply this: citizens who are receiving taxpayer funds in the form of welfare benefits should not be able to claim drug and alcohol abuse as a reason for failing to undertake critical mutual obligations like turning up to job interviews unless they are also making reasonable efforts to undertake treatment or support for the problem. The system as it currently stands fails to detect people with drug problems and simply allows those it does not know about to be exempt from all mutual obligations. The purpose of all these measures is to ensure that, when people have substance abuse issues that are acting as a barrier to their employment, they are compelled into appropriate treatment.


With respect to the compliance framework, from 1 July 2018, a new jobseeker compliance framework will provide more support to those who are genuinely trying to meet their obligations whilst also introducing fairer and more contemporary penalties for the very small number of jobseekers who persistently and deliberately do not meet their requirements. The Labor Party called for the reinstatement of waivers and provider discretion, but that is the exact reason the present system is failing. The failure of the current waiver arrangements and the inconsistency in the use of discretion has made our proposed changes completely necessary. Under the framework, at present, 93 per cent of penalties for serious or persistent noncompliance are waived. This means there is no consequence for the overwhelming majority of jobseekers who repeatedly fail to meet their requirements or who refuse an offer of suitable work. Penalties only apply to those who repeatedly fail, with multiple barrier assessments and warnings before this could occur. Reasonable excuse provisions will of course continue to apply.


With respect to information management, I would also note briefly that the bill eliminates the requirement for the Department of Human Services to obtain information twice. It streamlines prosecution processes and reduces the administrative burden of criminal investigations. These changes do align with the Department of Human Services information-gathering powers and align it with that of other agencies at the Commonwealth and state and territory levels. The changes retain the common-law right to silence, preventing use of information or documents against the person that provided them other than in proceedings for the provision of false information. This exception is consistent with the guide to framing Commonwealth offences, infringement notices and enforcement that states that the privilege against self-incrimination does not apply where it is alleged a person has given false or misleading information.


In summary, it is critical to ensure that our welfare system is efficient, effective and sustainable into the future. We simply cannot afford a set-and-forget approach to the welfare system. It is for those reasons that I commend the bill to the House.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Jagajaga has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment be agreed to.

The briefest explanation that I can provide with respect to those amendments, of which there are 22, is they are technical but that they amend schedules 10, 12 and 16 of the bill.


The amendments to schedule 10, which deals with the work first component of the bill, are designed to ensure that the ordinary waiting period will apply in the same way to jobseekers who are subject to RapidConnect as to jobseekers who are not subject to RapidConnect.


The amendments that apply to schedule 12, which deals with the drug-testing trial, are designed to refine the definition of 'drug test trial pool member' and give greater support to jobseekers referred to income management for whom the regime could pose any risk to their wellbeing.


The third group of amendments applies to schedule 16 and relates to the streamlining of tax file number issues. These amendments would allow for the request for tax file number provisions in the social security law to apply to a relevant third party as part of a person's claim for social security payment and to an income-tested healthcare card or seniors health card.


Question agreed to.



The SPEAKER:  The question now is that this bill, as amended, be agreed to.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (15:25):  To conclude my remarks on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017: what we've seen, in the measures that the government wants to introduce to delay payments to people who apply for welfare assistance, is a desperate move from a desperate government. Then we saw, in question time today, an answer from the minister which has outdone Chemical Ali during the war in Iraq, when he was denying what was happening there. Just as in the sketch in Monty Python and the Holy Grail where the Black Knight was denying what was happening to him at the time, the minister, totally out of touch with reality, suggested that the process that people are going through with Centrelink at the moment has been improved and that there are no problems with it. Nothing could be further from the truth than that.


What the government is saying is: 'We're going to put you through an even more difficult process than you already go through right now. You won't get your payments commenced until the process is finished—not at the time you start—by a department that is totally either underresourced or overwhelmed with applications.' The government knows exactly what it's doing. It is deliberately and intentionally wanting to delay the start of the payments in order to save a few dollars so that it can then try and balance its budget. Nothing could be more unjust and unfair than what this government is proposing.


The last matter, as to the unfairness, goes to the treatment that this government wants to dish out to people who are 55 years and over, where it is now saying that you can no longer fulfil your commitment to society by volunteering in your community; you will have to, like the rest of the people looking for support payments, go through applying for jobs or be in paid employment. I made the point earlier, at the beginning of my remarks, that there simply are not jobs out there. When there are far more people looking for jobs than there are jobs available, employers will not give people who are 55 years and over much of a look-in at all. It is going to be incredibly difficult for them to get jobs which are simply not there. And yet, again, this government is saying to them: 'If you don't go through this process, we will also take away payments from you.'


It is getting about as low as it possibly can when it starts putting those sorts of pressures on people who are clearly depending on the welfare system not because they want to but because they have no choice. We will have more of those people over the coming months—particularly in the region that I represent, because of the closure of Holden—and, quite frankly, to bring in this legislation and make their life even more difficult than it currently is just shows the depths that this government will sink to in order to try and balance its budget.


For those reasons, of course, I will not be supporting this legislation and will be supporting the amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga. The government may well be trying to get the legislation through by saying that, amongst the 18 measures contained in this legislation, there are some good ones, but the bad ones clearly outnumber the good ones, and this legislation should not be supported.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (15:28):  I wish to join with my colleagues in rising to speak against the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 and condemning the actions of this government. There are many proposed measures contained in this legislation that those on our side cannot in good conscience support. These include the axing of the bereavement allowance—an especially callous and cruel part of this legislation. The bereavement payment is a very short-term payment offered to those whose partners have recently died. In addition to the axing of the bereavement payment, this legislation seeks to push the starting date for some participation payments to new roles. It removes the intent-to-claim provisions that have been longstanding in the Centrelink regime. It also looks at changes to what constitutes a reasonable excuse. Finally, of course, it seeks to introduce a proposed trial for drug testing of those on social security.


This legislation is wrong in so many ways, but I particularly want to focus today on the component of this legislation that goes to the drug-testing trial of the social security recipients. It is shameful that this government has attempted to frame this policy as some type of health measure—as if targeting and punishing vulnerable and addicted Australians is somehow in their best interests and, indeed, in the best interests of our community. This policy is nothing more than a crass savings measure, and not a very good one at that. This policy will, in all likelihood, end up costing taxpayers more and achieving very little. The proposed trial is far from good, evidence-based policy making. It runs against all expert advice. It is so poorly thought out that some experts warn that, if rolled out, it may actually increase crime and drug use in our community. This trial could also inadvertently impact the medical treatment and rehabilitation of people suffering from drug and alcohol addiction.


Mr Speaker, you will not find a single organisation working in the field of drug and alcohol rehabilitation that will support this punitive policy. What you will find, however, is a great number of medical experts, addiction specialists and widespread community groups who have strongly urged the government against introducing this policy. I want to list just some of those organisations that have spoken out against this proposed drug-testing trial, because it's important that their considered opinions are noted and their opposition is recorded as part of this debate. These respected organisations include: the Australian Medical Association; the Royal Australasian College of Physicians; the Australasian Chapter of Addiction Medicine; the Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs; the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists; St Vincent's Health Australia; the Rural Doctors Association of Australia; Harm Reduction Australia; the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation; the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre; the Penington Institute; the Kirby Institute at UNSW; the Victorian Alcohol and Drug Association; 360 Edge, a specialist alcohol and other drug consultancy; the Australian Council of Social Service; UnitingCare Australia; Homelessness Australia; the St Vincent de Paul Society; the Wayside Chapel; Anglicare; Catholic Social Services Australia; the National Social Security Rights Network; Community Mental Health Australia; the Public Health Association of Australia; the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services; and the Ted Noffs Foundation. There are others, but time does not allow me to continue the list.


Rest assured that you will not find one medical expert who has come out to defend this as sound drug and alcohol addiction policy. Why? Because it is not. Even the CEO of Jobs Australia, David Thompson, has slammed the policy, saying he thinks all it will do is stop people asking for help because 'they feel the whole process … is really quite demeaning and humiliating'. If the government is trying to pretend that this is somehow a policy justifiable on health grounds, they are deceiving both themselves and the Australian people. The government needs to listen to the experts. The experts have made it crystal clear that this drug-testing trial will not work.


A doctor in my electorate, in Newcastle, recently contacted me, pleading for this policy not to go ahead. She is a doctor who is a medical specialist trained in paediatrics, epidemiology and genetics, and has had considerable experience working with families damaged by Stolen Generation pain, violence and abuse. She has written to me saying:


Many of the children of these families, as well as children with learning difficulties, autistic traits and severe anxiety turn to self-medication with alcohol and drugs in adolescence, or adulthood.


The idea that stopping their pocket money will remove this need or prevent substance abuse is childish and petulant. How can we as a developed nation continue to let ourselves fall into these punitive and silly games to make our politicians look 'strong'.


That's what doctors in my electorate are saying.


Australians go to their doctors and listen to them for medical advice. It's time that Malcolm Turnbull did the same. Mr Turnbull needs to listen to a doctor like Dr Anna Kelly, a general practitioner working in my electorate of Newcastle, who has also written a powerful letter arguing for this policy not to go ahead. Dr Kelly writes:


As a General Practitioner working in Newcastle, I have treated hundreds of people with drug and alcohol problems.


They often come from very difficult backgrounds; have a history of trauma including sexual abuse and domestic violence. Many have grown up in homes where drug and alcohol abuse and violence has been the norm. They miss out on education due to their difficult circumstances, leave home early to escape the hardship and experimenting with drugs leads to a drug and alcohol addiction problem.


With time, support, effort, empathy and access to resources, I have seen many get through their problem and break the poverty/drug and alcohol/violence generational cycle. Unfortunately due to lack of resources, it is difficult to get the right help at the right time for many of them.


I also see the children and extended families of people affected with drug and alcohol problems. They are ready to get help/support, but can't do it alone.


If drug and alcohol addicted people are prevented from receiving their Centrelink payments they will be forced into crime. People may be wanting to stop their addiction, but may not be able to do it alone.


If we stop their income, crime will increase, and seeking help will be even more difficult.


The funds used to police such a program would be much better spent in drug and alcohol rehabilitation services and for services to help the children and families of drug and alcohol affected people. Leave the punitive activities to our police force and fund adequately the services to help people.


That's the message from doctors in my electorate of Newcastle. These are doctors and medical experts who deal with the problem of drug and alcohol addiction every day. They are lining up to denounce this cruel and misguided policy proposal.


Nobody doubts that we face significant problems with drug addiction in our community, but there is simply no evidence that this trial will work. The problem of drug addiction requires a medical response. A punitive approach where the government is pursuing people on welfare who may or may not have a drug issue is not a reasonable way to deal with this important matter of public health. There is not a single extra cent in the health budget for any of the proposed drug trial sites. Precious taxpayer dollars would be better spent investing in support and rehabilitation services for those living with drug and alcohol addictions and their families. Without extra funding for treatment this trial will likely put pressure on an already overstretched and under-resourced system with long waiting lists, displacing people seeking help and further exacerbating the problem.


If this government had done even the smallest amount of research, they would have seen that drug testing of income support recipients has been trialled many times in many other countries, with no evidence to suggest that it is an effective measure to treat drug use in any of them. I take just one example—from New Zealand, our closest neighbour. The New Zealand government introduced a drug-testing program amongst welfare recipients in 2015. Only 22 of the 8,001 participants tested returned a positive result for illicit drug use. Just 22; that is just 0.2 per cent, a very small minority.


The point I'm trying to make here is that this flawed policy is not new. It has been tried before, and each time the result has been the same: it has not detected many positive results, and it has been very costly to deliver, which goes some way to explain why this government is refusing to give an estimate of the program's cost. However, regardless of the as yet unknown costs of this program, it is very difficult to see from any of the international evidence that this is an effective use of precious taxpayers' dollars. What we see here is just a cheap, populist and lazy policy from a government that is so worried about its own jobs that it has given up on trying to help vulnerable Australians. The idea that you would test tens of thousands of people and a few people may be found to have a positive test for the use of illicit drugs is not an effective use of those taxpayers' dollars, and it certainly will not help those few people who have genuine substance abuse problems—the very people that we should be seeking to reach out to.


The government should be focusing its resources on helping vulnerable people seek treatment for drug addiction, not making tokenistic gestures to appear tough. Drug and alcohol addictions are complex public health problems, and they require a public health policy response. I wish to close with a quote from Dr Marianne Jauncey, from the Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs, because I think it perfectly sums up just why this is such a bad policy. She says:


At a time when we desperately need money for frontline services—


this proposal means—


it's being spent in a way all the available evidence tells us won't work.


She goes on to say:


Doctors don't necessarily speak with a united voice—we're a very varied group of specialists and people with different backgrounds across the country, so when you do hear doctors speaking with a united voice I think people should listen.


I agree with Dr Jauncey. She is absolutely right.


Labor have listened to the expert advice from health professionals, and we oppose this drug-testing trial of social security recipients. It's time that the Turnbull government dumped this expensive trial that everyone says simply will not work. I stand with my Labor colleagues condemning this legislation, and I stand in support of the amendments moved by the member for Jagajaga.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (15:42):  I think when it comes to the legislation before the House today, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017, what we've got is legislation that really reeks of politics. That's what this is about. If we cast our minds back to the budget night, where I think the Minister for Human Services was going to go down the sewer and collect human waste material and test it, it was, at that point, a very half-baked idea. Of course, it's months and months later, and now we finally see, after the government trying to play the politics around drug-testing trials for welfare recipients, legislation that really has a bit of politics in it, some administrative changes and elements that are deeply flawed.


There are a number of changes that Labor have been very clear that we're happy to support, if split from other measures in the bill—things like, for example, streamlining tax file number collection and aligning social security and disability discrimination law. They are sensible things and things that we would support. As I think the shadow minister said, they are hardly reform, hardly an amazing reforming government agenda, but they are sensible measures nonetheless.


But there are some really, really important aspects that we will not support. I'd like to draw the attention of the House to those. The first one I would like to bring the House's attention to is abolishing the wife pension. The wife pension is a non-activity-test payment that has been closed to new applicants since 1 July 1995. When you look at this measure, the majority—I understand—will be transferred onto the age pension and carer's payment with a small minority having a cut. I think it says about 2,900 women will be transferred onto the jobseeker payment. These are a number of women who have not worked for a long time. It is pretty mean-spirited of the government to take this very small group of women who have not worked for a long time and say, 'We're going to phase out this payment for you'. It's not a huge amount of money. It really shows this government's callous attitude to anyone receiving an income support payment. 


Then we also have the other callous measure that has the potential to cut the payments of those receiving a bereavement allowance. This is for those who have lost their partners. It is a short-term payment of 14 weeks. This government has said, 'No, no, no'. It can be longer for a pregnant woman if they lose their partner. Now this government is going to snatch that away from them. Really, this is not welfare reform. This is just being mean-spirited. 


The one that I really think is not just mean-spirited but shows how out of touch this government is with those looking for a job are the changes to the activity test for people 55 to 59. Currently, people in this age group have to fulfil their activity test to get their Newstart payment by looking for work or volunteering for 30 hours per fortnight. This government is going to say that recipients would need to fulfil their 30 hours per fortnight of activity, but only half of that can be voluntary work. The rest of the time, they've got to go out and look for work. That's a nice concept. If the government has ever spoken to anyone between the ages of 55 and 59, trying to find work out there, they would know that these are not bludgers. These are not people flouting the system and deliberately trying to escape their requirements. 


I have spoken to so many who have found themselves in a situation where they've been made redundant, lost their job or been only able to achieve part-time work. They desperately want to work more and no-one will employ them. This comment comes to me time and time again. In fact, I have had older Australians looking for work say that they first put their resume in with their age and they get no interviews. So they think: 'Well, okay. I'm going to put my resume in without my age.' They get an interview but do not get the job. One could only suggest that it is down to what I believe is significant age discrimination when it comes to workplace employment. 


This is the real life experience of those older Australians desperately looking for work. The government says, 'Go and retrain'. They go back and retrain and they still can't get work. This government says to them, 'Look, you're finding it difficult to get a job.' They may then find a voluntary organisation that they feel passionate about, giving them 30 hours a fortnight. The government says: 'No, that's not good enough for the activity test. You've got to go and put yourself through the ringer time and time again. You can only do half of that work voluntarily. For the other half, you've got to keep turning up to interviews and keep getting rejections over and over and over again.'


You know what? The government does not understand how demoralising that is for people—how demoralising it is for people just turning up and putting their resume in over and over again. All they can say is, 'I've got the skills, I've got the passion and I want to work, but guess what: they just won't employ me.' This is something I hear from older Australians over and over again. So this measure to ensure that 55- to 59-year-olds cannot achieve their activity test by volunteering, once again, is just so mean spirited. It really shows that the government does not understand what the reality is out there.


We are going to be facing this in South Australia soon. We have so many people that are going to find themselves redundant with the closure of Holden—not just those directly working at Holden but also those working in manufacturing and industries associated with the automotive industry. I tell you: some of those people have given 20, 30 or 40 years of loyal service, and they still want to work after this. But it is going to be hard for them to find jobs, and really this government, through this measure, just shows that it has no concept whatsoever of the age discrimination that older Australians face going back into the workforce.


Whether it's the bereavement allowance, the wife pension or cutting the number of voluntary hours that count for your activity test, this is not reform. This is just mean-spirited picking on vulnerable people and trying to make out that they are somehow stealing from the taxpayer when, indeed, what they are asking for is just a little bit of support, and you want to rip that away.


I will finish my comments with the drug trials proposed in this piece of legislation. This is to pick welfare recipients and put them through a trial of drug testing and then change their payments or their access to payments as a result. When it comes to legislation and good public policy, we know that, when you put in a policy, you should have an outcome in mind. One would assume that any policy around drug and alcohol testing would be designed to try and minimise drug and alcohol use. That's what you'd think the outcome would be. Well, we know the measure before the House today will do nothing whatsoever to tackle addiction in our community.


Drug and alcohol addiction is a powerful, powerful thing. It is a medical issue that needs to be tackled properly in a medical way. We also know that you need to be ready and have the capacity to deal with that addiction. Being made homeless and desperate is not going to put you in a frame of mind to tackle your addiction. It's not just me and it's not just Labor; there is a list of bodies, which many of my colleagues have gone through before, from the AMA to every addiction organisation to ACOSS, all saying that this measure will not work. It will not do what the government claims it will do—that is, reduce drug addiction and alcohol abuse.


I am the first one to want to tackle the scourge of addiction in our community. I am the first one to say, 'Let's make sure that we give all the support and resources to those that want to make their lives better by tackling their addiction and their drug and alcohol dependency.' But you don't do that with a punitive measure with no drug and alcohol treatment.


What I found astounding is the admission from the government that they hadn't even checked what services for drug and alcohol treatment were available in the trial sites. You would think that, if there were going to be some sort of program to tackle drug and alcohol addiction through cutting people's payments, they'd say, 'Well, let's do it in a place where there are actually some services where people who want to get help can get help.' But they did not even check that. They did not even look at that critical piece of information, which brings me back to the point where I started: this drug and alcohol trial is condemned by medical professionals. It's condemned by those representing many vulnerable and disadvantaged people. It hasn't worked overseas, and many of my colleagues have gone through that. 


So there is a fundamental question before the House: why is this legislation being introduced when it's not going to work? The only answer I can come up with is politics. The government is divided and desperate. It has a weak Prime Minister. He is a Prime Minister who can barely hold his party together, who's being attacked by the Left and by the Right of his party. He is so fundamentally weak that he cannot do anything except play politics with vulnerable people.


I urge the government to rethink this damaging policy, this policy that will not work, this policy that's all about politics. Be a better government. Govern in the interest of Australians and not this rank political agenda that is desperately being used to try to hold the Right and the Left together.

"Collins, Julie, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (15:55):  This so-called welfare reform bill, as we've just heard from the member for Kingston, is really about the government trying to play politics. It's really about the government trying to pick on vulnerable people. You would have thought that they'd had enough of that, because they have tried much of this before.


There are three measures in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 that I am particularly concerned about and that I want to talk about today. Similarly to the previous member, I am particularly concerned about the change in the activity test for 55- to 59-year olds. People would know that at the moment people over the age of 55 who are out of work and are receiving Newstart can go and volunteer for 30 hours per week. That's 30 hours per week in which they are going out in their own time—paying for it themselves, often with transport—to get to their volunteer posts out and about in the community, to do good things supporting other vulnerable people, and this government wants to penalise them. It is just astounding. You would think it would be a sensible measure if, indeed, there were jobs out there for over-55-year-olds but there aren't. We have heard from many on this side the concerns around that and age discrimination.


I've been holding forums around the country with older Australians as part of my shadow portfolio duties, and one of the things that are raised with me every single time is the discrimination that older Australians face when trying to get work. The report Willing to Work, put out by the former Age and Disability Discrimination Commissioner Susan Ryan, says:


The right to work, free from discrimination on any basis, is a fundamental human right. Too many older Australians … are denied this right and as a result are prevented from enjoying the independence, dignity and sense of purpose that work brings.


Sadly, in Australia today this is still true. The report is only a year and a half old. It clearly shows the discrimination that older Australians face when trying to seek work. Many of these older Australians have been employed for most of their life. Indeed, many of them have been made redundant after years and years of work in the same job and then need to reskill. First, those reskilling programs are not available for most people and, second, it is so hard for these people to re-enter the workforce, yet when they're out there volunteering, trying to support other members in the community, the government is trying to penalise them. I do not understand where the government is coming from on this. The age discrimination commissioner's report says their survey found:


… 27% of people over the age of 50 had recently experienced discrimination in the workplace. One third of the most recent episodes of discrimination reported occurred when applying for a job.


They go in, they put in their resumes and their CVs and they get knocked back. They continually get knocked back on the basis of their age, even though that is not what they are told. Many of them, as you heard from the member for Kingston, don't even put their age on their CVs or resumes anymore, because they know that they will be discriminated against because of their age. And this government wants to penalise them even further. So I am really concerned about this aspect of the bill.


The other part of the bill that I am concerned about is in regard to the demerit provisions for Newstart jobseekers and the way in which they will work. I am particularly concerned that the government has removed the ability of employment service providers and, indeed, Centrelink to use their discretion and to waive demerits when there are exceptional circumstances.


I have seen this government try to move this bill two or three times before, and we've had to knock it off two or three times before because, of course, we know that doing things like that only leads to more homelessness. It only leads to more issues in the community because the people that the government is talking about penalising are already extremely vulnerable. And the government has no evidence that cutting more people off welfare or Newstart payments is actually going to improve their ability to find a job. What it actually wants to do is disengage people and not use its discretion for waivers when people are really vulnerable. I'm really concerned that this will actually have adverse impacts on those vulnerable members of our community.


The third part of the bill that I wanted to talk about today is of course the one that has been raised so many times in this place, and that is about the drug testing of welfare recipients in those trial sites. We've heard from so many experts, from the AMA to ACOSS, that this will not work. We've got no evidence from the government that this will work and, indeed, all the evidence from overseas would suggest that it won't work. We've also heard, unfortunately, that the government yet again hasn't done its homework. The government hasn't done its homework in terms of what services are available for those people whose tests do come up positive to say that, yes, there is alcohol or drug addiction. Indeed, has this government actually put in more support services in those trial sites? What are the waiting lists already for those people in those trial sites when it comes to seeking support for their addictions today?


Quite unusually for the government, they of course are making a hash of this just like they do everything else. They cannot implement any policy without mucking it up. We see it time and time again. We see it with this welfare reform bill; we saw it with the NBN; we saw it with the census; and we're going to see it, no doubt, with the household survey. They cannot organise anything. We've had minister after minister come in here and try to do more and more welfare reform that just leaves more and more people vulnerable. Quite frankly, I've had enough of it and my constituents have enough of it. It's about time the government stopped picking on vulnerable people and actually got on and did their job properly, because people out there in our communities know that there are not enough jobs for every jobseeker. They've got to stop picking on vulnerable jobseekers, go out there and create more jobs with less underemployment and less casualisation of the labour force. They need to improve wages growth. Indeed, they've got a lot of work to do, and this welfare reform bill doesn't do any of that. All it does is continually pick on vulnerable people.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2017-09-11,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce—Minister for Social Services) (16:02):  I thank all the members, including those opposite, for their contributions to the debate on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017. By way of summing up the second reading debate, I note that the bill simplifies the welfare system. It strengthens conditionality for jobseekers, particularly those with drug and alcohol issues, and it introduces a new targeted and workable compliance framework. The point of the simplification—and I do note that the member for Jagajaga is here, thank her for her presence and also note that in her Growing Together manifesto it was said by Labor that consideration should be given to simplifying the working-age payment system. Of course, that wasn't done under the period of the previous government, but now we have before parliament a plan which is to simplify the welfare system in a very substantive way. I might deal with those three issues—complexity, mutual obligation and the compliance framework—separately.


With respect to complexity, we know we have a very complex welfare system. This bill seeks to turn seven payments into one to create a new jobseeker payment, so from 20 March 2020 the bill would introduce a new single jobseeker payment which would replace the seven existing payments as the main payment for people of working age. These changes would ensure a single set of rules and rates for people of working age with the capacity to work and aim to firmly entrench employment as the desired outcome for Australians who seek the jobseeker payment. That is a very significant simplification reform. In fact, given its scale, it's interesting that only two issues really have been raised with respect to consolidating seven payments into one. Those relate to two payments: bereavement allowance and the wife pension.


I'd like to thank the member for Mayo. In her speech on the second reading she did raise a genuine issue with respect to the potential for pregnant women receiving bereavement allowance to spend longer than 14 weeks on the payment and therefore be financially worse off under the proposed arrangements. Again I thank her for raising that issue and speaking to me separately about it. We realise that that's a special category and will continue to work with her and the Nick Xenophon Team on that particular issue.


The second issue relates to what are effectively 200 wife pensioners who reside overseas and would no longer be eligible for the wife pension from a future point in time. Those individuals are presently aged between 45 and 62. Where they don't reside in a country with an international agreement, like every single other person in the welfare system that is able to work they would not be eligible to be continually funded by the taxpayer while they're overseas. That payment as it presently exists simply does not reflect community values, and it shouldn't be continued after 22 years so that we support able Australians to live overseas and never look for work even though they are of working age. That would maintain a range of existing inequities in the social security system. It reinforces outdated social norms and it would do a huge disservice to the taxpayer.


With respect to the issue of mutual obligations, again this is very significant reform. Most complaints from members opposite related to the changes to the activity test for persons aged between 55 and 59. The bill will also strengthen the employment focus of mutual obligations and better target mature-aged jobseekers with the labour market. Labor's criticism of the measure to increase the activity requirements for those aged between 55 and 59 is twofold. There are two criticisms: first, somehow this change is unfair or not in the best interests of those people aged between 55 and 59, and, second, it could affect rates of volunteering.


The truth of the situation is that neither of those criticisms is correct. There is a central question of principle here. As a government, we take the view that jobseekers aged between 55 and 59 are not going to benefit from being totally excused from any effort to prepare for or search for work. In fact, the contrary idea—that it is actually in a person's interest to be in a system that requires some effort to search for work—is supported by many sources. The Department of Employment's data shows that, in the year ending December 2016, over all age groups, 32.4 per cent of jobseekers who participated in voluntary work were in employment three months later. Comparatively, 48.5 per cent of jobseekers who participated in jobactive were in employment three months later. Reputable data also exists to show that mature-aged people are 13 times more likely to find work when actively looking for it. Critically, alongside this reform is the fact that the government is investing over $110 million in mature-aged re-skilling packages to help older Australians retain and find work.


The government also rejects the argument that the reforms for the 55 to 59 age bracket would see volunteer groups somehow lose volunteers. In claiming a negative impact on volunteering, members opposite continually and conveniently ignore the fact that, of the 40,000 jobseekers aged 55 to 59, only around 7½ thousand presently use volunteering alone to meet their 30 hours of activity. Also, of course, members opposite ignored the fact that our reforms will, for the first time, require that 45,000 jobseekers aged over 60 will have some mutual obligations, where at present there are none, and be required to undertake 10 hours of activity per fortnight, all of which could be met through volunteering. That means a boost to the volunteering sector by providing a net increase of up to 337,000 volunteering hours a fortnight. How can it be considered a disadvantage to volunteering groups when it could provide up to 337,000 hours more volunteering a fortnight?


This bill also contains changes for faster connection to employment services. From 1 January 2018, the bill will encourage jobseekers to connect more quickly with their employment service providers. Some members opposite have raised concerns on how this measure would impact on jobseekers in rural and remote areas. Again, the fact is that, under current arrangements, jobseekers in regional areas are exempt from RapidConnect where transport would not allow attendance at their initial appointment in a timely manner, and that safeguard remains.


Some issues were raised with respect to the removal of intent-to-claim provisions. Under this bill, the social security claimants would receive payments from the date they provide all material necessary to be assessed that is within their control, rather than from the date of first contact with the Department of Human Services expressing an intention to claim. That is opposed by Labor, but the fact is that, at present, an applicant can provide only their name and the payment which they intend to claim and be back paid to the date that they first made contact with the department. This arrangement simply does not align with community expectations and, again, does a massive disservice to the taxpayer. It is simply not an unreasonable request for applicants to provide the very basic required information when lodging a claim. This measure will improve the integrity and administrative complexity of the welfare system, and, again, adequate provisions and exemptions exist for people who do not have the ability to provide all relevant documents, including those who may be disabled or live in remote areas and those who are homeless or affected by domestic violence.


The bill, under the heading of strengthening mutual obligation requirements, deals with a range of substance abuse measures. It introduces three measures to strengthen requirements for jobseekers with substance abuse issues and provides improved pathways for them to pursue appropriate treatment.


Firstly, the bill establishes a two-year trial of drug testing for 5,000 recipients of Newstart and youth allowance from 1 January 2018. Members opposite oppose this trial, doing so on the basis that they say there is no evidence that it's guaranteed to work. Of course, the first point is that this position ignores the fact that it is a trial, designed to determine whether the welfare system can be effectively used to compel people into treatment. Further, that is the same argument that has been run against the cashless welfare card and against the No Jab, No Pay immunisation policy to link vaccination to family tax benefit payments, and yet both of those policies have proven very substantial and successful in changing behaviours and improving individual lives.


The exact reason that there is no evidentiary guarantee for a trial like this, or that it will work, is that it has never been done before in the way that we are doing it. Despite multiple false statements by members opposite, this trial will not cut people off from income support if they test positive for drugs. It is very different in that respect to the trials that have been conducted overseas. Instead, after a first test, our trial will limit the amount of income support that is provided in cash and, following a second positive test, it refers the individual to a doctor for an assessment on what treatment may be required.


I think the member for Barton typified the opposition's position in opposing this in her second reading contribution. She said that the trial won't work because, 'this requires a medical response'. Of course, a medical response is exactly what we are proposing. Every decision regarding treatment will be made by a qualified medical professional, paid for and provided by the government. The member for Barton also gave Labor's objection to the trial on the basis that income management was described as not being an effective tool to help people with substance abuse problems. Indeed, what I think was revealed in several contributions from members opposite was an equal opposition to the trial as to the consequences of a positive drug test being income management.


I must say to the member for Jagajaga that I share her views where she noted that income management is a useful and important tool for protecting vulnerable people—particularly for protecting children. It makes sure that welfare payments are spent on the essentials of life—things like food, clothing and rent—and not on alcohol or drugs. The Labor position also conveniently ignores the considerable body of evidence that exists around the effectiveness of compelling people into drug treatment.


The reason for trialling a new approach where there is not an evidentiary guarantee of success is to trial, test and learn. Equally, the fact that there may not be a guarantee of success is distinct from a lack of evidence to suggest that the trial of a new approach could reasonably be considered worthwhile. I worked in drug courts and, in fact, much of what we have done is based on the process there. Drug courts, of course, effectively mandate treatment and they have been very successful in mandating treatment for drug and alcohol problems. The data and evidence shows that this type of compulsion for treatment can be very effective. The Magistrates Early Referral Into Treatment Program—the MERIT Program—in New South Wales has resulted in the number of people in employment rising from 20 per cent at program entry to 27.5 per cent at exit. The Victorian Drug Court had a study which showed that 79 per cent of people appearing before it were unemployed. It showed that the benefits of the drug treatment compulsory order program included improved health and wellbeing, reductions in drug and alcohol risk and enhanced employment prospects and overarching life skills.


A 2008 study published by the Crime and Misconduct Commission in Queensland examined the issue of mandatory versus voluntary treatment for drug and alcohol problems. It concluded as follows:


Our findings do not support the current treatment philosophy of waiting for people with drug and/or alcohol abuse problems to get themselves psychologically motivated and prove their readiness to receive treatment. On the contrary, the findings indicate that mandatory treatment seems a promising option to help offenders with drug and alcohol abuse problems.


This trial has been developed to test whether the welfare system can be used in a similar way to drug courts. If it does not work, of course there will be a need to try something else. If it does work, we will have improved the lives of people with those drug problems.


Two other measures in this bill also ensure that jobseekers with substance abuse issues remain actively engaged in appropriate activities, including treatment to address their barriers to work rather than being exempt from all mutual obligation requirements. From 1 January 2018, jobseekers will no longer be exempt from their mutual obligation or participation requirements if the reason they are unable to meet their obligations is predominantly due to drug or alcohol dependency. From 1 January 2018, the government will also tighten the reasonable excuse rules to allow for the closing of a loophole so that alcohol and drug dependency will not be accepted as a reasonable excuse for not meeting obligations when the jobseekers are not also actively engaged in treatment.


Again, Labor sought to characterise these changes as punitive, but what they failed to point out or to mention is that this change is accompanied by, and will run parallel to, one of the most important changes in this reform package—that is that for the first time all jobseekers will be able to have drug and alcohol treatment efforts count towards their mutual obligation requirements.


The fundamental principle the government reforms embody is simply this: citizens who are receiving taxpayer funds in the form of welfare benefits should not be able to claim drug and alcohol abuse as a reason for failing to undertake critical mutual obligations like turning up to job interviews unless they are also making reasonable efforts to undertake treatment or support for the problem. The system as it currently stands fails to detect people with drug problems and simply allows those it does not know about to be exempt from all mutual obligations. The purpose of all these measures is to ensure that, when people have substance abuse issues that are acting as a barrier to their employment, they are compelled into appropriate treatment.


With respect to the compliance framework, from 1 July 2018, a new jobseeker compliance framework will provide more support to those who are genuinely trying to meet their obligations whilst also introducing fairer and more contemporary penalties for the very small number of jobseekers who persistently and deliberately do not meet their requirements. The Labor Party called for the reinstatement of waivers and provider discretion, but that is the exact reason the present system is failing. The failure of the current waiver arrangements and the inconsistency in the use of discretion has made our proposed changes completely necessary. Under the framework, at present, 93 per cent of penalties for serious or persistent noncompliance are waived. This means there is no consequence for the overwhelming majority of jobseekers who repeatedly fail to meet their requirements or who refuse an offer of suitable work. Penalties only apply to those who repeatedly fail, with multiple barrier assessments and warnings before this could occur. Reasonable excuse provisions will of course continue to apply.


With respect to information management, I would also note briefly that the bill eliminates the requirement for the Department of Human Services to obtain information twice. It streamlines prosecution processes and reduces the administrative burden of criminal investigations. These changes do align with the Department of Human Services information-gathering powers and align it with that of other agencies at the Commonwealth and state and territory levels. The changes retain the common-law right to silence, preventing use of information or documents against the person that provided them other than in proceedings for the provision of false information. This exception is consistent with the guide to framing Commonwealth offences, infringement notices and enforcement that states that the privilege against self-incrimination does not apply where it is alleged a person has given false or misleading information.


In summary, it is critical to ensure that our welfare system is efficient, effective and sustainable into the future. We simply cannot afford a set-and-forget approach to the welfare system. It is for those reasons that I commend the bill to the House.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Jagajaga has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment be agreed to.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:49):  I rise to speak on the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017. Labor will support the bill in the House. We understand the government will make an amendment as agreed with Labor. The immigration and border force portfolio is a very complex and dynamic remit with many areas integral to the integrity, security, prosperity and safety of this country. It includes stronger borders, preventing people smugglers and stopping deaths at sea—areas of policy Labor is strongly committed to—as well as the visa system, skilled migration, customs, the administration and collection of tariffs, travel, tourism and many more.


Given these broad portfolio matters, the issue of transparency and accountability in the work undertaken by the department, staff, contractors and service providers is absolutely critical. It is especially important to the trust that Australians have in the integrity of our immigration and humanitarian programs. The Department of Immigration and the Australian Customs and Border and Protection Service merged in 2015 to become the current department with its operational arm being the Australian Border Force. Given this merger, the secrecy and disclosure provisions in part 6 of the legislation then covering Border Force were adapted from the now repealed Customs Administration Act into the new legislation. At the time, Labor supported the ABF Act, inclusive of part 6. Since 2015, there has been both confusion and criticism with part 6 of the ABF Act—about what information is protected and what information can be disclosed.


The ABF Act, as currently written, essentially protects all information, which has led to a lack of disclosure of information by concerned individuals and stakeholders. Some stakeholders refer to the 'chilling effect' the act has on the public disclosure of information. The appropriateness of this, and concerns raised by stakeholders about an inability to disclose any information, was one of the main driving forces behind Labor including an examination of part 6 of the act in the terms of reference of the recent Senate inquiry into serious allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect of asylum seekers in the Nauru regional processing centre and similar allegations in the Manus regional processing centre.


It is important to clarify any real or perceived confusion about whether information is or is not protected. Labor agrees people should have the right to disclose non-sensitive information where appropriate and when required. Given this, we welcome the legislation before the chamber today. The practical application of this bill is to more narrowly define information that is protected from disclosure. This narrowing of the definition clarifies people's capacity to disclose non-protected information. It is also important to clarify the matter, given instances in which this information could lead to actions against an individual.


The bill adds three new permitted purposes for which personal information can be disclosed under the legislation. This includes matters of intercountry adoption, the protection of national security and defence of the country and the location of missing persons, all measures which Labor is very committed to and supports. The legislation amends the ABF Act 2015 in a number of ways. As per the current act, protected information is currently defined as 'information that was obtained by a person in the person's capacity as an entrusted person'. It is a very broad definition and covers all information obtained in the capacity of entrusted person. Under the legislation, that person could be the secretary of the department, the Australian Border Force Commissioner or an Immigration and Border Force Protection worker.


The proposed amendments narrow the scope and change the protected information to a new definition called 'Immigration and Border Protection information'. Subsection 1 of section 4 of the Immigration and Border Protection information includes disclosure that could reasonably be expected to prejudice security, defence or the international relations of Australia such as high-level data and information on human trafficking exchanged with other countries. The next subsection talks about the need to prevent detection and investigation of or conduct of proceedings relating to an offence or a contravention of a civil penalty provision, including information obtained by the interception of communications under a warrant. The next subsection talks about the protection of public health or endangering the life or safety of an individual or group of individuals such as through revealing the biographical details of individuals in witness protection programs. The next subsection deals with disclosure of information 'which would or could reasonably be expected to found an action by a person (other than the Commonwealth) for breach of a duty of confidence'. For example, details of aviation operations which are commercial-in-confidence. The next one talks about disclosure which could cause competitive detriment to a person, including commercially sensitive information about commercial entities such as names of suppliers, prices paid for goods and, finally, anything prescribed under information of a kind prescribed in instrument under subsection (7), which I will refer to later on. In this amendment, the narrowing, I think, is beneficial for public trust and integrity in the system. Of course there are some offences associated with the legislation as well, including unauthorised disclosure of information carrying imprisonment as a punishment for up to two years. 


The executive memorandum of this bill argues that the amendments are made in terms of these provisions because they are ineffective and reduce operational administrative inefficiencies. Subsection (1) creates a new definition of duty of confidence, immigration and border protection information and intelligence agencies. That is subsection (1) of section 4. The amendments make a difference to public integrity and trust in the system. The new subsection 4(7) I mentioned before creates new powers for the secretary of the department to prescribe the kind of information to be defined as immigration and border protection information by way of a legislative instrument. That legislative instrument is disallowable, and we would agree with that—that is, if the secretary is satisfied that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to prejudice the effective work of the department or otherwise harm public interest. Given the complexities of the immigration and border protection portfolio, it is reasonable that issues may arise because of unforeseen changes in circumstances which make it necessary for information to be protected from disclosure and for that action to be taken quickly. 


Labor is not convinced that this power should rest with an unelected public official, albeit someone of the standing of the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. This is a concern that was shared by the chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry, Ian Macdonald, who, in the public hearing into this bill said that he felt 'uncomfortable with this power resting with the secretary'. Labor is strongly of the view that the minister should be personally responsible and accountable for any decision to protect from disclosure any additional information that should be covered by this legislation, and which is certainly not covered by the definition. If they are going to add additional information, it should be the minister and not an unelected secretary of the department. 


Labor anticipates that the minister will move an amendment to the legislation before the House today to transfer this responsibility from the secretary to the minister, and Labor will support that amendment. This is not a decision that should be delegated to the department. Labor supports transparency and accountability in immigration and border protection decision-making. The minister should always be accountable and willing to justify any decision to protect from disclosure additional immigration and border protection information. 


Part 1 of schedule 1 of the bill will have a retrospective application backdated to 1 July 2015 which should give some comfort to stakeholders and advocates who have spoken about the Turnbull government's failure to manage the immigration and border protection portfolio. This clarifies that only information that would cause identifiable harm if disclosed is to be protected under the ABF Act. The new narrower definition of immigration and border protection information will, I think, reassure individuals who may otherwise erroneously believe that they have committed an offence. I also note that there have been no prosecutions under the current ABF Act for release of protected information. The ABF Act also makes amendments to the Customs legislation and other types of legislation. 


Unlike the current government in their failures to consult or welcome scrutiny, Labor will always consult with relevant stakeholders, advocates, experts and others when developing policy and legislation, given the potential legislative impact those changes may have on people. With that in mind, we referred this particular bill to a Senate inquiry in relation to it. The Senate inquiry is due to report on 12 September, before the Senate looks at it but after the House will deal with this legislation. Whilst awaiting the final report, we note the 13 submissions that have been received by that Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill. A public hearing was held last Friday.


Submissions made to the Senate inquiry generally welcomed the proposed amendments to the ABF Act to narrow the scope of information which could be protected and to offer greater clarity about the types of information that can be publicly disclosed. The Refugee Advice and Casework Service, commonly known as RACS, confirmed in their submission their support for the bill and said that the bill:


… would bring a greater degree of transparency to the immigration detention system.


The submission also said:


By substituting 'protected information' with 'Immigration and Border Protection Information', the Bill decriminalises the disclosure of a range of information that may be crucial for avoiding harm.


The Law Council of Australia stated in its submission that it:


… welcomes any attempt at ameliorating the secrecy provisions in the Act in order to address concerns over the encroachments on freedom of speech.


The Human Rights Commission expressed a view that the proposed amendments are better than the current ABF Act, stating:


When compared to the current law, it strikes a better balance between recognising the need to protect sensitive government information and the importance of allowing legitimate public scrutiny.


Additionally, during the public hearing on Friday, 8 September, Doctors for Refugees provided testimony stating their support for the intent of the bill, despite serious reservation about the provision of health care provided to asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru. This includes the willingness of Australian based medical practitioners to speak out about the availability and provision of medical care.


I note concerns raised by submitters, including concerns as to the power of the secretary of the department, as I referred to before, and the processes of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection in marking information with appropriate security classifications; and questions as to why the department would have the need to protect the information. In particular, I draw the House's attention to a submission made by the Australian Information Commissioner which recommends:


… that the Department undertake a Privacy Impact Assessment … on this proposed change if one has not been undertaken.


During the public hearing on this bill, the department confirmed that, in preparing this bill, they did not undertake a privacy impact assessment. This is despite the Information Commissioner, in his submission, arguing:


Conducting a PIA would assist in identifying any privacy impacts associated with the handling of the relevant personal information due to the change in definition.


According to the commissioner, a privacy impact statement would also:


… provide an opportunity to undertake proactive steps to mitigate any potential impacts.


I urge the government to undertake such steps in the future.


Regrettably, the Australian public is all too aware of the failings of this government with respect to the operation of the Immigration and Border Force portfolio. The failures are not different. As in other areas of health and education, there has been report after report from the Auditor-General in relation to the dismal handling of this portfolio in terms of offshore processing and the mismanagement of the department by the current minister and the previous minister. There has been mismanagement of offshore processing and of welfare and garrison support contracts, the subject of two scathing ANAO reports. The government sat on its hands as to negotiating third-country arrangements, particularly for Australian-funded offshore processing centres.


We support the US refugee resettlement deal. We want all eligible refugees to have the opportunity to resettle, including refugees who are currently in Australia for ongoing medical treatment. The government seem to have put all their eggs in one basket with the US resettlement deal, and we urge them to look elsewhere for other third-country arrangements. We have consistently called on the government—in the interests of accountability and transparency, on which they seem to have had a change of heart here—to release details of the US refugee agreement and any side agreement they had in relation to the Costa Rica arrangements. The government have come to the party here. They've made changes in terms of protected information. We urge them to show the same degree of transparency and accountability on the US refugee resettlement deal and the Costa Rica arrangements that the current Prime Minister came to with then President Obama.


We want refugees off Manus and Nauru and into third countries as soon as possible, but we will hold the government to account in terms of transparency in the onshore as well as the offshore immigration system. When it comes to their handling of this, the minister and the secretary of the department should always be able to account for and should account for inaction. And that's what happened. The subject of this legislation before the chamber was looked at by the Senate inquiry which I referred to earlier. In September 2016, Labor initiated that inquiry because of the failure of the Turnbull government to act on serious allegations raised in the Nauru files aired by The Guardian. The chair's report, conclusions and recommendations from that Senate inquiry were handed down on 21 April this year. It's been 155 days and counting of complete and utter inaction on those recommendations. During those 155 days, we've seen more and more examples of failure by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection to manage his secretary and the department


It seems to me that a 'tick and flick' approach is simply not good enough. I saw that exposed last week with reports that about 2,000 departmental staff were overpaid for leave, and this went unnoticed by the minister for immigration for two years. The minister blamed a systems error for the overpayments while forcing staff into an inflexible repayment scheme owing to his own failure to manage the department. This occurred while morale within the department is said to have collapsed and workers and their representatives, the unions, are still locked in a dispute with the Turnbull government over pay and conditions that's lasted for four years.


Labor is increasingly concerned about the Turnbull government's failure to manage offshore processing centres and to treat asylum seekers fairly and with dignity. Recently the immigration minister callously cut financial support and housing for asylum seekers transferred from Manus Island and Nauru for medical treatment. There are up to 400 people, potentially, who could be caught up in this decision. The cuts began without warning two weeks ago. In the interests of transparency and accountability and in the spirit of this particular legislation that we've got today, we ask the government not to purposely make people destitute and homeless. The government can only exacerbate health conditions of asylum seekers who were originally transferred to Australia for treatment. The immigration minister has completely failed to make a case as to why these people haven't been allowed to apply for resettlement in the United States while receiving medical treatment in Australia. The long-term issue of these people being in Australia could have been avoided entirely if these eligible refugees had been allowed to apply to be resettled as part of the US refugee resettlement arrangement whilst still living in Australia, as recommended by that Senate inquiry I've referred to.


Labor is committed to holding the government to account and to increasing transparency in onshore immigration detention and offshore immigration processing. The bill before the House today eases some of our concerns in relation to these issues, but it's simply not good enough. The government needs to do better—certainly in terms of the provision of medical care to refugees who need it on Manus and Nauru. There've been a number of medical reports of asylum seekers and refugees in regional processing centres experiencing significant delays in the medical transfer process or having their recommended procedures being unavailable on Manus and Nauru. I wrote to the immigration minister to seek an assurance that medical transfers would be available when recommended by medical professionals, including women's rights to reproductive assistance. My letter drew the attention of the minister to recommendations 1 and 2 of that Senate inquiry. I will read them for the record. Recommendation 1 is:


The committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, as a matter of urgency, commission an external review of its medical transfer procedures in offshore processing centres. 


Recommendation 2 is:


The committee recommends that the Australian Government undertake to seek advice in relation to whether improvements are required to the medical treatment options available to asylum seekers and refugees in the Republic of Nauru and Papua New Guinea, particularly mental health services.


Today I again remind the House that the Turnbull government has yet to respond to these recommendations, and I urge the minister to respond to the Senate recommendations and to read the report and act on those recommendations.


Pending an anticipated amendment, Labor will support the bill before the House. Labor is committed to improving transparency and accountability, and we want to make sure that appropriate information is protected but that there be adequate disclosure provisions there. It's critical to the trust Australians have in the integrity of our immigration and border protection policies. Given this, we would welcome the amendments we anticipate today, including the narrowing of the definition of information that is protected from disclosure. We will continue to hold the government to account, and I urge the government to respond to the Nauru files Senate inquiry's recommendations and to my letter as soon as possible.

"Templeman, Susan, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (17:09):  I welcome the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017. I welcome it alongside the legal, medical and aid organisations and an organisation in my own community, the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group, who are looking forward to the improvements it will bring to existing law relating to the transparency that we have in Australia's offshore detention system.


As a former journalist, I've been particularly concerned with the Turnbull government's lack of transparency in the operation of offshore detention centres. My community has always been an extremely outspoken one when it comes to issues of refugees and asylum seekers. I've received hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of letters protesting not only the conditions of Australia's offshore detention centres but also the secrecy that the Australian offshore detention regime has been shrouded in.


I'm pleased to see that this parliament is taking bipartisan steps—albeit modest ones, by the Law Council's assessment—towards ensuring that Australians know what is happening in offshore detention, that refugees and asylum seekers are afforded freedom of political communication in line with the common and international law that we operate under and that individuals working on Manus and Nauru are able to more freely speak about what they see. This bill tangibly means that individuals who've been involved in Australia's offshore detention system as contractors or employees of the DIBP, such as Save the Children, social workers, psychologists, doctors and lawyers, will generally be able to speak more freely about their experiences and what they've seen with less fear of prosecution.


The bill narrows the type of information which, if recorded or disclosed, would make a person liable to prosecution under section 42 of the act. It repeals a very broad phrase, 'protected information', and gives a more precise and specific definition. For instance, it defines that 'information the disclosure of which would or could reasonably be expected to prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia'—such as high-level data and information on human trafficking exchanged with other countries—is covered. It specifies that information 'which would or could reasonably expected to cause competitive detriment to a person', including commercially sensitive information about commercial entities, such as names of suppliers or prices paid for goods, is now defined.


This bill begins to stop the government's total suppression of so-called whistleblowers and staff speaking out about Australia's offshore detention regime, and that is a good thing. The Chairperson of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, Malcolm Evans, said:


This is why we think independent monitoring is so important—transparency is one of the greatest protections here. Where there's a lack of transparency, naturally there will be concerns things are not as they ought.


As a former reporter, I would say transparency is vital, and this is a good step at improving the level of transparency in offshore detention. Under the current legislation, you can't guarantee that whistleblowers would have been spared from retaliation. I'm particularly pleased that the bill has a retrospective commencement date, meaning that those who've spoken out in the past may well fall under the concessions in this bill.


The Turnbull government's mismanagement of offshore processing centres and welfare and support contracts has been the subject of two scathing Australian National Audit Office reports, so, clearly, greater transparency is very welcome. My community was outraged, rightly so, at the release of the Nauru files, where 26 former Save the Children workers on Manus and Nauru detailed what they saw and described allegations of sexual assault and self-harm in the Nauru detention centre. One of the workers stated:


You feel you can't talk about it even though you know you should talk about it.


The files, which the government shrouded in secrecy, included reports of genital mutilation against young women, people sewing their lips shut, self-immolation, sexual violence and gross mishandling of incidents by private contractors.


In September 2016, Labor initiated a Senate inquiry to investigate these allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect, because the Turnbull government had failed to act. The government's total inaction for the past 3½ months on the chair's report conclusions and recommendations is extremely disappointing. Let's remember the Australian Border Force Act has previously been used by the Abbott government to attempt to prosecute Save the Children staff after they revealed serious allegations of abuse of women and children. In future, with this amendment, I hope this means that can't happen again.


In looking at the bill before us today, I note that in total, there were 13 submissions to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee Senate inquiry into the bill, generally welcoming the amendments to narrow the scope of information which should be protected and offer greater clarity about the types of information that can be publicly disclosed, a belated step but certainly a step in the right direction. 


I would like to take a moment to talk about the anticipated amendment that has been foreshadowed by the shadow minister—that is, the minister, not the secretary of the department, should have the power to prescribe which information is protected. It should certainly be the case that the minister should be personally responsible and accountable for any decision to protect from disclosure any additional immigration and border protection information not already covered by the definition. We certainly look forward to that amendment being moved and we would support that amendment. 


Having said those things about the bill, there are other things that this issue raises. We must not forget that this government has systematically maligned asylum seekers and refugees and mismanaged offshore processing in Manus Island and Nauru. Whether we liked it or not at the time Manus Island and Nauru were set up as regional transit processing facilities. They were never meant to be what they've become, a place of indefinite detention, because the government failed to secure third-country resettlement options. No-one in this chamber can possibly feel that people should still be on Nauru and Manus Island four years on. The Prime Minister and immigration minister should be exploring every possible alternative. 


I note that New Zealand Labour leader, Jacinda Ardern, will renew the country's offer to take refugees from Manus Island if she is successful in the election later this month. It is not enough to assume that the US agreement is the sole answer, but this minister has tried to shirk responsibility wherever he can. This is, after all, the minister who said that Australia is 'not responsible' for the hundreds of asylum seekers on Manus Island after the Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court ruled that the detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island is illegal. The minister needs to listen to the UNHCR, which last month said that PNG and Nauru remain unsuitable as places of resettlement, not least because of the lack of medical and psychological services. In fact, it is the provision of medical services that goes to the heart of the concerns my community raises with me—the impact that indefinite detention is having on people. The Blue Mountains branch of Grandmothers Against Detention of Refugee Children have been extremely vocal in fighting for fairness and humanity in our offshore detention centre, as have Justice For Children. I have with me a petition of more than 600 signatures that has gone to the Prime Minister, collected mainly in the Blue Mountains, but from as far afield as Dubbo and Bondi. These grandmothers remind the government that we are signatories to international agreements which need to be respected. 


Another group in my electorate wanting to see more humane treatment of people is the Uniting Church. Members of the Springwood Uniting Church last week sent me a petition addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, expressing their outrage at the minister's decision to withdraw income and accommodation support from up to 370 babies, children, women and male asylum seekers brought to Australia from Nauru and Manus Island on medical grounds. These are some of the most vulnerable people in our community, with more than 20 of the women victims of sexual assault. The minister is making their struggle and their recovery worse by now impoverishing them and making them destitute and homeless. The government's decision to cut financial support and housing to these asylum seekers is a new low, even for them. By purposefully making people destitute, making them homeless, the Turnbull government can only be exacerbating the very health conditions they were originally transferred to Australia to be treated for. I can't fathom why these same people have not been allowed to apply for resettlement in the US. why have they deliberately being excluded from that agreement? The minister has failed to really explain why.


I encourage the congregation of Springwood Uniting to keep raising issues like these. The Blue Mountains branches of GetUp! and Amnesty International have also communicated their concerns and have joined the chorus of almost a thousand of my constituents who have taken the time to personally contact me about the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. In fact, the only other issue that has garnered more correspondence in my electorate is the government's mishandling of the National Broadband Network—that speaks volumes for how appalled so many in the community are.


People and groups in my community, such as the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group, have been at the forefront of providing assistance to asylum seekers and refugees arriving in Australia. They welcome this amendment to the Australian Border Force Act. The Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group is a group made up of grassroots members of my community who provide practical assistance to those in detention at Villawood and those who are released from detention. They provide financial support to asylum seekers and refugees in our community. They find employment for asylum seekers and they help them find homes. When people are given work rights they often get a job through the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group. They rely on the goodwill of people in the community to assist them to furnish the homes that they find. They provide English lessons and tutors, and they provide friendship and support for a group of people who are often demonised and isolated. They provide lifts to medical appointments, they help them navigate complex government bureaucracy and much more.


There is also a refugee cricket team, Oceans 12. One of their matches earlier this year was on Anzac Day, with the Navy cricket team. The comment from the captain of Oceans 12 was that it was strange to be playing cricket against a Defence Force team as most of the players were more used to being afraid of defence forces in their own countries rather than being seen as equals. This is the sort of community building that the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group does, and I'm proud to be a member of it. I will always consult them about amendments to bills and gauge their response.


The Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group has welcomed this bill as a good first step in increasing transparency in Australia's offshore detention system. They will continue to fight for fair and humane treatment of asylum seekers and refugees, and I will stand alongside them.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2017-09-11,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (17:22):  I welcome the comments from the member for Macquarie and thank her for the work that she is doing in this parliament. The purpose of the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 is to introduce amendments to the 2015 Australian Border Force Act, legislation that sought to stop the unauthorised disclosure of information that could harm the national or public interest.


I support this bill. The minister and, in turn, the government are showing that they are listening to the concerns raised by the community and by professionals working in the sector. And they have responded in a positive way to those concerns by addressing the problems raised. I acknowledge the work of the government in doing this and say thank you.


However, there are still problem areas, and I ask the minister and the government to bring this same approach to the issues raised in a number of submissions made to the recent Senate inquiry. These issues include that the power to make a legislative instrument should rest with the minister, rather than with the department secretary. I understand that we'll have an amendment to that effect shortly. I note that the government is this afternoon circulating further amendments to the bill, and that these amendments will provide for the minister to make this legislative instrument; I acknowledge that.


There are other recommendations that new provisions and powers introduced in the bill could be used in a way that negates this purpose of distinguishing between information that does or does not need to be kept secret. There is also a provision for an external or independent arbitrator for complaints and breaches of offshore and onshore operations. Later in this speech I will share with this parliament some of the emails from my constituents responding to the pending closure of the regional processing centre in Manus Island in October, and particularly in response to the government's announcement of new visa conditions for those asylum seekers who have been brought to Australia and have been living in the community.


But first I would like to talk briefly to some of the work of Save the Children Australia. They made a number of submissions to the inquiry. Save the Children consider this bill a step in the right direction in decriminalising certain public interest disclosures pertaining to immigration regulation. Save the Children was contracted by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection from August 2013 to October 2015 to provide education, recreation, child protection and welfare services to asylum seekers and refugees in Nauru. In the course of providing these services, Save the Children and its employees were subject to the Australian Border Force Act as well as other legislation, such as section 70 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, that criminalise certain disclosures by those contracted to government.


Save the Children Australia welcomes proposed amendments to the act to allow for lawful disclosure of information in the public interest in Australia. It says it is appropriate for the government to extend confidentiality requirements to organisations contracted to provide services on its behalf. It notes the need for a careful balance between the maintenance of confidential information on the one hand and disclosures where the public interest demand it on the other.


Save the Children Australia's note of caution is that the bill introduces some new powers and provisions that could be used in a way that negates their stated purpose of distinguishing between information that does and does not need to be kept secret for legitimate governmental reasons. In particular, it says the delegation of power to the departmental secretary to make an instrument should rest with the minister instead. It argues this broad discretion should be used to prevent the lawful disclosure of a wide range of information, so I welcome the minister's attention to that.


I also refer to the submission made by Rural Australians for Refugees—RAR. Rural Australians for Refugees is a network of groups. They describe themselves as 'everyday people throughout regional Australia aiming to bring about change to the way Australia treats refugees and those seeking asylum'. RAR was formed in 2001 and currently consists of more than 70 groups across all the states and territories. Groups develop activities that suit the strengths of their members and their communities. Some are focused on providing support to newly arrived refugees, as the member for Macquarie has just outlined. Some have chosen community education and awareness programs, while others advocate their concerns to government and the public. Many of the groups do all three.


The RAR national president, Marie Sellstrom, is from Mansfield in my electorate. Indeed, there is a strong connection between Indi and the RAR national executive, with the vice president, Ruth Fluhr, coming from the Strathbogie Tableland in North-East Victoria and the secretary, Penny Egan-Vine, coming from Albury-Wodonga. I meet with representatives from local RAR branches and associated networks in Indi on a regular basis, including the convenor of the north-east refugee support network, Freida Andrews, of Benalla, and I thank them all for their ongoing work and representations to my office on behalf of their communities. They are a voice of conscience in my electorate. They call for better communication from the government and immigration authorities. They call for mercy for those who find themselves in such an untenable situation as to need to ask for asylum.


Network members will make a visit to Canberra later this year to plead their case for the support of refugees, and discuss how regional communities can provide their support. I also note that executive members of Rural Australians for Refugees will be in Canberra at Parliament House later this week, and I will be meeting with Marie Sellstrom and RAR national treasurer, Margaret Rasa, on Wednesday morning.


Since its inception, RAR members have been increasingly concerned about what they perceive to be a retraction and diminution of accountability by government in the operation of refugees and asylum policies. They note that over the past 15 years members' legitimate questions have been ignored or met with obstruction and/or outright obfuscation in the name of 'security' or 'privacy' or 'client confidentiality' or 'commercial in confidence'. RAR members have also noted an unwillingness on the part of government to account to taxpayers and the ongoing lack of transparency in response to legitimate questions about the conduct and the costs of private contractors. Why do legitimate questions and attempts to obtain information and access sometimes meet with attack?


RAR says it fully supports the need for special and heightened arrangements to protect Australia's security; however, it does not support the merging of security and secrecy as a means of avoiding security of routine and non-sensitive operational and administrative arrangements. RAR argues that the same standards of accountability that apply generally to the government within our democracy should apply to the operations of refugee and asylum policy.


RAR welcomes the government's amendments to the Australian Border Force Act that it says will remove elements unduly constraining democratic access. RAR seeks a strong amendment that would objectively and specifically support improved capacity for external security of Border Force operations. It suggests specific provision for an external and independent arbitrator for complaints and breaches about the onshore and offshore operations conducted by Australian Border Force. RAR also calls for the removal of the special clause providing protection of commercial interests, believing this consideration is unnecessary and instead may lead to perceptions that Border Force operations belong outside of or above normal government commercial arrangements.


I join with both Save the Children and RAR in supporting the amendments before the House tonight. I welcome greater transparency and accountability in an area that, for too long, has been shrouded in secrecy. It is this secrecy and the lack of information about the treatment of asylum seekers that my constituents find so distressing—and, as a member of parliament, I too find it distressing. I have spoken previously about how important our laws are, but equally important is recognition that we are a compassionate nation and that we show mercy to those in the most dire of circumstances. Tonight, I call upon the government to show this mercy to the most vulnerable asylum seekers caught up in the crackdown on those who have been brought to Australia from Manus Island and Nauru. The government tells us this is a simple policy designed to stop government payments going to those who don't need them. It says these individuals, assessed on a case-by-case basis by the department, are now on a final departure bridging visa with work rights. I am told it applies only to those well enough to live in the community. But I have had dozens—more than dozens—of emails from constituents who say these asylum seekers and refugees face increasing despair and destitution, as the government attempts to force them back to Manus, Nauru or where they have fled from.


I continue to receive feedback from constituents concerned about the closure of Manus Island's regional processing centre at the end of October. To bring one particular example to light, Jill Morton of Bright, who visited Manus and Port Moresby in March, writes: 'Someone needs to stop Australia from dumping these men in PNG. It has become much more unsafe.' She also refers to the recent visit by Senator Nick McKim, and his social media post highlighting the growing number of detainees being transferred from Manus Island to Port Moresby with the understanding that they will not be returned to the detention centre and will be stuck in Port Moresby.


Two of my constituents are regular visitors to those detained at the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation at Broadmeadows. I specifically refer to Marg and Delfina. They have recently taken fresh fruit to detainees—fresh fruit. From today, 11 September, a new set of guidelines prohibits this. The department says the new rules aim to reduce the risk associated with visitors bringing in food that could compromise safety, security and good order of the immigration facilities. Food must be commercially packaged. It must be consumed during the visiting period and any leftover food must be disposed of at the end of the visit. No-one disagrees with the need for rules, but surely those rules are absolutely extreme. My constituent Marg asks: 'Why is this being done? It appears to be another cruel twist in how these people are being treated.' I agree. I ask the government representative at the table to particularly investigate those rules, follow them through and see if we can do something about making sure fresh food is able to be eaten, distributed and kept.


I am heartened, I have to say, by a response in my electorate from the work of the Northern Victoria Refugee Support Network, who have prepared a submission to the inquiry into regional development and decentralisation. They provide arguments, supported by evidence, for decentralising detention, establishing processing centres in rural and regional Australia, developing a coordinated control agency at a statewide level, locating it in a region or a regional area, and successfully integrating refugee communities into rural and regional areas. There's such willingness, there's such a want, and there are such good case studies of refugees coming to rural and regional Australia.


I look forward to continuing to see my community putting their hands up to be part of the solution, and I will not let this issue go. My community will not allow me to let it go. We need to do better, and we must do better. Time is of the essence. I am very pleased that this legislation shows the government has the capacity to change and to do things better. My constituents are telling me that parliament must show leadership. We must represent our regional and rural communities around Australia, and we must bring to parliament their voices, saying: 'Can we demonstrate compassion and support? Can we show how refugee communities can be successfully integrated to build stronger, more resilient communities, particularly in rural areas?'


In closing, I will continue to advocate for a compassionate and sustainable response by this parliament. In November last year I brought a similar speech to a conclusion by quoting Pope Francis, who noted, 'Frightened citizens build walls on one side and exclude people on the other.' This is not the time for fear and punishment. It is the time for mercy, courage and justice.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2017-09-11,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (17:36):  I'd like to follow on from the member for Indi and thank her for her contribution in this debate. The support for the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 is broad across the parliament because everybody is concerned about making sure that we are a country that accepts people on the legitimacy of their refugee application and that everybody is treated in a just way.


The provisions included in this bill that narrow the provisions in the Australian Border Force Act are extremely important in making sure that we get the measures in the law necessary to protect people—particularly vulnerable people at vulnerable stages of life, held in custody or detention by Australian agencies or offshore—and that the policy intent of the provisions set out in the original act are fully realised. They do this by narrowing the provisions to ensure that there are protections and that secrecy or privacy of individuals who are detained is properly protected. But at the same time—as I have raised in a previous public capacity—it is to ensure that information that should be available in the public sphere, particularly around the protection of people and if there are issues around criminal behaviour against individuals, can be properly reported as part of a process to make sure the government, no matter who is in charge and no matter what instrument it is, can be held properly to account.


The provisions in this piece of legislation are relatively straightforward. They narrow the basis of the provisions within sections of the existing act to make sure that it is focused primarily on immigration and border protection information rather than simply protected information, particularly around the conduct of entrusted persons. I think everybody in this place would agree with the broad thrust and focus of this bill for that reason, because it seeks to achieve the original intention of the legislation, rather than going off and doing something different, and to address the concerns that many Australians have and have had in the past. These concerns can now be addressed by narrowing the scope and definition within the legislation.


It fits within a much broader package of making sure that this government and this nation meet their expectations and responsibilities around making sure we treat in a fair and just manner people who are seeking protection as a consequence of facing persecution elsewhere in the world. We face a difficult challenge as a consequence of people seeking asylum in Australia, particularly when they arrive through means that aren't the traditional routes recommended to us by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We have to maintain and protect a clear and consistent approach, which allows people to be accepted on the basis of their need and the legitimacy of their application, not on the method or means for their arrival into Australia. At different stages that has been, broadly speaking, a bipartisan approach.


I understand that at the moment the opposition is continuing to support the government. At other points in recent past they have not done so. I hope they continue to do so, because it is in the best interests of Australians and also because it is in the best interests of those people seeking protection. It is so that they know the direct, honest and straightforward pathway to make it into Australia, rather than trying to circumvent processes to get into Australia by other means.


Having spent a lot of time in detention centres as well as refugee camps across the world, I have seen the very real and human consequences of what happens when people seek to arrive in another country through processes and means that may not be consistent with the country that they are seeking to enter, and with which they are prepared to accept. In the end, there are millions of people all around the world who are either displaced or seeking refugee protection as a consequence of the circumstances outside of their control.


We are one of many countries that takes this issue very seriously. There is a need to be able to provide people with protection as a consequence of those circumstances. We need to have a process and a system that people have confidence in. In countries, particularly in countries like ours, they need to have confidence that people are being accepted on the basis of need and the very real risk of persecution, rather than simply the way they self-identify or make their means or process to get to the country. It must be a just system to continue to preserve confidence so that we can accept people into Australia as refugees. This simple bill around refining the content and the detail within the Australian Border Force Act seeks to achieve that.


To follow on from the previous member, I've also had a number of constituents who have continued to raise concerns with me around the operation of Manus Island and the Nauru detention centre and around the conditions that people face. They aim to make sure that they are treated in a fair and just manner. I consistently raise those issues, both in my former capacity and in my current capacity, to make sure people are treated with dignity and respect. I want to stress to all the constituents of the good electorate of Goldstein that this is something that is very much at the fore of the government's mind: making sure that people are treated with dignity and respect, and, in addition, making sure their time in detention is reduced.


That is why the deal with the United States, to get people off Manus Island and Nauru, has been secured: to try and minimise the time people are held in offshore detention. Those people are able to move on with their lives. It's obviously in their interests, because it gives them the opportunity to realise what they were always seeking—to live a life free from persecution—and then to be able to go on and do it in an environment where they are able to live out their hopes and their dreams. This provides the opportunity for the formation of a family and to be able to secure work and opportunity. That should always be the objective when people are facing persecution: not just to protect them and make them safe but to provide them with foundations and opportunity for them to be able to get on with their lives, as we would hope for our fellow citizens.


This has been a long and difficult process, but it continues to be the objective of this government. In addition, it is very much in our national interest to do so. While we are being very supportive and generous to tens of thousands of people who come to Australia as refugees by providing them with support and assistance, there is no national interest on our part in holding people in detention any longer than necessary. When it comes down to it, we need people to move on with their lives as part of the package to maintain a strong protection for border security that the Australian people and the government have confidence in. We equally want people who are in detention centres to spend as little time there as possible. It's obviously financially beneficial to everybody but, more importantly, it's about people being able to move on with their lives.


If there are problems associated with that, we must be free, within the context and while respecting the privacy of individual people, to provide information that's appropriate in the public domain, because the government always needs to be held to account. As someone who has had a longstanding advocacy in this space, as well as holding government to account more generally, I am always cautious about any measure that limits the capacity for information to be reported about government. That's not a partisan point, whether the Liberals, Labor or anyone else is in office. That's a point of principle—in fact, it goes to one of the core reasons I am a Liberal. Whenever you have centralised power, no matter who is in the position to exercise it, we pose the risk that people may choose to limit the information that is freely available to the advancement and the protection of the interests of those in positions of power and responsibility. In many cases, that's at the core of why people flee from countries—because they experience persecution in the first place. That's why this bill and this provision seeks to clarify what has been longstanding practice under the existing bill—to clarify it for everybody so it will continue to operate into the future.


The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 is one that seeks to be a realisation of government aspiration and policy around refugees, and at the same time makes sure that government can be appropriately held to account for its conduct, no matter who is in office, so that all Australians can look to their government with confidence that they are doing the best, the noble and the humanitarian thing.

"O'Brien, Ted, MP",LP,2017-09-11,"



Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (17:46):  It is a pleasure to follow the member for Goldstein in this debate on the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017. National security—the defence of a nation's borders and the protection of its citizens—has been a core responsibility of sovereign governments since the rise of nation states. Even earlier, the protection of peoples and the resources that sustained them was a cornerstone responsibility for those forms of government that preceded the modern state. And so it remains for the Turnbull government—this national government—in this extraordinary era of sweeping change and global turbulence.


Today, the task of maintaining our national security is even more complex and more demanding of vigilance and specialist skills than ever before. There are more people on the move right now, globally, across national borders, searching for everything from permanent resettlement either with or without controlled parameters to travel for brief periods for business, for pleasure and maybe even for mischief, than at any other time in human history. Technological change is speeding up every aspect of that intermingling, together with the immense tensions it creates. This is one of the great global challenges of the 21st century, and we have to keep up. We have to be prepared and we have to ensure that, as new challenges emerge, we are alert enough and flexible enough to reorganise and refine our capability and systems to keep Australia safe.


That's why this bill, the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017, is before the House today. It is also why the Turnbull government is undertaking the most significant reform of Australia's national intelligence and domestic security arrangements in 40 years, as announced by the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice just two months ago, following a review of Australia's intelligence community ordered by the Prime Minister only last year. This review is a big part of that process of keeping up with an ever-changing security landscape and is so desperately important if we are to take the protection of our citizens and defence of our way of life seriously as a first priority.


The review highlighted how changing security threats and technologies are driving the need for closer cooperation and improved vigilance between and by our domestic security and law enforcement agencies, against a backdrop, it needs to be emphasised, of stellar performance from all of those agencies to date in maintaining our national security. Our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have successfully intercepted 12 imminent terrorist risks since September 2014. Operation Sovereign Borders has prevented successful people-smuggling ventures for nearly three years. Yet the government remains deeply mindful of the need to reorganise and to refine our efforts whenever compelling advice suggests it is needed to maintain our security at levels that meet the needs and expectations of Australians. Another major result of that review has been the decision to establish an Office of National Intelligence and to transform the Australian Signals Directorate into a statutory agency within the Defence portfolio.


The government will also, as part of the same batch of reforms, establish a home affairs portfolio—a portfolio of immigration, border protection and domestic security and law enforcement agencies—such that there will be an effective federation of agencies, including the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Federal Police, Australian Border Force and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.


Earlier in the year, in the May budget, the government announced a program worth nearly $60 million to enhance technology that stores biometric data—involving, especially, facial recognition and fingerprints—so that security at points of entry to Australia, especially at our international airports is enhanced. This is crucial national security work, given that an extraordinary 700,000 people arrive in and depart from Australia every week. Yet another major investment is almost $100 million, announced in the 2016 budget, to enhance, again principally through investment in technology, our visa application processes to provide us with enhanced risk assessment of applicants.


A major and very important challenge in this ongoing and evolving effort to keep the country safe is, of course, to ensure that measures are fair and reasonable in their impact and application on the vast majority of decent, honest, law-abiding people. People who cherish the rule of law and the rights we all enjoy, people who hope to enjoy those rights and freedoms by joining our Australian community or people simply visiting Australia from overseas for legitimate business or pleasure—they all deserve to be treated civilly and fairly by our laws and those who enforce them. This is a finely tuned and seriously considered balancing act, where individual freedoms are respected while at the same time our national security regime is robust, innovative and capable, and as comprehensively alert to all threats as it can be.


Information gathering by our security agencies—from individuals, from industry, from other sectors of government, from foreign agencies, from partners—to ensure mutual national security is obviously a key factor, a central factor, in enabling those agencies to keep us safe. Some of that information is highly sensitive and must be carefully managed. We have to ensure that it is only used or disclosed for legitimate purposes. The danger inherent in the mishandling or the leaking of information with the potential for significant damage to our national security, public safety and law enforcement is obvious. In the act being amended here, the penalty for that sort of breach was two years in prison.


On a more personal level, individuals can obviously suffer serious detriment where personal and sensitive information is inappropriately disclosed. Other information may be less sensitive and more appropriate to disclose in an open, democratic society while at the same time we deal effectively with critical threats. The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 clarifies the secrecy and disclosure provisions in the Australian Border Protection Act 2015 with retrospective application to reflect the policy intent of those provisions which was, and is, to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of information that could cause harm to the national or public interest—what is known as 'identifiable harm'. The bill makes clear that the definition of information to be protected includes only certain kinds of information such as that relating to the security, defence and international relations of Australia; the prevention, detection and investigation of offences; the protection of public health and safety; or sensitive personal and commercial matters. This narrowing of the definition with retrospectivity will reassure individuals who may otherwise erroneously believe they have committed an offence.


The bill maintains provisions making it an offence to record or disclose information obtained by a person in their capacity as an entrusted person. That includes people employed by the department either directly or via some form of contracted service. The unauthorised disclosure of information by these people will continue to be punishable by two years imprisonment.


These provisions were originally adapted from the model in place for the former Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, which were reflected in the Customs Administration Act 1985, but that model has not kept pace with developments that have so deeply influenced the increasingly complex and interconnected world we now live in. There was no internet then. Terrorism existed, but on nowhere near the scale that we see today. Freedom of rapid movement around the globe, especially of air travel, was in its relative infancy, given the vast numbers travelling today. There were millions of refugees, but their numbers were nowhere close to those of today, which measure in the tens of millions—managing that flood has been a significant border security issue here and for many other countries and, indeed, whole continents around the world. It was certainly a very different world in 1985.


These provisions are reasonable, necessary and proportionate for providing assurance to the Australian public, to business, to industry and to government partners in Australia and abroad that information provided to Australian authorities will be appropriately handled, to ensure a strong border protection regime. That is in the interest of all Australians and it is also in the interest of the many visitors to our shores. It is for that reason that I am happy to commend the bill to the House.

 (Reid—Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (17:56):  I rise to sum up the bill and, in doing so, note and thank members on both sides for their contributions. I acknowledge the shadow minister for immigration and border protection, Mr Neumann, who has joined me at the table, and his contribution to the debate.


The Australian Border Force Act 2015 provides an important regime in administering the secrecy and disclosure of information set out in part 6. The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 clarifies part 6 and related provisions to reflect the original intent of the legislation, which was to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of information that could cause harm to the national or public interest. The aim of the measure in this bill is to ensure that immigration and border protection information is provided with the necessary level of protection in a targeted manner but also is able to be disclosed went it is appropriate to do so. This bill provides assurances for the Australian public, business, government and foreign partners that sensitive information provided to the department of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection will be appropriately protected without unnecessarily restricting informed public debate. The retrospective application of the bill, back to the date of the Australian Border Force Act that was enacted in 2015, will provide the necessary certainty that only information which would harm the national public interest if disclosed is to be protected and will be regarded as ever having been protected under the ABF Act.

Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid—Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (17:58):  I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill and seek leave to move government amendments (1) and (2) together.


Leave granted. 




Mr LAUNDY:
  I move government amendments (1) and (2):


(1) Schedule 1, item 5, page 5 (line 1), omit ""The Secretary"", substitute ""The Minister"".


(2) Schedule 1, item 5, page 5 (line 4), omit ""the Secretary"", substitute ""the Minister"".


The Australian Border Force Act 2015 provides the regime administering the secrecy and disclosure of information set out in part 6. The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 updates these secrecy and disclosure provisions. In particular, it proposes to repeal the definition of 'protected information', which currently covers any information obtained in a person's capacity as an entrusted person, and to substitute a new definition of 'immigration and border protection information'. Under the new definition of 'immigration and border protection information', only specific kinds of information would be covered by the secrecy and disclosure regime. It would be an offence to disclosure or make a record of such information, which is punishable by imprisonment for two years, but which may be identified in the future and which may require protection.


Such information may require protection more quickly than an amendment to the Australian Border Force Act 2015 would permit. Therefore, the bill includes a new power that would enable the secretary of the department to prescribe additional kinds of 'immigration and border protection information' by legislative instrument. This would enable a swift response to the need to protect information that is not one of the other kinds of information set out in the new definition. 


The bill is currently the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. Questions have been raised in submissions to this inquiry and at the public hearing on the bill in relation to the secretary's power to prescribe additional kinds of information. As this has the potential to widen the application of the offence provision concerns have been raised that this power should not be exercised by an unelected public official. To address these concerns, the government proposes to amend this power so that it can only be exercised by the minister, and not the secretary. As the instrument prescribing new kinds of information is a legislative instrument, it will be subject to scrutiny by both houses of parliament and may be subject to disallowance.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:49):  I rise to speak on the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017. Labor will support the bill in the House. We understand the government will make an amendment as agreed with Labor. The immigration and border force portfolio is a very complex and dynamic remit with many areas integral to the integrity, security, prosperity and safety of this country. It includes stronger borders, preventing people smugglers and stopping deaths at sea—areas of policy Labor is strongly committed to—as well as the visa system, skilled migration, customs, the administration and collection of tariffs, travel, tourism and many more.


Given these broad portfolio matters, the issue of transparency and accountability in the work undertaken by the department, staff, contractors and service providers is absolutely critical. It is especially important to the trust that Australians have in the integrity of our immigration and humanitarian programs. The Department of Immigration and the Australian Customs and Border and Protection Service merged in 2015 to become the current department with its operational arm being the Australian Border Force. Given this merger, the secrecy and disclosure provisions in part 6 of the legislation then covering Border Force were adapted from the now repealed Customs Administration Act into the new legislation. At the time, Labor supported the ABF Act, inclusive of part 6. Since 2015, there has been both confusion and criticism with part 6 of the ABF Act—about what information is protected and what information can be disclosed.


The ABF Act, as currently written, essentially protects all information, which has led to a lack of disclosure of information by concerned individuals and stakeholders. Some stakeholders refer to the 'chilling effect' the act has on the public disclosure of information. The appropriateness of this, and concerns raised by stakeholders about an inability to disclose any information, was one of the main driving forces behind Labor including an examination of part 6 of the act in the terms of reference of the recent Senate inquiry into serious allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect of asylum seekers in the Nauru regional processing centre and similar allegations in the Manus regional processing centre.


It is important to clarify any real or perceived confusion about whether information is or is not protected. Labor agrees people should have the right to disclose non-sensitive information where appropriate and when required. Given this, we welcome the legislation before the chamber today. The practical application of this bill is to more narrowly define information that is protected from disclosure. This narrowing of the definition clarifies people's capacity to disclose non-protected information. It is also important to clarify the matter, given instances in which this information could lead to actions against an individual.


The bill adds three new permitted purposes for which personal information can be disclosed under the legislation. This includes matters of intercountry adoption, the protection of national security and defence of the country and the location of missing persons, all measures which Labor is very committed to and supports. The legislation amends the ABF Act 2015 in a number of ways. As per the current act, protected information is currently defined as 'information that was obtained by a person in the person's capacity as an entrusted person'. It is a very broad definition and covers all information obtained in the capacity of entrusted person. Under the legislation, that person could be the secretary of the department, the Australian Border Force Commissioner or an Immigration and Border Force Protection worker.


The proposed amendments narrow the scope and change the protected information to a new definition called 'Immigration and Border Protection information'. Subsection 1 of section 4 of the Immigration and Border Protection information includes disclosure that could reasonably be expected to prejudice security, defence or the international relations of Australia such as high-level data and information on human trafficking exchanged with other countries. The next subsection talks about the need to prevent detection and investigation of or conduct of proceedings relating to an offence or a contravention of a civil penalty provision, including information obtained by the interception of communications under a warrant. The next subsection talks about the protection of public health or endangering the life or safety of an individual or group of individuals such as through revealing the biographical details of individuals in witness protection programs. The next subsection deals with disclosure of information 'which would or could reasonably be expected to found an action by a person (other than the Commonwealth) for breach of a duty of confidence'. For example, details of aviation operations which are commercial-in-confidence. The next one talks about disclosure which could cause competitive detriment to a person, including commercially sensitive information about commercial entities such as names of suppliers, prices paid for goods and, finally, anything prescribed under information of a kind prescribed in instrument under subsection (7), which I will refer to later on. In this amendment, the narrowing, I think, is beneficial for public trust and integrity in the system. Of course there are some offences associated with the legislation as well, including unauthorised disclosure of information carrying imprisonment as a punishment for up to two years. 


The executive memorandum of this bill argues that the amendments are made in terms of these provisions because they are ineffective and reduce operational administrative inefficiencies. Subsection (1) creates a new definition of duty of confidence, immigration and border protection information and intelligence agencies. That is subsection (1) of section 4. The amendments make a difference to public integrity and trust in the system. The new subsection 4(7) I mentioned before creates new powers for the secretary of the department to prescribe the kind of information to be defined as immigration and border protection information by way of a legislative instrument. That legislative instrument is disallowable, and we would agree with that—that is, if the secretary is satisfied that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to prejudice the effective work of the department or otherwise harm public interest. Given the complexities of the immigration and border protection portfolio, it is reasonable that issues may arise because of unforeseen changes in circumstances which make it necessary for information to be protected from disclosure and for that action to be taken quickly. 


Labor is not convinced that this power should rest with an unelected public official, albeit someone of the standing of the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. This is a concern that was shared by the chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry, Ian Macdonald, who, in the public hearing into this bill said that he felt 'uncomfortable with this power resting with the secretary'. Labor is strongly of the view that the minister should be personally responsible and accountable for any decision to protect from disclosure any additional information that should be covered by this legislation, and which is certainly not covered by the definition. If they are going to add additional information, it should be the minister and not an unelected secretary of the department. 


Labor anticipates that the minister will move an amendment to the legislation before the House today to transfer this responsibility from the secretary to the minister, and Labor will support that amendment. This is not a decision that should be delegated to the department. Labor supports transparency and accountability in immigration and border protection decision-making. The minister should always be accountable and willing to justify any decision to protect from disclosure additional immigration and border protection information. 


Part 1 of schedule 1 of the bill will have a retrospective application backdated to 1 July 2015 which should give some comfort to stakeholders and advocates who have spoken about the Turnbull government's failure to manage the immigration and border protection portfolio. This clarifies that only information that would cause identifiable harm if disclosed is to be protected under the ABF Act. The new narrower definition of immigration and border protection information will, I think, reassure individuals who may otherwise erroneously believe that they have committed an offence. I also note that there have been no prosecutions under the current ABF Act for release of protected information. The ABF Act also makes amendments to the Customs legislation and other types of legislation. 


Unlike the current government in their failures to consult or welcome scrutiny, Labor will always consult with relevant stakeholders, advocates, experts and others when developing policy and legislation, given the potential legislative impact those changes may have on people. With that in mind, we referred this particular bill to a Senate inquiry in relation to it. The Senate inquiry is due to report on 12 September, before the Senate looks at it but after the House will deal with this legislation. Whilst awaiting the final report, we note the 13 submissions that have been received by that Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill. A public hearing was held last Friday.


Submissions made to the Senate inquiry generally welcomed the proposed amendments to the ABF Act to narrow the scope of information which could be protected and to offer greater clarity about the types of information that can be publicly disclosed. The Refugee Advice and Casework Service, commonly known as RACS, confirmed in their submission their support for the bill and said that the bill:


… would bring a greater degree of transparency to the immigration detention system.


The submission also said:


By substituting 'protected information' with 'Immigration and Border Protection Information', the Bill decriminalises the disclosure of a range of information that may be crucial for avoiding harm.


The Law Council of Australia stated in its submission that it:


… welcomes any attempt at ameliorating the secrecy provisions in the Act in order to address concerns over the encroachments on freedom of speech.


The Human Rights Commission expressed a view that the proposed amendments are better than the current ABF Act, stating:


When compared to the current law, it strikes a better balance between recognising the need to protect sensitive government information and the importance of allowing legitimate public scrutiny.


Additionally, during the public hearing on Friday, 8 September, Doctors for Refugees provided testimony stating their support for the intent of the bill, despite serious reservation about the provision of health care provided to asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru. This includes the willingness of Australian based medical practitioners to speak out about the availability and provision of medical care.


I note concerns raised by submitters, including concerns as to the power of the secretary of the department, as I referred to before, and the processes of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection in marking information with appropriate security classifications; and questions as to why the department would have the need to protect the information. In particular, I draw the House's attention to a submission made by the Australian Information Commissioner which recommends:


… that the Department undertake a Privacy Impact Assessment … on this proposed change if one has not been undertaken.


During the public hearing on this bill, the department confirmed that, in preparing this bill, they did not undertake a privacy impact assessment. This is despite the Information Commissioner, in his submission, arguing:


Conducting a PIA would assist in identifying any privacy impacts associated with the handling of the relevant personal information due to the change in definition.


According to the commissioner, a privacy impact statement would also:


… provide an opportunity to undertake proactive steps to mitigate any potential impacts.


I urge the government to undertake such steps in the future.


Regrettably, the Australian public is all too aware of the failings of this government with respect to the operation of the Immigration and Border Force portfolio. The failures are not different. As in other areas of health and education, there has been report after report from the Auditor-General in relation to the dismal handling of this portfolio in terms of offshore processing and the mismanagement of the department by the current minister and the previous minister. There has been mismanagement of offshore processing and of welfare and garrison support contracts, the subject of two scathing ANAO reports. The government sat on its hands as to negotiating third-country arrangements, particularly for Australian-funded offshore processing centres.


We support the US refugee resettlement deal. We want all eligible refugees to have the opportunity to resettle, including refugees who are currently in Australia for ongoing medical treatment. The government seem to have put all their eggs in one basket with the US resettlement deal, and we urge them to look elsewhere for other third-country arrangements. We have consistently called on the government—in the interests of accountability and transparency, on which they seem to have had a change of heart here—to release details of the US refugee agreement and any side agreement they had in relation to the Costa Rica arrangements. The government have come to the party here. They've made changes in terms of protected information. We urge them to show the same degree of transparency and accountability on the US refugee resettlement deal and the Costa Rica arrangements that the current Prime Minister came to with then President Obama.


We want refugees off Manus and Nauru and into third countries as soon as possible, but we will hold the government to account in terms of transparency in the onshore as well as the offshore immigration system. When it comes to their handling of this, the minister and the secretary of the department should always be able to account for and should account for inaction. And that's what happened. The subject of this legislation before the chamber was looked at by the Senate inquiry which I referred to earlier. In September 2016, Labor initiated that inquiry because of the failure of the Turnbull government to act on serious allegations raised in the Nauru files aired by The Guardian. The chair's report, conclusions and recommendations from that Senate inquiry were handed down on 21 April this year. It's been 155 days and counting of complete and utter inaction on those recommendations. During those 155 days, we've seen more and more examples of failure by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection to manage his secretary and the department


It seems to me that a 'tick and flick' approach is simply not good enough. I saw that exposed last week with reports that about 2,000 departmental staff were overpaid for leave, and this went unnoticed by the minister for immigration for two years. The minister blamed a systems error for the overpayments while forcing staff into an inflexible repayment scheme owing to his own failure to manage the department. This occurred while morale within the department is said to have collapsed and workers and their representatives, the unions, are still locked in a dispute with the Turnbull government over pay and conditions that's lasted for four years.


Labor is increasingly concerned about the Turnbull government's failure to manage offshore processing centres and to treat asylum seekers fairly and with dignity. Recently the immigration minister callously cut financial support and housing for asylum seekers transferred from Manus Island and Nauru for medical treatment. There are up to 400 people, potentially, who could be caught up in this decision. The cuts began without warning two weeks ago. In the interests of transparency and accountability and in the spirit of this particular legislation that we've got today, we ask the government not to purposely make people destitute and homeless. The government can only exacerbate health conditions of asylum seekers who were originally transferred to Australia for treatment. The immigration minister has completely failed to make a case as to why these people haven't been allowed to apply for resettlement in the United States while receiving medical treatment in Australia. The long-term issue of these people being in Australia could have been avoided entirely if these eligible refugees had been allowed to apply to be resettled as part of the US refugee resettlement arrangement whilst still living in Australia, as recommended by that Senate inquiry I've referred to.


Labor is committed to holding the government to account and to increasing transparency in onshore immigration detention and offshore immigration processing. The bill before the House today eases some of our concerns in relation to these issues, but it's simply not good enough. The government needs to do better—certainly in terms of the provision of medical care to refugees who need it on Manus and Nauru. There've been a number of medical reports of asylum seekers and refugees in regional processing centres experiencing significant delays in the medical transfer process or having their recommended procedures being unavailable on Manus and Nauru. I wrote to the immigration minister to seek an assurance that medical transfers would be available when recommended by medical professionals, including women's rights to reproductive assistance. My letter drew the attention of the minister to recommendations 1 and 2 of that Senate inquiry. I will read them for the record. Recommendation 1 is:


The committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, as a matter of urgency, commission an external review of its medical transfer procedures in offshore processing centres. 


Recommendation 2 is:


The committee recommends that the Australian Government undertake to seek advice in relation to whether improvements are required to the medical treatment options available to asylum seekers and refugees in the Republic of Nauru and Papua New Guinea, particularly mental health services.


Today I again remind the House that the Turnbull government has yet to respond to these recommendations, and I urge the minister to respond to the Senate recommendations and to read the report and act on those recommendations.


Pending an anticipated amendment, Labor will support the bill before the House. Labor is committed to improving transparency and accountability, and we want to make sure that appropriate information is protected but that there be adequate disclosure provisions there. It's critical to the trust Australians have in the integrity of our immigration and border protection policies. Given this, we would welcome the amendments we anticipate today, including the narrowing of the definition of information that is protected from disclosure. We will continue to hold the government to account, and I urge the government to respond to the Nauru files Senate inquiry's recommendations and to my letter as soon as possible.

"Templeman, Susan, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (17:09):  I welcome the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017. I welcome it alongside the legal, medical and aid organisations and an organisation in my own community, the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group, who are looking forward to the improvements it will bring to existing law relating to the transparency that we have in Australia's offshore detention system.


As a former journalist, I've been particularly concerned with the Turnbull government's lack of transparency in the operation of offshore detention centres. My community has always been an extremely outspoken one when it comes to issues of refugees and asylum seekers. I've received hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of letters protesting not only the conditions of Australia's offshore detention centres but also the secrecy that the Australian offshore detention regime has been shrouded in.


I'm pleased to see that this parliament is taking bipartisan steps—albeit modest ones, by the Law Council's assessment—towards ensuring that Australians know what is happening in offshore detention, that refugees and asylum seekers are afforded freedom of political communication in line with the common and international law that we operate under and that individuals working on Manus and Nauru are able to more freely speak about what they see. This bill tangibly means that individuals who've been involved in Australia's offshore detention system as contractors or employees of the DIBP, such as Save the Children, social workers, psychologists, doctors and lawyers, will generally be able to speak more freely about their experiences and what they've seen with less fear of prosecution.


The bill narrows the type of information which, if recorded or disclosed, would make a person liable to prosecution under section 42 of the act. It repeals a very broad phrase, 'protected information', and gives a more precise and specific definition. For instance, it defines that 'information the disclosure of which would or could reasonably be expected to prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia'—such as high-level data and information on human trafficking exchanged with other countries—is covered. It specifies that information 'which would or could reasonably expected to cause competitive detriment to a person', including commercially sensitive information about commercial entities, such as names of suppliers or prices paid for goods, is now defined.


This bill begins to stop the government's total suppression of so-called whistleblowers and staff speaking out about Australia's offshore detention regime, and that is a good thing. The Chairperson of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, Malcolm Evans, said:


This is why we think independent monitoring is so important—transparency is one of the greatest protections here. Where there's a lack of transparency, naturally there will be concerns things are not as they ought.


As a former reporter, I would say transparency is vital, and this is a good step at improving the level of transparency in offshore detention. Under the current legislation, you can't guarantee that whistleblowers would have been spared from retaliation. I'm particularly pleased that the bill has a retrospective commencement date, meaning that those who've spoken out in the past may well fall under the concessions in this bill.


The Turnbull government's mismanagement of offshore processing centres and welfare and support contracts has been the subject of two scathing Australian National Audit Office reports, so, clearly, greater transparency is very welcome. My community was outraged, rightly so, at the release of the Nauru files, where 26 former Save the Children workers on Manus and Nauru detailed what they saw and described allegations of sexual assault and self-harm in the Nauru detention centre. One of the workers stated:


You feel you can't talk about it even though you know you should talk about it.


The files, which the government shrouded in secrecy, included reports of genital mutilation against young women, people sewing their lips shut, self-immolation, sexual violence and gross mishandling of incidents by private contractors.


In September 2016, Labor initiated a Senate inquiry to investigate these allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect, because the Turnbull government had failed to act. The government's total inaction for the past 3½ months on the chair's report conclusions and recommendations is extremely disappointing. Let's remember the Australian Border Force Act has previously been used by the Abbott government to attempt to prosecute Save the Children staff after they revealed serious allegations of abuse of women and children. In future, with this amendment, I hope this means that can't happen again.


In looking at the bill before us today, I note that in total, there were 13 submissions to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee Senate inquiry into the bill, generally welcoming the amendments to narrow the scope of information which should be protected and offer greater clarity about the types of information that can be publicly disclosed, a belated step but certainly a step in the right direction. 


I would like to take a moment to talk about the anticipated amendment that has been foreshadowed by the shadow minister—that is, the minister, not the secretary of the department, should have the power to prescribe which information is protected. It should certainly be the case that the minister should be personally responsible and accountable for any decision to protect from disclosure any additional immigration and border protection information not already covered by the definition. We certainly look forward to that amendment being moved and we would support that amendment. 


Having said those things about the bill, there are other things that this issue raises. We must not forget that this government has systematically maligned asylum seekers and refugees and mismanaged offshore processing in Manus Island and Nauru. Whether we liked it or not at the time Manus Island and Nauru were set up as regional transit processing facilities. They were never meant to be what they've become, a place of indefinite detention, because the government failed to secure third-country resettlement options. No-one in this chamber can possibly feel that people should still be on Nauru and Manus Island four years on. The Prime Minister and immigration minister should be exploring every possible alternative. 


I note that New Zealand Labour leader, Jacinda Ardern, will renew the country's offer to take refugees from Manus Island if she is successful in the election later this month. It is not enough to assume that the US agreement is the sole answer, but this minister has tried to shirk responsibility wherever he can. This is, after all, the minister who said that Australia is 'not responsible' for the hundreds of asylum seekers on Manus Island after the Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court ruled that the detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island is illegal. The minister needs to listen to the UNHCR, which last month said that PNG and Nauru remain unsuitable as places of resettlement, not least because of the lack of medical and psychological services. In fact, it is the provision of medical services that goes to the heart of the concerns my community raises with me—the impact that indefinite detention is having on people. The Blue Mountains branch of Grandmothers Against Detention of Refugee Children have been extremely vocal in fighting for fairness and humanity in our offshore detention centre, as have Justice For Children. I have with me a petition of more than 600 signatures that has gone to the Prime Minister, collected mainly in the Blue Mountains, but from as far afield as Dubbo and Bondi. These grandmothers remind the government that we are signatories to international agreements which need to be respected. 


Another group in my electorate wanting to see more humane treatment of people is the Uniting Church. Members of the Springwood Uniting Church last week sent me a petition addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, expressing their outrage at the minister's decision to withdraw income and accommodation support from up to 370 babies, children, women and male asylum seekers brought to Australia from Nauru and Manus Island on medical grounds. These are some of the most vulnerable people in our community, with more than 20 of the women victims of sexual assault. The minister is making their struggle and their recovery worse by now impoverishing them and making them destitute and homeless. The government's decision to cut financial support and housing to these asylum seekers is a new low, even for them. By purposefully making people destitute, making them homeless, the Turnbull government can only be exacerbating the very health conditions they were originally transferred to Australia to be treated for. I can't fathom why these same people have not been allowed to apply for resettlement in the US. why have they deliberately being excluded from that agreement? The minister has failed to really explain why.


I encourage the congregation of Springwood Uniting to keep raising issues like these. The Blue Mountains branches of GetUp! and Amnesty International have also communicated their concerns and have joined the chorus of almost a thousand of my constituents who have taken the time to personally contact me about the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. In fact, the only other issue that has garnered more correspondence in my electorate is the government's mishandling of the National Broadband Network—that speaks volumes for how appalled so many in the community are.


People and groups in my community, such as the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group, have been at the forefront of providing assistance to asylum seekers and refugees arriving in Australia. They welcome this amendment to the Australian Border Force Act. The Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group is a group made up of grassroots members of my community who provide practical assistance to those in detention at Villawood and those who are released from detention. They provide financial support to asylum seekers and refugees in our community. They find employment for asylum seekers and they help them find homes. When people are given work rights they often get a job through the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group. They rely on the goodwill of people in the community to assist them to furnish the homes that they find. They provide English lessons and tutors, and they provide friendship and support for a group of people who are often demonised and isolated. They provide lifts to medical appointments, they help them navigate complex government bureaucracy and much more.


There is also a refugee cricket team, Oceans 12. One of their matches earlier this year was on Anzac Day, with the Navy cricket team. The comment from the captain of Oceans 12 was that it was strange to be playing cricket against a Defence Force team as most of the players were more used to being afraid of defence forces in their own countries rather than being seen as equals. This is the sort of community building that the Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group does, and I'm proud to be a member of it. I will always consult them about amendments to bills and gauge their response.


The Blue Mountains Refugee Support Group has welcomed this bill as a good first step in increasing transparency in Australia's offshore detention system. They will continue to fight for fair and humane treatment of asylum seekers and refugees, and I will stand alongside them.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2017-09-11,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (17:22):  I welcome the comments from the member for Macquarie and thank her for the work that she is doing in this parliament. The purpose of the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 is to introduce amendments to the 2015 Australian Border Force Act, legislation that sought to stop the unauthorised disclosure of information that could harm the national or public interest.


I support this bill. The minister and, in turn, the government are showing that they are listening to the concerns raised by the community and by professionals working in the sector. And they have responded in a positive way to those concerns by addressing the problems raised. I acknowledge the work of the government in doing this and say thank you.


However, there are still problem areas, and I ask the minister and the government to bring this same approach to the issues raised in a number of submissions made to the recent Senate inquiry. These issues include that the power to make a legislative instrument should rest with the minister, rather than with the department secretary. I understand that we'll have an amendment to that effect shortly. I note that the government is this afternoon circulating further amendments to the bill, and that these amendments will provide for the minister to make this legislative instrument; I acknowledge that.


There are other recommendations that new provisions and powers introduced in the bill could be used in a way that negates this purpose of distinguishing between information that does or does not need to be kept secret. There is also a provision for an external or independent arbitrator for complaints and breaches of offshore and onshore operations. Later in this speech I will share with this parliament some of the emails from my constituents responding to the pending closure of the regional processing centre in Manus Island in October, and particularly in response to the government's announcement of new visa conditions for those asylum seekers who have been brought to Australia and have been living in the community.


But first I would like to talk briefly to some of the work of Save the Children Australia. They made a number of submissions to the inquiry. Save the Children consider this bill a step in the right direction in decriminalising certain public interest disclosures pertaining to immigration regulation. Save the Children was contracted by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection from August 2013 to October 2015 to provide education, recreation, child protection and welfare services to asylum seekers and refugees in Nauru. In the course of providing these services, Save the Children and its employees were subject to the Australian Border Force Act as well as other legislation, such as section 70 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, that criminalise certain disclosures by those contracted to government.


Save the Children Australia welcomes proposed amendments to the act to allow for lawful disclosure of information in the public interest in Australia. It says it is appropriate for the government to extend confidentiality requirements to organisations contracted to provide services on its behalf. It notes the need for a careful balance between the maintenance of confidential information on the one hand and disclosures where the public interest demand it on the other.


Save the Children Australia's note of caution is that the bill introduces some new powers and provisions that could be used in a way that negates their stated purpose of distinguishing between information that does and does not need to be kept secret for legitimate governmental reasons. In particular, it says the delegation of power to the departmental secretary to make an instrument should rest with the minister instead. It argues this broad discretion should be used to prevent the lawful disclosure of a wide range of information, so I welcome the minister's attention to that.


I also refer to the submission made by Rural Australians for Refugees—RAR. Rural Australians for Refugees is a network of groups. They describe themselves as 'everyday people throughout regional Australia aiming to bring about change to the way Australia treats refugees and those seeking asylum'. RAR was formed in 2001 and currently consists of more than 70 groups across all the states and territories. Groups develop activities that suit the strengths of their members and their communities. Some are focused on providing support to newly arrived refugees, as the member for Macquarie has just outlined. Some have chosen community education and awareness programs, while others advocate their concerns to government and the public. Many of the groups do all three.


The RAR national president, Marie Sellstrom, is from Mansfield in my electorate. Indeed, there is a strong connection between Indi and the RAR national executive, with the vice president, Ruth Fluhr, coming from the Strathbogie Tableland in North-East Victoria and the secretary, Penny Egan-Vine, coming from Albury-Wodonga. I meet with representatives from local RAR branches and associated networks in Indi on a regular basis, including the convenor of the north-east refugee support network, Freida Andrews, of Benalla, and I thank them all for their ongoing work and representations to my office on behalf of their communities. They are a voice of conscience in my electorate. They call for better communication from the government and immigration authorities. They call for mercy for those who find themselves in such an untenable situation as to need to ask for asylum.


Network members will make a visit to Canberra later this year to plead their case for the support of refugees, and discuss how regional communities can provide their support. I also note that executive members of Rural Australians for Refugees will be in Canberra at Parliament House later this week, and I will be meeting with Marie Sellstrom and RAR national treasurer, Margaret Rasa, on Wednesday morning.


Since its inception, RAR members have been increasingly concerned about what they perceive to be a retraction and diminution of accountability by government in the operation of refugees and asylum policies. They note that over the past 15 years members' legitimate questions have been ignored or met with obstruction and/or outright obfuscation in the name of 'security' or 'privacy' or 'client confidentiality' or 'commercial in confidence'. RAR members have also noted an unwillingness on the part of government to account to taxpayers and the ongoing lack of transparency in response to legitimate questions about the conduct and the costs of private contractors. Why do legitimate questions and attempts to obtain information and access sometimes meet with attack?


RAR says it fully supports the need for special and heightened arrangements to protect Australia's security; however, it does not support the merging of security and secrecy as a means of avoiding security of routine and non-sensitive operational and administrative arrangements. RAR argues that the same standards of accountability that apply generally to the government within our democracy should apply to the operations of refugee and asylum policy.


RAR welcomes the government's amendments to the Australian Border Force Act that it says will remove elements unduly constraining democratic access. RAR seeks a strong amendment that would objectively and specifically support improved capacity for external security of Border Force operations. It suggests specific provision for an external and independent arbitrator for complaints and breaches about the onshore and offshore operations conducted by Australian Border Force. RAR also calls for the removal of the special clause providing protection of commercial interests, believing this consideration is unnecessary and instead may lead to perceptions that Border Force operations belong outside of or above normal government commercial arrangements.


I join with both Save the Children and RAR in supporting the amendments before the House tonight. I welcome greater transparency and accountability in an area that, for too long, has been shrouded in secrecy. It is this secrecy and the lack of information about the treatment of asylum seekers that my constituents find so distressing—and, as a member of parliament, I too find it distressing. I have spoken previously about how important our laws are, but equally important is recognition that we are a compassionate nation and that we show mercy to those in the most dire of circumstances. Tonight, I call upon the government to show this mercy to the most vulnerable asylum seekers caught up in the crackdown on those who have been brought to Australia from Manus Island and Nauru. The government tells us this is a simple policy designed to stop government payments going to those who don't need them. It says these individuals, assessed on a case-by-case basis by the department, are now on a final departure bridging visa with work rights. I am told it applies only to those well enough to live in the community. But I have had dozens—more than dozens—of emails from constituents who say these asylum seekers and refugees face increasing despair and destitution, as the government attempts to force them back to Manus, Nauru or where they have fled from.


I continue to receive feedback from constituents concerned about the closure of Manus Island's regional processing centre at the end of October. To bring one particular example to light, Jill Morton of Bright, who visited Manus and Port Moresby in March, writes: 'Someone needs to stop Australia from dumping these men in PNG. It has become much more unsafe.' She also refers to the recent visit by Senator Nick McKim, and his social media post highlighting the growing number of detainees being transferred from Manus Island to Port Moresby with the understanding that they will not be returned to the detention centre and will be stuck in Port Moresby.


Two of my constituents are regular visitors to those detained at the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation at Broadmeadows. I specifically refer to Marg and Delfina. They have recently taken fresh fruit to detainees—fresh fruit. From today, 11 September, a new set of guidelines prohibits this. The department says the new rules aim to reduce the risk associated with visitors bringing in food that could compromise safety, security and good order of the immigration facilities. Food must be commercially packaged. It must be consumed during the visiting period and any leftover food must be disposed of at the end of the visit. No-one disagrees with the need for rules, but surely those rules are absolutely extreme. My constituent Marg asks: 'Why is this being done? It appears to be another cruel twist in how these people are being treated.' I agree. I ask the government representative at the table to particularly investigate those rules, follow them through and see if we can do something about making sure fresh food is able to be eaten, distributed and kept.


I am heartened, I have to say, by a response in my electorate from the work of the Northern Victoria Refugee Support Network, who have prepared a submission to the inquiry into regional development and decentralisation. They provide arguments, supported by evidence, for decentralising detention, establishing processing centres in rural and regional Australia, developing a coordinated control agency at a statewide level, locating it in a region or a regional area, and successfully integrating refugee communities into rural and regional areas. There's such willingness, there's such a want, and there are such good case studies of refugees coming to rural and regional Australia.


I look forward to continuing to see my community putting their hands up to be part of the solution, and I will not let this issue go. My community will not allow me to let it go. We need to do better, and we must do better. Time is of the essence. I am very pleased that this legislation shows the government has the capacity to change and to do things better. My constituents are telling me that parliament must show leadership. We must represent our regional and rural communities around Australia, and we must bring to parliament their voices, saying: 'Can we demonstrate compassion and support? Can we show how refugee communities can be successfully integrated to build stronger, more resilient communities, particularly in rural areas?'


In closing, I will continue to advocate for a compassionate and sustainable response by this parliament. In November last year I brought a similar speech to a conclusion by quoting Pope Francis, who noted, 'Frightened citizens build walls on one side and exclude people on the other.' This is not the time for fear and punishment. It is the time for mercy, courage and justice.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2017-09-11,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (17:36):  I'd like to follow on from the member for Indi and thank her for her contribution in this debate. The support for the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 is broad across the parliament because everybody is concerned about making sure that we are a country that accepts people on the legitimacy of their refugee application and that everybody is treated in a just way.


The provisions included in this bill that narrow the provisions in the Australian Border Force Act are extremely important in making sure that we get the measures in the law necessary to protect people—particularly vulnerable people at vulnerable stages of life, held in custody or detention by Australian agencies or offshore—and that the policy intent of the provisions set out in the original act are fully realised. They do this by narrowing the provisions to ensure that there are protections and that secrecy or privacy of individuals who are detained is properly protected. But at the same time—as I have raised in a previous public capacity—it is to ensure that information that should be available in the public sphere, particularly around the protection of people and if there are issues around criminal behaviour against individuals, can be properly reported as part of a process to make sure the government, no matter who is in charge and no matter what instrument it is, can be held properly to account.


The provisions in this piece of legislation are relatively straightforward. They narrow the basis of the provisions within sections of the existing act to make sure that it is focused primarily on immigration and border protection information rather than simply protected information, particularly around the conduct of entrusted persons. I think everybody in this place would agree with the broad thrust and focus of this bill for that reason, because it seeks to achieve the original intention of the legislation, rather than going off and doing something different, and to address the concerns that many Australians have and have had in the past. These concerns can now be addressed by narrowing the scope and definition within the legislation.


It fits within a much broader package of making sure that this government and this nation meet their expectations and responsibilities around making sure we treat in a fair and just manner people who are seeking protection as a consequence of facing persecution elsewhere in the world. We face a difficult challenge as a consequence of people seeking asylum in Australia, particularly when they arrive through means that aren't the traditional routes recommended to us by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We have to maintain and protect a clear and consistent approach, which allows people to be accepted on the basis of their need and the legitimacy of their application, not on the method or means for their arrival into Australia. At different stages that has been, broadly speaking, a bipartisan approach.


I understand that at the moment the opposition is continuing to support the government. At other points in recent past they have not done so. I hope they continue to do so, because it is in the best interests of Australians and also because it is in the best interests of those people seeking protection. It is so that they know the direct, honest and straightforward pathway to make it into Australia, rather than trying to circumvent processes to get into Australia by other means.


Having spent a lot of time in detention centres as well as refugee camps across the world, I have seen the very real and human consequences of what happens when people seek to arrive in another country through processes and means that may not be consistent with the country that they are seeking to enter, and with which they are prepared to accept. In the end, there are millions of people all around the world who are either displaced or seeking refugee protection as a consequence of the circumstances outside of their control.


We are one of many countries that takes this issue very seriously. There is a need to be able to provide people with protection as a consequence of those circumstances. We need to have a process and a system that people have confidence in. In countries, particularly in countries like ours, they need to have confidence that people are being accepted on the basis of need and the very real risk of persecution, rather than simply the way they self-identify or make their means or process to get to the country. It must be a just system to continue to preserve confidence so that we can accept people into Australia as refugees. This simple bill around refining the content and the detail within the Australian Border Force Act seeks to achieve that.


To follow on from the previous member, I've also had a number of constituents who have continued to raise concerns with me around the operation of Manus Island and the Nauru detention centre and around the conditions that people face. They aim to make sure that they are treated in a fair and just manner. I consistently raise those issues, both in my former capacity and in my current capacity, to make sure people are treated with dignity and respect. I want to stress to all the constituents of the good electorate of Goldstein that this is something that is very much at the fore of the government's mind: making sure that people are treated with dignity and respect, and, in addition, making sure their time in detention is reduced.


That is why the deal with the United States, to get people off Manus Island and Nauru, has been secured: to try and minimise the time people are held in offshore detention. Those people are able to move on with their lives. It's obviously in their interests, because it gives them the opportunity to realise what they were always seeking—to live a life free from persecution—and then to be able to go on and do it in an environment where they are able to live out their hopes and their dreams. This provides the opportunity for the formation of a family and to be able to secure work and opportunity. That should always be the objective when people are facing persecution: not just to protect them and make them safe but to provide them with foundations and opportunity for them to be able to get on with their lives, as we would hope for our fellow citizens.


This has been a long and difficult process, but it continues to be the objective of this government. In addition, it is very much in our national interest to do so. While we are being very supportive and generous to tens of thousands of people who come to Australia as refugees by providing them with support and assistance, there is no national interest on our part in holding people in detention any longer than necessary. When it comes down to it, we need people to move on with their lives as part of the package to maintain a strong protection for border security that the Australian people and the government have confidence in. We equally want people who are in detention centres to spend as little time there as possible. It's obviously financially beneficial to everybody but, more importantly, it's about people being able to move on with their lives.


If there are problems associated with that, we must be free, within the context and while respecting the privacy of individual people, to provide information that's appropriate in the public domain, because the government always needs to be held to account. As someone who has had a longstanding advocacy in this space, as well as holding government to account more generally, I am always cautious about any measure that limits the capacity for information to be reported about government. That's not a partisan point, whether the Liberals, Labor or anyone else is in office. That's a point of principle—in fact, it goes to one of the core reasons I am a Liberal. Whenever you have centralised power, no matter who is in the position to exercise it, we pose the risk that people may choose to limit the information that is freely available to the advancement and the protection of the interests of those in positions of power and responsibility. In many cases, that's at the core of why people flee from countries—because they experience persecution in the first place. That's why this bill and this provision seeks to clarify what has been longstanding practice under the existing bill—to clarify it for everybody so it will continue to operate into the future.


The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 is one that seeks to be a realisation of government aspiration and policy around refugees, and at the same time makes sure that government can be appropriately held to account for its conduct, no matter who is in office, so that all Australians can look to their government with confidence that they are doing the best, the noble and the humanitarian thing.

Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (17:46):  It is a pleasure to follow the member for Goldstein in this debate on the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017. National security—the defence of a nation's borders and the protection of its citizens—has been a core responsibility of sovereign governments since the rise of nation states. Even earlier, the protection of peoples and the resources that sustained them was a cornerstone responsibility for those forms of government that preceded the modern state. And so it remains for the Turnbull government—this national government—in this extraordinary era of sweeping change and global turbulence.


Today, the task of maintaining our national security is even more complex and more demanding of vigilance and specialist skills than ever before. There are more people on the move right now, globally, across national borders, searching for everything from permanent resettlement either with or without controlled parameters to travel for brief periods for business, for pleasure and maybe even for mischief, than at any other time in human history. Technological change is speeding up every aspect of that intermingling, together with the immense tensions it creates. This is one of the great global challenges of the 21st century, and we have to keep up. We have to be prepared and we have to ensure that, as new challenges emerge, we are alert enough and flexible enough to reorganise and refine our capability and systems to keep Australia safe.


That's why this bill, the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017, is before the House today. It is also why the Turnbull government is undertaking the most significant reform of Australia's national intelligence and domestic security arrangements in 40 years, as announced by the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice just two months ago, following a review of Australia's intelligence community ordered by the Prime Minister only last year. This review is a big part of that process of keeping up with an ever-changing security landscape and is so desperately important if we are to take the protection of our citizens and defence of our way of life seriously as a first priority.


The review highlighted how changing security threats and technologies are driving the need for closer cooperation and improved vigilance between and by our domestic security and law enforcement agencies, against a backdrop, it needs to be emphasised, of stellar performance from all of those agencies to date in maintaining our national security. Our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have successfully intercepted 12 imminent terrorist risks since September 2014. Operation Sovereign Borders has prevented successful people-smuggling ventures for nearly three years. Yet the government remains deeply mindful of the need to reorganise and to refine our efforts whenever compelling advice suggests it is needed to maintain our security at levels that meet the needs and expectations of Australians. Another major result of that review has been the decision to establish an Office of National Intelligence and to transform the Australian Signals Directorate into a statutory agency within the Defence portfolio.


The government will also, as part of the same batch of reforms, establish a home affairs portfolio—a portfolio of immigration, border protection and domestic security and law enforcement agencies—such that there will be an effective federation of agencies, including the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Federal Police, Australian Border Force and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.


Earlier in the year, in the May budget, the government announced a program worth nearly $60 million to enhance technology that stores biometric data—involving, especially, facial recognition and fingerprints—so that security at points of entry to Australia, especially at our international airports is enhanced. This is crucial national security work, given that an extraordinary 700,000 people arrive in and depart from Australia every week. Yet another major investment is almost $100 million, announced in the 2016 budget, to enhance, again principally through investment in technology, our visa application processes to provide us with enhanced risk assessment of applicants.


A major and very important challenge in this ongoing and evolving effort to keep the country safe is, of course, to ensure that measures are fair and reasonable in their impact and application on the vast majority of decent, honest, law-abiding people. People who cherish the rule of law and the rights we all enjoy, people who hope to enjoy those rights and freedoms by joining our Australian community or people simply visiting Australia from overseas for legitimate business or pleasure—they all deserve to be treated civilly and fairly by our laws and those who enforce them. This is a finely tuned and seriously considered balancing act, where individual freedoms are respected while at the same time our national security regime is robust, innovative and capable, and as comprehensively alert to all threats as it can be.


Information gathering by our security agencies—from individuals, from industry, from other sectors of government, from foreign agencies, from partners—to ensure mutual national security is obviously a key factor, a central factor, in enabling those agencies to keep us safe. Some of that information is highly sensitive and must be carefully managed. We have to ensure that it is only used or disclosed for legitimate purposes. The danger inherent in the mishandling or the leaking of information with the potential for significant damage to our national security, public safety and law enforcement is obvious. In the act being amended here, the penalty for that sort of breach was two years in prison.


On a more personal level, individuals can obviously suffer serious detriment where personal and sensitive information is inappropriately disclosed. Other information may be less sensitive and more appropriate to disclose in an open, democratic society while at the same time we deal effectively with critical threats. The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 clarifies the secrecy and disclosure provisions in the Australian Border Protection Act 2015 with retrospective application to reflect the policy intent of those provisions which was, and is, to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of information that could cause harm to the national or public interest—what is known as 'identifiable harm'. The bill makes clear that the definition of information to be protected includes only certain kinds of information such as that relating to the security, defence and international relations of Australia; the prevention, detection and investigation of offences; the protection of public health and safety; or sensitive personal and commercial matters. This narrowing of the definition with retrospectivity will reassure individuals who may otherwise erroneously believe they have committed an offence.


The bill maintains provisions making it an offence to record or disclose information obtained by a person in their capacity as an entrusted person. That includes people employed by the department either directly or via some form of contracted service. The unauthorised disclosure of information by these people will continue to be punishable by two years imprisonment.


These provisions were originally adapted from the model in place for the former Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, which were reflected in the Customs Administration Act 1985, but that model has not kept pace with developments that have so deeply influenced the increasingly complex and interconnected world we now live in. There was no internet then. Terrorism existed, but on nowhere near the scale that we see today. Freedom of rapid movement around the globe, especially of air travel, was in its relative infancy, given the vast numbers travelling today. There were millions of refugees, but their numbers were nowhere close to those of today, which measure in the tens of millions—managing that flood has been a significant border security issue here and for many other countries and, indeed, whole continents around the world. It was certainly a very different world in 1985.


These provisions are reasonable, necessary and proportionate for providing assurance to the Australian public, to business, to industry and to government partners in Australia and abroad that information provided to Australian authorities will be appropriately handled, to ensure a strong border protection regime. That is in the interest of all Australians and it is also in the interest of the many visitors to our shores. It is for that reason that I am happy to commend the bill to the House.

Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid—Assistant Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (17:56):  I rise to sum up the bill and, in doing so, note and thank members on both sides for their contributions. I acknowledge the shadow minister for immigration and border protection, Mr Neumann, who has joined me at the table, and his contribution to the debate.


The Australian Border Force Act 2015 provides an important regime in administering the secrecy and disclosure of information set out in part 6. The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 clarifies part 6 and related provisions to reflect the original intent of the legislation, which was to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of information that could cause harm to the national or public interest. The aim of the measure in this bill is to ensure that immigration and border protection information is provided with the necessary level of protection in a targeted manner but also is able to be disclosed went it is appropriate to do so. This bill provides assurances for the Australian public, business, government and foreign partners that sensitive information provided to the department of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection will be appropriately protected without unnecessarily restricting informed public debate. The retrospective application of the bill, back to the date of the Australian Border Force Act that was enacted in 2015, will provide the necessary certainty that only information which would harm the national public interest if disclosed is to be protected and will be regarded as ever having been protected under the ABF Act.

Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (19:29):  Question time is a robust debate in this place, and it should be. However, day after day we have to sit through the Deputy Prime Minister and the Melbourne inner city minister for energy claiming that I and the other Hunter Labor MPs are betraying coalminers and energy workers. In this narrative, the government is the working man's best friend and we are hypocrites. I completely reject this narrative. It bears no resemblance to reality. It is offensive to me and, more importantly it is offensive to the workers and communities that I represent.


The government is using them as debating props for scoring cheap political points, and this is the most disgraceful aspect of the debate. The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the motley crew of charlatans, hypocrites and venal time servers that constitute their frontbench are an embarrassment. Deputy Prime Minister: being mates with Gina Rinehart does not make you a friend of coalminers. Coalminers don't get free trips to India on Gina's private jet. Most coalminers don't get to study at the $40,000-a-year St Ignatius' Riverview College.


To the Deputy Prime Minister I pose the following questions. If you really care about coalminers, where were you yesterday when every other federal MP who represents the Hunter region, which you purport to represent, attended the annual Miners Memorial Day at Cessnock? This day commemorates the 1,803 women, men and, tragically, children as young as 11 who have died in Hunter coalmines. Where were you, Deputy Prime Minister? I didn't see you offering condolences to the grieving family of the latest worker to suffer a tragic and unnecessary death at a Hunter coalmine. I haven't heard the Deputy Prime Minister calling for better mine regulation and safety enforcement. Instead, I see cheap taunts thrown around in question time while the Deputy Prime Minister and the government perpetrate two acts of national shame. Firstly, they continue to weaken worker protection laws in this country by restricting the ability of unions to enter workplaces and limiting what workers and firms can include in enterprise agreements, making it harder for safety standards to be enforced. The rise of labour hire and increased use of short-term contractors are undermining workplace safety. In the northern coalfields, sadly, we are averaging one workplace death a year. We have also seen the return of black lung, a disease we had hoped we had seen eradicated in our coal communities. What is the government's response? It wants to outlaw the mineworkers' union. What a shameful act!


The second act of shame that this government is perpetuating is their continuing lies to energy workers about their future. Everyone knows there'll never been a coal-fired power station built in this country without massive public subsidy. The workers know it, the generators acknowledge it and the financiers demonstrate it through where they invest their funds. Thermal and coking coal exports have a strong future, but we will never build another coal-fired power station in this country without massive public subsidies. We owe it to the energy workers, their families and the communities that depend upon that industry to have an honest conversation about that.


The most disrespectful thing a politician can do is to lie to workers, and that is exactly what this government is doing. My community understands the realities. What they want is a government that will work with them; a government that will put forward a well-resourced plan to look after the workers and communities affected and to diversify the economic base of these regions. I committed in my first speech to fight for my community and to be honest with them. I will spend every day that I have the privilege to represent the people of Shortland doing just that.


My neighbour is a coalminer and my kids go to kindy with the children of energy workers and coalminers. I am proud of our mining heritage, and recognise the wealth generated by the 18,000 coalminers who risk their lives to mine this resource. The best way I can commit to commemorating the 1,803 miners who have lost their lives in Hunter coalmines is to fight for laws that mean no other family has to receive the dreaded call that they have lost a loved one. In comparison, we have a Deputy Prime Minister, a Prime Minister and a government that continue to lie, that continue to use workers a political props and continue to treat my region—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  Order! I would ask the member for Shortland to withdraw that inference.




Mr CONROY:
  I withdraw it, but I was using the plural, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. I withdraw. In comparison we have a government that continues to lie, that continues to use workers as political props and that continues to treat my region as a cheap debating trick. My community condemns their actions, as, surely, will history.

Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:30):  I rise to speak on the very sad passing of a good friend of mine, Viv Maher, on Wednesday 16 August after her battle with pancreatic cancer. Viv touched the lives of many over the years as a teacher, social worker, Aboriginal elder, social activist, mother, grandmother and feminist. She was born in the small Victorian town of Warragul, approximately 100 kilometres east of Melbourne. She married Jim Maher less than 12 months after they met before they made their way to PNG in 1972. Jim had an opportunity to install one of the first computer systems in the country. Viv completed her studies in Port Moresby, where she took on a job as a social worker at the Port Moresby hospital. Her choice to study was a turning point, enabling Viv to pursue her passion in social work. 


Viv was one of the special people you hear about in life, a one in a million, who put others first. After returning to Australia, her activist nature was ignited by an issue at the Frankston hospital, which had a policy of not permitting pain medication for unmarried women at the time. Viv quickly took up the issue with the board of the hospital and needless to say she got her way. That's the kind of person Viv was. She would see injustice and act. Viv also worked at the local Centrelink office in Mount Gambier. A story told at her funeral a couple of weeks ago made an impression of many. When Viv worked as a social worker she would often see some of the most vulnerable people requiring help getting food, paying the bills and maybe needing a bit of cash to get through the week. Viv was always there to lend a helping hand, sometimes allowing small loans from a so-called 'special fund' for special cases. She would make the client sign a form, making it formal process, but tell them on the quiet they didn't need to repay the money. You see, there wasn't a special fund for emergency cases. When someone was down on their luck, Viv used her own money to help, but to make them feel better she would tell them that story. That's the kind of person Viv was. 


Viv also gave her first-born to the Labor Party, and Kyam is now a minister in the Weatherill government. Her son summed his mum up by describing her as a 'towering feminist, champion of and for the Aboriginal community, fierce advocate for social justice and fierce but terrible singer.' Our thoughts and condolences go out to Viv's family and friends. She will be missed. She's survived by husband Jim; Kyam and Carmel, with grandkids Marley, Flynn and Jai; Cameron and Carol, with grandkids Oliver, Fletcher and Jake; and Gibran and Xiang, with grandkids Felix and Maverick. Her spirit lives on in all of them.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (11:02):  The Greens have for a long, long time called in this parliament for a royal commission into the banking and financial services industry. We have had Senate report after Senate report and expose after expose of people who have lost their house and/or their life savings all because a bank sold them something that worked in the bank's interest but not necessarily in their interest. What we have also seen very clearly throughout all of those inquiries is that parliamentarians of all stripes and with the best intentions will do their hardest to get to the bottom of what is going on in our banking system. But when a banker fronts up to an inquiry and wrings their hands and says, 'We made a mistake,' and walks away and then comes back again a few months later and we find that no-one has lost their job as a result of it, that the practices might still be continuing, it becomes crystal clear that what we need is someone who can commit to and conduct that inquiry but do it with the powers that they need so that they can find out what is going on behind closed doors, so that this parliament and the people get more than some serial hand-wringing from bank executives, and we actually get a change in culture. 


Quite some time ago, the Greens in parliament moved a motion for a royal commission; but, sadly, we didn't have many friends at that stage. Labor didn't vote with us, the Liberals didn't vote with us, but we did have some support on the crossbench. It's testament to the fact that, when there are people in parliament who will stand up for what is right, a good idea can ultimately win. Over time, the opposition have changed their position and come around to the idea of having a royal commission—and that's good. We're a vote or so away in the House of Representatives from calling on the government to have a royal commission. But what has become crystal clear is that, as long as the Turnbull government are in place, they will do the banks' bidding and form a protective shield against the banks. So there's something we can do in this parliament before the next election, where there may well be a change of government, and that is use the powers of the parliament. If the government is unwilling to step up and use the executive to call a royal commission, then parliament can step in and do it.


That's why we need a commission of inquiry. That's what a commission of inquiry is: it's parliament saying the people and the public interest should trump what the executive wants to do, because the executive is only acting as a delegate of the power of the people, and it's also saying that parliament should trump the interests of corporations and some of the biggest corporations in this country. That is why commissions of inquiry can exist. It's because it's the ability of parliament to then say, 'This issue is so important that it is time we established a full and wide-ranging inquiry.' It's why commissions of inquiry exist, why they have been used in the past and why they should be used now—too many people have lost too much.


At the heart of the Australian banking industry is a conflict. On the one hand, every one of us can't get by now without a bank account. We're funnelling money regularly through banks and financial institutions. They have a guaranteed income stream from us. The big four banks, as we saw during the global financial crisis, have the implicit backing of the government behind them. They know that if they ever get into trouble—because we have a too-big-to-fail, four-pillars policy in this country—they will get public support. But on the other hand, they have a business model that is based on fleecing people. It's not based on looking after and curating people's deposits with the maximum of care, as the other arm of the banks' business model is to sell us all products that are about increasing the banks' profits.


We've heard too many tales of people who have been hurt, ending up with products that they don't need, simply because the banks' primary obligation is to their shareholders. If the big banks in this country want public support and government support standing behind them, there should be a quid pro quo. They should open their doors and open their books, and a commission of inquiry is the best way to make that happen.

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (11:07):  Those opposite did absolutely nothing about the Australian banking system during their time in office, and this government is taking action now on a very wide range of fronts. Let me run through a few of them. Firstly, there are interest rates. The ACCC now has the power to go into the banks and get documents about the process by which banks set interest rates. When the banks say they had no choice but to raise interest rates because of external factors, the ACCC will now be investigating that exact issue. They will be going into the banks, getting the board minutes, getting the interest subcommittee minutes and determining whether or not that is in fact the case. That's a very good thing for competition. It's happening because of this government, out of the House's Standing Committee on Economics inquiry. It's a very, very positive development. It's happening now. All Australian bank executives should be on notice that representations about interest rate policy settings are now subject to internal ACCC scrutiny. That's a very positive development.


We're also setting up the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. Previously, there were three different authorities in this area. It was quite confusing for consumers to know where to go and who to talk to. We're now setting up a one-stop shop for complaints against financial institutions: the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. The outcomes will be binding on those institutions. When the authority makes a decision, consumers can pursue claims up to $500,000 and small business can pursue claims up to $1 million. There's no need to go to court and spend the large amounts of money involved in court proceedings. It's a very, very important reform implemented by this government.


We've also implemented the Bank Executive Accountability Regime. It's true that there has not been enough accountability in senior executives in banks, as we have seen from the failures in the banking system. What we saw and what we recommended in the House's Standing Committee on Economics inquiry was for an executive accountability regime to be established. The government has done that. What we are seeing is that fines of up to $200 million can be enforced by APRA if banks are in breach of their prudential obligations.


We're also going to require the banks to have a very clear map of who's responsible for what so that there can't be finger pointing within banks to say, 'It wasn't my area; it was that person's area.' That will all now be set out in a very clear document, which will mean there is nowhere to hide and the bank executives who are responsible for divisions in which there is malfeasance will be held accountable. That's a very important development.


We've also seen concerning allegations recently regarding the Commonwealth Bank and its conduct in relation to cash deposits. These are allegations made by AUSTRAC which are very serious in nature. The government has set up an inquiry, led by Dr John Laker, the former chairman of APRA, and also supported by former ACCC chairman Graeme Samuel and company director Jillian Broadbent. This inquiry is looking specifically into the Commonwealth Bank's issues of governance and culture. It will investigate those issues and report back to the government by January with an interim report focused on the issues within the Commonwealth Bank. It will identify any problems and make recommendations to government about the ways in which the Commonwealth Bank should improve.


We also have competition. One of the problems in the Australian banking system has been a lack of competition. For instance, in the last decade there was only one licence issued for a new start-up bank in Australia. That's unacceptable. Consequently, we're changing the rules so that it will be easier to get a bank off the ground. Previously, you had to have $50 million of cash before you could even get a banking licence. You can imagine that, if you are trying to raise the money to get a bank off the ground, asking people to give you $50 million on day one, before you've even got a licence, is a very difficult thing. So now there will be a two-stage process. People will be able to get a bank off the ground with a much smaller amount of funds and then get a full banking licence later. That is what's happened in the UK in recent years, and we've seen several dozen new entrants to the banking sector as a consequence.


So there are very important reforms across a whole range of areas, including on accountability of banking executives, ensuring focus on competition and giving consumers a one-stop shop to address the problems they have with banks. This government is taking action very aggressively across a wide range of areas in the banking sector.

They know that if they ever get into trouble—because we have a too-big-to-fail, four-pillars policy in this country—they will get public support. But on the other hand, they have a business model that is based on fleecing people. It's not based on looking after and curating people's deposits with the maximum of care, as the other arm of the banks' business model is to sell us all products that are about increasing the banks' profits.


We've heard too many tales of people who have been hurt, ending up with products that they don't need, simply because the banks' primary obligation is to their shareholders. If the big banks in this country want public support and government support standing behind them, there should be a quid pro quo. They should open their doors and open their books, and a commission of inquiry is the best way to make that happen.

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (11:07):  Those opposite did absolutely nothing about the Australian banking system during their time in office, and this government is taking action now on a very wide range of fronts. Let me run through a few of them. Firstly, there are interest rates. The ACCC now has the power to go into the banks and get documents about the process by which banks set interest rates. When the banks say they had no choice but to raise interest rates because of external factors, the ACCC will now be investigating that exact issue. They will be going into the banks, getting the board minutes, getting the interest subcommittee minutes and determining whether or not that is in fact the case. That's a very good thing for competition. It's happening because of this government, out of the House's Standing Committee on Economics inquiry. It's a very, very positive development. It's happening now. All Australian bank executives should be on notice that representations about interest rate policy settings are now subject to internal ACCC scrutiny. That's a very positive development.


We're also setting up the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. Previously, there were three different authorities in this area. It was quite confusing for consumers to know where to go and who to talk to. We're now setting up a one-stop shop for complaints against financial institutions: the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. The outcomes will be binding on those institutions. When the authority makes a decision, consumers can pursue claims up to $500,000 and small business can pursue claims up to $1 million. There's no need to go to court and spend the large amounts of money involved in court proceedings. It's a very, very important reform implemented by this government.


We've also implemented the Bank Executive Accountability Regime. It's true that there has not been enough accountability in senior executives in banks, as we have seen from the failures in the banking system. What we saw and what we recommended in the House's Standing Committee on Economics inquiry was for an executive accountability regime to be established. The government has done that. What we are seeing is that fines of up to $200 million can be enforced by APRA if banks are in breach of their prudential obligations.


We're also going to require the banks to have a very clear map of who's responsible for what so that there can't be finger pointing within banks to say, 'It wasn't my area; it was that person's area.' That will all now be set out in a very clear document, which will mean there is nowhere to hide and the bank executives who are responsible for divisions in which there is malfeasance will be held accountable. That's a very important development.


We've also seen concerning allegations recently regarding the Commonwealth Bank and its conduct in relation to cash deposits. These are allegations made by AUSTRAC which are very serious in nature. The government has set up an inquiry, led by Dr John Laker, the former chairman of APRA, and also supported by former ACCC chairman Graeme Samuel and company director Jillian Broadbent. This inquiry is looking specifically into the Commonwealth Bank's issues of governance and culture. It will investigate those issues and report back to the government by January with an interim report focused on the issues within the Commonwealth Bank. It will identify any problems and make recommendations to government about the ways in which the Commonwealth Bank should improve.


We also have competition. One of the problems in the Australian banking system has been a lack of competition. For instance, in the last decade there was only one licence issued for a new start-up bank in Australia. That's unacceptable. Consequently, we're changing the rules so that it will be easier to get a bank off the ground. Previously, you had to have $50 million of cash before you could even get a banking licence. You can imagine that, if you are trying to raise the money to get a bank off the ground, asking people to give you $50 million on day one, before you've even got a licence, is a very difficult thing. So now there will be a two-stage process. People will be able to get a bank off the ground with a much smaller amount of funds and then get a full banking licence later. That is what's happened in the UK in recent years, and we've seen several dozen new entrants to the banking sector as a consequence.


So there are very important reforms across a whole range of areas, including on accountability of banking executives, ensuring focus on competition and giving consumers a one-stop shop to address the problems they have with banks. This government is taking action very aggressively across a wide range of areas in the banking sector.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (11:12):  I move:


That this House:


(1) welcomes the results of Round One of the Building Better Regions Fund (BBRF), including the allocation of $3 million in funding to the Events Centre, Caloundra, on the Sunshine Coast;


(2) congratulates all of the successful applicants in Round One of this program;


(3) notes that:


(a) the BBRF is another example of the Government investing in our regions to boost local economies, grow regional confidence, create jobs and build vibrant communities;


(b) nationally the successful projects will support a diverse range of important infrastructure in regional and remote areas for projects ranging from tourism and transport, to culture, sporting and healthcare facilities;


(c) the Events Centre is such an important piece of infrastructure, providing world class cultural experiences for local people on the Sunshine Coast and drawing tourists from all over South East Queensland; and


(d) nearly 550 organisations applied from all across Australia for the Infrastructure Projects stream;


(4) commends the Government for its allocation of an additional $200 million in funding for this important program in the 2017 budget; and


(5) encourages eligible organisations to make an application to Round Two of the BBRF, which is anticipated to open later in 2017.


It gives me great pleasure to move this motion, as I'm a strong supporter of the government's Building Better Regions Fund. I understand the enormous benefits it can bring to a local community such as my electorate in the north of Brisbane on the Sunshine Coast. It still truly remains a regional area. The main focus of the Building Better Regions Fund is on creating jobs, driving economic growth and building stronger regional communities.


One of the directors of the Caloundra Events Centre in my electorate of Fisher, Mr Don Smith, was quoted recently as saying: 'This is a major outcome for us and a big hit for our local community. I can assure you that, when this work is finished, we'll really be able to roll out the red carpet and dress this place up to welcome everyone, even the Queen.' Mr Smith's comments came on the back of the results of round 1 of the Building Better Regions Fund in which the Events Centre in Caloundra was successful in being granted $3 million for upgrades to the centre. Mr Smith is a long-term supporter of the Events Centre, having dedicated much of his time in recent years to securing funds for vital upgrades to the facility. Mr Smith's comments relate to his dogged determination to ensure that any upgrades to the centre included a porte-cochere that would be fit for the Queen. Once these upgrades are complete, that is exactly what we will have. Mr Smith's next job is to try and get the Queen to Caloundra!


The Events Centre Caloundra is an important piece of infrastructure that provides a world-class cultural experience for local people based on the Sunshine Coast, but it also draws tourists from all over South-East Queensland. The project, which, due to this grant, is expected to be completed by the end of 2018, will have an array of transformative upgrades. The project will improve the acoustics of the main theatre and upgrade the foyer, the bar, the verandah cafe and box office facilities. It will also upgrade the heating and air conditioning throughout the building, it will increase accessibility at the main entrance and it will install toilet and lift facilities for patrons with a disability. Because we are actually celebrating Disability Action Week in Queensland this week, I'm very proud to be announcing an upgrade which will see much greater facilities for those with a disability. 


Nationally, the Building Better Regions Fund received more than 500 applications, and the Events Centre Caloundra was one of around a hundred that were approved. More applications were received under the Infrastructure Projects Stream than in any of the three funding rounds conducted under the previous National Stronger Regions Fund. I'd like to extend my personal congratulations to all of those worthy community groups across Australia who successfully received funding through these grants.


Round 1 of the Building Better Regions Fund Infrastructure Projects Stream has been highly competitive, with the applications received demonstrating significant strength and quality across the three project sizes. Strong applications were able to describe and quantify project economic benefits in the short and long term, and how they would deliver social benefits in the region. There was also a need to demonstrate that the project was both viable and sustainable, and that it would be delivered on time, on budget and to the standard required for important infrastructure projects. The Events Centre Caloundra ticked all of these boxes, and their success is testament to the importance of this facility to Sunshine Coast locals, the huge effort that the team put into consulting with the locals and preparing their application, and the groundswell of support we received from the community. 


Only the coalition government is backing regional communities by funding critical projects that support economic development across the regions.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (11:17):  Regional Queensland, and in particular North Queensland, has been facing some very tough times. Our unemployment rates and youth unemployment rates are amongst the highest in the country; Townsville is the insolvency capital of the nation; and, in the last five years, we have had three massive cyclone events—however, this has not always been the case. We also have a large population of veterans and ex-service personnel who want quality employment opportunities. During the global financial crisis, whilst unemployment was around 10 per cent in Brisbane, unemployment in Townsville was less than five per cent. Fortunately, Townsville's economy was diverse enough to survive the GFC. But that has not been the case for the residents on Palm Island, in my electorate. Lack of infrastructure and jobs have always been major issues for this remote community.


Between 2012 and 2015, regional, rural and remote Queensland experienced the wrath of the Newman LNP government, and now, after four years of the coalition Abbott-Turnbull governments, Townsville has really felt a significant negative impact and is, as I said, the jobless capital of the nation. LNP governments are not the friends of regional, rural and remote Queensland. This is borne out by recent history and the savage cuts made by LNP state and Liberal-National federal governments. LNP governments have always looked after their city mates at the expense of people living in regional, rural and remote Queensland, especially in first-nation communities. The Turnbull government have done nothing to address the growing rate of inequality in regional, rural and remote Queensland; in fact, they have just added fuel to the fire.


Since the GFC, whilst unemployment has been on the decline in Brisbane, wages are on the increase. Compare and contrast this to North Queensland, where employment is on the rise, and the only thing dropping is wages. Life expectancy is lower in regional, rural and remote Queensland. There are more households with no access to the internet in regional, rural and remote Queensland than in capital cities. Insurance is higher in regional Queensland than in Brisbane, even though Brisbane experiences more regular and severe weather events. Townsville has the highest homeless rate per capita in the nation. Rates are higher, energy prices are higher and the overall cost of living is higher. Inequality in regional, rural and remote Queensland is on the rise, and the Turnbull government is doing nothing to rectify this situation.


More focus and action is needed in regional, rural and remote Queensland, and deservedly so. We need short-, medium- and long-term solid plans and not just bandaid solutions. In particular, urgent attention must be paid to the regions that have been identified for rapid population growth. It is concerning to note that the regions with the highest projected growth rates are the same regions being excluded from capital works grants like the Building Better Regions Fund. To help build the vital infrastructure necessary to prepare for the rapid growth, the government has little to offer these communities. In fact, these regions are almost excluded from the $500 million Building Better Regions Fund, the $220 million Regional Jobs and Investment Packages and the new $200 million Regional Growth Fund despite their urgent and obvious needs. This situation must be reviewed because much needed growth is dependent upon the funds to address the necessary infrastructure that will guarantee this sustainable growth.


Funding projects are just one piece of the puzzle. It is not just about dollars. We also need to set our priorities. This includes our value proposition and social capital. The government needs to understand the real social dividend that comes from local projects and not just short-term ribbon-cutting opportunities. The decisions regarding the best bid must consider more than dollar value—they must also include social capital. Delivering a one-off, short-term project based on cost alone will do very little in the long term. However, the same project that has a genuine local focus, including local jobs, purchasing local resources and services and local manufacturing opportunities that may be slightly higher in cost, will deliver real economic and social benefits in regional communities in the longer term. This will enable local small businesses to build their capacity to create more jobs. Funding that takes these elements into account will build both a strong and growing local economy and a thriving society.


Awarding tenders and delivering funding that is focused only on the initial cost and not the broader picture does not take into account the positive flow-on effects for regional communities. The Building Better Regions Fund needs to address this crucial focus. The Sunshine Coast is not regional, rural or remote Queensland, and the differences are blindingly obvious. I demand action from the Turnbull government to provide the funding that will deliver community capacity building and local jobs for all Townsville residents, including the residents on Palm Island and our ex-service personnel and veterans.

"McVeigh, John, MP",LP,2017-09-11,"



Dr McVEIGH
 (Groom) (11:22):  Today I rise to recognise our government's foresight and commitment to building better regions across Australia. I'm a proud resident of the Darling Downs. My parents, my grandparents and my great-grandparents before me were residents there as well. My family tree of McVeighs and Mearas is proof that regional Australia can support ambitions and efforts across the generations. My family put down roots in the amazing, cracking black-clay soils of the Darwin Downs, and those roots are still there today. There are five generations, with my children's generation starting to make its way in the world.


The city of Toowoomba is the beating heart of the Darling Downs, and it would be safe to say that it would be unrecognisable to my great-great-grandparents today. Toowoomba is a city of some 116,000 people and is perched on the Great Dividing Range. In the latest round of the Building Better Regions Fund, a life-changing project in our city was successful. The dream of having a purpose-built permanent home-base facility for LifeFlight emergency medical helicopters is becoming a reality. The funds, which were a partnership in the true sense of the word, were provided through the coalition government's Building Better Regions Fund, which provided $2.05 million; local businessman and philanthropist Clive Berghofer, OAM, who provided $1.87 million; and LifeFlight Australia, which provided $171,000.


The money will replace existing ageing buildings with new purpose-built aviation facilities, including hanger capacity for two AW139 helicopters, aircrew accommodation, administration operations and a flight-simulator room. It will be a boost for our regional community as the project will create 350 jobs during construction and, more particularly, will enhance the entire healthcare chain throughout our region. Most importantly, it will provide more vital aeromedical services to people throughout our region of south-west Queensland, be they farmers, miners, locals or tourists. This type of project continues to build the future for our region so that families like mine will continue to stay and prosper, or, as many of us do, go away and see the world before realising there is nowhere that compares to the Darling Downs and return home. The LifeFlight project is an example of a significant project enhancing our community on the Darling Downs, but it is also an illustration of broader Australia and the benefits that can be achieved in regional Australia in particular.


As chair of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation, I know there is huge potential for economic growth in regional areas. The government's Building Better Regions Fund is part of the investment in the futures of these regions. The government is doing this as it wants to partner with regional communities to build confidence across the entire nation, as regional communities are the lifeblood of this country, as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker. We need to capitalise on the strengths and local resources we know our regions offer. We certainly need to focus on required infrastructure and community facilities for growth in regional Australia. But we need to recognise, at the end of the day, as this government does, that so much of Australia's economic prosperity is generated from our regions, from mining to agriculture, from education to health, to innovation and other advances, particularly in new industries. There are many rural and regional towns doing great things across the country to foster economic and social development in their communities. This government is committed to seeing that continue to happen, hence efforts such as the Building Better Regions program. We are committed to regional growth, long-term employment opportunities and sustainability in these communities across the states and territories of Australia.


I am a passionate supporter of regional Australia and I believe Australia's regions remain the key to unlocking our future growth and potential as a nation. Why? Because, like those generations of McVeighs and Mearas who went before me, we understand, in our case, the Darling Downs. We know its challenges, we know its successes, and, like so many others who live in regional Australia, we know there is tremendous growth potential throughout our entire nation. The government's Building Better Regions program recognises just that as well.

Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (11:27):  I'd like to join the member for Fisher in congratulating the successful applicants of round 1 of the Building Better Regions Fund. In my electorate of Mayo, two applications were successful: $202,000 is going towards a sculpture trail on Kangaroo Island, and $255,000 has been allocated to the construction of a men's shed at Victor Harbor. I have previously spoken in this House about the Victor Harbor Men's Shed, and I reiterate my support for men's sheds right across Australia. They are integral community spaces, they are places where there's a great deal of support, mateship and, indeed, love for each other, and I believe they save lives.


When I visited the Victor Harbor Men's Shed last year, I was delighted to see men, young and old, working side by side sharing their skills together—although I must say it was quite a tight squeeze in the men's shed! Thanks to the grant funding they've received, the Victor Harbor Men's Shed will be able to relocate to larger premises. They were previously operating out of the Encounter Centre—a great resource for our community—but they only had one day a week. This move will allow them to be open every day and help foster stronger relationships throughout the community. An organisation such as this is exactly the reason the Building Better Regions Fund is so valuable to regional communities. Similarly, the construction of the Kangaroo Island sculpture trail will add another great drawcard to Kangaroo Island and it will be a great boost to our economy there. The trail will show the natural vegetation of the island, the local wildlife, and include large sculptured works created from natural materials. I greatly look forward to its completion and disembarking at Penneshaw and having a good look around myself.


The Building Better Regions Fund is a genuinely good initiative. Investment in our region is so important to enable communities to grow and thrive, and I strongly support the intention of the program. That is why I'm so frustrated at the rules regulating eligibility of access to the fund being based on mapping. I have spoken on this issue previously, but it's inconceivable to me that a township such as Woodside in my electorate, with a population of just 2,000, cannot access the fund while the Gold Coast, the sixth biggest city in Australia, can. Mount Barker, the major economic centre of the Adelaide Hills, cannot access the fund. This is a town projected to have a population of 44,000 in the next 20 years, and the district population will grow to 56,000 in the same period, yet we lack so many of the essential services that a town with such a population demands because we have been such a small regional community. For example, our swimming pool is not up to competition standard—it's still in yards and feet—and it leaks into the surrounding ground. The recently announced sports hub will allow more football and soccer competitions, and that is desperately needed in our community, but what we need is Mount Barker and surrounding areas again being part of the Building Better Regions Fund. 


Meanwhile, the Gold Coast is gearing up to host the Commonwealth Games next year, and it has two professional sports teams and the facilities that come with it. It is a large economic centre that receives millions of dollars each year from tourists visiting the city. I don't think you will find many who are willing to say the Gold Coast is lacking in essential services and community infrastructure. Indeed, I think you will find very few people in Australia who consider the Gold Coast a region. The minister spoke to me about my concerns and she said at the end of round 1, in July this year, she would have a review of the boundaries. As yet I have heard nothing from the minister. 


South Australia is at an impasse, with our manufacturing industry closing down and unemployment rising. We must look to the next opportunity and I believe that next opportunity for South Australia is in food production and agriculture. It always has been, we just never realised it. In the Adelaide Hills these industries are crying out for major infrastructure projects to allow them to best display their talents to the world. This is why it is so important that these areas, true regional areas that rely on primary production for their prosperity, are allocated into the Building Better Regions Fund. While it is tremendous that we congratulate those who were successful in round 1, I would urge the minister to review as quickly as possible how they have drawn the boundaries for the Building Better Regions Fund, because it seems ridiculous that small towns with no public transport, small towns where you are lucky if you have one or two stores and a thousand people, where the banks have closed and everything has gone, cannot access this fund. For us not to be included and for places such as the Gold Coast to be included makes a mockery of the term 'regions'.

"Littleproud, David, MP",Nats,2017-09-11,"



Mr LITTLEPROUD
 (Maranoa) (11:32):  It is with pride that I speak to this motion today on the government's commitment to the Building Better Regions Fund. For the people of Maranoa, an electorate that covers 42 per cent of the state of Queensland, and particularly for those in rural and regional areas, this has been a boon. During the roll-out of the Building Better Regions Fund we have seen, only in the last round, an announcement of just under $5 million for a new cold storage facility in Warwick that will bring 150 new direct jobs, 138 indirect jobs and 80 jobs during construction. This is a significant investment in the community of the Southern Downs. It is also a sign of faith in rural and regional Australia. To bring more than 200 new families to a community of just over 12,000 people is a significant change in the economic make-up of that community. 


We are proud to say that rural and regional Australia has a future, because if we have a strong rural and regional Australia we have a strong nation. My electorate alone, Maranoa, contributes more to the GDP per capita than Townsville, Toowoomba or the Gold Coast. That is without taking into account the three coal-fired power stations that generate more than 50 per cent of the state's electricity. That is all coming out of my electorate of Maranoa—rural and regional Australia. All this is important investment, and we can couple that with another investment out in Morven for a rail hub, worth just over $4 million, to bring cattle in from the west, to provide security for those people in rural and regional Australia who are in the cattle industry. It will also provide them with more competition, because if we can move their product then we will have competitors wanting to bring in their product. If we have got Oakey Beef wanting to secure this hub and bring cattle in on the train, rather than on trucks, it will also mean that Oakey Beef's competitors will be looking to secure supply for their abattoirs. This is a real economic boon for the people of Morven, a little town of only a couple of hundred people. This investment will bring a rail hub to Morven that will ensure we can bring in cattle from all over this nation.


The other investment we've made is a $204-million investment in aged care in Blackbutt, a little community in the South Burnett. Two hundred thousand dollars will go towards independent living for those who are disadvantaged—for those who are unable to afford to get into one of dearer aged-care facilities. In this small community, we are giving people options and choice so that they don't have to leave. They can still have their family around them and have the dignity and respect in their ageing years to be able to stay and be part of that community. It's an important investment in that community.


Previously, our government proudly invested in the rebuilding of the Waltzing Matilda Centre, which burnt down some two or three years ago. I have to call out Mayor Butch Lenton—an absolute outback legend. This is a mayor who leads. He doesn't make his community a victim; he gets on with the job. He's fought droughts; he's fought fires. The man is a leader, and he's a leader who every Australian should be proud of. In the little outback town of Winton, with just over a thousand-odd people, he is helping to rebuild the Waltzing Matilda Centre—a national iconic centre that every Australian should be proud of. It will bring new jobs to that community. Winton has nearly 50,000 visitors a year, in tourism, to the Waltzing Matilda Centre and the Age of Dinosaurs museum. It is a significant investment in that community, because we are diversifying the economic base of Winton to not only rely on agricultural but also rely on tourism—to put another pillar in that local economy. That's an important investment in that community. Ensuring 40,000 to 50,000 visitors a year go to a small town that has a population of only a thousand people is a significant investment that will ensure that community has greater resilience as we move forward. It will also ensure that we continue to look at this as an investment in rural and regional Australia.


We understand that, if we make that investment, we are the economic engine room of this nation. We understand that, if we invest in rural and regional Australia, we will continue to ensure that the whole nation's economy benefits. We are the ones who are putting the product on the boats that are empty once they bring their stuff into this country. We proudly, as a government, have sought to ensure the security of and investment in rural and regional Australia because it makes economic sense. I'm proud that this motion has been put forward. I thank the member for Fisher, Mr Wallace, for putting it forward. It's an important one for rural and regional Australia.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (11:37):  I rise to object to this motion being put today on the grounds that, historically, this government has changed what was once an Australia-wide possibility to apply for Commonwealth funding for community programs, for builds, that might have created jobs and community infrastructure. In the past, under a Labor government, this was the RDAF. I note that this government left it as it was until just this last round when, mysteriously, the boundaries changed and areas of this country were cut out of applying for this grant. I stand here as the member for Lalor whose community was a recipient of this grant under this government, but not this time. We were not allowed to apply. Someone applied some maps and put some boundaries in—exclusive boundaries, I might add.


While I congratulate all the communities who did the hard work of applying for this grant, I note that in Victoria communities around Ballarat, Corangamite, Murray, Gippsland, McMillan, Flinders, Mallee, Indi and Wannon are all recipients of this round but that the electorate of Lalor was locked out of this process. I condemn this government for the changes that it made to this program, locking out communities like mine and locking out electorates like Holt, both of which are in growth corridors. We don't have to go very far to find that people living in growth corridors feel that they are doing it tough and that they are being neglected by this government. But this grant process is one area about which we can clearly say is an opportunity that we have been cut from, that our applications have been disallowed.


Looking at the electorate of Lalor, there were lots of things. In fact, our local government already had prioritised projects where they were going to seek support from this grant until those boundaries were changed and until a growth corridor, like the city of Wyndham, was locked out of this level of support. The city of Wyndham could have applied for a new station at Black Forest Road with the Regional Rail Link. They are keen on that as a major project, as an extension of a Commonwealth program under a previous Labor government. We could have applied for some support in upgrading our irrigation, which we have failed to get under this grants program and we have failed to have funded under the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund program. We could have applied for support for our catalyst sites to reset the Werribee CBD as an employment hub for locals. We could have applied for building funding for BizBuddyHub, which is a collection of microbusinesses in my community. They desperately need somewhere to set up so that they can collaborate, share costs and innovate together. There are things that we would have and could have applied for.


In fact, there were things that we were already looking at as a possibility of being part of this process, and we were locked out. One can only assume that we were locked out. When you look at who was funded this round and when you look at those boundaries, it is pretty clear that this government doesn't recognise that growth corridors might need extra support. At the rate our area is growing, it is turning into a population of 230,000 people halfway between Melbourne and Geelong. I note that, under this program, the city of Geelong is still considered to be regional, but Wyndham City has been cut from this program. For the people I represent, me coming in here today and hearing people celebrating the grants that have been provided or will be part of their future just highlights this government's lack of attention to detail and lack of attention to the growth corridors—not just the one I represent, but growth corridors around the country.


We should be remembering, as the National Growth Areas Alliance tells us, that five million Australians live in growth corridors, where LGAs and local communities are struggling to keep up with the exponential growth that's happening all the time. In my community we are building recreational facilities at a rate of knots to keep up with the growth. This program could have offered some support to the community that I represent, but this government chose to lock us out of the process and lock us out of our capacity to join the rest of Australia in building for our region.

Apologies that I was late to stand to speak then; I just would have thought that they would want to speak on their own motion.

I should note that this isn't the first time a federal government has had a funding stream available for our regions to tap into. Under Labor it was called the Regional Development Australia Fund and it was a genuine commitment to work with local, state and federal governments to build the infrastructure that we need in the regions. As my friend and colleague the member for Lalor pointed out, it acknowledged all areas of the regions—like our outer metropolitan areas, with their cross-section of outer metro and regional—and the need for infrastructure in those areas. Those are areas like Werribee and parts of Western Sydney, where they are feeling the pressures of growth. These are regions, and this government is choosing to ignore them.


When the government got elected, they scrapped the Regional Development Australia Fund and the role that our RDAs played in ensuring that these areas were priority projects. The government then had the National Stronger Regions Fund. In motion after motion of the last parliament, we heard about how great that fund was. It wasn't as good as Labor's fund, but it did help deliver for places like Bendigo. We did receive funding under that grant scheme for our airport. We did receive funding for the redevelopment and the building of an aquatic centre. It was a project and a guideline that we could work with and that our region said it was able to access.


However, what we're seeing from the Building Better Regions Fund, the BBRF, is a really confusing model. There are two streams now, an infrastructure project stream and a community investment stream. For the infrastructure project stream, as we have pointed out, those successful grants have been announced. They line up with a lot of election commitments made by this government at the last election. This also highlights where they were focused. Perhaps, unfortunately for Bendigo, we didn't make the list and the cut for funding because we weren't a target seat. It's just another example of pork-barrelling by this government, particularly in the state of Victoria—funding for Gippsland, funding for Corangamite, funding for Murray, funding for Flinders, funding for McMillan, funding for Indi, funding for Mallee, funding for Wannon. Bendigo, in Victoria, is the second-biggest regional city, after Geelong, and did not get $1 of funding. It was not because our council didn't apply, not because local businesses didn't apply and not because not-for-profits didn't apply. We had a number of projects go forward but they missed out. And I ask the question: is it because the National Party and the Liberal Party didn't believe that Bendigo was worthwhile, that they just crossed over Bendigo and made very few commitments at the election?


A complaint has also come from my region about the community investment stream. Those announcements haven't been made. Perhaps that's because, in the case of the minister who's involved in making these decisions, there's a question mark over their citizenship. Perhaps the decisions have been delayed because if they made an announcement then they could be challenged. We don't know whether they've been elected and whether they should be sitting in this parliament. These are projects where, again, there are questions about the criteria for this particular stream. You could apply for amounts from $10,000 up to $10 million. How do you compare projects—$10,000 to $10 million? What are the criteria the department has to work with? We can't get access or information about this. A couple of community groups and organisations as well as local governments who've made applications under the stronger investment stream of this particular fund are saying to us that they've had no word. They applied back in March and have had no word. The events, the projects, are going ahead, and they don't know whether they've got funding from the federal government. All they get is a wall of silence.


I urge the government to go back to the model Labor had when we were in government, the Australian regional investment fund, where we worked with local government, we worked with state government, we worked with our RDAs—a model that worked in Victoria—to deliver the projects that our regions need. 


Debate adjourned.

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (16:00):  The pace of global disarmament has been dangerously slow. In recent weeks we've been reminded again of the risks of nuclear war, as tensions flare between two fractious and nuclear-armed leaders. But next Wednesday, at a United Nations ceremony, government leaders will begin signing on to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. This new treaty was negotiated and adopted by 122 countries in July and is a categorical rejection of nuclear weapons. It bans the production, stockpiling, testing, possession, hosting, use and threat of such weapons and is a major milestone on the path to a nuclear-weapon-free world. The treaty is founded on the understanding that any use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic consequences to which no humanitarian or government agency could adequately respond.


Sadly, the Australian government boycotted the nuclear disarmament negotiations and was the only one of 115 countries that belong to nuclear-weapon-free zones to vote against the start of negotiations. Australia has signed the treaties banning chemical and biological weapons, anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions. If this government is serious about nuclear disarmament, it will sign and ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Frankly, there is no legitimate role for these weapons, and we must relegate them to the past.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (16:52):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) Thompson Square, Windsor, is Australia's only surviving Georgian public town square;


(b) in 1810 Governor Lachlan Macquarie proclaimed Thompson Square as the first public place named to honour the contributions of an ex-convict, sending a strong message about Australia as a place of the 'fair go';


(c) the NSW Government's Windsor Bridge replacement project will result in a large modern concrete structure destroying the current Square; and


(d) a community action group, Community Action for Windsor Bridge, has staged a 24 hour occupation of Thompson Square since 21 July 2013 in order to fight the NSW Government's plan;


(2) condemns the NSW Government for ignoring the advice of its own Office of Environment and Heritage, the Heritage Council of NSW and the National Trust; and


(3) calls on the Minister for the Environment and Energy to exercise his powers under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and grant emergency heritage listing to the Thompson Square Precinct to protect this unique place of Australia's cultural heritage.


For 1,514 days local volunteers have been sitting 24 hours a day in a square in historic Windsor, an hour north-west of Sydney. They sit in pairs, four hours at a time, at this time of year sheltered from cold weather by a tarp and, through the night, a gas heater and blankets. In summer they take the sides of the tent down to let whatever breeze there is from the Hawkesbury River wash over them. They sit there because this is Australia's only surviving Georgian public town square, and it's under threat from a poorly-thought-through road project that would knock down an equally heritage bridge and put a modern concrete structure through this historic place. That's why the federal Minister for the Environment and Energy needs to show leadership and grant emergency heritage listing to Thompson Square precinct to protect this unique place.


Let me take you through why this place matters, not just to me as the member for Macquarie, not just to my local community, but to all Australians. For a start, this square and its original listed Georgian buildings are still homes and businesses but are older than Port Arthur. The precinct dates to the same time as Sydney's Macquarie Street buildings like Hyde Park Barracks, The Mint and Sydney Hospital, which the New South Wales government is so concerned to protect. In 1810 Governor Lachlan Macquarie proclaimed Thompson Square as the first public place named to honour the contributions of an ex-convict. As we look back on Macquarie and his decisions, we know we're not proud of all of them. Like many governors he was determined to crush Aboriginal resistance, and that history needs to be told. At the same time, he was pivotal in the development of the Hawkesbury, a region which provided food for the early settlement in New South Wales. In January 1810 Macquarie wrote:


I am concerned to be under the painful necessity of stating to you that there is not at present a single ounce of Wheat or any other sort of Grain in His Majesty's Stores here for victualling the Troops and Convicts.


The colony faced starvation. Within months Andrew Thompson was successful in appealing to settlers in the Hawkesbury to sell extra grain they might have been withholding from the government. Without Thompson's efforts, you'd have to wonder how the colony would have survived, and our nation's history might have been very different. What Macquarie did by rejecting the name of a king or a lord for this gathering place was send a strong message about Australia as a place of the fair go, a place where a convict would be given a second chance as a free man, having served his time, his name to be carried into the 21st century.


The state member for Hawkesbury, Dominic Perrottet, agrees with me about the significance of Macquarie's contribution. He recently said, 'Lachlan Macquarie was one of the chief architects of our state and our nation', yet his government, the New South Wales government, seems hell-bent on proceeding with the Windsor Bridge replacement project, which will result in a large, modern concrete structure right through the current historic square. It is shameful that the New South Wales government continues to ignore the advice of its own Office of Environment and Heritage, the Heritage Council of New South Wales and the National Trust. It also ignores the wishes of a community that desperately wants and needs improvements to its road and bridge network but respects the heritage contained in one of the five Macquarie towns.


The federal Minister for the Environment and Energy has the power to protect Australian history and stories here. He can exercise his powers under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and grant emergency heritage listing to Thompson Square, and its precinct, to protect this unique place of Australia's cultural heritage.


Local group Community Action for Windsor Bridge, CAWB, which organises the 24-hour sit-in, has been doing so since 21 July 2013. They're doing it to fight the New South Wales government's plan and they must be commended for running what we believe is the longest heritage protest Australia has ever seen. The four years of effort shouldn't be ignored. In those years the local council changed its views on the square and now calls for it to be spared, only to be ignored by the New South Wales government.


I want to commend the community for its patience and resilience. We all know how appalling traffic problems are, and most of us realise the New South Wales government's plan is not the answer. I find it hard to reconcile that they will spend $100 million and in doing so not fix the traffic and destroy this important piece of history. This federal environment minister should be similarly appalled and act to make sure that Thompson Square is saved.

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2017-09-11,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (16:57):  I second the motion. As my colleague the member for Macquarie has just outlined, Thompson Square is located in the heart of Windsor, the third-oldest place of British settlement on the Australian continent. It lies 55 kilometres north-west of Sydney and is a little over an hour away from the CBD by car or train. Thompson Square is Australia's first public square. It is the only town square that remains from the original five towns planned and designed by Governor Macquarie. Australia has a long-lived history that long pre-dates European settlement of this country, and capturing and maintaining its history—all elements of its history—is vital to our cultural identity as a nation. You may find it passing strange: what's the member for Lyons in Tasmania doing commenting on this in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales? I have a former history, having lived in Fremantle in Western Australia for many years. That, too, has a long, proud, built architectural history. I know just how important it is to retain what Tim Winton once referred to as a sense of place. Professor George Seddon made similar comments—that a sense of place is so vitally important, because if we don't have that sense of place, that sense of belonging to a past, it's difficult to contemplate where we head to in our future.


There is much built heritage in my own electorate of Lyons, a lot of it built by convicts, many of them Fenian political prisoners. Thompson Square, as the member for Macquarie alluded to, pre-dates Port Arthur, and Port Arthur has had a magnificent restoration. I can't imagine a Tasmania without Port Arthur and the incredible restoration work that has gone on there. Port Arthur hasn't been modernised, or, for want of a better word—and I hope this is not used as an expletive—bastardised. The heritage of Port Arthur has been respected. I think the least we can do is do the same with Thompson Square. We need to respect our heritage in all its forms. I will just come to this point: I'm a big believer in taking a fresh look at history through contemporary eyes. I don't think history is a fixed thing. 



Mr Christensen interjecting—




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  No, it's not a fixed thing. The member for Dawson laughs at this. He thinks that somehow what he learned in primary school is all there is to history. But the fact is that history is contextual.




Mr Christensen:
  It's about facts.




Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:
  It's all about facts. I do agree with the member for Dawson on that. History is about facts. But people are taught some facts and not others. What we need to do in the 21st century is look at history with a fresh filter. We need to look at Aboriginal history. What is the context of Aboriginal history in Australia? What is the context of Australia's history in terms of trade unions and their impact, and how things impact on trade unions? There are a whole range of things that we can learn from that. It's not just the white, colonial history.


Thompson Square is vitally important. It is only one element of Australia's history, but it's an element worth preserving. I'm not of the view that we should be tearing down statues or demolishing them. I think they are a part of our history, and we need to honour that history and learn from it. Sometimes we may need a new plaque on something to better explain part of that history. We owe it to our future to protect significant sites, like Thompson Square. And Thompson Square of course is remarkable in that Macquarie had the foresight to name it after an ordinary bloke. What better Australian story is there than to name a square after an ordinary bloke, right next to a street that is named after the King of England? It's a wonderful middle finger to the royalty of England and a great example of emerging Australian larrikinism. So, we owe it to our future to protect significant sites like Thompson Square, places where history was made, where people have gathered, and places that are important in our history.


I'm not a slavish devotee of colonial history. It is a very good thing that we are re-evaluating with fresh eyes what we have assumed to be our national history. It is a very good thing that we impose new filters on our history—through Indigenous eyes, through the experiences of women and of children who were brought out as little more than slave labour, through the experience of people who are LGBTIQ, or trade unionists, and of course through the experience of migrants. We need to learn from all these experiences and weave together a shared history of this land, a shared history of this nation that we all love, that we all want to see succeed. Thompson Square is part of that history, and what the New South Wales government is doing to it is a terrible shame and should be stopped.


Debate adjourned.
