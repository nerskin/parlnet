Mr ROB MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (10:08):  In September and October last year I travelled to Greece and Turkey alongside my parliamentary colleagues the member for Hindmarsh, Mr Steve Georganas, and Senator Barry O'Sullivan, the great latte-sipper from Queensland—I know Barry will be shaking his head when he hears me say that; he's not a latte man, but we got him to have one, just for a bit of fun—with our wonderful secretariat, Ms Ann Palmer. It is a pleasure to speak about the tabling of this report on our parliamentary delegation. We met with various Greek government officials and stakeholders to discuss trade, economic opportunities, our historic relations and issues surrounding border management. Our discussions gave us the opportunity to reiterate the strength and warmth of the relationship between Greece and Australia. The recovery of the Greek economy and the future economic opportunities were central points of the discussions throughout the visit. It was a pleasure to tour Creta Farms, a leading producer of olive oil, meat and deli products. Creta Farms has a strong alliance with Primo Smallgoods, which locally produces Creta Farms's unique olive-oil based products on our Aussie shores. These kind of partnerships are vital in the rebuilding of the Greek economy, and I hope we can see more opportunities for cooperation.


A particular highlight for me, coming from an electorate with such a rich military history, was our focus on the military engagements which underpin our relations with both Greece and Turkey. It was an honour to visit many memorials commemorating the role played and sacrifices made by Australian soldiers defending Greece and Crete during World War II. We paid our respects at the Souda Bay Allied War Cemetery and memorial and at Phaleron War Cemetery in Athens, where 250 fallen Australian soldiers are buried, as well as the Athens Memorial, where 329 Australians are buried. To commemorate the role of Australian soldiers during the Battle of Crete in 1941, we visited the Stavromenos Memorial, where we met George Pouloudakis. George's father, Mark, was instrumental in establishing the memorial.


We were incredibly humbled to lay wreaths at the Hellenic-Australian Memorial Park in Rethymno an the memorial of the Battle of 42nd Street in Crete, an Anzac memorial near Chania. The issue we've had is that the 42nd Street memorial is famous because Red Saunders, the first Australian Indigenous person to be commissioned officer, led a battalion there. Unfortunately, so far this year we've had to write to three different veterans affairs ministers to try to get this memorial upgraded and treated properly. It's a beautiful memorial, but it needs whoever does the mowing at the other cemeteries nearby—they're only a couple of miles away—or someone to come down, clean the gardens and keep it neat and tidy. It is a very important part of Australian history.


Of course, our time in Turkey was also defined by the deep military history we share. There aren't words to describe the feeling you get when you walk on Anzac Cove at the Gallipoli memorial. It is something that I know touched me very deeply. I had an opportunity to visit the wall at Lone Pine and see Keith Mitchell from Whittlesea, a relative who passed away, killed on the Anzac Day landings, and to appreciate just how great the Turkish people have been with the memorials at Anzac, what it means to Australians and the respect they showed us and they showed our soldiers in that time.


We had fruitful discussions with the chair of the Turkish parliamentary friendship group, who noted the priority in establishing direct flight between Turkey and Australia for Turkish Airlines. There is movement in this respect, and we look forward to seeing an expansion of stopovers in Asia and the introduction of a nonstop flight route.


Recently Turkey began importing Angus cattle to use as breeding stock. We went through issues that they are having with keeping that stock going. Senator O'Sullivan, being a good cattle producer, was able to talk through a whole range of things to help them. Our officials have got in touch with each other, so we're building support for the Turkish cattle industry as well.


We looked at the influx of refugees throughout Turkey, what they've had to face and how they've been able to handle it. We're talking three million refugees heading to Turkey, and the way they've been able to work very closely with the refugee community, bring them in and help them get work and support was something that we should look more and more closely at as we deal with this global crisis.


It was an important visit for the trade relations. It was an important visit for our cultural relations and a great opportunity, as I said, to go to Anzac Cove but also to see just how important trade is to Australia and Australia's future.


I present the report to the House.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:14):  It's a great honour to be speaking on this report on the delegation that visited Greece and Turkey back in September and October last year. For someone like myself, who has a Greek background and also represents a seat with a very large Greek-Australian population, it was an absolute honour to be there, to have discussions with ministers and officials and to see firsthand some of the challenges under the economic crisis that Greece is facing.


Could I first of all say a big thankyou to the people who looked after us while we were there: Ann Palmer, from our secretariat in the Senate, who ensured that we were at the correct place at the right time; and the wonderful staff at the Athens embassy, including Sophia McIntyre, Mr Andrea Biggi and of course—someone who is a stalwart at the embassy—Leonie Kowalenko, who has set up many meetings for me over the years with ministers, deputy prime ministers, speakers et cetera. I pay tribute to her, because she's a wonderful Foreign Affairs staffer who does amazing things in Athens.


The delegation, as we heard from the member for McEwen, looked at border management and border protection. We met with Frontex in Athens, who told us about the way they're dealing with the massive influx of refugees, not just from Syria but from all over the world. When they tell you that there are over 500,000 refugees living in Athens alone you can see the enormity of the problem they have and the assistance they require from Europe and other parts of the world to help with the issue. We spoke about the economy of Greece and how there's approximately 23 per cent unemployment—the official figure is 23, but it's more likely to be around 40 per cent.


We visited Crete, and it was a very special moment to visit the place where the Battle of Crete took place. Many Australians participated in the battles there during World War II. As the member for McEwen said, we visited the memorial at Stavromenos, and they raised with us the upkeep of that particular memorial. We've written to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to ensure that we can get some sort of support to keep this very special place clean and tidy and to ensure that it is a special place for Australians when they visit Greece.


We also had meetings with the deputy foreign affairs minister, Mr Terence Quick. Mr Speaker, you would remember that we welcomed him here, in this place, in the Greek language, together with the member for Chisholm. It was great to see Mr Terence Quick again and have discussions with him. One of the things we spoke about with Mr Terence Quick was the finalising of the working holiday visa with Australia. Only the other day he telephoned me to tell me there was one more tiny thing to be done, one thing to be signed, for that to become reality. We discussed Greek-Australia relationships, with the massive Greek Australian community that we have here, the wonderful experiences people have and the ties between our two nations.


Mr Speaker, it was a very informative visit where we saw all the aspects of the people-to-people ties, the economic challenges that Greece is going through and, of course, our historical ties through World War I and World War II. We also visited Gallipoli and, as the member for McEwen said, it was very moving to be on that peninsula and still to find things on the ground that were left by our troops back in World War I. We laid wreaths at different memorials. We visited Hagia Sophia, one of the major Christian churches in the world and one of the first, built by Constantine the Great. It was very moving for me. Unfortunately, I had to leave—I had a family issue that popped up in the middle of the delegation's trip—and didn't make it to Ankara, but it was a good delegation. We ensured that we made the ties between those two nations and Australia stronger through the discussions we had and ensured that there is continuing thought given to trade and to the people-to-people contact we have with both of those nations. Both of them are very good allies of Australia through our ties with NATO in Europe and through the historical ties that exist in Greece because of World War I, World War II and the history of the mass migration of people to Australia. I'm looking forward to seeing some of these things come to fruition, especially the working holiday visa and the upkeep of the memorials we spoke about, because they are significant for Australia and for Greece. Many, many people have an interest in this area.

Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (10:19):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Colleagues, I'm pleased to stand in the House today to introduce this Higher Education Support Amendment (National Regional Higher Education Strategy) Bill 2018, which focuses on regional higher education. I'd like to recognise in the gallery Dr Caroline Perkins, the executive director from the Regional Universities Network, RUN, who's in the chamber. RUN includes a network of universities: CQ University, Federation University Australia, Southern Cross University, University of New England, University of Southern Queensland and the University of the Sunshine Coast. They've worked with our office to strengthen and promote the contribution of regional universities to national development. I'd also like to acknowledge colleagues in the House from the Alpine Valleys Community Leadership program, and stress to you that it's all about leadership.


The delivery of higher education in regional Australia is central to the economic prosperity of this nation, and this bill provides a way forward to ensure that regional Australia has a comprehensive higher education strategy underpinning policy decisions of government. The bill mandates that the government maintains a strategic plan and analysis of regional higher education, and recognises the role of regional universities in sustaining economic growth and supporting employment in regional Australia.


Support for the delivery of higher education in regional areas is often seen only as an issue of equity, focused on improved access, participation and completion rates. And, while equity is important, regional education is also an essential driver of the national economy. I call on a national regional higher education strategy to actually put regional higher education at the centre of integrated policy and programs about education, research, innovation, employment, and, of course, regional development.


Mr Speaker, as you know, regional universities play a unique role in developing our regional economies, contributing to social and cultural development. They act as an anchor for investment and, importantly, workforce development. One of the biggest threats to sustainability of rural communities is the great export of our young people to cities. Three-quarters of students who study at regional universities actually stay in regional areas after they graduate. So regional universities educate the future workforce and help to grow and stabilise the population of regional Australia in regional Australia. This strategy must be developed in partnership with all levels of government and with regional higher education providers, their representative bodies and their industries. So before I conclude my comments I'd like to invite the member for Mayo to value-add to this in her role as seconder of the private member's bill.


But I say to my colleagues opposite—I say to the National Party and to members of the Liberal Party from regional Australia—where are you on this? Why are you letting one size fit all? The consequence is that regional Australia gets left behind, we fall into a deficit model and we are not able to take our place—our rightful place—in developing this whole country. One size does not fit all: the tyranny of distance and the issues facing regional Australia need to be taken and addressed in their own right.


I absolutely call on the National Party and I call on the regional members from the Liberal Party: get up here! Can I say to my colleagues: 'See their interest. Where are they? Why are they not here today to be part of this debate?' I say they're not here because they don't care. This is a stunning call-out to all the people in rural and regional Australia who vote for the coalition, hoping that they would bring their voice to parliament. They singularly, repeatedly fail us.



The SPEAKER:  Is there a seconder?

"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",CA,2018-03-26,"



Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (10:24):  I rise to second the Higher Education Support Amendment (National Regional Higher Education Strategy) Bill 2018 and to support the motion of the member for Indi, and to congratulate the member for Indi for the work she has done to further the cause for regional universities. I support this bill because I understand how important it is for the future of our regions and the future of our country that we have a strong, growing regional educational sector.


Regional universities are vital to the success and prosperity of Australia's regional centres. The economic benefit that universities provide to a regional town is immense. For example, the University of New England is responsible for 12.6 per cent of the total employment in the New South Wales town of Armidale. Similar stories are replicated across Australia in towns like Burnie, Launceston and Albury-Wodonga. Just last Friday I was invited to Geelong to speak at a coastal conference. When I met with local government there, they said it was Deakin University that was the anchor point in changing the prosperity of the community of Geelong. I am working very hard to make sure that we can have campuses in Mayo. We need university campuses, like we have in my home state in Whyalla and Mount Gambier. The benefits of having a university campus in a regional area are, indeed, immense. Universities provide employment opportunities for locals and they collaborate with local businesses on research that will directly impact the area, but, most importantly, they provide a genuine opportunity for rural and regional students to obtain higher education without needing to leave their communities—their home towns.


Universities Australia has equated the shortfall in funding as the equivalent of 10,000 university places. While this is a major concern across the nation, the impact of the MYEFO cuts is disproportionately felt by regional universities. These universities, by virtue of their location, will struggle to attract full-fee-paying international students to meet the funding shortfall. They often struggle to attract the same level of research investment as the traditional universities in the capital cities. They simply do not have the ability of the larger metropolitan based universities to draw on alternative funding sources.


The statistics are damning. For people aged between 25 and 34 in major cities, 42.4 per cent have obtained a bachelor degree. Compare this to those in regional areas and the number falls dramatically to just over 20 per cent. It is still lower in remote areas, where the rate is less than one in five. I'm on the record as saying that university is not for everyone and that many people would perhaps be better served by undergoing VET courses or apprenticeships, but to have such a divide between regional and metropolitan education levels in our country is staggering and something that I believe the government must address. As the member for Indi says, this is something that the National Party should be picking up with both hands.


Finally, it is worth recognising that the government has a clear decentralisation agenda. I recognise the excellent work that the member for Indi has done in her role on the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation—not just being part of the committee but making sure that committee happened. There is significant evidence that shows the only way for decentralisation to truly work is for the region to contain a skilled supply of labour supported by a university. Not having a regional higher education strategy puts the government's decentralisation agenda, I believe, at risk, and it puts the future of Australia's regional areas at risk. The member for Indi's bill identifies the need to increase the representation of regional students in higher education. It identifies that the future of the regions lies in encouraging students to stay and study in their local area and receive a good-quality education, and it identifies that the federal government is not supporting our regions by providing them with the tools necessary to succeed. We need to do this. We need to keep our young people in the communities that they want to live in, and not all of us, indeed, want to live in a capital city.


Once again, I congratulate the member for Indi and encourage all members of this House, particularly those from regional areas, and, again, I call on the National Party: show some leadership in this area. You represent the seats where these universities are needed and the regions that, where universities already exist, are struggling.



The SPEAKER:  The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-03-26,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:30):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Under this coalition government, working people have less control over their lives than ever before, but the problems have been around for a while. The last time I introduced a version of this bill to give people more control over the hours and arrangements of their working lives, back in 2012, the Labor Party refused to support it even though we were in a position where we could have got it through the minority parliament. Now, six years later, we still have the same problems and some of them are getting worse. Take unemployment, for example. Just last week, unemployment ticked up to 5.6 per cent—the last time it was under five per cent was in November 2008. In 2012, when I last introduced this bill, it was 5.3 per cent, but now it looks like it could reach six per cent.


In my previous speech in 2012, I noted that Australians performed $72 billion of unpaid overtime each year. Now, it's estimated to be $130 billion. In 2012, according to the ABS, our underutilisation rate was 12.7 per cent, but now it's 13.9 per cent. It's the same story with the underemployment ratio, which has gone up from 7.8 to 8.9 per cent. To move away from percentages—this is a huge number of people. The amount of underemployed people in this country was around 872,000 in 2012, when I last stood here on this matter, and is now over 1.1 million people.


In my last speech, I said that 'if people want to work different hours or work from home so that their life is better, then the law should allow it and society should encourage it, provided it does not unduly impact on their employer.


The ironic reality of how trickle-down economics or neoliberalism is twisting workers is painfully borne out by the data, which shows why we need this reform. In Australia people are both overworked and underworked simultaneously. According to research conducted by the Australia Institute in November last year, 27 per cent of full-time workers said they would prefer to work fewer hours. In contrast, part-time and casual workers work far fewer and more uncertain hours, and they want to work more. In fact, 45 per cent of part-time workers and 60 per cent of casuals said they want to work more. The Australia Institute's report Excessive hours, unpaid overtime and the future of work: an update puts it best:


It is painfully ironic that so many Australians in insecure jobs want and need more hours of paid employment—while many more, who currently work long hours, would like more time off.


At the same time as we're rightly worried about the effect of technology and automation on the workforce, it also becomes clear how, if we had control over it, it could actually be beneficial. It could provide workers with more flexibility—not just the flexibility to work from home but the flexibility to reduce their hours as well. Technology could help create more jobs, but only if the community has control over how that technology is used and implemented in our workplace and if people as workers have control of it, so it's used not to displace workers but to make work better.


We need the law to keep pace with changes in society and technology. Our job in this place is to examine society to identify problems—and then to work as hard as we can to correct them. It's not our job to just sit back in this chamber and allow markets, big corporations and those that have power to wield it with no consequences. One of the fundamental reasons we have government is to intervene when the system is no longer working in the best interests of the people that it's meant to serve, and right now, with so many people clamouring for more work and so many others saying, 'Hang on; we're actually being overworked,' it's clear that the law is not serving people.


We need this reform and we need it urgently. Right now there too many people who are not in a job that matches their circumstances. The trends identified by the Australia Institute match the ABS data, which shows that 23½ per cent of 20-to-24-year-olds want more hours in their main job, but meanwhile, if you go to the other end of the spectrum, a staggering 20.1 per cent of 55-to-59-year-olds want less. Overall almost three out of 10 employees are dissatisfied with the number of hours they work in their main job. We have a national crisis when it comes to young people. When you add together the number of young people who are unemployed and the number of young people who want more work—that is, those who are underemployed—about one in three young people in this country either doesn't have a job or doesn't have enough hours of work. And it's got worse since the GFC, not better. 


We are on the verge on condemning a whole generation of young people to never having decent jobs and income. Meanwhile at the other end of the spectrum there are people who are saying, 'I'd be happy to work less, in fact, I want to work less,' but our law does not allow for them to have an enforceable right to do it. In this respect, we are behind other countries. If we gave people more control over their working lives and an enforceable right to ask for different working arrangements, we could share available work around more fairly, and we could relieve the pressure on people, on young and older workers, especially those who are juggling work and caring responsibilities. Right now under Labor's Fair Work Act, all you have got in law is a right to have a conversation with your employer. If the boss says no, you've got nowhere to go. It's not an enforceable right, and we need to make it enforceable.


This bill, the Fair Work Amendment (Better Work/Life Balance) Bill, gives people that enforceable right to request different hours and arrangements for work, especially if they have caring responsibilities. Employees would have the right to ask that their working hours be decreased or increased, which the employer could refuse only on reasonable business grounds, and the Fair Work Commission would be empowered to decide whether the employer's refusal was reasonable. Employees with caring responsibilities would have greater rights, with employers only able to refuse on serious countervailing business grounds. I think most people in this place would agree that caring—caring for kids or caring for your parents as they get older—is work. It is work. Increasingly, it is becoming difficult to balance that with work responsibilities. So many people are saying, 'We are being overworked,' at the same time as many people on the other side of the spectrum are saying, 'We are being underworked.' We are doing a very bad job in this country of matching the hours people actually work with the hours that they want to work. Unless we tackle it, we not only condemn a generation of young people to underemployment and unemployment for a very, very long time but condemn other people to having unfulfilling family and personal lives, because their employer is able to dictate what counts as flexibility. For too long, flexibility has been a one-way street. It's been something employers have been able to demand, but when employees want it, when employees want a bit more control over their life, a bit more certainty over how many hours they're going to work—a bit more or a bit less—they're unable to get it. It seems the flexibility only ever works from the top down. And in a country like Australia, especially as we see rising unemployment and underemployment, we should be able to tackle this. We're going to need to change the rules and accept, as the Greens have been arguing since 2012, that the Fair Work Act is broken, that it tilts the balance in favour of big corporations and that it does not give people the rights to control their own working environment. So the stakes are high. If we keep going as we are, we condemn a generation of young people to not having enough work and to not having good enough incomes. And we also know that, at the other end of the spectrum, we are impacting on people's health.


A recent study conducted by Indiana University's Kelley School of Business found that those who work in high-stress jobs with little control over their arrangements at work are more likely to die sooner than those who have more control over and balance in their work. That stands to reason. It stands to reason that, if you don't have control over the hours that you're able to work—whether it's a bit more or a bit less—and it impacts on your life outside because your life is too insecure or you're balancing too many responsibilities, that causes stress and that makes people less happy and less healthy. Workers who are happier and healthier are more motivated and are more likely to stay in a workplace longer. Changing the law and giving workers this right is not an attack on business. This should make business better. And, in other countries where they have made the right enforceable, there hasn't been an outbreak of litigation. You end up with a few decisions from the tribunal that sets the ground rules and then people adjust accordingly. This reform is long overdue. The Greens have been pushing for action on it since 2012. We will keep pushing for action, and I hope that others support it.

 (Lindsay) (10:51):  I move: 


That this House:


(1) acknowledges that the XXI Commonwealth Games will commence on the Gold Coast with the opening ceremony on Wednesday, 4 April 2018 and the closing ceremony on Sunday, 15 April 2018;


(2) notes that:


(a) more than 6,600 athletes and team officials from 70 Commonwealth Nations and Territories will be competing;


(b) the athletes will compete in 275 events in 18 different sports and seven para-sports; and


   (c) beach volleyball, para triathlon and women's Rugby Sevens will make their Commonwealth Games debuts and for the first time at a Commonwealth Games, an equal number of men's and women's medal events will be contested;


(3) acknowledges that this year the Commonwealth Games motto will be 'Share the Dream'; and


(4) encourages all Members of Parliament to support the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games and the Australian sports people representing Australia at the Commonwealth Games.


I'm delighted that the 21st Commonwealth Games are due to start on the Gold Coast from 4 April and will run for 11 days, concluding on 15 April. There will be 71 nations competing, including Gambia, which has been readmitted to the Commonwealth. We will see the best of the best competing, with more than 6,600 athletes and team officials already moving into the villages, competing in 275 events in 18 different sports and seven parasports. Some of the traditional inclusions in this year's games are swimming, athletics, basketball, boxing, gymnastics, hockey, netball and triathlon. I'm probably proficient in about one of those sports. Hopefully the people competing are much better than I am! This year, it's great to see that beach volleyball and paratriathlon are included, as well as the women's rugby sevens making their Commonwealth Games debut. For the first time in the Commonwealth Games, an equal number of men's and women's medal events will be contested, which is an absolutely fabulous outcome for equality. 


There are 1.5 million tickets to watch the games and more than a million have already been sold. Preparations are well underway for the opening ceremony on 4 April. A number of communities have participated in the Queen's Baton Relay as the baton has made its way up to the Gold Coast for the 21st Commonwealth Games. The relay has travelled a record 230,000 kilometres around the world, and, while in Australia, will be carried by just under 4,000 baton bearers, including through my own community of Lindsay. I would love to congratulate all of the baton bearers and make special mention of those people in Lindsay who took the baton throughout our community: teacher Craig Beacroft from Penrith, who has been inspirational with his school in fundraising for Relay for Life; Mitchell Beggs-Mowczan from Glenmore Park, the Young Penrith Citizen of the Year 2017, who has contributed to improving the health of our region's Indigenous community; Betty Gallagher from Colyton, an amazing woman who has fostered more than 100 children; Cathy Gardiner from St Clair—St Clair is slightly out of Lindsay, but, as with all good things, we like to claim people from St Clair as our own—who has represented Australia in athletics and now trains athletes with a disability; Alysha Pearson from Cranebrook, who is the current New South Wales under-16 women's hammer-throw champion and recipient of a Local Sporting Champions award—I can throw a hammer, but not really to a medal standard and only usually in frustration during home renovations!—so well done to Alysha; Robert Wearn from Mulgoa, the patron of the Great Walk Foundation; and Cheryl Webb from Werrington, a Commonwealth Games bronze medallist. Thank you to all of those people, who made an incredible show bringing that baton through our community.


The world will be watching our games. It's estimated that we will have a global audience of about 1.5 billion people. Hundreds of international media organisations will begin arriving this week. Let's hope that we are on our best behaviour. 


Viewers will see the sporting talents and be enthralled by the games, and they will see our beautiful country. These games are a great opportunity to showcase the Gold Coast, Queensland and Australia to the world and, if we're watching at home, they might encourage some of us to get up off the couch, stop being armchair athletes, be a bit more active and catch up with our mates for a game or two.


The economic benefits to holding the games are about $4 billion, including a $2 billion boost to Queensland's economy, including $1.7 billion for the Gold Coast. There are also around $2.6 billion of additional government and private sector investments. To support businesses and to take advantage of the opportunities arising before, during and post games, a number of programs to build capability and capacity have been developed, including the Be Games Ready program, tourism initiatives, support for Indigenous businesses and major event capability development. Everything is absolutely on track for the games. Eighteen world-class venues were built or upgraded, and the amazing infrastructure program supported 1,000 full-time construction jobs.


The First Nations welcome ceremony will be hosted on 1 April, and I'm proud that there has been a reconciliation action plan, which has actually delivered a really great outcome for the Yugambeh people on the coast. Gold Coast 2018 is the first major sporting event to have a reconciliation action plan driving employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and for arts and culture. More than 200 employment opportunities have been created for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as one of the key outcomes of the Gold Coast 2018 reconciliation plan. I'm really, really pleased to see that this has happened. And it will be Gold Coast's biggest event.


It is a tremendous effort to prepare for the games, and I congratulate Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and Commonwealth Games minister Kate Jones and make mention of the Commonwealth Games stakeholders and thank them. It is very exciting for Australia to be once again involved in hosting the games. We can all share the dream.


I would like to say a special mention to the 1,500 volunteers who will be out there making sure that everyone gets to the venues on time. I thank them for their volunteerism.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (10:57):  I'm happy to second the motion from the member for Lindsay. As we enter another sitting week here in parliament followed by Easter, already we see the focus turning to the event that will occur after Easter, which is the 21st Commonwealth Games, on the Gold Coast. What a spectacle it will be, I'm sure, and hopefully the rainy weather we have had up in Brisbane and on the Gold Coast of late will disappear so we can show the people of the Commonwealth what a wonderful place the Gold Coast really is. As we see more than 6,600 athletes and officials from over 70 Commonwealth nations and territories making their way there, it will be terrific to see and showcase the Gold Coast in all its glory. We already know that the Gold Coast is one of the most visited destinations in Australia. We will see some 275 events in 18 different sports and seven parasports.


The 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games is much more than a sporting event, though. It's about the opportunities and the benefits the games will bring to the Gold Coast and to all Queensland before, during and after the event. While the competition itself will be fierce and the tourism opportunities for our part of the world like no other, the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games is also about creating exciting opportunities for young people in my electorate of Forde. I recently had the pleasure of visiting Marsden State High School to present a cheque for the Stronger Communities grant. The funding was going towards some new equipment for their catering and restaurant facilities.


But, while I was speaking to the students, congratulating them on their success and also congratulating Principal Andrew Peach, I was very pleased to learn that 35 students from Marsden State High School will be working in the athletes' village during the Commonwealth Games. I'd like to congratulate the school's food, design and technology department, who have supported these 35 students in gaining paid employment. Their proactive approach to working with Delaware North has led to real-world learning experiences and opportunities for Logan's youth. These will result in an outstanding head start for their future careers in the hospitality industry. These students have shown great skill and a fantastic work ethic to be chosen to take on paid employment in catering and services at the Commonwealth Games, and will now get some fantastic real-world experience to put their skills to the test. It will be an experience that will be remembered for a long time and one that they'll be able to put on their resumes.


The students who have been chosen to work in the athletes village deserve the praise and the media attention they have received, as they did on ABC radio a couple of weeks ago—as does the work and the effort of Marsden State High School and the principal and the teachers there. This is an outstanding school, with an excellent reputation for hardworking teachers and students.


The organisers, staff and volunteers of the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games have also worked hard to ensure the games run as smoothly as possible. With thousands of people already arriving on the Gold Coast, the logistics of so many people visiting one city is phenomenal. My electorate of Forde is playing its part in ensuring that spectators, staff and volunteers can get to their events on time with the park and ride at Beenleigh State High School. From there, people will be able to access all Gold Coast venues via train and shuttle buses.


To witness this event in its entirety is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many Queenslanders. I'm looking forward to attending a number of events and cheering on our fantastic Australian athletes as they compete for glory on their home soil. It will be an opportunity like no other, and I hope the 2018 Commonwealth Games will leave a positive and lasting impression as the world listens on. Equally, we will see a legacy of wonderful sporting venues and opportunities for the future use of these great facilities once the Commonwealth Games concludes. So I commend everybody involved in the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, and wish them every success for the coming couple of weeks.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (11:02):  I'm very pleased to speak on the motion moved by the energetic and passionate member for Lindsay.


There are just nine more sleeps until we experience the spectacle and excitement of the opening ceremony of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. This year, I'm happy to say, it's on my home turf of Queensland. In 2006 Australia last hosted a Commonwealth Games in a city—I think it's called Melbourne, Deputy Speaker? And the time before that, 36 years ago, was in Brisbane. The athletes village for the 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games was in my electorate of Moreton. The Griffith University Nathan campus was transformed into an operations centre. The student accommodation housed athletes and officials, new-release movies were shown in the university cinema and the grounds were a rolling venue for live entertainment to fill the athletes' downtime. We saw this on the Channel 7 news the other day in a flashback. The Commonwealth Games from 1982 left a lasting legacy on the Nathan campus. This year's Commonwealth Games will be held just down the road at the Gold Coast—again, next door to a Griffith University campus, but this time on the Gold Coast.


Hosting the Commonwealth Games is a massive undertaking. There will be 71 nations and territories competing. Six thousand six hundred athletes and team officials have already started moving into the Gold Coast, ready for the start of the games. Queensland's Minister for the Commonwealth Games, Kate Jones, and Annastacia Palaszczuk, the Premier, have done a wonderful job preparing for Queensland's biggest event—an event that has created thousands of jobs and opportunities for Queenslanders. Obviously, they have been ably assisted by their chairman, the indefatigable and ever-astute Peter Beattie.


More than one million tickets have been sold so far. But there are still some tickets available, including a new release of 40,000 tickets. There are still tickets available for athletics, basketball, squash, hockey, lawn bowls, badminton and weightlifting, and I hear that more tickets for the swimming are about to be released. I'm lucky enough to be able to take my family along to the swimming, to the boxing and to a few other events. Fifteen thousand volunteers and thousands more staff will be deployed to venues on the Gold Coast.


Not only will the event itself be fantastic as a sporting spectacle but it's great for Queensland. I can't wait to take my family to some of the events, and I know that other people from all around the world will be turning up. Up to 30,000 jobs have been created and 18 world-class facilities have been built or upgraded through a $320 million infrastructure program. The games venues were completed some time ago and the temporary overlays to specifically house the Commonwealth Games events are all but finished. 


The magnitude of preparing the venues becomes apparent when you hear what was required to be installed before the games could start: 61,000 temporary grandstand seats, 500 tents covering 45,000 square metres, 50 kilometres of temporary fencing and over 38,000 branded elements to ensure that everyone will be well aware that they are celebrating the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. 


The games will have a global viewing audience of about 1½ billion and will showcase the Gold Coast, Queensland and Australia to the world. Hopefully, some of these viewers will then be tempted to come for a visit themselves, bringing more tourism dollars for businesses. The Commonwealth Games will leave a lasting legacy, as the new sporting infrastructure will make Queensland more attractive as a location for other international sporting meets. More immediately, the games will generate $4 billion and support 16,000 full-time jobs. 


As for the events themselves: what can I say? They will be a feast for sporting spectators: world-class athletes competing at world-class venues, and just a short train ride from my home. The games will be using the very best venues and the most beautiful natural resources that the Gold Coast can lay on. The 20-kilometre race in both the walking and road cycling will take place on the beautiful Currumbin beachfront. The marathon and triathlon will be staged at the Southport Broadwater Parklands, a route familiar to all who have done the Gold Coast half-marathon or marathon. Lawn bowls will be held at the Broadbeach Bowls Club, just metres from one of the Gold Coast's famous white sandy beaches—beaches that are easily, I believe, the best in the world. We must not forget the most important part of the Commonwealth Games: the athletes who have trained and are striving for gold. Importantly, this year, for the first time, female athletes will receive the same number of medals as males. 


I wish athletes competing all the best, especially those who grew up in Moreton and started their playing careers in some of our wonderful south-side sporting clubs, athletes such as the talented Charlotte Caslick, who's already won a gold medal—at the Olympics—and will be competing in the Australian rugby women's sevens and Tom Lucas who'll be competing in the Australian men's Rugby Sevens squad and who started his Rugby at Sunnybank. I wish you athletes all the best—that is, anyone connected with my electorate and everyone in the Australian team. I will be cheering some of you from the sidelines and others from my lounge room.

"Vasta, Ross, MP",LP,2018-03-26,"



Mr VASTA
 (Bonner) (11:07):  The countdown is on for the 2018 Commonwealth Games at the Gold Coast, the largest sporting event to be held in Australia in a decade. As we all know, the coalition government has helped make these games a reality, investing $154 million in 2013-14 to fund permanent infrastructure for the games and a further commitment of $2 million for legacy programs to encourage more Aussies to get active. I'm glad to have seen some of the investment dollars being spent in my own electorate of Bonner as we prepare to host the track cycling and shooting events. The construction of two state-of-the-art venues in Bonner has created hundreds of jobs and will provide local families and athletes with awesome opportunities for many years to come.


Earlier this month I visited the Anna Meares Velodrome. I must say, it's a masterpiece, a state-of-the-art construction ready to host the track cycling. The Belmont Shooting Complex has been fitted with brand new electronic targets, in preparation for the games, and will play host to some of the world's finest shooters as they compete in the clay target, full-bore, pistol and small-bore events. I'm excited to be attending some of the shooting events with Senator Bridget McKenzie, the Minister for Sport, as we cheer on our Australian athletes. 


As we near the opening ceremony, on 4 April, the spirit of the games is being felt all over the country, including in the electorate of Bonner. Last month I visited 26 local schools, delivering hand-waving flags to the students, encouraging them to get into the spirit of the games. I'm hoping that all the local kids will take their hand-waving flags to events they may be attending and cheer loudly for our great athletes in the green and gold.


Thanks to one local student I, too, will be taking a very special item with me to the games.  I held a competition for local primary schoolchildren to design supporters' banners for the chance to win a prize pack. The entries received were amazing and featured everything from the iconic boxing kangaroo to the games mascot, Borobi, playing basketball. It was almost impossible to pick just one winner from all the great entries, but Jessica Kelly of Carina State School was chosen. Congratulations, Jessica, and thanks for the awesome poster. I'll gladly be waving it at the games. 


With just over a week to go, I would like to wish all of our Aussie athletes good luck. In Bonner we will be cheering extra loud for local girl Madison Keeney, who is representing Australia in the one-metre and three-metre synchronised diving events. Harnessing the determination of her favourite show, Pokemon, Madison is striving to be the very best, like no-one ever was. I'm urging all of my Bonner locals to keep a keen eye out for Olivia Brown from the Annette Roselli Dance Academy in Tingalpa as well. Olivia will be joining the thousands of other amazing young entertainers performing in the closing ceremony.


It's not just the athletes who deserve a massive thanks. It's going to be a huge job keeping the thousands of visitors, athletes and locals safe during the games, too. Last week I met with the local police in Carindale and Wynnum and was given a snapshot into the work they're doing to prepare for the games. Our local and state police crews, emergency services and all the volunteers are putting in so much of their time and deserve a huge round of applause for the hard work they are putting in prior, during and after the games. It's going to be a big job, but somebody has to do it. I'm glad to say that what I have seen so far is that we've got the best women and men on the job. Let's get ready for the games.

"Lamb, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (11:11):  In just over a week the 21st Commonwealth Games will commence on the Gold Coast in my home state of Queensland. It will be the fifth time that Australia has hosted the Commonwealth Games and, by the look of things, it may very well prove to be the best one yet. It's really exciting to think that more than 6,600 athletes and team officials from 70 Commonwealth nations will come together for this huge showcase of international sportsmanship.


What is even more exciting is that there are young Australians standing up, wearing the green and gold very proudly, representing our great country on the world stage. There are young Australians like Liam Wilson. Liam is only 21. He's a light welterweight boxer and he comes from Caboolture, a great suburb in our great electorate of Longman. Liam is going to be a world champion, I'm sure. He already holds an outstanding record of 122 wins from 135 fights. For someone so young, he's got the experience, having been boxing since he was just 10 years of age. It's great to see Liam representing our region, our state and our nation. I know he will do well.


Proudly, our region's talent doesn't stop there. Representing our wonderful area in South-East Queensland, we have sisters Taylor and Kaylee McKeown, who will compete in the swimming. Caboolture's own superfish, Lakeisha Patterson, will also be competing.


I don't know what it is—maybe it's something in the water, if we are talking about swimming—but Australia always shows its strength when it comes to competitions. That is why I'm so pleased to see women truly showing their strength at this year's games. For the first time at a Commonwealth Games there will be an equal number of men's and women's medal events being contested, with sports like women's rugby sevens and beach volleyball being contested for the very first time. The motto for this year's games is 'Share the dream'. It's so good to see this motto being lived by. We have some truly incredible female athletes in this country. It's great to see them finally getting the recognition they deserve. It seems women's sport has hit a turning point in the last few years. We've still got a long way to go, but it's great to see them hitting that turning point. This is a really huge step forward. I'm excited to be able to sit and watch in my lounge room as it starts to pay off.


As I said, the 21st Commonwealth Games are going to be huge. It's going to be the largest sporting event to be staged in Australia this decade. In fact, the GC 2018 is going for gold to deliver an inclusive games by hosting up to 300 para-athletes in 38 medal events across seven sports. An event of this magnitude requires a great team to get it all together. I commend the Queensland Palaszczuk government, with a special mention to the Minister for the Commonwealth Games, Kate Jones, for all of their efforts in having a focus on equality and inclusion; efforts towards making South-East Queensland games-ready; and hard work towards supporting 30,000 full-time equivalent jobs required for the games. It's developed infrastructure across Queensland's south-east corner that will benefit Queensland long after the closing ceremony. It will showcase South-East Queensland to the world, to all of the interstate and international visitors and many, many millions of people who watch the games at home, and their hard work will inject around $2 billion into our economy.


I really am looking forward to watching the games come 4 April. I'm looking forward to seeing the young Australians proudly represent our country, standing in front of the flag and wearing the green and gold, and I'm looking forward to seeing the medal tally at the end of the games. Australia, I am sure, will have won gold after gold after gold.


To all the athletes competing, I wish you all of the best of luck. All of Australia will be right behind you. We'll all be barracking for you and we'll be sharing the dream with you. I'm sure you'll do our nation proud. But I can't sign off without acknowledging the wonderful work that all of the volunteers will be doing at the Commonwealth Games. I know there are people from my electorate that are heading down to the Gold Coast and will be volunteering their time to make sure that the Commonwealth Games go smoothly, that they are inclusive, that we do see equality, that we all have a great time and that we do it safely. Thank you.

Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (11:16):  For those of us who represent regional Australia, the 21st Commonwealth Games is a particularly welcome occasion. This is the first time that the games have been hosted in a regional Australian city. This year, we'll show the world that regional Australia and the regional coast of Queensland, like my electorate of Fisher, in particular, are not simply an unforgettable destination for tourism. We will prove that regional Australia can mount a multibillion-dollar world event; efficiently manage a team of thousands of employees, volunteers, athletes and officials; and provide world-class security for all. As the world's attention turns to regional Australia, we will show them that our regions have fantastic local businesses and innovators, world-class cultural experiences and, most importantly, hundreds of thousands of highly-skilled and highly-motivated people with a great deal to offer any project.


The Sunshine Coast is heavily involved in these Comm Games. Our world-class sports facilities, as well as our relaxing environment and welcoming people, have attracted more than 500 athletes and officials to train during the games' build-up. These include: Australia's rugby sevens and netball teams, England's triathlon group and athletes from the Isle of Man, St Helena and Niue. Wales has chosen to bring its athletes and swimming teams to the Sunshine Coast while Scotland is basing its entire team in our community. The biggest contributions will be made by our people. Twenty-four Sunshine Coast locals are carrying the Queen's Baton, and hundreds of our residents will work as volunteers, including my own daughter Sarah. However, Sunshine Coasters will not just be represented behind the scenes but at the heart of the action in the Australian national team.


The many fantastic swimming clubs in our region are really producing the goods for Australia. The University of the Sunshine Coast Spartans, alone, are sending nine athletes. Taylor and Kaylee McKeown, Jake Packard, Leah Neale and Mikayla Sheridan will be going to the Commonwealth Games while Blake Cochrane, Ellie Cole, Daniel Fox and Logan Powell will be representing Australia in the integrated para-sport program. And you know what, Deputy Speaker? One of the best things about the Commonwealth Games is the integration of the Paralympics with the able-bodied athletes. The Olympic movement can take a huge leaf out of what the Comm Games do, because we've all seen those, what I regard to be, very unfortunate situations where, for the Olympics, we get excited about our able-bodied athletes and then, a week later, the Paralympics start and they just don't get the same attention. When you look at the sheer grit and guts that those Paralympic athletes have taken to get themselves to that level of sport, I think that we, as a sporting-mad community, really drop the ball. I want to congratulate, from the bottom of my heart, the Comm Games team that integrate those two sports together. As the father of a disabled child who dreams of being a Paralympian one day, just to see the integration and how they're all mixed in together and is just a fantastic thing. Those that run the Olympic teams really need to get their act together and follow the lead from the Comm Games.


Kaylee McKeown's performance at the national trials was particularly remarkable. She defeated Australian icon and double-world champion Emily Seebohm to claim her first national title in the 200 backstroke. At 16 she's also the swimming team's youngest member, so congratulations, Kaylee.


The University of the Sunshine Coast will also send two coaches, Chris Mooney and Nathan Doyle; as well as sports scientist Dr Daniella Formosa to be part of the Australian team. Kawana Waters Swimming Club Paralympian finalist Liam Schluter has also been selected and I'm certain will have a great chance for a medal in the S14 200-metre freestyle. 


There are plenty of other clubs, like Pelican Waters Swim Club, with Tessa Wallace, who I met the other day and is no relation. Tessa Wallace, good luck. Good luck also to Lucky Patterson. You're all great, and I know that you will do us all proud.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (12:11):  This Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 is an extraordinary one. It contains some 17 different measures that will hurt many vulnerable Australians, people who are unemployed, single parents, and women and children escaping violence. As Ross Gittins said in an article, just today:


You've never seen such a list of pettifogging nastiness, yielding tiny savings to the budget.


From the title of the bill—'welfare reform'—you might get the false impression that this was part of some big once-in-a-generation change to our social security system. But it isn't. It's a grab bag of nasty and mean cuts that will hurt vulnerable Australians. I'm sure everyone here will remember that when this bill was introduced, in September last year, it had some even nastier measures. It initially had the government's plan to trial drug testing of social security recipients. That measure doesn't have any support of medical, health or community organisations. The government cannot find one expert, person or group that supports the drug-testing trial. All the experts say that it won't work and completely runs counter to the evidence of what does work. The government couldn't convince the Senate crossbench of the merits of its controversial drug-testing trial, so they've taken it out of this bill. Unfortunately, they haven't got the message: they've decided to put it in a separate bill that is on for debate later this week. 


I want to go to another schedule of the bill that is also very nasty, particularly for a group of people who find it very difficult to find work in the current labour market. Schedule 9 relates to activity tests for people aged 55 to 59. Schedule 9 was intended to remove the ability of Newstart and some special benefit recipients, aged between 55 and 59, to fulfil the activity test by volunteering 30 hours a fortnight. People would need to fulfil 30 hours a fortnight of activity with voluntary work and suitable paid work. Fifteen of the 30 hours must be of paid work or approved job-search activities. As a result of this measure, the government would have seen many community groups having to cut the amount of time people can volunteer and still receive jobseeker payments. As I say, we already know how hard it is for people in this age group to find work.


The government ignored the views of volunteer organisations, who believe that this change will decimate the number of people and volunteer hours available to community organisations that help neighbourhoods right across Australia. Volunteering Australia has said that this would 'have a profound impact on the volunteering sector'. I remind all the Liberal and National party members opposite that they all voted for this change that Volunteering Australia said will have a profound impact on the sector. Volunteering Australia went on to say that this proposal 'will do little to improve the job prospects of older Australians, an already disadvantaged group in the job market'. The government hasn't provided any additional support to help Australians aged 55 to 59 to overcome the significant barriers they face in the labour market. There's overwhelming evidence, put to the Senate inquiry on this bill, that mature job seekers face significant age discrimination in the labour market and find it very hard to get back into the workforce after they've lost their jobs.


As a result of the amended schedule we've got before us, there will now be 12 months full jobseeker participation, and then people will be able to go back to the old arrangements. It shows the complete chaos of this government. They put a bill in. They've now got a 12-month arrangement. It really is not the way to do good policy.


I say to the government that this is one part of this legislation and these amendments—they might have found a short-term fix but the long-term problem still remains. I'm highlighting one of the schedules today, and I will go on to another in a moment. There are so many parts of this bill that will hurt many, many vulnerable Australians.



We will support the amendments, because they soften the blow, but I absolutely and clearly say to the House that we will continue to oppose the bill overall. The government may have made some concessions of a short-term nature, but this is a straight-up attack on vulnerable people. There might be some short-term, small backdowns in these amendments but there are certainly nowhere near enough to get us to support the bill.

"Burney, Linda, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms BURNEY
 (Barton) (12:18):  I reiterate the sentiments expressed by the member for Jagajaga about how nasty, unnecessary and discriminatory the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 is. This bill is indicative of the mindset of the government. It is out of touch, and it does not give very much consideration for those people who rely on governments for support, and for those people who rely on governments for support at the most difficult times of their lives.


In truth, this bill may have been returned amended, but it remains just as reprehensible. As the member for Jagajaga said, this bill reflects the disdain and contempt which the government holds for vulnerable Australians who rely on income support. In short, it is trying to save money—not very much money—and it doesn't seem to give a damn about people who rely on governments to speak up for them. It is a cynical exercise in politics, and I think the minister understands that.


According to the Australian Council of Social Services, this will negatively impact on at least 80,000 Australians who are out of work; single parents; and women and children, who are fleeing domestic violence. This bill completely ignores common sense and dismisses extenuating circumstances. It is simply designed to make it more difficult for Australians who find themselves in difficult and uncertain times in their lives to claim income support. The government is more concerned, as we saw this week, with a big tax cut to multimillionaires and multinationals than with our government's responsibility: protecting the most vulnerable people in the community.


I'm particularly concerned with how this bill will impact on the Human Services portfolio. In schedule 10 the bill will change the payment start date and backdating for Newstart and youth allowance. In schedule 11 the bill will cut intent-to-claim provisions which consider a person's extenuating circumstances. This is so concerning. One would think, with the debates raging about this, that the government would have a rethink. In schedule 17 the bill will also allow information obtained by DHS from claimants to be used against them in investigations and prosecutions, as the member for Jagajaga indicated. I'm very concerned about the government's axing of the bereavement allowance.


Schedule 10's proposed changes to backdating for Newstart and youth allowance are punitive and arbitrary. By moving the payment start day from initial contact to initial appointment, claimants potentially lose out on much-needed income support at very uncertain and vulnerable times in their lives. What is particularly concerning about this schedule is the impact it is going to have on rural and remote communities. They may have limited access to job providers or consideration to travel arrangements for applicants living in rural and remote communities. We know that is going to particularly affect young people in these communities. This is nothing more than a cash grab from people who are in between jobs. These changes will mean applicants need to wait longer to access income support on top of the existing one-week waiting period that applies. The implications are not just for the young people that this will apply to; there are implications for the families and for the communities that these young people reside in.


The government's removal of intent to claim is yet another cash grab. Intent to claim allows the department to deem a claimant entitled to a payment from the day of initial contact in the following circumstances: if a person lodges a claim for the payment or concession card within 14 days of initially contacting the department; if a person has a medical condition or is caring for a partner or someone suffering from a medical condition which impacted on the person's ability to lodge a claim earlier; or if the claimant was otherwise unable to lodge a claim by reason of special circumstances. These circumstances are homelessness, separation, hospitalisation, health issues or difficulty accessing technology. I understand the government introduced amendments to retain these intent-to-claim provisions for vulnerable individuals in extenuating circumstances. The truth is that there is absolutely no reason to amend the intent-to-claim provisions. Labor remains opposed to schedule 11.


As the member for Jagajaga says, we will support the amendments, but overall the bill will be opposed.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (12:23):  I'll start with a big call at the outset: if there were a competition to choose the government's nastiest, meanest bill—it is a long list to choose from—the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 would have to be near the top, if not at the top. That's coming alongside the bill to let people say more racist things—that was a good one!—the bill to give the minister for immigration the power to deport people based on the class of race and religion, the cuts to the pensioner energy supplement and so on and so forth. Another day, another attack on the most vulnerable from this government, the Prime Minister and the Liberals.


This is not the first time that we've debated this bill or these measures. It was six months ago that I and many Labor members spoke in this House when it was coupled up with some of the more outrageous proposals around the drug testing of people on welfare, which could be better named the 'drive up crime bill', as the former Australian Federal Police commissioner called it. All that bill would do is drive up crime. The government banged it through the House and took it to the Senate, and it was defeated. Those measures were quite rightly rejected by senators. Yet the government, like goldfish swimming around in a bowl, has no vision for the country and no real policy agenda, so we're back here six months on, debating the same nasty, mean little cuts. It is a nasty, mean bill. It will make life even harder for the most vulnerable Australians. The cut to 80,000 people on income support is bad enough. Social services groups have called these cuts out as worsening homelessness, which we saw in the latest census figures reach record levels across the country. We've come to expect this stuff, unfortunately, from the Liberals, but I had hoped the Senate crossbench would stick to their original position and defeat these kinds of measures.


I draw attention to and make some remarks on one particular clause in the bill, amended as a result of the Senate's work. The bill kills—pardon the pun—the bereavement allowance. It should not die without a fight. What is the bereavement allowance? It's a short-term payment to people whose partner has died. It's paid for a maximum of 14 weeks at the rate of the age pension with the same income and assets tests, so it's a well-targeted, tightly targeted payment. If you are a pregnant woman, you can stay on this payment until your pregnancy ends, until you give birth. How decent! This is not a forever payment. This is not a payment where people live their lives on welfare, as we keep hearing; this is a short-term, targeted payment. How many people does it go to? All this fuss is about cutting a payment that goes to 900 Australians every year. The government tried, by axing this payment, to push people whose partners had just died onto Newstart. Every one of those 900 people would have had $1,300 taken off them while they were grieving.


I say unashamedly that I'm proud to live in Australia, a country where we can do things like treating people decently when their partner has just died. We don't force pregnant women to go onto Newstart and go to job interviews. The government wants to chop it and pay it at a lower rate, as I said. It's absolutely pathetic. It's a mean, nasty, small little cut. It's not about fiscal repair at all. We moved amendments to this bill in the Senate to make it a bit less awful, to protect the bereavement allowance. Senator Hanson voted with the government to kill it. It is important that this point is understood because, after she did so, there was an enormous backlash on social media, so she posted stuff trying to pretend she didn't vote with the government to kill the bereavement allowance. The voting record shows she voted with the Liberal Party to kill the bereavement allowance. The 'battler's friend' is a Liberal stooge. Time after time she talks a big game in the community, whether it's on penalty rates, cuts for pensioners or whatever, but then she lines up and votes with the Liberal Party. Let there be no mistake about it.


After that ridiculous display, once she realised, 'I might have a bit of a political problem here; that's a bit much,' she introduced a series of amendments in a panicked way to pretend she had not just killed the bereavement allowance. All this legislative mess, as I said, is about saving $1,300 over 14 weeks for 900 people. Senator Hanson's amendments, which make the whole thing more complex—she could have just left the bereavement allowance there; it's well understood, well administered and well targeted—instead make things a little bit less awful for most of those 900 people but still leave an indeterminate number, maybe only 30, worse off. Why are we doing this? Why are these our priorities?

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (12:28):  I ask the minister at the table to clarify some of the issues the member for Bruce just raised. As the member for Bruce indicated, there was an absolute farce in the Senate last week, where the government went all out to kill the bereavement allowance. The Liberals, the Nationals and One Nation voted for the abolition of the bereavement allowance, Labor voted to keep the allowance, there was a tied vote, and then all the things the member for Bruce outlined followed. But what we're still not clear about—and I would ask the minister to explain it to the House before we vote on this amendment—is what the impact of the government and One Nation's change will be. How many people will actually be worse off as a result of this change? I mean worse off compared to the existing arrangements, not worse off compared to the bill that the government previously put into the House. We currently have a bereavement allowance that's paid, as the member for Bruce said, at the rate of the age pension for 14 weeks. A very limited number of people are entitled to it right now. How many people will be worse off as a result of the amendments that are before us compared to the current arrangements, and by how much? Really, the House needs to know.

 (Wannon—Minister for Social Services) (12:31):  As I've said, under the changes put forward by One Nation everyone who qualifies for bereavement allowance under the jobseeker payment will be no worse off, and some people will be better off, than under the current arrangements.


Payments are targeted to those who need them. Bereavement allowance is paid to people in lieu of work, and that is why it is exempt from normal mutual obligation tests and waiting periods. Income and assets tests only apply during the period of bereavement and are designed to assist those people who have no access to leave or other income. To be found ineligible based on the assets test, a single person needs to have assets of more than $253,750, not including the family home, if they're a homeowner, and $456,750 if they are not a homeowner. Bereavement allowance is available for people earning up to $1,053.34 per fortnight during the bereavement period. In regard to casual workers or people who have no access to leave arrangements, these people will qualify provided they do not earn over the income threshold during their bereavement period or hold assets higher than the limit. That is because these people would be with little or no income during this period due to a lack of work.

Mr TEHAN:
  What we're talking about are the people who won't qualify. Of course, as the shadow minister would know, getting exact figures on those people who would or wouldn't qualify is not easy, but on our assessment, given the income and assets tests, approximately 30 people might not qualify.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (12:34):  I spent Saturday at five street stalls, in Springvale, Noble Park, Dandenong, Dandenong North and Mulgrave. I spent an hour or more in each place talking to people. I must say, as someone who actually participates in this institution, respects it and holds it in high regard—I always have—it saddens me how little people think of us. And you wonder why so many people in Australia say they hate politicians. Well, you can't get a straight answer to a question. You duck and you weave, and you read out key messages and eventually you come out with a number of, 'Well maybe 30.' You could have just said that at the start, if these changes are going to hurt 30 people. So now what we're doing is debating an amendment to take $1300 off 30 people and pretending that is in some way welfare reform. That's your government's priority? That's welfare reform? I would have thought reform was about making something better—improving something—but instead reform now under this government has boiled down to using the House's time to take $1,300 off Australian people whose partners have just died—30 of them. That's what we're now doing. 


So we keep getting told the other reason that we have to have these kinds of bills, apparently, is because we have got a structural deficit—a debt and deficit disaster. Well, let's just read into the Hansard a few facts—the context that this bill sits in. This year's deficit has blown out by eight times. The 2017-18 deficit was $2.8 billion in the Liberal's 2014-15 budget and it's now $23.6 billion in the mid-year financial update. Net debt since this government has been elected more than doubled: net debt was $175 billion in September 2013 and was $335 billion in January 2018. Gross debt is more than half a trillion dollars, it has never been higher and it is growing with no end in sight. Both types of debt are growing faster under the Liberals than Labor. That is the context that this nasty, mean, sneaky little measure that we're standing here debating sits in. It's not too late, Minister Tehan. You could just stop this. You have the delegation; you could say: 'We'll put this debate aside. I'll go back to the government and say, ""Maybe we've got this wrong. Maybe we don't need to try to pretend we're going to fix the budget in Australia by picking on 30 vulnerable people.""' How much of a contribution do you think that's going to make to closing the debt and deficit gap? Do you think this makes any contribution in any meaningful way to budget repair or to addressing the structural deficit? Words fail me.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Social Services) (12:37):  The reason for this Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 is that we want to simplify the complexity around Newstart and other payments, and that's what we do by creating the jobseeker payment. We are bringing seven payments into one. This was what the McClure report recommended. That is what the government are doing. We want to make sure that we have a simple welfare system that is easy for people to navigate.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (12:37):  I don't think anybody in the House would argue against simplification. But to use simplification as the reason to get rid of the bereavement allowance that is currently paid—for 14 weeks or for the duration of her pregnancy, whichever is longer—to a pregnant woman who has lost her partner, as the member for Bruce says, just defies belief. It just defies belief that every member of the Liberal and National parties and One Nation voted to get rid of this bereavement allowance for these pregnant women. Anyway, we have now dragged out of the Minister for Social Services that this affects around 30 people; they don't actually know exactly how many. Can the minister confirm that these 30 people will lose the full $1,300? Is that how much worse off they'll be?

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (12:41):  I just did some maths on 30 people times $1,300—and $1,300 is actually a conservative estimate, because let's say there's a pregnant woman or two amongst those people, and it's entirely possible that pregnancy will last longer than 14 weeks under the current rules. But let's say it's $1,300. Now we're using the House's time to debate hurting people by taking $39,000. That's the annual saving to the Commonwealth budget we're now talking about. You mob have run up a deficit of $23.6 billion a year, and your answer to that is to take $39,000 a year off the most vulnerable Australians. I tried to work out what percentage that is on the iPad there. I divided $39,000 by $23.6 billion and it just says 'error'. It's too small even for the iPad to calculate.


You'd think that, if you're going to address structural deficit, you'd look at the big systemic things and cast 10 years out, wouldn't you? There are things like negative gearing, which goes overwhelmingly to the top 10 or 20 per cent of income earners and enables someone to buy their 13th investment property with a big free kick from the taxman while first home buyers are struggling to get in the market. You'd think you'd look at that. Or look at capital gains tax discounts, which overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest people in the country.


But that, I suppose, is me projecting our values onto you, because what this bill shows is that taking $39,000 from the most vulnerable Australians is your answer to the Commonwealth budget crisis. What this bill shows clearly, in stark relief, if there was any doubt, is your values. Your party exists to protect those who have wealth. Your party exists to protect those who already hold capital. If there's ever a reminder for anyone listening about what our role is as a Labor Party sticking up for the most vulnerable people in society then this bill is it. Shame on you.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (12:11):  This Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 is an extraordinary one. It contains some 17 different measures that will hurt many vulnerable Australians, people who are unemployed, single parents, and women and children escaping violence. As Ross Gittins said in an article, just today:


You've never seen such a list of pettifogging nastiness, yielding tiny savings to the budget.


From the title of the bill—'welfare reform'—you might get the false impression that this was part of some big once-in-a-generation change to our social security system. But it isn't. It's a grab bag of nasty and mean cuts that will hurt vulnerable Australians. I'm sure everyone here will remember that when this bill was introduced, in September last year, it had some even nastier measures. It initially had the government's plan to trial drug testing of social security recipients. That measure doesn't have any support of medical, health or community organisations. The government cannot find one expert, person or group that supports the drug-testing trial. All the experts say that it won't work and completely runs counter to the evidence of what does work. The government couldn't convince the Senate crossbench of the merits of its controversial drug-testing trial, so they've taken it out of this bill. Unfortunately, they haven't got the message: they've decided to put it in a separate bill that is on for debate later this week. 


I want to go to another schedule of the bill that is also very nasty, particularly for a group of people who find it very difficult to find work in the current labour market. Schedule 9 relates to activity tests for people aged 55 to 59. Schedule 9 was intended to remove the ability of Newstart and some special benefit recipients, aged between 55 and 59, to fulfil the activity test by volunteering 30 hours a fortnight. People would need to fulfil 30 hours a fortnight of activity with voluntary work and suitable paid work. Fifteen of the 30 hours must be of paid work or approved job-search activities. As a result of this measure, the government would have seen many community groups having to cut the amount of time people can volunteer and still receive jobseeker payments. As I say, we already know how hard it is for people in this age group to find work.


The government ignored the views of volunteer organisations, who believe that this change will decimate the number of people and volunteer hours available to community organisations that help neighbourhoods right across Australia. Volunteering Australia has said that this would 'have a profound impact on the volunteering sector'. I remind all the Liberal and National party members opposite that they all voted for this change that Volunteering Australia said will have a profound impact on the sector. Volunteering Australia went on to say that this proposal 'will do little to improve the job prospects of older Australians, an already disadvantaged group in the job market'. The government hasn't provided any additional support to help Australians aged 55 to 59 to overcome the significant barriers they face in the labour market. There's overwhelming evidence, put to the Senate inquiry on this bill, that mature job seekers face significant age discrimination in the labour market and find it very hard to get back into the workforce after they've lost their jobs.


As a result of the amended schedule we've got before us, there will now be 12 months full jobseeker participation, and then people will be able to go back to the old arrangements. It shows the complete chaos of this government. They put a bill in. They've now got a 12-month arrangement. It really is not the way to do good policy.


I say to the government that this is one part of this legislation and these amendments—they might have found a short-term fix but the long-term problem still remains. I'm highlighting one of the schedules today, and I will go on to another in a moment. There are so many parts of this bill that will hurt many, many vulnerable Australians.



We will support the amendments, because they soften the blow, but I absolutely and clearly say to the House that we will continue to oppose the bill overall. The government may have made some concessions of a short-term nature, but this is a straight-up attack on vulnerable people. There might be some short-term, small backdowns in these amendments but there are certainly nowhere near enough to get us to support the bill.

"Burney, Linda, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms BURNEY
 (Barton) (12:18):  I reiterate the sentiments expressed by the member for Jagajaga about how nasty, unnecessary and discriminatory the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 is. This bill is indicative of the mindset of the government. It is out of touch, and it does not give very much consideration for those people who rely on governments for support, and for those people who rely on governments for support at the most difficult times of their lives.


In truth, this bill may have been returned amended, but it remains just as reprehensible. As the member for Jagajaga said, this bill reflects the disdain and contempt which the government holds for vulnerable Australians who rely on income support. In short, it is trying to save money—not very much money—and it doesn't seem to give a damn about people who rely on governments to speak up for them. It is a cynical exercise in politics, and I think the minister understands that.


According to the Australian Council of Social Services, this will negatively impact on at least 80,000 Australians who are out of work; single parents; and women and children, who are fleeing domestic violence. This bill completely ignores common sense and dismisses extenuating circumstances. It is simply designed to make it more difficult for Australians who find themselves in difficult and uncertain times in their lives to claim income support. The government is more concerned, as we saw this week, with a big tax cut to multimillionaires and multinationals than with our government's responsibility: protecting the most vulnerable people in the community.


I'm particularly concerned with how this bill will impact on the Human Services portfolio. In schedule 10 the bill will change the payment start date and backdating for Newstart and youth allowance. In schedule 11 the bill will cut intent-to-claim provisions which consider a person's extenuating circumstances. This is so concerning. One would think, with the debates raging about this, that the government would have a rethink. In schedule 17 the bill will also allow information obtained by DHS from claimants to be used against them in investigations and prosecutions, as the member for Jagajaga indicated. I'm very concerned about the government's axing of the bereavement allowance.


Schedule 10's proposed changes to backdating for Newstart and youth allowance are punitive and arbitrary. By moving the payment start day from initial contact to initial appointment, claimants potentially lose out on much-needed income support at very uncertain and vulnerable times in their lives. What is particularly concerning about this schedule is the impact it is going to have on rural and remote communities. They may have limited access to job providers or consideration to travel arrangements for applicants living in rural and remote communities. We know that is going to particularly affect young people in these communities. This is nothing more than a cash grab from people who are in between jobs. These changes will mean applicants need to wait longer to access income support on top of the existing one-week waiting period that applies. The implications are not just for the young people that this will apply to; there are implications for the families and for the communities that these young people reside in.


The government's removal of intent to claim is yet another cash grab. Intent to claim allows the department to deem a claimant entitled to a payment from the day of initial contact in the following circumstances: if a person lodges a claim for the payment or concession card within 14 days of initially contacting the department; if a person has a medical condition or is caring for a partner or someone suffering from a medical condition which impacted on the person's ability to lodge a claim earlier; or if the claimant was otherwise unable to lodge a claim by reason of special circumstances. These circumstances are homelessness, separation, hospitalisation, health issues or difficulty accessing technology. I understand the government introduced amendments to retain these intent-to-claim provisions for vulnerable individuals in extenuating circumstances. The truth is that there is absolutely no reason to amend the intent-to-claim provisions. Labor remains opposed to schedule 11.


As the member for Jagajaga says, we will support the amendments, but overall the bill will be opposed.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (12:23):  I'll start with a big call at the outset: if there were a competition to choose the government's nastiest, meanest bill—it is a long list to choose from—the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 would have to be near the top, if not at the top. That's coming alongside the bill to let people say more racist things—that was a good one!—the bill to give the minister for immigration the power to deport people based on the class of race and religion, the cuts to the pensioner energy supplement and so on and so forth. Another day, another attack on the most vulnerable from this government, the Prime Minister and the Liberals.


This is not the first time that we've debated this bill or these measures. It was six months ago that I and many Labor members spoke in this House when it was coupled up with some of the more outrageous proposals around the drug testing of people on welfare, which could be better named the 'drive up crime bill', as the former Australian Federal Police commissioner called it. All that bill would do is drive up crime. The government banged it through the House and took it to the Senate, and it was defeated. Those measures were quite rightly rejected by senators. Yet the government, like goldfish swimming around in a bowl, has no vision for the country and no real policy agenda, so we're back here six months on, debating the same nasty, mean little cuts. It is a nasty, mean bill. It will make life even harder for the most vulnerable Australians. The cut to 80,000 people on income support is bad enough. Social services groups have called these cuts out as worsening homelessness, which we saw in the latest census figures reach record levels across the country. We've come to expect this stuff, unfortunately, from the Liberals, but I had hoped the Senate crossbench would stick to their original position and defeat these kinds of measures.


I draw attention to and make some remarks on one particular clause in the bill, amended as a result of the Senate's work. The bill kills—pardon the pun—the bereavement allowance. It should not die without a fight. What is the bereavement allowance? It's a short-term payment to people whose partner has died. It's paid for a maximum of 14 weeks at the rate of the age pension with the same income and assets tests, so it's a well-targeted, tightly targeted payment. If you are a pregnant woman, you can stay on this payment until your pregnancy ends, until you give birth. How decent! This is not a forever payment. This is not a payment where people live their lives on welfare, as we keep hearing; this is a short-term, targeted payment. How many people does it go to? All this fuss is about cutting a payment that goes to 900 Australians every year. The government tried, by axing this payment, to push people whose partners had just died onto Newstart. Every one of those 900 people would have had $1,300 taken off them while they were grieving.


I say unashamedly that I'm proud to live in Australia, a country where we can do things like treating people decently when their partner has just died. We don't force pregnant women to go onto Newstart and go to job interviews. The government wants to chop it and pay it at a lower rate, as I said. It's absolutely pathetic. It's a mean, nasty, small little cut. It's not about fiscal repair at all. We moved amendments to this bill in the Senate to make it a bit less awful, to protect the bereavement allowance. Senator Hanson voted with the government to kill it. It is important that this point is understood because, after she did so, there was an enormous backlash on social media, so she posted stuff trying to pretend she didn't vote with the government to kill the bereavement allowance. The voting record shows she voted with the Liberal Party to kill the bereavement allowance. The 'battler's friend' is a Liberal stooge. Time after time she talks a big game in the community, whether it's on penalty rates, cuts for pensioners or whatever, but then she lines up and votes with the Liberal Party. Let there be no mistake about it.


After that ridiculous display, once she realised, 'I might have a bit of a political problem here; that's a bit much,' she introduced a series of amendments in a panicked way to pretend she had not just killed the bereavement allowance. All this legislative mess, as I said, is about saving $1,300 over 14 weeks for 900 people. Senator Hanson's amendments, which make the whole thing more complex—she could have just left the bereavement allowance there; it's well understood, well administered and well targeted—instead make things a little bit less awful for most of those 900 people but still leave an indeterminate number, maybe only 30, worse off. Why are we doing this? Why are these our priorities?

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (12:28):  I ask the minister at the table to clarify some of the issues the member for Bruce just raised. As the member for Bruce indicated, there was an absolute farce in the Senate last week, where the government went all out to kill the bereavement allowance. The Liberals, the Nationals and One Nation voted for the abolition of the bereavement allowance, Labor voted to keep the allowance, there was a tied vote, and then all the things the member for Bruce outlined followed. But what we're still not clear about—and I would ask the minister to explain it to the House before we vote on this amendment—is what the impact of the government and One Nation's change will be. How many people will actually be worse off as a result of this change? I mean worse off compared to the existing arrangements, not worse off compared to the bill that the government previously put into the House. We currently have a bereavement allowance that's paid, as the member for Bruce said, at the rate of the age pension for 14 weeks. A very limited number of people are entitled to it right now. How many people will be worse off as a result of the amendments that are before us compared to the current arrangements, and by how much? Really, the House needs to know.

Payments are targeted to those who need them. Bereavement allowance is paid to people in lieu of work, and that is why it is exempt from normal mutual obligation tests and waiting periods. Income and assets tests only apply during the period of bereavement and are designed to assist those people who have no access to leave or other income. To be found ineligible based on the assets test, a single person needs to have assets of more than $253,750, not including the family home, if they're a homeowner, and $456,750 if they are not a homeowner. Bereavement allowance is available for people earning up to $1,053.34 per fortnight during the bereavement period. In regard to casual workers or people who have no access to leave arrangements, these people will qualify provided they do not earn over the income threshold during their bereavement period or hold assets higher than the limit. That is because these people would be with little or no income during this period due to a lack of work.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (12:34):  I spent Saturday at five street stalls, in Springvale, Noble Park, Dandenong, Dandenong North and Mulgrave. I spent an hour or more in each place talking to people. I must say, as someone who actually participates in this institution, respects it and holds it in high regard—I always have—it saddens me how little people think of us. And you wonder why so many people in Australia say they hate politicians. Well, you can't get a straight answer to a question. You duck and you weave, and you read out key messages and eventually you come out with a number of, 'Well maybe 30.' You could have just said that at the start, if these changes are going to hurt 30 people. So now what we're doing is debating an amendment to take $1300 off 30 people and pretending that is in some way welfare reform. That's your government's priority? That's welfare reform? I would have thought reform was about making something better—improving something—but instead reform now under this government has boiled down to using the House's time to take $1,300 off Australian people whose partners have just died—30 of them. That's what we're now doing. 


So we keep getting told the other reason that we have to have these kinds of bills, apparently, is because we have got a structural deficit—a debt and deficit disaster. Well, let's just read into the Hansard a few facts—the context that this bill sits in. This year's deficit has blown out by eight times. The 2017-18 deficit was $2.8 billion in the Liberal's 2014-15 budget and it's now $23.6 billion in the mid-year financial update. Net debt since this government has been elected more than doubled: net debt was $175 billion in September 2013 and was $335 billion in January 2018. Gross debt is more than half a trillion dollars, it has never been higher and it is growing with no end in sight. Both types of debt are growing faster under the Liberals than Labor. That is the context that this nasty, mean, sneaky little measure that we're standing here debating sits in. It's not too late, Minister Tehan. You could just stop this. You have the delegation; you could say: 'We'll put this debate aside. I'll go back to the government and say, ""Maybe we've got this wrong. Maybe we don't need to try to pretend we're going to fix the budget in Australia by picking on 30 vulnerable people.""' How much of a contribution do you think that's going to make to closing the debt and deficit gap? Do you think this makes any contribution in any meaningful way to budget repair or to addressing the structural deficit? Words fail me.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Social Services) (12:37):  The reason for this Social Services Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform) Bill 2017 is that we want to simplify the complexity around Newstart and other payments, and that's what we do by creating the jobseeker payment. We are bringing seven payments into one. This was what the McClure report recommended. That is what the government are doing. We want to make sure that we have a simple welfare system that is easy for people to navigate.

Ms MACKLIN

But to use simplification as the reason to get rid of the bereavement allowance that is currently paid—for 14 weeks or for the duration of her pregnancy, whichever is longer—to a pregnant woman who has lost her partner, as the member for Bruce says, just defies belief. It just defies belief that every member of the Liberal and National parties and One Nation voted to get rid of this bereavement allowance for these pregnant women. Anyway, we have now dragged out of the Minister for Social Services that this affects around 30 people; they don't actually know exactly how many. Can the minister confirm that these 30 people will lose the full $1,300? Is that how much worse off they'll be?

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (12:41):  I just did some maths on 30 people times $1,300—and $1,300 is actually a conservative estimate, because let's say there's a pregnant woman or two amongst those people, and it's entirely possible that pregnancy will last longer than 14 weeks under the current rules. But let's say it's $1,300. Now we're using the House's time to debate hurting people by taking $39,000. That's the annual saving to the Commonwealth budget we're now talking about. You mob have run up a deficit of $23.6 billion a year, and your answer to that is to take $39,000 a year off the most vulnerable Australians. I tried to work out what percentage that is on the iPad there. I divided $39,000 by $23.6 billion and it just says 'error'. It's too small even for the iPad to calculate.


You'd think that, if you're going to address structural deficit, you'd look at the big systemic things and cast 10 years out, wouldn't you? There are things like negative gearing, which goes overwhelmingly to the top 10 or 20 per cent of income earners and enables someone to buy their 13th investment property with a big free kick from the taxman while first home buyers are struggling to get in the market. You'd think you'd look at that. Or look at capital gains tax discounts, which overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest people in the country.


But that, I suppose, is me projecting our values onto you, because what this bill shows is that taking $39,000 from the most vulnerable Australians is your answer to the Commonwealth budget crisis. What this bill shows clearly, in stark relief, if there was any doubt, is your values. Your party exists to protect those who have wealth. Your party exists to protect those who already hold capital. If there's ever a reminder for anyone listening about what our role is as a Labor Party sticking up for the most vulnerable people in society then this bill is it. Shame on you.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:45):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report entitled Report 470: Defence sustainment expenditure.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Ms BRODTMANN:
  by leave—Some would say I have a rather unhealthy obsession with the sustainment of defence capability. Prior to becoming the member for Canberra, I worked in the Defence Materiel Organisation for nearly 10 years, got a very clear understanding of the acquisition process and tried to get a clear understanding of the sustainment process that supports our defence capability. Given the lack of clarity and transparency around sustainment, I decided that when I became a member for Canberra I would pursue the Holy Grail of trying to get greater clarity and transparency around the sustainment of our defence capability, with a view to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the sustainment of our defence capability.


The reason I have had this unhealthy obsession for quite some time, probably nearly two decades now, is that this is a significant Defence spend. For 2017-18, the spend on acquiring defence capability was $11 billion. For 2018-19, acquiring defence capability will go up to nearly $13 billion, for 2019-20 it will go up to $14 billion and in 2020-21 it will go up to nearly $16 billion—that's for the acquisition of defence capability. The reason I have such a strong interest in improving the transparency and clarity around sustainment of our defence capability, as much as our acquisition of defence capability, is the following figures. In 2017-18, nearly $9.5 billion will be spent on the sustainment of our defence capability. In 2018-19, it will be nearly $10 billion; in 2019-20, it will be nearly $11 billion; and, in 2020-21, we're looking at $11.5 billion.


The percentage of sustainment to the acquisition budget will be, in this financial year, 82 per cent; in 2018-19, 77 per cent; in 2019-20, 77 per cent; and, in 2020-21, 72 per cent. So we are talking big dollars here being spent on the sustainment of our defence capability. There are big dollars spent on the acquisition and there are big dollars spent on supporting our defence capability—our ships, our planes and our tanks. Lots of money is spent in these areas, in both acquiring and sustaining capability.


For those who are listening, I think it's probably worthwhile to outline what sustainment actually is. Defence defines it as:


The provision of the appropriate goods and services required to achieve readiness and sustainability goals for the life of the Defence Element.


In plain English, that is capability capacity. The report says:


Defence Sustainment involves the provision of in service support, including repair and maintenance, engineering, supply and replacement parts, configuration management and disposal action.


Also, it's not just the support and the disposal of that capability.


Sustainment can apply to platforms such (ships, aircraft, vehicle fleets), commodities (clothing, combat rations, munitions) or services (calibration, provision of maritime target ranges).


It's across a very broad range of areas, and it is, as I said, a very significant sum of money from the Defence budget that's being spent each year.


In 2015, when reviewing the Defence major projects report, the committee noted the size of sustainment expenditure at $5 billion per annum and recommended that, following the implementation of the Department of Defence's First principles review, the department improve how it reports on sustainment. In November 2016 the committee readopted a lapsed inquiry into Defence sustainment expenditure and on 21 June 2017 resolved to inquire into this area also, hence this report.


The sustainment budget, as I said, is expected to grow year-on-year across the forward estimates to over $11.5 billion in 2020-21 and the percentage of that budget over the course of the forward estimates will average 77 per cent. This is a significant amount of expenditure and further work is needed to improve the transparency of sustainment reporting both to the public and to the parliament. This has been my mission since I have been the member for Canberra.


Compared to the level of reporting across any level on acquisition in the Defence major projects report, we are underdone when it comes to actually taking a close look at sustainment spending. We've got the projects of concern, we've got the projects of interest and we've got the Defence major projects report, which is an incredibly comprehensive document. The committee had a close look at that last Friday. But the level of transparency that is applied to acquisition is certainly not applied to sustainment.


Having been on this case for some time, I know that there are sensitivities. I know that the chiefs of the services have concerns about sensitivities around sustainment. I understand those concerns and I respect those concerns. I respect the fact that by taking a close look at sustainment we do not in any way want to give away what's actually happening on deployments or operations. I do not want the operational capability or the operational sensitivity to be compromised in any way. What I want is to ensure that the Australian taxpayer dollar is being spent efficiently and effectively, which is why I have been on this mission on sustainment reporting.


As I said, we've been trying to get greater transparency around sustainment for some time. We are getting it gradually, and this report is just another effort towards trying to improve the transparency around that issue. It's going to be an iterative process and it's going to be a slow process; it's probably going to move at a glacial pace. But I'm pleased to report to the Australian people that we are actually getting some traction on this. We have actually improved the transparency on it, but it will take time. And it will certainly take time, a long time, before it gets to the level that I would like to see it at.


We made a number of recommendations, particularly on getting a clear read across reporting documents. We made recommendations that Defence can improve on getting a clear read—getting a clear understanding of what is actually going on. For the record, I will outline here that a clear read means that:


… the objectives for each project should be clearly stated at the start of the year and achievements against those objectives are reported at the end of the year.


It ensures that there is consistency across all the public reporting statements. We've suggested that Defence improve the clear read on sustainment. We have also recommended


… that the Department of Defence consolidate information extracted from its Corporate Plan, Portfolio Budget Statements, Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements and Annual Report in one place online in a format that allows for clear and easy scrutiny of sustainment expenditure.


We made some recommendations on the Defence annual report, and we recommended:


… that within six months of the tabling of this report the Department of Defence provide to the Committee:


a report on progress in driving First Principles Review reforms


detail of the positive changes that have been realised to date with the implementation of the First Principles Review


an update on the progress of the Systems Program Offices review


a report on progress of the whole-of-life costing model


a report on progress to selecting a candidate to run the Major Projects Office.


There was a concern that Bechtel had been engaged to provide those services, and we were assured Defence was now undertaking a competitive process to find a suitable candidate to run the major projects office. The committee, as I said, has made a recommendation on that. We also recommended:


… that the Auditor-General consider reviewing the Department of Defence's new Monthly Reporting system …


and:


… that the Department of Defence provide a detailed progress report on behavioural changes that have accompanied improvements in internal performance reporting within six months …


They're the recommendations in a nutshell.


In closing I thank the committee for the work that they did in compiling this report. I thank the committee secretariat. I also thank the Department of Defence and the ANAO for their contributions to this inquiry. It is an important contribution. As I said, it is proceeding at a glacial pace, but we are gradually moving towards greater transparency and clarity on sustainment, and I say we bring it on sooner rather than later.

… that the Department of Defence consolidate information extracted from its Corporate Plan, Portfolio Budget Statements, Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements and Annual Report in one place online in a format that allows for clear and easy scrutiny of sustainment expenditure.


We made some recommendations on the Defence annual report, and we recommended:


… that within six months of the tabling of this report the Department of Defence provide to the Committee:


a report on progress in driving First Principles Review reforms


detail of the positive changes that have been realised to date with the implementation of the First Principles Review


an update on the progress of the Systems Program Offices review


a report on progress of the whole-of-life costing model


a report on progress to selecting a candidate to run the Major Projects Office.


There was a concern that Bechtel had been engaged to provide those services, and we were assured Defence was now undertaking a competitive process to find a suitable candidate to run the major projects office. The committee, as I said, has made a recommendation on that. We also recommended:


… that the Auditor-General consider reviewing the Department of Defence's new Monthly Reporting system …


and:


… that the Department of Defence provide a detailed progress report on behavioural changes that have accompanied improvements in internal performance reporting within six months …


They're the recommendations in a nutshell.


In closing I thank the committee for the work that they did in compiling this report. I thank the committee secretariat. I also thank the Department of Defence and the ANAO for their contributions to this inquiry. It is an important contribution. As I said, it is proceeding at a glacial pace, but we are gradually moving towards greater transparency and clarity on sustainment, and I say we bring it on sooner rather than later.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (13:13):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. This is an unfair bill which attacks students and puts up further barriers to getting a university education in this country. It's not driven by reform principles; it's merely an attempt by the government to make budget savings. Consequently, I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""the House declines to give the bill a second reading because it attacks students and would undermine the fairness of Australia's world-class student loans scheme"".


This bill is yet another example of the Liberals' war on young people. Since they came to office, we've seen repeated attacks on universities and students through funding cuts and attempts to increase fees. It's always been part of the Liberals' agenda: cut unis and make students pay more. If it weren't for the strong opposition of Labor and the crossbench, as well as the community across this country, we would already have $100,000 degrees and real interest applied on student loans. This bill is yet another example of how the government is going after students.


The changes to HELP are part of the government's mid-year economic and fiscal outlook package of cuts announced in December. Unable to get their third higher education package of cuts through the parliament, the minister and the government resorted to a grants freeze as well as changes to the HELP income-contingent loan scheme. This sneaky, reckless, backdoor cut will see $2.2 billion ripped from higher education funding. According to Labor's analysis, this means $60 million from the ACT, $736 million from New South Wales, $15 million from the Northern Territory, $436 million from my state of Queensland, $160 million from South Australia, $58 million from Tasmania, $572 million from Victoria and $208 million from Western Australia. The greatest tragedy is that the cuts will effectively kill the demand-driven system in this country. Universities Australia say that because of the cuts almost 10,000 places will be underfunded this year alone. This means nearly 10,000 Australian students could miss out on their dream of getting a university degree. These cuts will particularly hurt in the outer suburbs of Perth and Brisbane and in Central Queensland, outer Melbourne and Western Sydney.


This bill proposes to enshrine the government's MYEFO attack on students. It would lower the HELP repayment threshold to $45,000 and change the way that repayment thresholds are indexed in the future. It's all designed to find savings in the budget and help the Liberals pay for their extraordinary $65 billion in tax cuts for the big end of town and the big banks. It's simply a recycling of their plans from last year, albeit with a slightly higher rate than the $42,000 rate previously proposed for the commencement of HECS repayments. Labor believes this new rate is still too low. It's still only around $9,000 more than the minimum wage. Very little work has been done on how the new payment thresholds intersect with the tax or social security systems. Young people are already faced with a range of pressures: an increasingly out-of-touch housing market; cuts to penalty rates; tax increases from this government and, in parts of the country, very high rates of youth unemployment. This bill adds to the Liberals' attack on young people.


In rising to speak on this bill, I want to congratulate Labor senators for their work on the recent inquiry on this bill, led by senators Jacinta Collins and Deb O'Neill. I'm glad Labor's senators showed up—there wasn't anyone from the Greens or the Senate crossbench there to defend Australian students. I know that, at least, the Greens party contributed a dissenting report. If you look at the inquiry transcripts, submissions and reports, it's pretty clear that there is very little support in the community for this bill.


I want to particularly congratulate the new president of the National Union of Students, Mr Mark Pace, for his contribution. Mr Pace said that recent data from the NUS and from Universities Australia on student finances found that two-thirds of Australian students lived below the Henderson poverty line and one in five students would regularly skip meals. Under the proposed new HELP repayment threshold in this bill, many students would have to start paying their higher education income-contingent loans back before they even graduate—that's income-contingent loans. How does this new threshold reflect private benefit from higher education when it's barely above the minimum wage?


The government should also note that its changes to the HELP repayments would disproportionately impact women. The government has not put enough thought into this point. Sixty per cent of all Australians with a HELP debt are women, and two-thirds of the Australians affected by the new arrangements will be women.


It was Labor that created Australia's world-class income contingent loan scheme. It was first called HECS, of course, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, and was introduced by the reforming Labor minister for education Minister John Dawkins in 1989 and designed by Professor Bruce Chapman. It was introduced in order to fund a major expansion of the higher education system. When we introduced it, we said that it was fair that students who receive a private benefit from a university qualification should make a contribution to the costs of higher education. These changes were a result of a number of years of policy development and consultation. But how could you say that the private benefit of higher education is reached when you're earning only $9,000 more than the minimum wage? This new repayment threshold is a nonsense.


Unlike the Liberals, Labor has a proud record of higher education reform. It was Labor that moved Australia's higher education system from a small elitist model to the broad high-participation model that we have in this country today. One of the greatest achievements of Labor's last period in office was our further opening up of the higher education system in this country. In fact, and as Universities Australia has recently noted, it has been HECS, now HELP, in conjunction with Labor's demand-driven funding and equity and participation scheme, that has been responsible for low-socioeconomic status undergraduate student enrolments increasing by 55 per cent, from 90,467 in 2008 to 140,462 in 2016. Indigenous undergraduate student enrolments have increased from 7,038 in 2008 to 12,320 in 2016, a growth of 89 per cent. Enrolments of undergraduates with a disability have more than doubled from 24,311 in 2008 to 50,206. And enrolments of students from regional and remote areas have increased from 110,124 in 2008 to 163,292 in 2016, that's a growth of 48 per cent.


The MYEFO decision to kill off the demand-driven system will put a handbrake on opportunity in this country. A substantial amount of the enrolment growth in higher education has come from students who are first in their family to attend university, just like I was. Killing off the demand-driven system will have only a modest impact on the wealthy parts of Australia but it will hit the suburbs and regions hard, because that's where we've seen the biggest growth in university enrolments. This measure will kill aspiration.


The second proposal in this bill is to introduce a loan limit on how much students can borrow under HELP. Currently, students enrolled in Commonwealth supported places have no limit to the amount they can defer through the HELP scheme. There are restrictions on the amounts that students can borrow for full-fee places. The proposal in this bill would create a borrowing limit across all of the HELP programs—the VET Student Loans scheme, HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP. While Labor is not unsupportive of loan limits operating as price signals—it's something that we committed to doing in the VET Student Loans space at the last election—we believe that the proposal in this bill would have too many unintended consequences.


In a period of rapid change, we need to accept that more and more students will want to take on additional study throughout their lives. Lifelong learning is important, given the particular changes that we are facing in the nature of work and the nature of our economy. That's why Labor supports a system where students can defer the cost of further study, be it postgraduate or vocational. As our system becomes more dynamic and responsive to the changing needs of the labour market, more students will need to take various courses throughout their lives. They will need a menu of options—vocational education as well as higher education—throughout their working lives. We can't simply assume the old linear way our post-secondary education system operates will continue to serve us into the future.


The proposal for a one-off borrowing limit in this bill is clearly inadequate. Even the government senators recommended an amendment to this particular change. Labor wants to see a more dynamic model, which is better designed to support lifelong learning needs, which our economy needs.


Looking at the system of fees and loans in this country provides a timely reminder of the rising costs of getting a university education in Australia. Australian students already make the sixth-highest contribution to the cost of their degrees, as compared with other OECD economies. There are many full-fee courses that already go beyond the current FEE-HELP limits, and there are dozens of courses where students already pay more than $100,000. Many of the students enrolled in these courses have to ask their families for assistance to meet the fee loan gap. It's simply not good enough.


As we have seen before, loan limits can act as an incentive for providers to set their fees in line with the maximum borrowing limit. Labor doesn't want to see the rise of commercial, American-style student loans in this country. This bill does nothing to address some of the recklessly high fee-setting that goes on. While a loan limit would help the government with its budget, it doesn't do anything to ensure that students can get the support that they need for affordable education, both after school and across their working lives.


The jobs of the future will, of course, be very different from the jobs of today. With everybody living longer, we can expect people to have large numbers of career changes throughout their working lives. With economic transitions happening, that will also mean people being displaced from old occupations are needing to skill up for new jobs.


Young people born today will enter the workforce in 2040. We must ensure that we have a post-secondary education system that is fit for purpose. That's why I was delighted to join with our shadow minister for education and training and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Tanya Plibersek, and the shadow minister for skills, TAFE and apprenticeships, Senator Doug Cameron, in announcing that Labor, in government, would undertake a once-in-a-generation inquiry into Australia's post-secondary education system.


The time for an inquiry has come. It's been 44 years since the last major vocational education and training inquiry in this country. There's never been a full—holistic—whole-of-post-secondary inquiry in this country. We've certainly had a lot of inquiries in respect to higher education. We need to look at all of post-secondary education, collectively, so that we can see what we need to do to make it fit for purpose. As issues from the debate on this bill remind us, we need a system that supports lifelong learning. We also need a system that has a strong, vibrant public TAFE at the centre of our vocational offering and we need to ensure that we have a system where all students are treated equitably. 


I want an Australia where a poor kid is as likely to go to university as a rich kid. I also want an Australia where a rich kid is as likely to choose TAFE as a poor kid. We need to have a system where we have high-quality, high-status educational offerings in both vocational and higher education. This bill does nothing to set up Australia for the challenges and opportunities of the future. As the Mitchell Institute has said, a majority of jobs in 2020 will require a post-secondary qualification. We need to boost investment in TAFE and university to ensure that we don't get left behind in the Asian century. We can't continue to go down a path of moving more and more of the cost of education onto the student. Deputy Speaker, I know that you are well aware of this and that you have a lot of students in your electorate who have high debts already. 


This government, since it was elected back in 2013, has been trying to find ways to increase the debt that people carry in response to getting a higher education qualification. One of the first things this government did, after getting elected in 2013, was seek to bring in a package of 20 per cent public funding cuts for universities and full deregulation of fees for university degrees. The community, the opposition and the crossbench were able to defeat these attempts by the government to cut public funding and increase fees. 


The next package, of course, you'd be aware, defeated more recently, was a 7½ per cent fee increase for students, a commensurate cut to public funding for higher education, then a further cut to public funding for higher education to increase the proportion borne by students, in terms of their own private debt and, of course, the reduction of the HECS-HELP repayment threshold in that legislation. The parliament fought off these changes, the community fought off these changes, and they were successfully defeated. 


But now we're seeing this round of cuts. The government has bypassed the parliament. They couldn't be under any doubt about the parliament's view of their attempts to cut funding to higher education, yet that's what they're doing in this bill. They're doing it administratively, through freezes announced at MYEFO. It's $2.2 billion worth of cuts to higher education and, as I said, the measures in this bill accompanied those announcements. We can't have a situation where university gets further out of reach, where there's a failure to invest properly in TAFE and where students are left in more and more debt in order to get a higher education, particularly given most jobs in the future will need post-secondary education qualifications. The entire approach of this government to higher and vocational education in this country is wrong. It's why we oppose the government's reckless MYEFO cuts and why we oppose this unfair bill.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson) (13:30):  I congratulate you on your new role, Deputy Speaker. Last week, the government completed what has been a four-year process in the largest removal of area under conservation that any government has been involved in anywhere. Some people have reported this as the largest reduction in marine conservation. There is no government in the world that has taken as much area out of conservation—on land or sea—as this government has just done. 


Australia has gone from being a world leader in ocean protection to being the worst in the world when it comes to removing areas from conservation. The process began under the Abbott government, and it was completed last week under the Turnbull government. The two arguments given as to why they wanted to make this change were that there had not been enough consultation and that Labor's plan had not been based on sound science. Yet their own hand-picked panel found that the science on which it was based was a sound basis and drew upon the best available information. And, when they consulted with people, they reported back that there was consultation fatigue because there had been so much consultation. Be in no doubt: this is a direct attack from this government on the future health of the oceans around Australia. The health of the Coral Sea—the cradle to the Great Barrier Reef—and the resilience of our oceans are directly threatened by this government. (Time expired)

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (15:24):  by leave—On 6 March at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, I signed a maritime boundary treaty with Timor-Leste, on behalf of the Australian government.


The treaty is an historic achievement for Australia and Timor-Leste. We have settled a long-running dispute, established permanent maritime boundaries, and laid the foundation for a new chapter in our relationship with one of our closest neighbours.


The treaty is also a landmark for international law and the rules based order. It was the result of the first ever compulsory conciliation under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, known as UNCLOS. 


It is an example of the value and importance of international law in resolving disputes and disagreements between states through peaceful negotiation. As we said in Australia's Foreign policy white paper released last year, Australia believes the international rules-based order is fundamental to our collective security and prosperity.


I signed the treaty alongside Timor-Leste's Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister for Delimitation of Borders, His Excellency Mr Hermenegildo, or Agio, Pereira. The United Nations Secretary General, His Excellency Mr Antonio Guterres, and the Chair of the United Nations Conciliation Commission, His Excellency Mr Peter Taksoe-Jensen, witnessed the treaty signing.


The Secretary-General's presence reflected the treaty's significance, both for our countries and for international law. Mr Guterres congratulated Australia and Timor-Leste for their constructive engagement in a ground-breaking conciliation. 


Both countries demonstrated goodwill and preparedness to compromise during negotiations. The parties, and the independent conciliation commission, recognise the outcome is fair, balanced and consistent with international law.


The government has always ensured that the interests of Australia, Timor-Leste, and commercial partners are protected with respect to arrangements before the conciliation began and after it commenced.


I had the pleasure of hosting senior members of the Timor-Leste government and negotiating team, members of the commission, and representatives from the Greater Sunrise Joint Venture companies at a reception held on 31 January in Sydney.


In my public and private remarks to these stakeholders, I reassured them of our sincerity and desire to conclude a boundary agreement and a framework to develop Greater Sunrise in a manner which promotes the interests of all parties.


The treaty provides for both countries to jointly develop the Greater Sunrise gas fields and share in the benefits. This recognises both Australia and Timor-Leste have legitimate sovereign rights as coastal states under UNCLOS. 


The conciliation commission worked extensively with the parties to broker a way forward on Greater Sunrise. We recognise that developing this resource will deliver significant benefits to Timor-Leste in particular. We look forward to collaborating with Timor-Leste as it works with the joint venture companies to find a commercially viable pathway to develop Greater Sunrise.


Australia consulted closely with companies that have offshore petroleum investments in the Timor Sea in the lead-up to signing the treaty. The treaty's transitional arrangements will ensure certainty and security for stakeholders. The government will continue to consult with these companies to give effect to transitional arrangements and as we develop implementing legislation for the treaty. 


The conciliation that led to our treaty under UNCLOS's dispute resolution procedures was the first of its kind. As two democratic nations and close neighbours, our joint success through the conciliation sets a positive example for the region and the international community. 


The independent conciliation commission played a vital role in supporting the negotiation of the treaty. Timor-Leste and Australia each selected two conciliation commissioners and the commissioners selected the chair. As eminent diplomats, legal scholars and jurists, the commissioners played an objective, forthright and rigorously independent role. 


The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague supported the conciliation commission, reinforcing its important role of the international legal framework to help states resolve disputes. The commission also drew on its own independent technical advice regarding the development options for Greater Sunrise. 


Australia will continue to be a staunch supporter of international law, including UNCLOS and its dispute settlement processes.


Australia has an enduring interest in a stable and prosperous Timor-Leste, and the treaty opens a new chapter in our relations. As good friends and close neighbours, we support Timor-Leste's aspiration to achieve its economic potential. We have historical and geographical ties, and deep people-to-people links, which we will continue to nurture. We will continue our support for Timor-Leste's economic and human development.


While the treaty will benefit both countries, we recognise in particular its significance for Timor-Leste. The government will work to bring this treaty into force, including by preparing implementing legislation and working with Timor-Leste and the joint venture companies on transitional arrangements. The government aims to introduce the bill later this year, following review of the treaty by parliament and its committees.


I hereby table the maritime boundary treaty with Timor-Leste. I also table a copy of my ministerial statement.


I now turn to the tabling of two historic trade deals: the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP-11; and the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement, along with the accompanying national interest analyses for consideration by the parliament.


The TPP-11 is a very significant trade agreement which includes Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam. Remarkably, the market access commitments made under the original deal which included the United States have been honoured by all TPP-11 members, and will apply among TPP-11 members.


With elimination of 98 per cent of tariffs in the TPP-11 bloc, the agreement will provide preferential access for more than A$5.5 billion of Australia's dutiable agricultural exports to TPP-11 countries. This includes expanding opportunities for industries such as beef, dairy, sugar, rice, grains, seafood, horticulture and wine. The deal will also afford new levels of market access for iron and steel products, ships, pharmaceuticals, machinery, paper and auto parts, to name but a few.


Secondly, the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement, or PAFTA, complements the TPP-11. As one of the fastest-growing countries in Latin America, and with a GDP similar to the size of Vietnam, Peru represents a largely untapped market for our exporters.


Under PAFTA, Peru will eliminate tariffs on 93.5 per cent of Australian goods on entry into force of the agreement and on 99.4 per cent of Australian goods within five years.


The tabling of these two agreements today is evidence that the Turnbull government is delivering on its ambitious trade and economic agenda to secure the prosperity of all Australians.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:32):  The opposition warmly welcomes the tabling of the Treaty Between Australia and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste Establishing Their Maritime Boundaries in the Timor Sea. This treaty establishes a maritime boundary in the Timor Sea that settles more than 40 years of uncertainty over our shared maritime border.


The resolution of this dispute with Timor-Leste vindicates the strong position taken by Labor two years ago, when I urged a speedy resolution to this matter. As I said to the National Press Club in February 2016:


If we want to insist that other nations play by the rules, we also need to adhere to them.


Australia has a good record of acting in defence of this system, but not a flawless one.


Timor-Leste suffered decades of war and starvation before gaining independence. Australia played a key role in securing that independence …


It was a proud moment for many Australians, and I should mention now the role of the member for Solomon in that proud time for Australia. I also said in February 2016:


The maritime boundary dispute has poisoned relations with our newest neighbour.


This must change.


For their sake, and for ours.


The dispute put a strain on our bilateral relationship with Timor-Leste that was as unnecessary as it was prolonged. Labor also acknowledges that this treaty is a landmark with respect to both compulsory conciliation under the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention and the effectiveness of the rules based system under which the international community operates. Labor has long been committed to multilateralism and a rules based international system. We are strongly of the view that all nations benefit from acting in accordance with international norms.


Labor congratulates the independent conciliation commission on its work in bringing this matter to a successful conclusion. It's a reassuring development that the work of the conciliation commission was supported by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. With our strong emphasis on constructive internationalism, Labor has long sought to draw upon the technical, scientific and legal skills of experts to provide objectivity to the resolution of such disputes.


Now, of course, we need to proceed with the business of developing the Greater Sunrise gas field to the benefit of both Timor-Leste and Australia. The maritime boundary treaty is a necessary first step because it settles any uncertainty concerning the rights of both Timor-Leste and Australia as coastal states. The task now is for the joint venture companies to chart a commercially viable course to the development of Greater Sunrise and the exploitation of gas reserves in a way that is economically and environmentally efficient. Labor's pleased that the treaty's transitional arrangements will provide certainty and security to the stakeholders. It is important that the joint venture partners continue their consultations with the government as legislation to implement this treaty is prepared


Turning now to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. As the opposition leader has previously said, if this agreement is good for jobs and good for Australia, then we'll support it. But, of course, this is a different agreement to the one signed in New Zealand in 2016. It has a new name: the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. It no longer has the TPP's largest signatory, the United States. It now captures just 13.5 per cent of the world's GDP and 15.3 per cent of world trade. The previous agreement, including the United States, captured 40 per cent of the world's GDP. The new agreement also suspends a number of articles of the original Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, in particular some of the more contentious clauses negotiated by the United States, such as those covering biologics and copyright. It also includes a number of new side letters. I note, for example, that New Zealand was able to secure side letters with Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Peru and Vietnam, which mean that compulsory ISDS will not apply between New Zealand and these countries.


The agreement will be considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which will invite written submissions, hold public hearings and consult with stakeholder groups. It will make a report to the parliament as to whether this agreement is in Australia's best interests. We on this side of the chamber look forward to participating in that work. We note the increase in market access for Australian farmers—for example, beef, cheese, rice and sugar into Japan, and rice and beef into Mexico. I hope that the elimination of 98 per cent of tariffs in the CPTPP region will lead to more Australian exports and more Australian jobs.


There are things in this agreement that Labor would not have agreed to. We would not have agreed to waive labour market testing for six countries, which would allow companies to bring in workers from overseas before checking if there is an Australian who can do the job. Labor doesn't believe that's fair and will seek to fix this in government. Labor also does not support the inclusion of ISDS provisions and would not seek to include them if we were in government. We would have also submitted the entire agreement to independent modelling, so that the public, the parliament and the committee would have been properly able to understand what impact this agreement will have. The government hasn't done this, despite its being recommended by the Australian chamber of commerce, the government's own Harper review and the Productivity Commission, as well as Liberal Party members of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. If we want to build public confidence in trade, we can't rely on rhetoric. We actually have to provide evidence that agreements like this one will benefit Australian workers by creating jobs and benefit Australian consumers by lowering the cost of goods.


We're also concerned that there's been no independent analysis undertaken of the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement. Labor would do that; we will do it. We urge the government to do it for this and for other future trade deals. Peru is currently Australia's 53rd-largest trading partner. I went to Peru at the beginning of 2017, and I very much enjoyed my trip there. I think there's great capacity for closer relations between our nations.


Labor supports high-quality trade deals that benefit Australian workers, farmers and businesses. Australia is a trading nation, and we hope that this agreement will lead to more Australian jobs and to more Australian exports.

Mr HASTIE
 (Canning) (15:40):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's advisory report on the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr HASTIE:
  by leave—I'm pleased to present the committee's advisory report on the Security of Critical Infrastructure Bill 2017.


The bill introduces new measures to protect Australia's critical infrastructure from threats of sabotage, espionage and coercion.


The security of critical infrastructure is essential to the effective functioning of Australian society and provides continuous access to essential services for everyday life such as water, energy and communications.


The bill will establish two key measures—a register of critical infrastructure assets and a ministerial directions power.


The register will enhance Australia's capability to understand exactly who owns, controls and has access to our critical infrastructure.


The directions power will enable a minister to issue a direction where existing mechanisms and cooperation cannot be used to mitigate national security risks.


The committee has made 10 recommendations in its report. These recommendations focus on providing greater clarity to the public about the operation of the bill.


The committee has recommended that the Department of Home Affairs review and develop measures to protect Australia's fuel supply from national security threats. Australia's fuel industry is nationally significant. Ensuring fuel supply and stock is crucial both to our defence and our domestic economy. The committee's recommendation will ensure that supply chain vulnerabilities in the fuel industry are identified and protected.


To ensure the smooth implementation of the scheme, the committee has recommended the development of guidelines. These guidelines will be vital for owners and operators to understand their reporting obligations and the risk assessment process.


In the interests of preserving data integrity, the committee has also recommended that the Department of Home Affairs examine the viability of developing a common data entry portal for use across Commonwealth, state and territory databases.


The committee seeks to ensure that the face of the legislation and its accompanying explanatory material clearly reflects the intent of the bill. The committee has recommended amending the bill's definition of 'direct interest holder'. Similarly, the committee has recommended that the explanatory memorandum to the bill should clarify that the bill does not affect the operation of existing privacy obligations.


The committee considered strengthening the bill's information-sharing provisions to ensure greater transparency of decision-making. The committee has recommended that the explanatory memorandum to the bill clarify the factors that the secretary must take into account when exercising discretion to disclose protected information.


The committee compared the bill to the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2017. In August of last year, I presented the committee's advisory report on that legislation to this House.


The committee considered evidence from the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The committee has recommended that a person must be notified if they are the subject of an adverse security assessment under the bill.


The recent telecommunication laws require the committee to review the operation of the scheme three years after royal assent. The committee has recommended that this bill also be subject to a review, given the similarities in powers and the national security risks that both laws are designed to manage.


Finally, the committee has recommended that subject to the implementation of these recommendations the bill be passed.


I commend the report to the House.

"Hammond, Tim, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Mr HAMMOND
 (Perth) (15:44):  I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 26th annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum, held in Hanoi, Vietnam from 18 to 21 January 2018. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted.




Mr HAMMOND:
  It gives me tremendous pleasure to present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 26th annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum, held in Vietnam from 18 to 21 January 2018. I had the great honour of participating in that delegation, which was led by Senator Williams from the other place and also included the hardworking members for Wright and Whitlam. I'm delighted to see the member for Wright here. His perseverance and tenacity in seeing this through to its end was only matched by his perseverance and tenacity in a number of the plenary sessions.


The APPF is an assembly of members of national parliaments in the Asia-Pacific region which has met each year since 1993 to discuss matters of mutual concern. The issues the APPF deal with are mainly strategic, economic, social and cultural in nature. The APPF is important to the Australian parliament as a parliamentary association of members who share Australia's region. Key regional countries with which Australia has strong links send delegations to APPF meetings. These countries include Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand, a number of Pacific island countries and, of course—not to be outdone—our wonderful hosts, Vietnam.


Each conference is structured around a number of plenary sessions, working groups, and a drafting committee that considers a range of resolutions arising from the discussions. Participating countries submit draft resolutions that form the basis of the discussion sessions, and subsequent conference resolutions are finalised through consensus. The sessions were under the themes of political and security matters, economic and trade matters, and regional cooperation.


Reflecting the commensurate levels of hard work done by all delegates, four draft resolutions forwarded by the Australian delegation reflected those interests of the delegation members. Senator Williams took carriage of a resolution on food security in the Asia-Pacific region. He met a number of officials from the Vietnamese department of agriculture and prosecuted the case most admirably, I must say. The member for Wright devoted much time, energy and tenacity, speaking on combating international terrorism and trans-border crime. He also chaired a working group debating regional security matters of some complexity, I must say. The member for Whitlam—again, not to be outdone—spoke very eloquently on the importance of fostering regional tourism cooperation, and also chaired a working group on economic cooperation in the region.


At the forum I was most privileged to be invited to attend the regular meeting of women parliamentarians as a representative of the Australian parliament. This reflected the long tradition of advocacy by Australian delegations to the APPF to give female parliamentarians a greater say in APPF deliberations and in the region generally. I am pleased to report that the APPF unanimously passed a resolution establishing a meeting of women parliamentarians as a standing item of future APPF meetings. I also attended working party meetings and represented the delegation on the drafting committee.


In comparison to the numbers in some national delegations, it's true the Australian delegation was comparatively small. But what we lacked in numbers we made up for in tenacity, dedication and attention to detail. It meant that we did have a busy schedule, contributing to as many of the sessions as humanly possible. The forum provided an excellent opportunity for us to forge links with our parliamentary colleagues in the region and to discuss the many issues we have of common concern.


On behalf of the delegation, I would like to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for assistance with briefing papers for the forum meetings, and for the support provided in Vietnam by the Australian ambassador and his colleagues. The Parliamentary Library also provided most useful briefing material, which all of the delegation found incredibly valuable.


Special mention at this point must go to our very own Mr Catchpole, the delegation secretary, who dedicated much time and attention to ensuring the delegation was kept on track, on time and on budget and turned up to where it needed to be. And, of course, we must also thank our very hospitable hosts, the National Assembly of Vietnam. Our thanks, in particular, go to the President of the National Assembly and her staff. Our hosts were exceptionally generous in their welcome and their hospitality. It was obvious that a tremendous effort had been made to ensure the event was a success. Special mention should also be made of support staff and student volunteers who were unfailingly helpful and enthusiastic and helped make the forum a most successful event indeed. I commend the report to the House.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (15:50):  I associate myself with the words from the member for Perth and acknowledge the leadership by Senator 'Wacka' Williams from the other place in that delegation.


On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the following reports: the first report of 2018 concerning referrals made in the year 2017 and the Eighty-first annual report (2017).


Reports made parliamentary papers in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present two reports—the first is a report for 2018 and the second is the 81st annual report.


The first report of 2018 looks at four proposals referred to the committee over the course of last year.


The first proposal is the Engine Test Cell 1 Upgrade at RAAF Base Amberley. This involves enhancing the existing engine test cell to enable it to test the new F-35 engines, as well as the engines of the Super Hornets and Growlers. This will be the only test facility for F-35 engines in the Southern Hemisphere. The project cost estimate is $23.7 million, excluding GST. I can report to the House that that facility will also be a cost-recovery facility for other air force facilities around the Southern Hemisphere that want to come and test their engines, and we will pick up some coin out of that on cost recovery.


The second proposal is for the Joint Health Command Garrison Health Facilities Upgrade Project. The project proposes to deliver 13 fit-for-purpose health centres across Australia, constructing eight new health centres and refurbishing an existing five. In making this recommendation, the committee recognises the importance of suitable health facilities in enabling defence capability. The project cost estimate is $212.5 million, excluding GST.


The third proposal is JP157 Replacement Aviation Refuelling Vehicles Infrastructure Project. This project will provide new and upgraded infrastructure at 15 sites to accommodate replacement aviation refuelling vehicles, including new vehicle shelters, bunding around fuel tanks which is designed to contain fuel leaks, hardstand and roads, and fuel treatment facilities. The project cost estimate is $40.4 million, excluding GST.


The final project is SEA1654 Phase 3 Maritime Operational Support Capability Facilities Project. This project will provide suitable facilities and infrastructure to support the new supply ships which will be based on the west coast at HMAS Stirling and on the east coast at Garden Island in Sydney. The project estimate is $220.5 million, excluding GST.


The committee recommends that the four proposed projects should proceed.


I also present the committee's 81st annual report, which reports on the committee's activities for the 2017 calendar year. In summary, it was a busy year for the committee. Twenty-four projects were reported on, with a total combined value of more than $2.03 billion. The committee also had a significant increase in medium works projects, examining 147 proposals, with a total value of $718 million. The committee held 45 meetings during the year, in Canberra and at locations around Australia. May I suggest that one of the more successful meetings we held was in the member for Griffith's electorate, where we held a public forum at the request of the member, and I think, from feedback from your constituents, the meeting was well appreciated.


I'd also like to acknowledge the exceptional work that is undertaken by the secretariat. In the chamber here at the moment we have Pauline Cullen, and not in the chamber is a gentleman who is a powerhouse of work for us—James Bunce. James, we wish you the very best and a speedy recovery to get your feet back under the desk as soon as possible.


Can I also say that, when we are examining projects, the committee looks for best practice in looking for value for money. In turn, when we are examining the cost of getting the committee to projects right around Australia, we will create subcommittees, and those that are situated on the west coast will often go and do inspections on projects, without any regard for what side of the House they sit on. When you sit in this Public Works Committee, your opinion is valued. There have been a number of occasions where members of the opposition have gone, as part of a subcommittee, and come back and made diligent recommendations which have been wholeheartedly accepted. I only highlight that to show the collegial spirit that exists when it comes to spending taxpayers' money and having an open, fair and transparent process.


I'd like to thank my fellow committee members for all their hard work during the year of 2017. As chair, I appreciate firsthand the work of every individual and the collegial way in which we work. Their commitment and valued contribution to the work of the committee is appreciated. In closing, I want to acknowledge some of the members of the committee who will no longer sit on that committee, who have been elevated because of their exceptional skill sets. I speak of Mr David Coleman, the member for Banks, and Senator Dean Smith, from the other place, who's stepping down to take up another role. He's a former chair of this committee, and his experience will be greatly missed. I commend the report to the House.

The project proposes to deliver 13 fit-for-purpose health centres across Australia, constructing eight new health centres and refurbishing an existing five. In making this recommendation, the committee recognises the importance of suitable health facilities in enabling defence capability. The project cost estimate is $212.5 million, excluding GST.


The third proposal is JP157 Replacement Aviation Refuelling Vehicles Infrastructure Project. This project will provide new and upgraded infrastructure at 15 sites to accommodate replacement aviation refuelling vehicles, including new vehicle shelters, bunding around fuel tanks which is designed to contain fuel leaks, hardstand and roads, and fuel treatment facilities. The project cost estimate is $40.4 million, excluding GST.


The final project is SEA1654 Phase 3 Maritime Operational Support Capability Facilities Project. This project will provide suitable facilities and infrastructure to support the new supply ships which will be based on the west coast at HMAS Stirling and on the east coast at Garden Island in Sydney. The project estimate is $220.5 million, excluding GST.


The committee recommends that the four proposed projects should proceed.


I also present the committee's 81st annual report, which reports on the committee's activities for the 2017 calendar year. In summary, it was a busy year for the committee. Twenty-four projects were reported on, with a total combined value of more than $2.03 billion. The committee also had a significant increase in medium works projects, examining 147 proposals, with a total value of $718 million. The committee held 45 meetings during the year, in Canberra and at locations around Australia. May I suggest that one of the more successful meetings we held was in the member for Griffith's electorate, where we held a public forum at the request of the member, and I think, from feedback from your constituents, the meeting was well appreciated.


I'd also like to acknowledge the exceptional work that is undertaken by the secretariat. In the chamber here at the moment we have Pauline Cullen, and not in the chamber is a gentleman who is a powerhouse of work for us—James Bunce. James, we wish you the very best and a speedy recovery to get your feet back under the desk as soon as possible.


Can I also say that, when we are examining projects, the committee looks for best practice in looking for value for money. In turn, when we are examining the cost of getting the committee to projects right around Australia, we will create subcommittees, and those that are situated on the west coast will often go and do inspections on projects, without any regard for what side of the House they sit on. When you sit in this Public Works Committee, your opinion is valued. There have been a number of occasions where members of the opposition have gone, as part of a subcommittee, and come back and made diligent recommendations which have been wholeheartedly accepted. I only highlight that to show the collegial spirit that exists when it comes to spending taxpayers' money and having an open, fair and transparent process.


I'd like to thank my fellow committee members for all their hard work during the year of 2017. As chair, I appreciate firsthand the work of every individual and the collegial way in which we work. Their commitment and valued contribution to the work of the committee is appreciated. In closing, I want to acknowledge some of the members of the committee who will no longer sit on that committee, who have been elevated because of their exceptional skill sets. I speak of Mr David Coleman, the member for Banks, and Senator Dean Smith, from the other place, who's stepping down to take up another role. He's a former chair of this committee, and his experience will be greatly missed. I commend the report to the House.

To this, the honourable member for Griffith has moved, an as amendment, that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House, I will state the question in the form 'that the amendment be agreed to'. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2018-03-26,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (15:57):  As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted by 90-second statements, we do agree, across both sides of this House, on the importance of higher education and vocational education to ensure that students leaving high school have a pathway to a career that they wish to pursue. I rise today to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 to provide a new minimum repayment threshold for the compulsory repayment of Higher Education Loan Program debts. The government is committed—and this is the importance of this bill—to a stronger, more sustainable student-focused higher education system for all Australians. The government has, over the past two years, consulted extensively on higher education reforms in order to seek to achieve this. This bill plays a key role in delivering sustainability to our world renowned student loan scheme, which is underwritten by the taxpayer.


This bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 by providing a new minimum repayment threshold of $45,000. This bill also indexes the HELP repayment thresholds to CPI, instead of average weekly earnings, and introduces a limit on the amount that a student can borrow under the HELP scheme of $150,000 for students studying medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses, and $104,440 for other students. These provisions are about ensuring a fairer deal for Australian taxpayers, who, ultimately, provide this support to students. Through consultation with key stakeholders, the government found that there was strong evidence that we needed to get the cost of higher education under control, that universities were capable of making a contribution and that the student loan program needed to be made more sustainable.


It's worth noting that taxpayer funded student loans currently stand at some $55 billion, and, without changes to current policy settings, a quarter of all new loans are expected to never be repaid. The government has found that since 2009 taxpayer funding for Commonwealth Supported Places in higher education has increased by some 71 per cent, growing at twice the rate of the economy. Independent analysis from Deloitte also found that average funding per domestic student for universities increased by some 15 per cent between 2010 and 2015, while, over the same period, the cost for universities to deliver courses only increased by some 9½ per cent. Lowering the starting repayment threshold for loans to $45,000 with a one per cent repayment rate is an affordable and fair ask for students to start repaying their debt to Australian taxpayers. 


When the Turnbull government worked to bring the Australian people higher education reforms, the government put in the time to consult students, academics and policymakers, review more than 1,000 submissions to our discussion paper and work with a panel of experts guiding the development of this policy. The government is delivering on its promise to pursue quality and excellence in Australia's higher education sector. We're ensuring students have the support they need to succeed, while also making sure the system is financially sustainable for future generations. We want future students—our children and grandchildren—to have the same opportunities that this and other generations have had. Our reforms guarantee students will not have to pay a cent up-front and not face fee increases. Our reforms ensure the government continues to be the majority funder of higher education Commonwealth supported places on average and demonstrate that the scare campaign by those opposite, about prohibitive fees, has no validity. But we're used to that from those opposite. They sit there and they carp and complain about everything, but they never actually demonstrate anything useful to the Australian people, other than wanting to increase taxes, regulation and red tape. We've seen from their past record with the VET FEE-HELP debacle that they're not much good at managing anything either. 


One of the most important points I want to make about this bill is that students from disadvantaged backgrounds will continue to benefit from support through the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program, in which we're investing over half a billion dollars over the next four years. The government's reforms strike the right balance in fairness for all parties involved. The reforms will ensure our record level of investment in higher education results in better opportunities, better results for students and better value for Australian taxpayers. The government is providing record funding for higher education, with over $17 billion this year, and is supporting regional students through the $290 million in regional loading for regional campuses over the next four years, rural and regional scholarships and a new initiative around regional hubs.


Australia has a world-leading higher education system that continues to provide employment and income advantages to its graduates. Our government cannot afford to be complacent and risk jeopardising these opportunities for future generations of students who also want to be able to access student loans that remove all up-front fees from higher education, facilitating their enrolments, no matter their background or their financial circumstances. Australia's higher education system is excellent and recent rankings put it as very highly regarded, on global terms. In my electorate of Forde, Griffith University's Logan campus has gone from strength to strength, with students recognising its excellent educational opportunities and convenient location. I want Griffith University at Meadowbrook to continue to prosper and grow. By working with us, students, universities and taxpayers will see this government deliver improved choices, financial stability and accountability to Australia's higher education sector.


I reiterate my opening comments: it is important that we provide the opportunities for Australian students to pursue a career of their choice as they leave high school, whether that's facilitated through higher education study at university or through study at TAFE or a private college, through VET FEE-HELP. It is important that we ensure our students are given every opportunity as they seek to enter the workforce and further their careers in the future. This is in stark contrast to the approach of those opposite, who when last in government announced $6.6 billion worth of cuts to funding for the higher education sector. The coalition government is delivering a responsible suite of reforms that are fair and, importantly, seek to empower student choice. I commend the bill in its unamended form to the House.

"King, Madeleine, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (16:06):  I reflect on a couple of things the member for Forde said earlier about the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. One is the consultation said to have been done with the sector and students. I struggle to find any support for the measures the government is trying to introduce in this bill before the House. Universities Australia has done quite a lot of study into exactly what contribution universities and students have made to budget repair, and estimates that since 2011 universities and students have contributed over $3.9 billion to the task of budget repair in this country. I agree with what Universities Australia has said, that perhaps they have contributed their fair share to budget repair in this country. This government might want to consider its tax reform and the $65 billion worth of tax cuts it's giving to large companies, as well as to individuals earning more than $180,000 a year, rather than attacking universities and students earning $45,000 a year, if they even get to do that.


This side of the House does not support an attack on students, as I've suggested. This bill would attack and undermine the fairness of Australia's world-class student loan scheme. We on this side of the House, the Labor Party, have a proud record when it comes to higher education. Back in 1989 Labor introduced the first income contingent loan scheme, HECS, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. It contributed to an expansion of higher ed in this country and was part of the foundation of our fair and accessible higher education system. When last in office we increased funding for universities from $8 billion to $14 billion a year. We introduced the demand-driven funding system, which enabled more people to go to university. This led to an increase in participation from disadvantaged students. In fact, the system allowed an extra 190,000 students to go to university. This is an important point to consider when research tells us that by 2020, in only two years, two out of every three jobs created in Australia will require a diploma or a higher education qualification.


Despite this, the government introduced a bill that ignores the reality of the modern world, where further and lifelong study is essential to our economy. It is working to limit the aspirations of students and their families, denying university access to students and undermining the qualifications this country needs from its workers and workforce in the future. We need more, not fewer, people to go on to further education and gain the qualifications they need for the benefit of this country. This government has systematically attacked universities, students and education as a whole. This Liberal government has attacked higher education with a freeze on university grants—effectively a $2.2 billion cut—meaning 10,000 university places will be unfunded. So that means 10,000 fewer students at universities. 


We witnessed this government introduce an unfair funding regime that cut $17 billion from schools, hitting public schools the hardest. We all remember the 'not a dollar difference' campaign—well, there's a lot of difference. We've witnessed this government wallop vocational education and TAFE, with a whopping $3 billion being ripped from their funding. This government has the gall to say these cuts are necessary, while, at the same time, they can throw a staggering $65 billion tax cut bonus to the big end of town. I mean, what a nerve. 


We have consistently fought this Liberal government's attempts to introduce $100,000 degrees in this country, and we'll continue to fight this attempt to undermine the repayment threshold on student loans. It's known that higher student debt is a genuine barrier for low-income and disadvantaged students when it comes to study. We know these government cuts will affect students from Brand, from across the towns of Rockingham and Kwinana. We know this, yet instead of increasing participation and assistance in higher education this government is making it harder for people to study and harder for their families to support them. 


This is not the first attempt by this Liberal government to lower the repayment threshold for HELP. In last year's budget they tried to make students start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000 a year, and they failed. We will not support this latest attempt at lowering the Higher Education Loan Program repayments to a $45,000 threshold, which is only $9,000 a year more than the minimum wage in this country. It is simply too low. It will be a millstone around the necks of new graduates who are looking to begin their working lives. This debt will be a burden to people. 


How can someone starting out even think of paying a mortgage or getting married, or starting a family, when their income is sequestered by student loan repayments? Add to that the increased casualisation of our entire workforce, across the professions as well as in blue-collar work, where long-time employment contracts no longer exist or rarely exist. People find it impossible to secure housing loans, even personal loans for cars and the things that everyone takes for granted. Then you add in, with your profession, a debt of this magnitude—much higher than when I went to university and paid HECS—and they have to start paying it off at $45,000 per annum from their income. 


Contrary to the Prime Minister's advice that people go out and buy homes for their children, in the real world—certainly in the real world of Brand—this does not happen. In my electorate, I can tell you, parents struggle with paying their bills, thanks to this government's attack on penalty rates. I can tell you that parents are struggling every day with underemployment, unemployment, rising costs of living and stagnant wages growth. I can tell you that parents are struggling to pay their own mortgages—never mind being able to help their kids buy a house. I can tell you that in the everyday world, when they finish uni, young people, students, are on their own when it comes to finding their own homes and paying for them. 


Another concern to be had with this bill is the impact that the proposed changes to the HELP repayment thresholds will have on women. Mark Pace, the president of the National Union of Students, has stated: 'We know from the National Tertiary Education Union's submission to this Senate inquiry that 60 per cent of all Australians with outstanding HELP debt are women and that two-thirds of the Australians who will be dragged into the debt pool with the new proposed repayment thresholds will also be women.' So I cannot support this. 


In conjunction with this, student debt overall is a major concern in this country. Australian students already pay the sixth-highest contribution to the cost of their degrees in the OECD. This is significant. Making it harder for students to study, we are risking participation in post-secondary education that we need for the benefit of this country and for the economy of this country. We risk being left behind the rest of the world with short-sighted punitive measures such as those in this bill. We do not want a system where students have to take out commercial loans, or their families have to take out commercial loans, in order to fund their university fees. 


By putting universities in a funding vice, I can only imagine that the intention of this government is to push institutions toward having to institute higher fees. We saw this happen under the Abbott government when they tried to deregulate the entire system. That's when we saw the announcement of $100,000 fees—sadly, out of my home institution at UWA. 


There is no equitable scenario in the agenda being pushed here. What we are seeing is the opportunity of a better future that higher education affords being taken away from those who cannot afford it. This bill is about the wrong priorities of this government. We have a government driven on giving tax cuts to millionaires—to the detriment of those in need of support. It's a government delighting multinationals with tax cuts—showering the big end of town with a $65 billion tax cut—and then getting them to write letters to crossbenchers. This is the great compact that this government has with large corporations to buy some votes in the other place—a letter.


The flipside to the largesse of this government is the educational future, the employment opportunities and the standard of living for everyday people for whom university will be out of reach. Instead of breaking down barriers to higher education, this government is actively looking to build up barriers that prevent access to university. What we need to be doing as a country is investing in people and enabling them to realise their potential. We need to embrace the fairness of our world-class student loan system and we need to protect it, and we certainly should not be doing this act of destruction.


I mentioned at the start of my contribution on this bill the magnitude of what universities themselves, as well as students, have done in the activity of budget repair. I'm going to read from a Universities Australia paper from April of last year, 'The facts on university funding', where they conclude:


Australia's universities and their students have made a very substantial contribution to repair Australia's Budget position since 2011. They have done their bit.


Any further reductions would increase financial pressures for students already under stress and put at risk the ability of our world-class universities to continue to deliver excellence in education and research—the foundation of our third-largest export industry and the bedrock of future economic prosperity. 


It's important to understand how universities are funded. To ignore the fact that, over the many years of universities in this country, student fees do end up subsidising research is to ignore what is true. Maybe people don't agree with that being the case, but it is the case and, until we have a greater reform of our research and science funding system and how it intersects with our higher education student payments and fees system, it will remain the case—and we need to address the world as it is.


I want to chat briefly about the student experience because the bill before us will affect that. It puts the current student experience at risk, and I note that the student experience has been in decline for some time. It's a critical part of the role of universities to provide a safe and inclusive environment that enables young people—and mature age students, of course—to actively participate in the university community through clubs and societies, sporting or interest based, or culturally based focusing on international students, who provide us with our third-biggest export in this country.


As costs to attend universities increase, especially for local students, and students are exposed to ever-increasing fee liability on completion of their degree, it becomes harder for student societies, student unions and guilds to attract members, participants and the volunteers that keep these groups running—groups that add so much to the life and vibrancy of university campuses around this country. In parliament today, I spoke with the Australasian Union of Jewish Students, which is celebrating its 20th year. Groups like this get together and depend on the volunteer students who can generate interest on topics. Today, they were asking parliamentarians to talk about their experiences in this place and the road to this place. Firstly, I'd like to thank those students for their terrific work and what they're doing, and for organising for 60-odd members of the Union of Jewish Students to be here in the House today. But these kinds of groups are at risk when people can no longer afford the time because they have to work ever-increasing hours at their jobs, which pay less because penalty rates are cut, so that they can, in some way, contribute to their education because their parents are unable to support them, or they're simply not able to move out of home—all the things that seem to go along with a university education, or did once. I'd also like to thank Ariel Zohar for the invitation to speak to the Australasian Union of Jewish Students today.


There are other institutions that are important across universities. At the university I studied at, unbelievable fundraising activities took place. These groups face the very real challenge of students no longer being able to participate in them. I think of the university camps run at the start of each year for disadvantaged children across Western Australia. It's been going for a long time, but it's increasingly challenging for those groups to have students involved because of the pressures that the costs of education are placing on what we might think of as not study time but, nonetheless, a valuable part of the student experience at universities in Australia.


These institutions and international societies—the Association of Malaysian Students and the Singapore Students' Association—of course, are very important in the system in Western Australia, as they are where our educational exports come from. The highest number of Singaporeans outside of Singapore reside in Perth, and a lot of that is off the back of Singaporeans having come down from Singapore to study in Perth because it's close to their home. And so I thank all those students who participate, who help to welcome new international students to our shores and who make them feel welcome at our campuses.


Obviously, many of us in this chamber have been to orientation days. Recently, I was at Murdoch University and Curtin University, and whilst I did say hello to the Liberal clubs, of course I stayed and said hello to the Labor clubs. I would like to shout out to some good people who are engaging with local students about getting involved in talking politics: Lewis Whittaker, Kai Donaldson, Erin Horrigan, Chris Lesiter, Jay Wood, Conor McLaughlin and Braydon Wagstaff.


Over at Curtin, a great institution where I went with the member for Kingsford Smith, we talked about the Australian republic and the move for an Australian head of state. We had the great support of Jason Lawrence, Beck Bogdan and Bridget Edwards. There will always be students who can do it and who will do it, but I think it's time that all governments laid off students at universities in their passion for budget repair. We know that budget repair is critical. We support that, but these people—students and universities—are not the people to use to correct the budget.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (16:21):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. I thank the member for Brand for her contribution, and heartily endorse her work with the Australian Republican Movement to make sure we get some progressive change there. I want to say up-front that Labor opposes this legislation. I feel strongly about the measures that the Turnbull government is attempting to legislate in this bill.


I begin with a bit of history, both personal and national. I taught English, geography and a few other subjects in state and Catholic schools for 11 years. I have two sons, one in grade 4 at a state school and the other in grade 8 at a Catholic school. I was also a union organiser for private schools for a couple of years. I'm very passionate about the education of my own children—although neglecting them often by coming to Canberra—the education of all children in Moreton and the future of education in Australia.


There is a quote from Confucius that I like to use when talking about this topic. It says, 'If your plan is for one year, plant rice. If your plan is for 10 years, plant trees. If your plan is for 100 years, educate children.' Clearly, as a nation we should be planning for 100 years, but, instead, this bill before us is an unfair piece of legislation that attacks students and undermines the fairness of our world-class student loan system.


In 1989 Labor introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. It was the first income contingent loan scheme, and would become the foundation of Australia's fair and accessible higher education system. I do declare up-front that I did not pay HECS in my first qualification to become a teacher. That was a different time, and it is unfair that someone in my generation got the benefits of free education coming through under Whitlam and the like.


Nevertheless, Australian Labor brought in these changes, based on the belief that it is fair and reasonable in the current economic climate that students should contribute to the cost of their public education to the extent that they obtain a private benefit from such studies. It enabled many young people who would otherwise not have gone to university to gain a tertiary degree. It gave them an educational opportunity. I know that as the first of 10 people in my family, raised by a single mum, to obtain a higher education qualification.


It is not always an easy or direct path to university education, but we, as a nation, should be making it easier, not harder, for people. There are many examples of Australians who have gone on to make extensive contributions to society after taking a more meandering road, shall we say, to their educational attainment. Our country is far better off for their having made those sacrifices and taken those brave decisions. After becoming a teacher, I became a lawyer. I went through night school while I was teaching, and I saw how difficult it was. But I would like to point out two particular lawyers who work in the legal system. One is the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Hon. Chief Justice Susan Kiefel, a Queenslander. Chief Justice Kiefel left school at 15 after completing grade 10. She completed her secretarial training at the Kangaroo Point Technical College in Brisbane and worked as a secretary for a variety of companies, including a building society and an exploration company, before working for a group of barristers. While working she completed her secondary schooling and then began studying law. I think the Chief Justice has done all right for herself—being Chief Justice of the High Court—all things considered and by any measure. 


Another example that many in this chamber would know is my friend, the Queensland Attorney-General, the Hon. Yvette D'Ath. Yvette left school at 15 and worked in clerical and hospitality positions. Eventually, she put herself through night school while continuing to work and raise a family. The Attorney-General of Queensland obtained a Bachelor of Laws from QUT and she is now Queensland's first law officer—a great success in anyone's eyes—and is well loved by many in this chamber. 


They're just two examples. There are many other people, who may not be as well-known as the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General of Queensland, who for whatever reason have not thought that tertiary education was something they could or should attain when they finished high school but who have later obtained a higher qualification and achieved great things. 


HECS and, more recently, the HECS-HELP scheme, along with other measures designed to encourage university participation, have successfully boosted university attendance by minority groups, including first-in-family tertiary students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds and Indigenous students. In particular, participation for students with a disability has increased by more than 106 per cent; Indigenous students—an increase of 89 per cent; low-SES students—increased by 55 per cent; and regional and remote students by more than 48 per cent. One would think that the National Party—those supposed champions of the bush—would be doing all they could to support this legislation. Instead, they bend over and let it go through on behalf of the Liberal Party. 


The MYEFO package of $2.2 billion of cuts is the out-of-touch Turnbull government's fourth attempt since coming into office to cut universities and make students pay more. At Christmas the Turnbull government froze university grants effectively ending demand-driven funding. Also announced were the measures contained in this bill which seek to enact a number of changes to Australia's world-class income contingent higher education loan scheme. 


This legislation sets a new repayment threshold for HELP from 1 July 2018, starting with a new minimum repayment of $45,000. It aligns indexation of HELP repayment thresholds to CPI instead of average weekly earnings. It introduces a new combined loan limit on how much students can borrow under HELP, including VET student loans, HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP. The new limit would be $104,000, or $150,000 for students studying medicine, dentistry or veterinary science. It also makes changes to the Student Financial Supplement Scheme and its repayment thresholds. 


This legislation is unfair, out of touch and a complete rip-off for students. Students should not be looked at as cash cows for budget repair—the very same budget that is handing out $65 billion to large corporations, particularly banks and multinationals. We know that higher student debt and the potential for significantly earlier repayment are genuine barriers to study for low-SES, disadvantaged and regional students who may need to travel for study—so extra hurdles in front of them. These students are less likely to be able to rely on parental support during university or the early years of their careers—yet another reason this policy will cause those from certain backgrounds the most suffering. 


We should be doing all that we can to increase participation in higher ed, not making it harder. If we don't boost participation, we risk being left behind compared to the rest of the world. Universities should never be only for the elite. We need our brightest to be given opportunities, not just those who are the most well-heeled. Universities should be melting pots of society, bringing all parts of our community together—the bush and the city; Indigenous and non-Indigenous; and rich and poor. They should be bringing people together to research and make discoveries that will make all our lives better and develop the industries and jobs of the future. 


This bill is another episode in the sorry saga of this government trying to gut education in Australia, whether it's in schools, vocational education or at universities. Last year, the Turnbull government tried to make students start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000. That was just one of the measures in what was a fundamentally unfair LNP budget. It was the same budget that saw the big business tax giveaway to the top end of town blow out to over $65 billion. Labor joined with students around Australia and fought to stop this measure being implemented by the Turnbull government. Now it is proposing a new minimum threshold of $45,000, but it's still too low.


Labor believes the current repayment rate is about right. We don't want to make students repay their debts right when they're starting a career, trying to start a family or save to buy a house. This is yet another example of the Turnbull government failing to act to make Australia fair. Labor's proposal to limit negative gearing will give young first home owners a chance to compete in this market.


Recent analysis revealed that low- and middle-income areas of Australia will be hurt most by Prime Minister Turnbull's $2.2 billion of university cuts. Western Sydney, western and outer Melbourne and outer metro Brisbane and Perth are all being hit particularly hard. When Labor uncapped university places these areas saw a huge increase in the number of students attending university, because that's where the demand was. Statistics show that participation in higher education in outer suburban and regional areas still lags behind the wealthier inner urban areas. I've said in this place before that your bank balance or your parents' bank balance should not affect your ability to go to university; it should be your intellect, not your postcode, obviously.


Labor opened the door to higher education for hundreds of thousands more Australians, but the eternally out-of-touch Prime Minister Turnbull has slammed that door shut. It's estimated that up to 10,000 people could miss out on a place at university this year and next year, because of Prime Minister Turnbull's cruel cuts. This is a sorry blow to the many year 12 graduates who studied so hard in the hope of getting into university but now might not be able to enter. Since the cuts were announced before Christmas, there have already been reports of some universities turning away students and cutting programs. This bill puts higher education further out of reach for Australians.


In my own community, Griffith University is set to lose $92 million. I oppose this bill on behalf of all university students at all universities, but particularly the more than 13,000 students who attend Griffith University in my electorate. I was at Griffith University on the weekend for a citizenship ceremony as part of Harmony Day. It was a joint venture with the World Arts and Multi-culture Inc. I'm wearing the tie that Professor Martin Betts, from Griffith University, gave me to show my support for Griffith University. I also give a shout out to Lewis Lee who emceed a wonderful event on the weekend.


The Higher Education Loan Program, referred to as HELP, is the cornerstone of Australia's higher education system. In a submission to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, Universities Australia, the peak body representing the university sector, recommended that the government not set the minimum repayment threshold below a level that reflects a reasonable graduate earnings. A number of other submissions to the Senate committee inquiry raised concerns about the possible impact of a lower HELP minimum repayment threshold on access to higher education and graduate living conditions. The NUS and the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations have collaborated on a campaign called Bury the Bill to oppose this piece of legislation, stating it:


…condemns lower-earning graduates to pay back their student loans when barely earning minimum wage.


That's right, the government's proposed repayment threshold is only $9,000 more than the minimum wage.


Another submission, this time by the NTEU, raises significant questions about whether this government has bothered to fully understand the impact this change to HELP repayment thresholds will have on women. In their submission they analysed data obtained from the ATO showing that 60 per cent of people with a taxable income and an outstanding HELP debt are women. The same data also showed that the taxable income of these women was significantly lower. So not only are the majority of HELP recipients women, they are also earning less than their male counterparts. It is a real double whammy, made worse by the Turnbull government's further increase in the repayment burden in a system that is already skewed against women.


The Australasian Council of Deans of Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities argued in its submission that the measure will have a disproportionate impact on graduates of humanities, arts and social science courses. They often take a longer time to establish their careers and are more likely to be women, resulting in periods of lower earnings. The Equity Practitioners in Higher Education Australasia, in their submission, suggested the limit:


… may impact negatively on students who incurred a VET student debt as a pathway to higher education. In addition, the method of determining the loan limit is not explained, and may have implications for students accessing Start-up loans.


Likewise, Science and Technology Australia raised concerns about the impact on those entering university from VET pathways and then undertaking further training to become teachers, especially in science, technology, engineering and mathematics—the industries of the future creating the jobs of the future. 


Labor believes in fairness for all Australians. Labor believes in everybody having a fair go. Labor believes in all Australians being able to achieve their potential. That is why Labor opened the door to university for hundreds of thousands more Australians. But Prime Minister Turnbull has slammed that door in the face of young Australians who dreamt of a university education. The Turnbull government is ripping $436 million from Queensland universities. Griffith University, in my electorate, will have $92 million ripped from their funding. The Turnbull government's cuts to universities have effectively reintroduced a cap on the number of uni places, taking us back to the dark days of the Howard era. We should be supporting our young people to strive hard and let them get ahead. Some young people in my electorate who will now be prevented from enrolling in university will have worked hard throughout their schooling in the hope of going to uni, but they've had their hopes dashed by an uncaring Turnbull government. 


The Turnbull government have their priorities wrong. They're keen to make life easier for big business by giving away $65 billion in tax, but at the same time they're prepared to prevent our children from receiving a quality education, dashing the hopes of these young people, these smart people, these people who will create the jobs of the future. These proposals, coupled with the other MYEFO higher education cuts, raise significant questions and cast doubt over the future of the demand-driven funding system. They take a swipe at the ability of HELP to genuinely increase access and participation in tertiary education. That is why I do not support this legislation. (Time expired)

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (16:36):  I'm proud to be part of the party that stands up for education. In Labor, we believe in education. It's why Labor's been fighting for strong educational outcomes for Australians for many years. I don't believe investment in education is something we should be having to fight for, of course. We should be just fighting for what's right, for what just makes sense for the future of our country, for what all of the research says is a good idea, both in educational outcomes and as an investment in the future of Australia. But fighting for education is what we need to do with this government, because this Liberal-National government is doing whatever it takes to undermine every single educational system in Australia, from early childhood education all the way to tertiary studies. 


What we know is that families with young children will be affected by the government's planned childcare package, which will see 2,239 families in my electorate worse off, 2,239 families whose children will have reduced access to affordable early childhood education. Families with school-aged children will suffer the brunt of the Liberals' $17 billion cut from schools and, once you're out of school, young people are faced with a $3 billion cut to vocational education and training. For those who would rather go to university, they will have to endure a $2.2 billion cut to unis. The University of the Sunshine Coast, which has just begun its first semester operating at the Caboolture campus, will be hit with a $34 million cut. I've been having a number of conversations with the USC staff, who are worried about the impact of cuts on their existing operations and on their grand plans for the future for our region. These cuts are disgraceful, and they are in stark contrast to how we on this side of the House see priorities. 


When Labor were last in government, we lifted investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. The steps that Labor took opened the doors of universities to 190,000 more Australians, many of whom became the first in their family to go to university. This was a great step forward, but the conservatives are determined to stand in the way of progress, and they're seeking to do this today with a bill that directly attacks students seeking to further their studies. It attacks students and undermines the fairness and integrity of Australia's world-class student loans scheme, the Higher Education Loan Program, or, as we know it, HELP. 


Any changes to the HELP scheme need to be considered and evidence based. I'd like to point to a quote from Ms Catriona Jackson, the Deputy Chief Executive of Universities Australia. She said:


… the first principle—the first thing you must keep in your mind when you're changing this fundamentally important scheme—is to do no harm.


In last year's budget we saw the government attempt to compel students to start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000. That's barely more than the minimum wage. That failed, thank goodness, and unsurprisingly so, because Australians value people who seek to further their education. That's why, we know, the Liberals are trying again with a slightly higher repayment threshold. It's $45,000 this time but it's still far too low. In fact, as the ACTU have stated, it's a mere $9,000 more than the minimum wage.


The point of these loans isn't to churn someone through a degree and be done with them; it's to give them an opportunity to set themselves up with a career that will benefit them, benefit their families and, of course, benefit the country. Students should not have to repay all of their debts in their first, low-paying job after university, especially not when the cost of living has grown to such exorbitant heights under this government. We must do all we can to increase participation in higher education, not make it harder to access.


It's already hard enough for a student from a low-SES or disadvantaged background to access higher education. For many students in Longman, this is a genuine barrier. If you're already struggling to get by—maybe you've suffered a pay cut through the government's cuts to penalty rates or maybe you're already working two jobs to help support your family—your capacity to go to university is already severely limited. I'd like to further pick up on that limitation when it comes to women. The National President of the National Union of Students, Mark Pace, stated to the inquiry of the Education and Employment Legislation Committee into the bill:


We know from the National Tertiary Education Union's submission to this Senate inquiry that 60 per cent of all Australians with outstanding HELP debt are women and that two-thirds of the Australians who will be dragged into the debt pool with the new proposed repayment thresholds will also be women …


There's already enough day-to-day stress. Adding yet another financial burden would certainly take its toll. Let's be very clear: the government made no significant case in this Senate inquiry for a change to HELP beyond some budget savings.


As I mentioned, the University of the Sunshine Coast have just started up their Caboolture campus in my electorate of Longman, and they're doing their part to ensure that disadvantaged students have a pathway into tertiary education. Earlier this month I facilitated conversations between staff at the USC and a number of our special assistance schools in the area. We discussed how we could get our disadvantaged students interested in tertiary education—how to open up a pathway and help get them there. What was pretty clear at that roundtable was that the changes proposed by the government will have a devastating effect on getting disadvantaged students to engage in tertiary studies. Experts have warned time and time again that if Australia does not boost participation in post-secondary education there is a strong chance that we will be left behind by the rest of the world. It is estimated that about 10,000 people could miss out on a university place again next year because of the Turnbull government's cuts. This will affect people in the regions, particularly in areas like Narangba and Caboolture. It will hit students in these areas the hardest. These areas are already lagging behind the wealthier, inner-city urban areas when it comes to participation in higher education. Now, with all the cuts the Liberals have forced upon TAFE and the vocational education sector, it's not like there are many opportunities left to turn to if you're a student in my electorate.


But what makes it even worse is that the reason that the Turnbull government is pursuing these cuts is to give a $65 billion handout to big businesses. I find this truly, truly disgraceful. I also find it disgraceful that Pauline Hanson, who likes to claim she's a friend of battlers, has sold them out once again. After conspiring with her dear friends in the coalition here, Senator Hanson has agreed to throw $65 billion worth of taxpayer money at banks and big businesses. She's agreed to throw that money, while, at the same time, that will force the government to see universities like the University of the Sunshine Coast face $34 million worth of cuts in their aim to educate students, and we'll see $600 million worth of cuts to TAFE. That's what will happen.


When Labor win the next election, we will be putting Australia back on track. What you'll see is a government taking education seriously and investing in the future of this country, right from early childhood education through to tertiary education and TAFE. We'll be bringing Australia back to a position where we don't need to rely on so many 457 visa workers, for example. We'll be able to employ locally.


The Liberals and One Nation seem to think that the answer to a shortage of workers skilled through university or TAFE is to look overseas. Well, it's not. That's simply a bandaid solution. It does nothing to move more Australians into work, and it does even less to prevent this issue continuing into the future.


Senator Hanson's big-business-tax-cut sweetener, as we know, was 1,000 apprenticeship places. That barely scratches the surface. Under this government, we've seen 140,000 apprenticeships and traineeships lost. That's right. So what we've got here is a One Nation vote in the Senate that will cost this nation $65 billion worth of tax cuts for banks and big businesses in return for less than one per cent of the number of apprenticeships that have been lost under this government. That's what it will cost.


But I can tell you that Labor's commitment to reversing the government's cuts to TAFE and training will take a huge step forward, as will the 20,000 fast-tracked apprenticeships for people facing redundancies or whose jobs have been lost, and our revolutionary national inquiry into postsecondary education will bring it all together. Within our first 100 days of government, we will examine every aspect of the vocational and higher education systems, and we'll make sure that they have the resources and systems in place to best assist Australia's economy and society. Investing in education always pays off. Whether we're talking about early childhood education or schools or we're talking about TAFE, vocational education or our universities, it always pays off. By any other name, investing in education means investing in people. It's investing in Australians.


What we know are cruel changes that the government want to pass show that they're too busy throwing money at big business to look ahead. I'd like to invite the government—any government member they like—to come out to my electorate. Come to Caboolture and visit some of those special assistance schools with me. Come and talk to those young students from disadvantaged backgrounds, the ones who are looking for a pathway, those who, even before turning 18, are struggling to get by and have struggled to get by.


I visit them quite regularly because, whether it's Horizons College or Alta-1 or YJET, they're doing some really great work. So I visit them quite often. They're inspiring young minds to believe in themselves, to give themselves some aspiration in life to do better for themselves and their families, not just to accept hardship that's been dished out to them but to strive for something more. That's why we're having these conversations with the University of the Sunshine Coast: to give them that pathway. We want them to look at tertiary institutions—like, as I said, the University of the Sunshine Coast or maybe, if they want to head into Brisbane, QUT or UQ—and just know that that's not out of reach for them. So I invite any government member to come and talk to these students at any of those schools. Ask them about the impact of these changes and what effect not having that pathway would have on them. Ask them if watering down our world-class student loans makes it easier for them to get into university. I openly give this offer, because I'll tell you what those opposite will hear if they come out. They'll hear students unanimously saying changes to HELP are anything but helpful to them. We're not just talking about school leavers. I'd like to extend that invitation. Come and speak to some of the students that are in their 30s and 40s and for whatever reason didn't get the opportunity or didn't take that pathway and now want to. Come and talk to them about how the government's changes to HELP will affect those people who want to create a better future for their families. The other thing those opposite will hear is about cutting funds to TAFE. They'll hear just how those TAFE funding cuts are affecting students and children that might want to head down that pathway. 


Those opposite need to stop looking up at big business. Instead, we need them to look forward—and look forward to our students and to investing in their education. If they do that, they'll see that investing in people is the fastest way for our country to go forward into our future. Thank you.

"Swanson, Meryl, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (16:51):  I rise to speak against the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 because it is a blatant attack on Australian students. This bill stands to undermine the fairness of our nation's student loan scheme. Once again, my colleagues and I stand in this House railing against the Turnbull government's unfair and inequitable policies, which rip funding away from the most vulnerable to pave the path for the big end of town. 


This legislation stands against everything we know to be vital to encourage post-secondary education. It throws up yet another roadblock for the socioeconomically disadvantaged. It is a disincentive to the lifelong learning all progressive Australians know will be necessary to build the agile, smart workforce needed to futureproof our nation's industries and economy and to keep pace on the global stage—something the Prime Minister repeats over and over again as he ties our students' hands behind their backs. As it stands, the bill sets a new minimum repayment threshold of $45,000, which is just $9,000 above the minimum wage. It introduces a new combined loan limit, capping the amount students can borrow to cover their tuition fees. In these two points alone, there are two clear disincentives to post-secondary study. Those coming into the workforce on entry-level wages are often at a stage in life where they're trying to plan for a family or save for a home, and they are going to be slugged with extra financial imposts they can ill afford. Placing a limit on the amount students can borrow across their lifetime will really greatly hinder their ability to adopt the long-term theoretical, academic and practical skill development we know will be vital as technology changes what we do and, more importantly, how we live. 


In typical fashion, this bill is all about saving the Turnbull government money, and a lot of it. The changes to programs including VET student loans, HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP will save the government $345.8 million in fiscal balance across four years. Changes to the Student Financial Supplement Scheme will claw the government back an additional $32.3 million in cash balance across four years. Of course, those two amounts alone will very neatly cover the Turnbull government's $65 billion tax breaks for big business. But what's the real cost to our country? 


I am a proud alumnus of the University of Newcastle. I was born in the regional town of Heddon Greta, and I'm fortunate I came through my tertiary years at a time when education was truly accessible for all Australians. I started in 1989, the first year of HECS. I was happy to contribute to pay my bit, but now things aren't so rosy. Australian students in the year 2018 already make the sixth-highest contribution to their university fees in the OECD.


I know many families in my electorate—and there is profound socioeconomic disadvantage in some of these areas—where an erosion of the existing student supports will mean post-secondary education becomes nothing more than a pipedream. And, being first in family to go to university, I understand just how powerful that can be. These are areas where unemployment rates outstrip the national average, where youth joblessness is at crisis point, where people struggle to pay their electricity bills and where public transport is non-existent or so intermittent it might as well be useless. We know beyond doubt that higher debt is a massive disincentive for lower socioeconomic and disadvantaged students considering further education. They don't want that millstone around their neck.


We also know that, in this time of global economic transition, we need to invest in people. We need to build lifelong learners who embrace change and accept that growth and development are the only guarantee of future success. Why then are we making it harder for people to get post-secondary qualifications? Why are we making it more expensive to be smarter? It is just crazy economics. If we can for a moment take a break away from the Turnbull government's budget-centric view of managing our nation, there are many, many ways we could take a holistic approach towards encouraging post-secondary education.


Earlier this month, I met with Professor Caroline McMillen, the outgoing Vice-Chancellor of the University of Newcastle, and Leah Anderson, from the Tomaree Business Chamber, who also happens to be the Port Stephens Woman of the Year. We were discussing the barriers to post-secondary education faced by young people in Port Stephens. You may not have heard of Port Stephens, Deputy Speaker, but I imagine you have heard of Nelson Bay, which is the heart of this blue-water wonderland. It's an idyllic place for a beach getaway, but if you're a young person it can feel like the end of the earth. There is literally one road in and the same road out. There's only public transport via bus. The services are infrequent and the trip to Newcastle is long. Connectivity is a massive disincentive for students, jobseekers and even employees. There is a steady bleed of established professionals out of the area. It's blatantly obvious, then, that offering young people transport so that they can access training, education and even employment would make a massive difference to their lives, their futures and our economy.


As Deputy Chair of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation, I have sat in on a great many hearings across our country, hearing from people in our regional and rural communities about the issues they face. Whilst each area is diverse and boasts its unique set of opportunities and challenges, many could be cut and pasted from one town to the other. The big issues include connectivity, whether it be physical connection through public transport or internet connection through our failed NBN. I note the shadow minister sits at the table. She has worked so tirelessly for people across the nation who are just screaming out for decent connectivity. Educational opportunities are also going begging, as is quality health care. These are the things that people want in regional and remote parts of Australia. We must get these fundamentals right from day dot if we're going to level the playing field and ensure more young Australians get on a pathway to success earlier in their lives, especially if we'd like them to take up places in regional and rural Australia. Australia must do everything it can to support its young people, and the Turnbull government must really end this war that they seem to be waging on our youth, making it so hard. Young people are the very future of this nation, at every level and in every way. We must facilitate, encourage and enable, not throw up roadblocks and disincentives at every turn. 


Universities Australia and the National Union of Students found that in 2012 two-thirds of Australian students lived below the Henderson poverty line and one in five students regularly skip meals. How can the Turnbull government, with any conscience, now lower the student loan repayment threshold? In many instances, these young people have worked in casual, low-paid positions to fund their education. Then, when they finally graduate and embark on their new career, they are immediately slugged with loan repayments. It just isn't fair. It wasn't fair when the government proposed an income threshold of $42,000, and it is not fair under the $45,000 threshold that this bill prescribes. This short-sighted approach from a government that trumpets its economic nous really is quite ludicrous.


Experts warn Australia risks being left behind if it doesn't boost participation in post-secondary education. Instead of accepting this truth and stepping up to re-examine and re-invigorate our current model in favour of something that truly reflects the current landscape, this government continues to cut and cut and cut. We need to build, build and build something new, something that is built to meet the needs of this era, something that is built to meet the needs of the future, something that spans the whole of the post-secondary sector. It needs to be dynamic, it needs to be responsive to a changing system and it needs to happen quickly. The systems in place are not well equipped for lifetime learning, and this bill's cap on loans further restricts that potential. It is yet another example of the Turnbull government's myopic focus on the budget. This government is more concerned about the numbers on a page year to year than the long-term economic prosperity of our nation and its people.


I have a long-held passion for encouraging industries in my electorate to diversify and adapt to economic and technological change. I've been inspired and educated by many in the lower Hunter who work every day towards these goals. I'm proud to be part of the Hunter Youth Transition Advisory Group, and I commend to you an organisation called Youth Express, which facilitates young people's transition from education to employment and builds bridges between students and industry. Similarly, Alesco Senior College, which has campuses in two towns in my electorate—Raymond Terrace and Nelson Bay—is doing great things for young people in my area. Alesco is passionate about filling voids, not reinventing the wheel. It creates a place for young people who, for a variety of reasons, have opted out before completing their secondary education. Alesco gives them another chance, another pathway, another choice.


The University of Newcastle has three fantastic enabling programs. There is one geared towards Indigenous students; one called Open Foundation, which builds a bridge to university for those who did not achieve a TER; and one called Newstep. These are exceptional programs that change lives and in turn change our economic and social fabric. The University of Newcastle is also actively exploring innovation hubs in collaboration with local industry. There is a highly successful hub at Williamtown, which benefits from synergies with the defence and aerospace industries. I know other businesses are keen to explore the potential for similar hubs in the Hunter. These are all great examples of ways that we can create educational opportunities for our young people and encourage post-secondary study, all while working with industry and really capturing true innovation.


The government could be encouraging these wonderful initiatives. It could be funding our schools and giving them the resources to allow them to more actively engage with our local government and business chamber representatives to learn where our economy is headed. Educators could learn where the new jobs are likely to be and create educational opportunities based on these scenarios. Instead, the Turnbull government has cut school funding by $17 billion. The government could be exploring initiatives such as satellite campuses for our tertiary institutions. Instead, people such as Professor Caroline McMillen are dealing with the fallout of the federal government's $2.2 billion in budget cuts. What of vocational education and training? What of it, indeed. Under this government, we have seen nearly $3 billion cut. That translates into 140,000 apprenticeships and trainees lost since the Liberals took the reins. That is 140,000 opportunities for people to better their skills and their lives.


I will vote against this government's proposed changes to Australia's student loan scheme. I stand with Labor. Under a Labor government real and meaningful reforms were delivered to students pursuing higher education. Labor believes a fair and accessible higher education scheme must include income contingent loans, and that is why when in 1989 we introduced HECS as one of many reforms, it was broadly welcomed. People knew it was a fair system. We lifted Australia's investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013.


In more recent times Labor's equity and participation measures, including demand driven funding and HECS-HELP, transformed our tertiary education system. History proved Labor's measures worked: 190,000 more Australians were able to go to university. Many were the first in their families, as I was, to achieve that level of education. Universities Australia research shows marked improvement in the participation rates of students from underrepresented or disadvantaged groups. Between 2008 and 2016 the number of domestic undergraduate students with a disability rose by 106.5 per cent, Indigenous student numbers went up by almost 90 per cent, the number of students of low socioeconomic status increased by 55.3 per cent, and the number of students from regional and remote areas went up by 48.3 per cent. The world is changing quickly, and our policies must keep pace with those changes. We must look to the future and invest in our people if we are to help our young grow into smart, agile, lifelong learners who will innovate and adapt to survive this changing technological landscape. Without this investment right now, Australia will be left behind.

"Morton, Ben, MP",LP,2018-03-26,"



Mr MORTON
 (Tangney) (17:06):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. At its core these amendments ensure the sustainability of our student loan system, recognised as one of the most generous in the world. The bill introduces a new set of repayment thresholds for student loans, changes indexation arrangements for repayment thresholds, amends the order of repayment of some student loan debts and introduces a combined lifetime loan limit for taxpayer funded student loans. I support these amendments because I understand the importance of a tertiary education and want to ensure future generations have the same opportunity I had. Like the previous speaker, I was the first in my family, and one of only a handful at my high school, to go to university. It was a privilege to receive my university education with no up-front cost. My student loan was funded by people like my brothers, who work in the construction industry, and my family members, who work hard in their small business and who didn't go to university but paid taxes to give me the opportunity to borrow from them, the taxpayer, through the government to better myself and get the education. The privilege of receiving that student loan came with a responsibility for me to repay it.


Unfortunately, under the current system some students will never accept the responsibility of repaying their taxpayer funded student loans. They are happy to accept the student loan provided to them by the hardworking Australian taxpayers but have not repaid it. As of 30 June 2017 only $35.9 billion out of the total debt of $55.4 billion will likely be repaid. I absolutely support these amendments, which I believe will ultimately reduce the debt load. However, I believe that for the long-term sustainability of the system we will need to go further. I was pleasantly surprised by the contribution from the Labor member for Bruce, who last year spoke about the importance of debt recovery from the states. To be very clear, this would not be a death tax. As the member for Bruce said, it is simply:



… requiring HELP debts to be repaid, just like tax or social security debts …



I agree that there is a strong policy case to look at the option of recouping student debts from certain estates. I believe those who enter into student loan agreements do so freely. There needs to be an understanding that these loans are from the Australian taxpayer and must be repaid. It would be my absolute pleasure to work with the member for Bruce on further measures in a very bipartisan way.


It remains our intent to ensure Australians who have not gone to university are not unfairly bearing the costs of those who have not repaid their loans. In the same way, those who have had the opportunity to attend university and have diligently paid off their loans should not be made to bear the cost. We must continue to work on this issue. It is all about fairness. The reality is that taxpayer funded student loan repayments have not kept pace with lending growth. Since 2009 funding for Commonwealth supported places has grown at twice the rate of the economy, and from 2011 to 2017 the level of new debt not expected to be repaid increased from 16 per cent to 25 per cent. It is a serious concern that, according to the 2016 Australian National Audit Office estimates, on its current trajectory, by 2024-25 outstanding HELP debts will total $192.5 billion and almost 30 per cent—$55 billion—will not be repaid. Imagine the differences that $55 billion would make if invested in our education system or other government services.


We need to take action now the ensure that our higher education system is sustainable. Announced in MYEFO, these policy measures will replace the previous legislative proposals from the 2017-18 budget. I supported the previous reforms and I was disappointed they were voted down in the Senate.


We all have skin in this game of education, whether it be as a former, current or future student, a parent, a taxpayer, an educator, as administrators or, ultimately, as employers in business or service providers in every corner of Australia. The new amendments propose that from 1 July 2018 there be a lower minimum repayment threshold of $45,000 at a one per cent repayment rate. There will be smaller incremental rises in thresholds and repayment rates up to a top threshold of $131,989, at which 10 per cent of income is repayable. The minimum repayment threshold is $10,000 less than the current threshold of $55,000.


This repayment threshold will then be indexed according to the consumer price index rather than the average weekly earnings. This change is consistent with recommendations from both the National Commission of Audit in 2014 and the Grattan Institute. This change in indexation is important to ensure that those who have dropped out of the repayment streams as the thresholds rise faster than their income growth are brought back in and are repaying their student loans sooner. This will ensure repayment requirements are adjusted in line with the cost of living.


Other key changes come in the form of student thresholds for the Student Financial Supplement Scheme, which will be brought into line with the HELP repayment thresholds from 1 July 2019. This is to improve rates of repayment by replacing the three-tier threshold approach applied to Student Financial Supplement Scheme repayments with a new HELP threshold. This change ensures the HELP debt takes priority over other student loan debts.


Finally, there will be an introduction of new combined loan limits on how much students can borrow under taxpayer funded student loans to cover their tuition fees. The combined limit is $150,000 for students studying medicine, dentistry and vet science courses and $104,440 for other students. These limits would be sufficient to cover the study of even the most expensive courses for almost nine years as a Commonwealth supported, taxpayer supported student. The loan limit is not new, but it will now apply to HECS-HELP as well as students accessing the FEE-HELP, VET FEE-HELP and VET student loans.


But these amendments are all about fairness. Income contingent loans, the basis of our taxpayer funded student loan system, were introduced as an answer to maintaining access and equity as well as providing less of a burden on the taxpayer. From inception, the repayment threshold was never set according to an optimum economic model or theory. It was purely driven by a sense of fairness. I'm proud that this government is making changes to ensure that there is real fairness in student loans. It is not fair to take a loan from the taxpayer to further yourself, to better yourself, and then not pay that loan back to the taxpayer, because taxpayers are people like my brother and my family members, who work hard in small business, who have never been to university, who have worked hard and paid their taxes to give me that opportunity. If I was to take from them a loan in order to get an education but then not to pay that back, that would be robbing future societies and generations of the opportunity that I've had.


It is not fair that everyone who's paid off a taxpayer funded student loan in full, like I have, should shoulder the burden of those students who have chosen not to. The failure of some students to pay their loans makes our education more expensive for everyone. Taking a student loan from hardworking taxpayers and not repaying it is taking a free ride. But let's not forget that students currently only pay an average of 42 per cent of the cost of their degree. The rest is already subsidised by the taxpayer. 


When we're talking about student loans, we're not talking about students borrowing the total cost of their entire education. As I said, 42 per cent of their degree, on average, is funded through student loans—the rest by the hardworking taxpayers in Australia. Research from the Grattan Institute indicates that the split for average contributions would move to 64 per cent government and 36 per cent student if we take into account debt that would probably not be repaid, and this is unsustainable. 


I congratulate Minister Birmingham on these new amendments. Unfortunately, those opposite and a select group of education institutions have chosen to cloud and misrepresent this critical debate. Labor's Treasury spokesman called the measures an attack on one of the sources of Australia's long-term prosperity. Well, the shadow Treasurer is right about one thing: education is a source of Australia's long-term prosperity. This government's approach to student loan repayments is consistent with intergenerational equity. It is consistent with ensuring university education will be sustainable in the long term. This is a responsible suite of reforms and is in stark contrast to the brash approach from the Labor Party, who, when they were last in government, announced $6 billion worth of cuts to the higher education support sector. 


We cannot afford to be complacent and risk jeopardising opportunities for future generations of students, who will also want to access student loans that remove all up-front fees from higher education. The time to change is now, and the opposition's position on this legislation only puts the entire system in jeopardy. I would like all Australian kids to have the opportunity I had, the opportunity to go to university at no up-front cost. But if we don't have a sustainable system, we won't have that opportunity in the future. 


We need to ensure that our system can respond to the impact of the tremendous expansion in student numbers. Over the last quarter of a century, private education student numbers grew at more than three times the rate of the population as a whole. This growth has imposed significant costs on taxpayers. The astounding thirst for education has been enabled by the demand driven system in recent years. 


It has also been driven by the reality that a post-school qualification remains one of the best investments an individual can make. University graduates enjoy consistently higher employment and incomes than those who only complete high school. Our higher education system is exceedingly successful and has an excellent reputation, both here and overseas. Tertiary education now spans a competitive market, where providers are more numerous, more diverse and more commercially oriented than they ever were before. Education is one of our most successful exports and is a significant source of income for our universities. In 2016 education export income reached its highest level ever at $21.8 billion. 


This legislation lays out achievable reforms that can safeguard the position of the education sector for the future. We cannot underestimate the importance of a sustainable student loan scheme. It brings certainty to the sector, which has been unanimous about the need for change and has been left waiting long enough. The Australian taxpayer student loan scheme remains one of the most successful public policy innovations ever, ensuring a vibrant education export industry, support for student career aspirations and a skilled workforce for our industry.


Where this legislation does have a financial impact on students, we will implement changes in a way that is gradual, fair and appropriate. These reforms ensure our high-quality tertiary education system can grow while meeting the global challenges it will increasingly face. It guarantees that students will continue to have access to higher education, irrespective of their background or financial means. These amendments, in line with the broader government plans, will deliver $1.2 billion in savings over the next two years. 


In the lead-up to last year's budget the Prime Minister said:


… we call on the other parties … to support us in bringing the budget back into balance. It is a responsibility that weighs heavily on the shoulders of every single member of the house and—


in particular—


… the Senate …


This government has made substantial progress, with MYEFO showing this year's federal deficit has improved by $5.8 billion compared to forecasts in the May budget. Education savings are an essential part of this broader budget strategy. 


Frankly, we're all in this together. Taxpayers, whose support means that no-one must pay up-front course fees, will get a better deal knowing that the Turnbull government is looking after them and making sure their investment is repaid. Our taxpayer funded student loan scheme was not designed to facilitate a lifelong limitless cash pool for students who choose not to pay back their student loans. 


Taxpayer generosity should not be taken for granted. The measures in this bill were designed with fairness and sustainability at their core. Commonwealth financial assistance through taxpayer funded student loans still means that no student will need to pay one cent up-front for their higher education. But students cannot take this assistance for granted. Taxpayer funded student loans must be repaid to ensure that the system is sustainable and is available for future generations.


These amendments are about fairness. These amendments are about someone entering into a loan. These are amendments about making sure that people who enter into a loan repay that loan. To think that there is opposition to a situation where you're asking someone to pay back a loan that they've entered into means that my mind boggles. This is about fairness; it's about fairness for the taxpayer that funds these loans and it's also about ensuring that more and more students can have the opportunity that I've had in receiving an education with no up-front fees. I hope that more students can have the same opportunity that I've had as well. Thank you.

"McBride, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (17:21):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loans Sustainability) Bill 2018. I oppose the bill, as it attacks student and it undermines the fairness of Australia's world-class student loan scheme. As we have heard, the bill makes a number of changes to Australia's income contingent loan scheme, the Higher Education Loan Program—HELP—and makes technical changes to the Student Financial Supplement Scheme. This is the first point on which I will focus.


This bill sets new repayment thresholds for HELP from 1 July 2018, starting with a new minimum repayment of $45,000 and with a one per cent repayment rate. There are a further 17 thresholds and repayment rates, up to a top threshold of $131,989, at which 10 per cent of payment would apply. It aligns the indexation of HELP repayment thresholds to CPI instead of to average weekly earnings and introduces a new combined loan limit on how much students can borrow under HELP to cover tuition fees from 1 January 2019. The combined limit would be $104,440, or $150,000 for students studying medicine, dentistry or vet science.


The government has previously tried to make changes to the HELP repayment threshold, attempting to lower the HELP repayment rate to $42,000 a year. Labor argued that this was too low. The bill did not make it through the Senate and was subsequently withdrawn. The proposal for a lifetime borrowing limit is a new proposal from the government and has significant implications for students. While the borrowing limit has been introduced in the VET student loan system—a proposal that Labor took to the last election—there has yet to be a limit for all loan schemes in the system.


Traditionally, Commonwealth supported places, or HECS places, did not have a borrowing limit for students. Students taking other courses that are not subsidised, like full-fee postgraduate coursework places, could take out a loan for the fees through the FEE-HELP scheme. Full fees were set by universities and higher education providers and have not been regulated, which has led to some students taking on significant debt. While there is some merit to sending a price signal through a lifetime borrowing limit, the proposal in this bill may have a range of unintended consequences and therefore must not be supported.


Labor referred this bill to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, and the committee tabled its report on 16 March. I support the position of the Labor senators in their dissenting report. This bill would have unintended and negative consequences on students, particularly students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and therefore must not be supported.


Income contingent loans have been a part of higher education since Labor introduced HECS in 1989. More recently, Labor's demand-driven funding, in conjunction with the HECS-HELP scheme and other equity and participation measures, has transformed higher education in Australia. As Universities Australia has shown, there has been a significant boost in university enrolments from underrepresented and disadvantaged students. This is such a critical point: universities are now open, more than ever before, to students from those underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds. It is important that we spend some time looking at those numbers.


From 2008 to 2016 the following growth occurred: the number of domestic undergraduate students grew from 24,311 to 50,206, a staggering 106.5 per cent. The proportion of students with a disability participating rose from 4.3 per cent to 6.4 per cent. The number of Indigenous students grew from 7,038 to 13,320, an increase of 89.3 per cent. The number of students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds grew from 90,467 to 140,462, an increase of 55.3 per cent. The number of students from remote and regional areas, such as mine, grew from 110,000 to 163,292, an increase of 48.3 per cent. In total, the number of undergraduate students from all these backgrounds—students with a disability, Indigenous students, and students from remote areas—grew 39.6 per cent.


What a remarkable success story that we have nearly 40 per cent more students from these groups going to university. Why are they doing that? Because there are pathways available, because higher education is seen as valuable and it's accessible because barriers are being removed. We know that high student debt is a genuine barrier to study for students from low-SES and disadvantaged backgrounds, so we must remove barriers, not put them up again. In my electorate of Dobell, on the Central Coast, we have the Ourimbah campus of the University of Newcastle, which is playing a vital role in removing these barriers. I want to quote—I know she's been quoted already this evening—the Vice Chancellor and President of the University of Newcastle, Professor Caroline McMillen, who said to a parliamentary committee hearing earlier this month:


As our mission, we are committed to equity and excellence. We have some 37,000 students, 27 per cent from low socioeconomic backgrounds, which reflects our demographics in the regions we serve, and around 1,000 are Indigenous, which is the largest number of any Australian university.


She further said:


… this university since its foundation has served the demographics of the region by ensuring we do not trade equity for excellence.


'We do not trade equity for excellence' are important words, and that is an important mission. In higher education, excellence is vital, equity is vital and access is necessary. Yet this government wants to increase student debt and make it harder for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to get a foot in the door.


At the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle, health is a big area of study. The university partners with the Central Coast local health district, where I used to work, and the PHN. Health and social services, my area of training and background, is one of the largest employers in our region on the Central Coast. Importantly, it is also one of the growth areas for future work. With higher education comes jobs—local jobs, quality jobs.


At the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle, enabling programs such as Open Foundation and Newstep are trusted pathways for students to get started, pathways to further study. Almost one in four commencing students at our campus starts their education through these enabling programs. They are the pathway for so many, for nurses like Michelle, who was recognised as Wyong hospital nurse of the year last year. I have spoken about Michelle before. She would not be a nurse without enabling education. She would not be serving our community at Wyong hospital without access to higher education. I've also spoken about Sam, who is now a speech pathologist and whose sister is training to be a teacher. Sam said she really noticed the impact on her sons of seeing her study. They could see their mother was studying at university, and they could see that they might be able to study at university too.


Today I'd like to speak about my friend Renee, a graduate of the Central Coast campus Open Foundation course, and now a neonatal intensive care nurse. These are Renee's own words:


The fact that there is an opportunity like Open Foundation has given me the confidence to do something I never knew I could do. I never thought I was smart enough when I was at school to commence university. Never once did I ever think that I would complete a bachelor degree. I ended up completing a bachelor of nursing with distinction. Now I work within one of the elite hospitals and it's my privilege to work with vulnerable families in the neonatal intensive care unit.


Labor understands the benefits of education to families. We understand that it can transform lives. Dr Joyleen Christensen, who I went to primary school with, is a program convener for enabling education at the same campus. Joy speaks about the impact of higher education on students who are the first ever in their family to go to university. She said:


These students have so many obstacles already. The reason many of them are involved is to improve the financial situation for them and for their families. They are taking time away from work. They are taking time away from their families and money away from their families to find out whether they can do this. They have incredible potential. This program is life changing for them, their families and our community. It transforms lives.


It's transformed the lives of Michelle and Renee, and the contribution they make through their nursing is invaluable to our community.


The Dean of the Central Coast campus, Dr Brok Glenn, told me earlier today that in 2018 more than half of commencing students, 55 per cent, are the first in their family to go to university. It is an outstanding achievement. This, he said, is about enabling programs, working with high schools and actually getting students and their parents onto the campus so they can see for themselves what is possible. On the Central Coast, only half of students have the opportunity to finish high school, and fewer than half of the working-age population, 45 per cent, have qualifications post-school. Access to higher education is making a difference.


The effect on women of the changes to HELP repayment thresholds must also be considered, as women will be disproportionately affected by these changes. Sixty per cent of Australians with outstanding HELP debt are women, and two-thirds of the Australians who will be dragged into the debt pool with the proposed new repayment threshold will be women. This bill should be rejected on that premise alone.


Labor believes that the time for an inquiry into Australia's post-secondary education system has come. We must have a scheme that is fit for purpose, that intersects with our tax and social security systems and that treats all students equitably. We must have a system that suits the needs of a changing post-secondary education system; that suits the needs of lifetime learners.


While Labor is not opposed to sending a price signal through a loan cap, this bill would have unintended consequences. Under the current FEE-HELP scheme there are a range of courses which have fees in excess of $100,000. Labor fully supports a system that allows Australians to defer fees for postgraduate and further study. These days many students will choose both vocational and higher education qualifications. The proposal for a one-off borrowing limit is clearly inadequate for lifelong learning needs. Labor is concerned about reckless fee setting, and a price signal needs to be accompanied by further reforms. We must not have a system that forces students to take out commercial loans to pay for the gap between fees set by universities and the loan borrowing amount. This bill does nothing to discourage reckless high-fee setting. Student debt is a major concern for students, for their families and for all of Australia. The contribution Australian students make to the cost of their university education is already the sixth-highest in the OECD, and two-thirds of Australian students in 2012 were found to live below the Henderson poverty line, with one in five regularly skipping meals.


This government often talks about choice, but choice is a privilege. We need to make pathways to higher education easier, not harder. Labor is determined to end the war on young people in this country that's being waged by this government. We must not put barriers in their way, and the barriers to higher education are ones we have started to break down. This government continues to cut services and to try to charge students more. It is not the way to equity and it is not the way to excellence. Students at the Ourimbah campus of the University of Newcastle cannot afford cuts to education. They cannot afford to pay more.


As I said at the outset, I oppose this bill as an attack on students and an attack on the fairness of our world-class student loan system. Labor will not support any legislation that puts education out of the reach of the most vulnerable people in our community, people who are starting out in life, people who are starting over in life and people who have never had a start in life.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms CLAYDON

 (
Newcastle
) (
17:34
):  I rise to join with my Labor colleagues on this side of the House in our complete opposition to this bill. We have a series of grave concerns with the Turnbull government's Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. Firstly, it's an unfair bill that actively undermines Australia's world-class education system. It would penalise women and disadvantaged and vulnerable Australians, and hurt regional communities and economies like mine in Newcastle. It's yet another example of this government's relentless war on young Australians. It's telling that only two government members were willing to stand up today and back this bill. When government members can't even bring themselves to support their own legislation, you know something is wrong.


The bill proposes a number of changes to the Australian income contingent student loan scheme, HELP, formerly known as HECS. It sets a new, lower threshold of just $45,000 at which students must start repaying their student debt. It also introduces a lifetime limit of $104,440 on how much students can borrow for their tuition fees. This bill represents a terrible betrayal of young Australians, as it will make it harder for them to gain higher education. It will be the final nail in the coffin for some with university aspirations. From the beginning Labor had concerns about the impacts of this legislation, particularly for low-income earners, disadvantaged students and, as I mentioned before, women. We were concerned about the impacts it would have on young people in regional areas and the communities they live in, so we sent it to a Senate inquiry for consideration. Regrettably, the inquiry did little to allay our concerns.


The first measure proposed in the bill is to lower the repayment threshold to $45,000. This is the second attempt by this government, after failing to reduce the threshold to $42,000 last time around. Labor supports HECS-HELP. There is no argument from us on that front. We believe in the principle that Australians should contribute towards the cost of their education, from which they and all of us benefit, but we agree with those many people who made submissions to the Senate inquiry that $45,000 is simply too low. As the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations pointed out in its submission to the inquiry, $45,000 is only slightly more than half the average wage; it is in fact only $9,000 more than the minimum wage, as the Australian Council of Trade Unions rightly stated.


On this income, take-home pay is $37,928 a year, a little over $700 a week, after tax and Medicare levies are subtracted. Once you cover the basic costs of living, including—let's not forget—the skyrocketing rents many of these students are paying, transport, food, insurance and ever-increasing power bills, there is precious little left. For many, every spare dollar is funnelled into scraping together a deposit for a home, which could easily top $100,000 in many parts of the country. That is in no small part due to the Turnbull government's absolutely dogged refusal to do anything about the outrageous tax concessions provided to support property investors over and above what we offer to first home buyers. Incredibly, many young people are trying to do all of this with the extra financial burden of raising a young family at the same time. You can see no clearer example of pressure on our young people.


Yet, in another stunning display of just how out of touch it is with Australians on low incomes, the Turnbull government has decided it is completely fair and reasonable to start taking even more money from these people—utterly unbelievable!


It's no wonder that young Australians are furious with the Turnbull government. They have, of course, every right to be, especially given that a large number of government members went through university at a time of free education, bought their houses with the help of government subsidies and now get to rake in the tax benefits of negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions at the federal budget's expense. 


Labor doesn't believe that we should make students start repaying their debt at the same time when they're trying to start their careers and start families and when they're earning, often, the very lowest rates in their respective professions. Labor also has grave concerns about the impacts of reducing the HELP repayment thresholds on disadvantaged Australians and discouraging them from ever undertaking higher education in the first place. This is particularly relevant for many communities in and around the Newcastle and Hunter region, because those areas are characterised by very significant disadvantage and, indeed, lower levels of education attainment. I'm extremely proud of the equity record of my local university, the University of Newcastle, where 27 per cent of students come from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Many are the first in their family to go to university. But these are exactly the kinds of people who are going to be hurt by this bill, as they are more likely to decide against higher education rather than put themselves in a precarious financial situation. 


In a submission to the Senate inquiry on this bill, the University of Newcastle raised concerns that these cohorts are much more likely to be sensitive to price—I couldn't agree more—and that they are disproportionately likely to decide against taking on higher education if the repayment threshold were lowered. The submission also made the important point that, for some students, repayments could kick in before they even have completed their studies. This would only serve to further intensify the financial pressures potentially affecting completion rates and graduate outcomes. This will be a great shame for our universities and a huge loss for our region. When you add these measures to the estimated $69 million that the government is ripping out of the University of Newcastle through the MYEFO cuts, there's going to be a lot of pain ahead for our community. 


I'm also very concerned about the disproportionate impacts this lowering of the HECS repayment threshold will have on women. As the President of the National Union of Students, Mr Mark Pace, stated:


We know from the National Tertiary Education Union's submission to this Senate inquiry that 60 per cent of all Australians with outstanding HELP debt are women and that two-thirds of the Australians who will be dragged into the debt pool with the new proposed repayment thresholds will also be women …


I agree with Mr Pace that this is yet another reason for rejecting this bill. 


I'd now like to turn to the proposed cap in the bill which would put a lifetime limit of $104,440 on the value of higher education that can be supported through the loan system. For students doing medicine, dentistry and veterinary science, that cap would be $150,000. The new HELP limit would apply to HECS-HELP loans, FEE-HELP loans, VET FEE-HELP loans and VET student loans. Again, this is a measure Labor cannot support. As many people giving evidence to the Senate inquiry pointed out, many prospective students will find that there simply isn't the scope to take on further studies or to expand their expertise into new areas. Others pointed out that the cap is likely to hurt people who haven't taken a traditional pathway to study and many have taken extra courses to achieve their academic goals. The proposal for a lifetime cap also stands in stark contrast to the unavoidable reality that education is becoming a lifelong process, something that you don't bid farewell to in your early 20s. In fact, continuous upskilling will be increasingly important for people who want to remain competitive in a highly dynamic jobs market. Again, this proposed measure will have a disproportionate impact on regional communities like mine. As the University of Newcastle points out in its submission, this limit will hurt our region's economic transformation by preventing some people from engaging in critical retraining and reskilling, especially in the high-cost fields like STEM and health, which may require specialist postgraduate qualifications.


This bill provides yet more evidence that the only ideas this government has shown for higher education are to levy cuts and to force students to pay more. Just look at its destructive plan for university deregulation, which would have led to $100,000 degrees and lifelong debt sentences for students. Or perhaps we could consider the bill that preceded this one, which included $2.8 billion worth of cuts. Of course, the Senate refused to pass this. But, in a shameless display of its true 'born to rule' character, the government completely disregarded the will of the parliament and snuck $2.2 billion worth of cuts through the back door in the midyear budget update.


In contrast, Labor has a fantastic legacy of which I am very proud. When we were last in government, we increased funding for universities from $8 billion to $14 billion each year and introduced a demand driven funding system. This saw an additional 190,000 students get a place at university, many of whom were the very first in their family to ever set foot on a university campus. Investing in education is one of the best means we have to drive productivity and economic growth, especially by encouraging people from disadvantaged backgrounds to go to university, and we know that these reforms work.


As Universities Australia presented in its submission to the inquiry on this bill, there was a 106.5 per cent boost to people with disability undertaking undergraduate study. In the same time frame, there were 89.3 per cent more Indigenous students, 55 per cent more low socioeconomic status students and 48.3 per cent more regional and remote students. It is unquestionably a positive thing, not just for the individuals that improve their education levels and their life opportunities but for the entire country, because investment in education has flow-on effects for the whole society. This is backed up by recent figures from the OECD, which showed the Australian public, not individuals, benefit most from higher education. In fact, this OECD work shows that the public rate of return from tertiary education in Australia is twice the rate of return to the individual, despite the fact that individuals shoulder more of the cost.


The Turnbull government wants you to believe that the current HECS arrangements aren't sustainable. They want you to think that we need to rein in the amount of education that people can undertake and make them start repaying their student loans sooner. I'll tell you what's not sustainable: giving people who earn over $180,000 a year a tax cut while you're hiking up taxes for people on $30,000—that's not sustainable. Refusing to act on the billions of dollars of cash handouts that are going to Australian shareholders who don't pay any tax—that is not sustainable. And doing absolutely nothing to rein in excessive tax concessions for property investors—that is not sustainable. But I'll tell you what's really not sustainable: hiking the national debt to more than half a trillion dollars and then hatching a diabolical plan to shovel a further $65 billion out the door in corporate tax cuts, because that's what this bill is really all about. It's not about a crisis in the HECS or HELP scheme; it's about a government desperate to pay up on its promise to big business. This is a shameful bill before this parliament. I stand strong and proud with Labor in our opposition.

"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",CA,2018-03-26,"



Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (17:49):  As I rise to speak on this bill, I must begin by reiterating my support for Australia's higher education sector. For the sector to thrive, it must be sustainable. There is a delicate balance to be struck and I believe that the government's previous reform package, which failed to pass the Senate, did not get the balance right. I believe this bill comes a lot closer, although there are amendments that NXT will be seeking before we give our wholehearted support. 


This bill presents two major changes to the current system: firstly, a reduction in the HELP repayment threshold to $45,000, and, secondly, a cap on the loan amount a student can access in their lifetime. The idea of a cap on the amount of money a student can borrow from the Commonwealth is one I agree with in principle. In fact, I first raised this idea with Minister Birmingham last year. I believe that Australia's Higher Education Loan Program is world leading and something this country can be proud of. It allows students from all backgrounds to access university education without having the burden of up-front cost that students in many other countries face. 


However, as with any Commonwealth loan, it should not be a free-for-all. A university education gives a proven benefit to Australian society, but it is not in the nation's interests for the HELP scheme to be open slather with mounting debts, some of which will never be repaid. A cap sends an important message to students that the government will not support elongated study where it results in excessive loan amounts that are unlikely to be repaid. A student should understand that. Just like any other loan or debt, student loans must be repaid. Being a professional student, collecting endless degrees and not moving into a job really isn't viable for our nation. 


However, a lifetime cap is also not the answer. Increasingly, it's becoming clear that lifelong learning will become a regular feature of the Australian way of life. This government has, indeed, foreshadowed this. I again make reference to the Prime Minister's first statement as the leader of our country, where he stressed that he wanted Australia to be innovative and agile. Clearly, the ability to learn new things and to upskill is a fundamental part of being an innovative nation. For that reason, I struggle to understand why the government has proposed a lifetime cap on student learning. 


We should not be asking Australian students to be put in a position where they can graduate, work and pay off their HELP loans and yet be prevented from accessing Commonwealth support for future study. We know that today's graduates are likely to change jobs 17 times in their lifetime, and will most likely change career sectors completely. So, for this reason, I'm calling on the government to amend this bill to ensure that we can place a cap on student outstanding debt but that we can also ensure that if a person does pay off that debt, if they get below their cap, they can continue to study in another area at another time in their life. I note that this recommendation was put forward by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and Employment and, indeed, government members of the committee supported that the cap would be replenishable. I understand the government will be moving amendments to change this aspect of the bill, and I look forward to those amendments being moved. 


This bill also seeks to reduce the payment threshold for HELP loans to $45,000. I spoke on this issue during the debate of last year's higher education reform package, where I and my NXT colleagues rejected a proposal to lower the threshold to $42,000. I said then that I was willing to consider alternative thresholds, and that is the position that I maintain and NXT maintains. Australia's HELP system is one of the most generous in the world, significantly more so than the New Zealand system, which has a repayment threshold of $18,000, and the UK system, which has a repayment threshold of approximately A$36,000. I recognise that there is a growing amount of outstanding student debt, and the government does not expect this to be repaid. For this reason, NXT is willing to consider the proposed change to the thresholds if the government can commit to changing the lifetime cap to being a replenishable cap. I believe that a significant benefit of this measure over the government's previous proposal is ensuring that the repayment rate does not lift above one per cent until a graduate is earning over $51,000 per year. We believe this is a reasonable balance. 


I take this opportunity again to reiterate my previous calls for a comprehensive review into the post-secondary education sector. I called for such a review last October, and I am pleased to see that this has become part of the policy for the Australian Labor Party. This review must involve the federal and state governments. It must involve universities and the vocational education sector, including, of course, apprenticeships. We need to examine how we prepare the next generation for the world of work and ensure the pillars are in place for young people to successfully transition to sustainable employment.


Australia's higher education sector is one of the best in the world, but it needs to be supported. The government's recent cuts to universities during MYEFO were a cruel blow to the sector, and it is a sector that has faced so many cuts in recent years from both sides of the House. I believe this bill should be amended and that it will contribute to a stronger higher education sector. So for this reason I support the bill in this House, pending those amendments by government, as I referred to. Thank you.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (17:55):  I, too, would like to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. From the outset, I make it clear that Labor will be opposing this bill, and I also note the cacophony of voices opposite—all those rallying to support this piece of legislation! I just looked at the speaking list, and I noticed that of all those opposite they have only two members willing to come along and speak in support of the legislation.


This is an unfair piece of legislation and one that attacks students. It undermines the fairness and accessibility of Australia's higher education system. The bill is another example of the government's relentless attack on our universities, which are, no doubt, integral to the future of our nation. The bill also gives effect to a policy measure announced in the government's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This is very, very short sighted. It is a package of $2.2 billion of cuts for universities—measures that represent the government's fourth attempt since coming into office to cut universities and make students pay more. Nevertheless, we heard the Turnbull government—and the Minister for Education and Training, in particular—boasting that these cuts will put our higher education system on a more sustainable and responsible path for the future. 


This is the same style of rhetoric that we heard when the government tried to introduce their original package of cuts in the 2017 budget. That was $3.8 billion of cuts to universities and an increase in student fees. Those measures were not passed by the Senate and they were not passed for a very, very good reason: they were bad policy. It seems nothing has changed. These were the biggest cuts to the sector proposed since the Howard government's horror 1996 budget. These cuts were accompanied by a number of poorly designed policies and thought bubbles, and that continues today. None of the ideas that the government have proposed were really about reform that would produce or promote enhancement of the sector, and the same can be said about those legislative measures proposed by the bill we are debating today.


Real reform actually requires vision for the future, rather than a government solely driven to cut and diminish the significant role that universities play and, to that extent, that students who attend universities play in our future. This is solely about cost-cutting, and there's no doubt there's a reason that underpins that. Of course, you can't expect those opposite to change their spots and to take a different view of higher education. After all, they are the same bunch that came into this place intent on taking $17 billion from our schools, $637 million from our TAFE colleges and now $2.2 billion from our universities. The targets of the cuts are our higher education institutions—institutions which are, I submit, absolutely vital for our nation's future. But the justifications of these cuts and whether they're issues about pension or a whole raft of other things all fall back to that signature policy of this government: handing out $65 billion of tax cuts to millionaires and big business—effectively, the tax cuts to the top end of town. That justifies what these measures are all about.


Far be it from me to give the government advice, but I will chance my hand on this occasion. If you can't afford it, simply don't do it, but never, ever do it at the expense of future generations. That's precisely what is occurring here today. The unfairness of these cuts is plain and clear. This is a government that keeps proving that it can't be trusted when it comes to the most important investment in our nation's history. An investment in education is an investment in our future. It's an investment in the nation's future. Arguably, it's probably the most important investment decision governments can make, because a lot turns on this. While the measures in this bill are significantly narrower than the scope of the bill in 2017, the point I want to make is that it has the same underlying objectives.


For the purpose of discussion, I'll be focusing my time on talking about the proposed changes in the HELP scheme as opposed to some of the other, technical amendments that are also incorporated in this bill. The income-contingent loan has been a keystone or foundation of the architecture of Australia's fair and accessible higher education system. We on this side of the House understand the role that income-contingent HELP loans play. After all, it was a Labor government that introduced the concept in HECS in 1989. Universities Australia, I think, actually highlighted the integral role played by the HELP scheme when they noted that the scheme underwrote the growth of mass higher education in Australia, and it continues to support the expansion of opportunity. I think that's pretty right.


In conjunction with Labor's demand-driven funding, the HELP scheme has seen historic growth in higher education participation over decades. The transformation of higher education in this country has very much been a key aspect that's flowed from this scheme. As Margaret Gardner, Chair of Universities Australia, demonstrates, there's been a significant boost in the participation of underrepresented and disadvantaged students.


To put that in some perspective, I'd like to share with the House some statistics released by Universities Australia. Universities in Australia now educate 55 per cent more Australians from the poorest one-fifth of households, 48 per cent more students from regional and remote communities, 89 per cent more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and 105 per cent more students with a disability. I think they're outcomes that we should all be particularly proud of. Obviously those opposite have probably hung their heads in shame about this, because they're not participating in this debate—or only two of those opposite are. But this is something where we've shown we can actually transform higher education in this country and make it more accessible. As I say, that's something the House should be proud of, not condemning.


Labor opposes the government's move to lower the HELP repayment threshold to $42,000, because we recognise that it is unfair. As a matter of fact, we actually think the current proposal of a threshold of $45,000 is also unfair. As the Australian Council of Trade Unions indicated, the proposed threshold of $45,000 is only $9,000 more than the minimum wage today.


Illustrating the ramifications of the proposed payment threshold on individual earnings of $45,000 per annum, the ACTU observed that this would leave an individual with a take-home pay of $37,928 once income tax and the Medicare levy is deducted. We believe that the current repayment threshold strikes the appropriate balance. We cannot expect students to repay more than their current debts at the same time as starting a career, setting up and saving for a house—particularly in Sydney and Melbourne and probably Brisbane—and, in many instances, starting a family. 


We know that higher education debt is a genuine barrier to low socioeconomic and disadvantaged students. Equity practitioners in higher education encapsulate the heart of this problem, saying that this measure would disproportionately affect people of low socioeconomic backgrounds, people with disabilities, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. This measure will no doubt have an impact on the community I happen to represent. It's a community I'm certainly very proud of. It's very colourful; it's very vibrant—much like the community of my colleague the member for Werriwa. But our communities are not rich communities. 


The average household income in my community is just a tad over $60,000. We're not a rich community. As a matter of fact, my community's made up heavily of migrants and current refugees. So changing the income rate for all HELP thresholds from average weekly earnings to CPI is also a measure that will be hard-felt by many individuals in low socioeconomic backgrounds, certainly in communities like mine and, no doubt, those communities in regional Australia purportedly being represented by some of those opposite. 


As the Southern Cross Postgraduate Association has noted, it will place an additional hardship on low socioeconomic HELP debtholders at a time that combines with a stagnant wage growth and a rising cost of living. The proposed lifetime borrowing limit also has an impact of eroding the underlying objectives of universal access enshrined in the HELP scheme and the importance of lifelong learning, including the ability of workers to upskill. This will prove critical, given the considerable uncertainty of a future workforce in this country. We are all looking to the future and what that might hold, what the future industries might be, and workers will be undergoing upskilling and training. But this will be putting university education beyond the grasp of many in that situation. 


At a time when we have significant economic transition we should be investing in our people, not making it harder for them to get a university qualification. Australian students already make the sixth-highest contribution to their university fees in the OECD. As Catriona Jackson, the deputy chief of Universities Australia, has emphasised, when contemplating change to the magnitude of this, there should be a first principle in the legislator's mind: do no harm. This government, quite frankly, has done the exact opposite when it comes to education and, in this case, higher education. 


The changes to the HELP scheme are simply budget driven, and it's all about supporting the government's $65 billion tax cut to the big end of town. These measures are not fair, they're not good for universities and they're not good for students. On that basis, they cannot be good for the future prosperity of this nation. In the words of Margaret Gardner, I call on the government not to slam the door of opportunity shut, once more, to Australia's bright minds. Our nation cannot afford it, societally or economically. We must restore our nation's investment in Australian students and, in doing so, our investment in Australia's future.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:09):  What is it with conservative governments and access to opportunity and education for all—no matter what your postcode, no matter your gender, how much your parents earn, your race and your religion is? It took the Whitlam government to open the doors of opportunity for tertiary education. Prior to that, my mother and my father were bright, young Australians—bright, young Victorians. My mother grew up in a Housing Commission house in Preston in Victoria, just down the road from an abattoir. My father was sent off to do a trade, to become an electrician at the ripe old age of 15 because his parents couldn't afford for him to go to university. My mother was dragged kicking and screaming from high school—she also had to leave school at 15. She would have loved to have matriculated, as she calls it, but she was denied that opportunity, thanks to the conservative government that was running this nation for so long and that denied that opportunity for young Australians from working class backgrounds and from disadvantaged backgrounds.


It is the tradition that conservatives deny opportunity to those who are less well-off, to those who are doing it tough. My mother and my father are testimony to that. It wasn't until the Whitlam government and the opportunities that he opened through tertiary education—through free education for so many Australians—that I and my sisters, so many other Canberrans and so many other Australians were the first in their families to be educated.


What did that mean? For me it meant an awful lot. My father left me, my sisters and my mum with $30 in the bank in the seventies, when I was 11. There was no child support agency then, so things were pretty rough. I've spoken about this many times in this chamber, about the fact that we used to eat out every second or third night at family or friends' houses because mum couldn't afford to put food on the table every night of the week. On the nights of the week that we actually did eat at home mum invariably didn't eat, because she was on a seventies diet. The reality was that she couldn't afford to feed herself and her three daughters.


So I come from what I call a working class matriarchy. My great-grandmother was a cleaner in the Western District in Victoria. She left school at 11, denied choice and denied opportunity. She brought up 13 children on her own. She was denied choice and opportunity because she left school at 11. My grandmother left school at 13, and was also a cleaner. She worked three cleaning jobs in hospitals and theatres in Victoria. She brought up seven kids on her own in a Housing Commission house in Preston. Her abiding fear was that the state was going to take her children away. The reason she had that fear was not that she was a bad mother—she most certainly wasn't; she worked three jobs to put food on the table—but that she was poor.


When my dad left my mother and my sisters we were facing the same sort of cycle of disadvantage that had dogged three generations of the working class matriarchy of my family. But, thanks to the power of education—thanks to the transformative power of education—I broke that cycle, my middle sister broke that cycle and my little sister broke that cycle. Here I am, thanks to the transformative power of education, because it is a game changer. It is a silver bullet. I broke that cycle of disadvantage—three generations of disadvantage—and now I have the great honour of representing my community here in parliament. Thanks to the opportunity of education, my middle sister is now Australia's first female Master of Wine, and a scientist and a winemaker in her own right. My little sister is a neurologist, a world expert in dementia and stroke.


What was the game changer? What was the reason for this whole cycle of cleaning and cleaning, denial of opportunity and choice, poverty and disadvantage? The timidity with which you lead your life, where you don't think particular parts of the world are the right place for you, was because of lack of education. As a result of access to education, my sisters and I have been able to live bold lives determined by the choices and opportunities we sought. Education is the silver bullet, the game changer, and the opportunities, choices and game-changing abilities it provides are constantly denied by those opposite, through barriers such as this legislation, to all students, particularly disadvantaged Australians of low socioeconomic backgrounds and people in regional and remote Australia.


The government, as my colleagues have said, is proposing a new minimum repayment income of $45,000 for compulsory repayment of the Higher Education Loan Program, HELP. This change is absolutely outrageous. We've heard from the member for Fowler—I commend him on that speech—that Australia has the sixth-highest rate of student debt in the OECD, yet the government is making it even more onerous for students through these changes. This government is busy giving out $65 billion of tax cuts to the top end of town, yet is continuing to target students in universities right throughout the country. We're not just talking about the University of Sydney, the University of Canberra or the University of Melbourne. Shame on those opposite who represent regional and remote communities for talking in support of this bill! You are denying the young in your communities the opportunity to have a big life.


This government has already cut $28 million over the next three years from the Australian National University in my electorate. Last year the government introduced a plan to make students repay their HELP debts on incomes as low as $42,000; they're currently looking at making it $45,000. Labor opposed that change then and opposes this change now. University graduates face a housing affordability nightmare, a spike in the price of utilities, a second-rate NBN, cuts to penalty rates—the list goes on. Now the government wants students to start paying back their fees at an unreasonably low income. It is unfair: $44,999 sole income is not a lot of money. It's $865 per week. The average rental price for a house in my electorate of Canberra is $540 per week. Factor this in, and university graduates are left with just $325 each week to pay for utilities, transport, mobile phone bills and groceries. This amendment would add student fees to that already long list of expenses. And, if a sole income earner had any dependants, it would force them close to the poverty line. Can you imagine trying to pay back the debt and deal with those utility costs, particularly rent here? The average rent here in the electorate of Canberra is $540. If you've got dependants, it's mighty tough. The government is asking people to pay back their student loans before they even consider what they'll be able to feed their family.


Students in my electorate are already struggling with the prospect of paying back these debts. This amendment will change the future of students who have planned their life after university. Students will feel forced to take a job they may not have studied for because the salary's bigger, just so they can pay back that loan sooner than expected. I've heard of students who, as I said, are doing it tough—rent, utilities, and just trying to get food on the table. We all know that textbooks are expensive. They're always a huge hit for parents doing it tough at secondary schools and they're a huge hit for students doing it tough at the tertiary level, because we are looking at hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars for textbooks.


I've heard about the concerns amongst Canberra's students about this proposal. They are very, very concerned about it. Some of them are wondering whether they'll continue to study. We've got a student who says she feels betrayed by the government, particularly if this amendment's passed. She labels it 'a new level of pressure'. These students are already under significant pressure and here they are faced with a new level of pressure by this conservative government—another cut in education. It's just constant.


The 2014 budget was probably the piece de resistance when it came to the tone, values and principles of this conservative government opposite. The government haven't learned from the 2014 budget. Nothing has been learned from the 2014 budget. It's just constant attacks particularly on those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, particularly on those doing it tough, particularly on those from regional and remote Australia, and particularly on the disadvantaged.


Not only is education about opportunity but it's about fairness. The same opportunity should be offered to every Australian, no matter where they live or what their income. I've spoken about my story and how it unleashed so much opportunity and choice for me and my sisters. I am blessed to have participated in a quality public education and am blessed to have participated in free education as a result of a Whitlam government—a government that realised the opportunities for all Australians in innovation, in creating a modern society, in creating an inquisitive society, in creating a curious society. It was a government that realised the wonder that is offered up as a result of education.


Then we've got conservative governments. We started with Menzies and then Fraser, and now we've got this Abbott-Turnbull government, a government that has never, ever had one plan for education. It's had multiple plans, and they were all about cuts—at the secondary level, at the tertiary level, at the vocational level. Since this government took office, $17 billion has been cut from our schools, nearly $3 billion has been cut from vocational education, and Australia has lost 140,000 apprenticeships and traineeships. My electorate of Canberra has seen a 30 per cent decline in apprentice and trainee graduates since this government's been in power. And, with universities, we've seen cuts after cuts—$2.2 billion worth of cuts nationally; $28 million worth of cuts from here in Canberra under this government. It was Labor that opened the door of universities to 190,000 more Australians, many of whom were the first in their family to be educated. This government just slams it shut in their faces.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (18:25):  Labor does not support this bill and nor do I. I believe that a university education should not be denied to anybody. My parents would dearly have loved to go to university, but they came from families where it was financially not possible. My parents went without so that my siblings and I could have a good, quality education, and that included a university education. I am privileged and honoured to be here representing my electorate in this parliament, and that is as a result of my hard work and the university education that I had. I have two brothers, one who is principal of a boys college and one who is executive principal of a large secondary college, and I have a sister who is a family law barrister, all because our parents worked hard to ensure that we had the opportunity they were denied—that is, a university education.


This then begs the question: what is wrong with the entitled members sitting opposite me on the government benches, given that a large number of these Turnbull government members have happily risen to the top of their careers and entered this parliament on the back of Labor policy? Many government ministers and backbenchers have benefited from Labor's free higher education, yet when they come to power in government they simply slam the door shut in the faces of others.


There are a number of Turnbull government ministers who attended university between 1974 and 1988, when students did not pay fees. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and other frontbench figures, such as our former Attorney-General, George Brandis, and the Minister for Defence, Marise Payne, are among those who attended university when education was free. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott received a free university education. Foreign Minister Bishop, the former Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, Treasurer Scott Morrison, and the Minister for Defence Industry, Christopher Pyne, attended university for one year when education was free. The Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, the former Minister for Social Services, Christian Porter, and the Minister for Jobs and Innovation, Michaelia Cash, also attended university for at least one year when their education was free. In total, seven Turnbull government ministers were at university when students were not charged fees, while the other eight would have had at least one year of free university education. It is an absolute disgrace and a blatant demonstration of double standards that these Turnbull government elected representatives have benefited from a Labor policy—that is, a free university education—but they in turn feel justified in making it harder for anyone else wanting to attend university.


Labor has always been a party of high aspirations for all of our citizens. Labor has always said that it should never be your financial status that decides whether or not you can attend university. Whether you are a young kid from Kelso or from inner Sydney, Labor does not discriminate based on your postcode. No matter who you are, Labor believes that you have the human right to access education in order to better yourself and increase your contribution to society.


Labor is very aware of the strong links between education, quality employment and prospering economies. The skills of the future will be taught in our universities, and particularly in regional universities. Yet this government is hell-bent on punishing students from disadvantaged backgrounds by denying them the opportunity to attend university and to build a competitive Australia, because they most likely will not be able to afford to attend university. That is why Labor opposes this bill, and that is why I once again say I am proud to stand with Labor and fight these unfair cuts. The Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 is an unfair piece of legislation that attacks students and undermines the fairness of our world-class student loan system. The MYEFO package of $2.2 billion cuts is the government's fourth attempt since coming to office to cut university funding and make students pay more.


In all of Australia there is only one degree that is internationally ranked, and I am proud to say that it is at James Cook University, in my electorate of Herbert. ANU, University of Queensland, Monash—none of them can lay claim to having an internationally ranked No. 1 degree, but James Cook University in Townsville, North Queensland, can. Yet this university will be severely punished by this unfair cut. James Cook University holds the prestigious honour of being awarded the No. 1 status for a marine science degree, yet this government is cutting $36 million to James Cook University. James Cook University is a genuine regional university that was built by the blood, sweat and tears of local business people because our community dared to dream that our young people, whose families could not afford to send them south to study, could study at home.


Then there is my university, Central Queensland University, where the Turnbull government is cutting $38 million. These are universities that are embedded in regional Queensland communities. These are universities that strive for excellence to deliver across vast distances and provide quality education for all regional, rural and remote Queenslanders. Clearly the Turnbull government is totally unaware and out of touch with regional Australia and, in particular, Queensland. This government does not understand that the participation rate in universities in regional communities is almost half of what it is in metropolitan universities. Linking funding to population growth is absolutely unfair and demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the regional challenges.


In the last couple of weeks, I attended graduation ceremonies of both JCU and CQU, with both delivering outstanding results. It was really exciting at both ceremonies to witness young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students receiving their degree awards. It was great to see international students coming to our great city to study at these quality universities. This is particularly the case at JCU in the marine science area.


It is unfair and it's a complete rip-off to students. At last year's budget, the Turnbull government tried to make students start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000. Now the government is proposing a new rate of $45,000. It's still far too low. Why is this government changing the threshold when new graduates are really struggling? New graduates need time to get their feet on the ground, to establish themselves in their chosen career and not be forced into a state of anxiety as to whether they can afford to immediately start to pay their HELP debt, pay rent and survive. It is not fair that new graduates will have to choose between paying their HELP debt or saving to buy a house. It is also not fair to make graduates choose between starting a family or paying their HELP debt. There are a large number of graduates who are barely surviving whilst trying to make ends meet on a wage of $45,000 a year. In my community, rental prices are high, cost of living is expensive and energy prices are through the roof under this government, so students and graduates are already doing it tough. This government's decision to lower the income threshold to $45,000 for graduates to start to pay their HECS debt is just another burden for them to carry. It is unfair and it does not reflect a fair go for all. In fact, it is quite the opposite.


In my last meeting with James Cook University Vice Chancellor Sandra Harding, we discussed how we want more people enrolled in higher education across North Queensland because higher education leads to greater employment choices and opportunities. Across North Queensland, we have some of the highest rates of unemployment in the country, and that is particularly the case for youth unemployment. A university education is the beacon of hope for employment. A university education is the vehicle that will deliver the industries and jobs of the future. University education builds a community's capacity to grow its economy. But the Turnbull government is hell-bent on strangling North Queenslanders' hopes for future employment based on a quality university education. These added burdens on students and graduates will not entice people to enrol at university. Placing additional barriers and making it harder for students to pay back their debts will simply deter students from enrolling at university, and that is the very last thing we need in regional Queensland. In regional Queensland we need to create an environment that increases participation and does not make it harder.


Experts have warned Australia that if we do not boost participation in post-secondary education we risk being left behind by the rest of the world. But this back-to-the-future government probably wants that. This is 1920s style thinking from the government. If you want a country to get back on track, then you must invest in its people. In a time of significant economic transition, we should be investing in our people, not making it harder for them to get a university qualification.


Labor has always been a party for the people. Labor is the party for the many and not just the few people who have healthy credit cards and a strong social status. Labor does put people first. But it's pretty clear that the Turnbull government have only ever had one plan for higher education, and that plan is to cut funding and make students pay more. Of course, that always affects those disadvantaged in our community. It is critically important in regional Queensland, and particularly in my electorate of Herbert, that our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people have the opportunity, once they finish high school, to access a university education. Financial status is not an indicator of capability, but it is an indicator of ability to participate. Australian students already make the sixth-highest contribution to their university fees in the OECD. But the Liberals can't help themselves. They have consistently tried to make students pay more. Why? That is the question. It would appear, at the moment, it's all about paying for their $65 billion tax cut for wealthy corporations. We've seen it in schools, with a $17 billion cut. We've seen it in the vocational education and training sector, with nearly $3 billion cut and more than 140,000 apprenticeships and traineeships lost since the Liberals came to office. In my electorate alone, that is 1,591 apprenticeships. Again, we see it in universities with a $2.2 billion cut. 


Labor delivers real reform to higher education in this country. When Labor was last in government, it lifted investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. Labor opened the door of universities to 190,000 more Australians, many of whom were the first in their family to go to university. Coming from that situation myself, I completely understand what a privilege it is to have the opportunity to attend university when you know how desperately your parents would have loved to have had that opportunity. The Liberals, through their latest round of cuts, are slamming that door firmly shut for many people in our community. The Turnbull government will never be a government for the people. They are a government for the top end of town. 


Investment in people starts with education. However, this government have completely missed this fact, as they are completely out of touch with people. I don't think we can emphasise enough how absolutely important it is that we invest in the people of this country, that we invest in our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people, and that we also invest in the people who are leaving the defence forces, people who need to reskill or get skills to transition into new employment. University is the ticket out of poverty and disadvantage. I urge this government not to make these severe cuts to university funding.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2018-03-26,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (18:38):  Tonight, in my comments regarding the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 I particularly want to focus on its impact on rural and regional Australia. Today, in this place, I introduced a private member's bill which spoke of the importance of positive discrimination in favour of, just as my colleague has just expressed, rural and regional Australia, and that one size does not fit all. So I want to take my opportunity tonight to further that argument. I want to take the opportunity to ask the government to seriously consider a regional strategy that actually takes holistic thinking and looks at the national good and at how we, as a nation, can educate ourselves, have the workforce that we need and have the economic growth that we need, as a direct result of good education.


I just can't enforce enough in tonight's debate, as I know many of my colleagues have, the fundamental importance of education—tonight we are talking about post-school higher education—as one of the pillars of a developed nation. What I'm so sad to see in the discussion we've had from the government is the lack of a vision, the lack of a strategic approach, in how education is going to come together to be the driving force that we need. In the five years that I've been in this parliament, higher education and the government approach to it has been one of the significant disappointments with the lack of vision, the lack of a way forward and often the lack of partnership in our ability to actually move forward.


I wanted to talk a little bit tonight about my electorate of Indi, why this topic is just so important and why I think that the changes are going to have a negative impact on my community. I quote from Higher education information navigation: an exploration of parent information needs in the Hume region, presented by Regional Development Australia and RDV. It says on page 6:


It is of concern, therefore, that the Hume Region has some of the lowest educational outcomes in Victoria. For example, the region shows lower retention rates for Years 7-12 than the average for non-metropolitan regions. The region also has an estimated 22% of young people leaving school through years 10-12, in comparison to metropolitan Melbourne where only 15% of this cohort leaves school.


The percentage of people aged between 25-34 years in the Hume Region in 2006 with a Bachelor degree or higher was 17.35%—


Let me read that again:


The percentage of people aged between 25-34 years in the Hume Region in 2006 with a Bachelor degree or higher was 17.35% compared to the Victorian rate of 30.4%. Hence, the region has just over half the Victorian average of people aged under 34 years with a university degree.


They're shocking statistics, and I live in a really well connected part of Australia. We are getting better internet. We've got trains that sometimes work. We've got roads that work. Yet we've got those appalling statistics for young people accessing tertiary education.


So what happens? The young people leave. It's our biggest export. The consequences for a nation that doesn't pay attention to this are really serious. Obviously you have bigger cities, but not having a young, educated, well-trained cohort and not having universities in our regional centres to drive economic growth are just the most short-sighted policies we could possibly have.


So I'm beseeching the advisers tonight. I'm beseeching the minister to actually seriously do something about this, to do something about a region. If you can't solve the problems for the nation—and I get that it's complicated—surely for regional Australia we can begin work on a strategy and we can actually do something for the regions where I live and where those appalling statistics are in existence. Not wanting to be totally negative, my office has been working with the Parliamentary Budget Office to come up with solutions for how there might be some positive things we could do to make it easier and better for the regions. I've sent them across to the minister's office with some of the costings the Parliamentary Budget Office did around changing the HELP repayment-free period and amended it for rural regions. I've got all the details but, in summary, they came back with an expected fiscal balance impact of minus $9.7 million over the 2017-18 budget forward estimate if we just changed the payment-free period. This is such a small impact compared with the government's expected saving of over $3.8 billion.


So I say to the colleagues in the House: at what cost do we keep going with this track of making higher education harder and harder to get and we as a nation not accepting the responsibility I believe we have not only to give people equity but to actually provide education, which provides the driving force for our regions and will enable the whole of regional Australia to take its place in the nation in the years ahead? By this legislation, by not paying attention to the impact on the regions, we're really working against the ability of our regions to do that.


I say to my colleagues here tonight: you can make some great friends listening to what I've got to say, because it's not just me who thinks this. Clearly I'm on the back bench. I'm an independent member of parliament, but the Rural Universities Network put out a press release that says:


The Regional Universities Network (RUN) strongly endorses Cathy McGowan MP's motion on regional universities before the House of Representatives, and the need for a National Regional Higher Education Strategy.


That's the RUN universities. La Trobe University's John Dewar supports strong local campuses because we need them for regional development.


The thing I really want to bring to the House tonight is a letter from what I thought was a most surprising ally—and please forgive me for making that assumption—the Group of Eight. I have a letter today from the Group of Eight and I'd like to read it into Hansard as part of my speech. It is signed by the Vicki Thomson, Chief Executive of the Group of Eight, which represents the universities in our cities:


Dear Ms McGowan,


As Chief Executive of Australia's leading research universities, the Group of Eight (Go8), I'm writing to you to offer my support for your Private Member's Bill, the National Regional Higher Education Strategy.


There often appears to be the view that the Go8's teaching and research is confined to the major cities. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. The Go8 remains committed to ensuring not only equitable access for students to higher quality education, but also long-term sustainability and economic growth for the regions—


as should the government be, let me say. The letter goes on to detail the Go8's contribution to regional Australia:


More than 25,000 regional and remote students study at a Go8 university each year—


that's our great export—


One in eight rural and regional students study at a Go8 university


50 per cent of agriculture and environmental students in Australia study at a Go8 university


60 per cent of veterinary students in Australia are trained by Go8 universities.


They tell me they invest in outreach to regional communities, which of course they do, and it's important. But the point is: imagine the situation we've got today. Here I am on the back bench, independent and a strong advocate for the regions and I've got the Go8 onside, we've got the rural universities onside and I'm beseeching the government to please do something to make sure that the unintended consequences—and I say that kindly—are not going to be felt in the long term by the nation because at this particular time we fail to pay attention to the impact of this legislation before the House tonight on rural Australia. I don't know how to say it other than the consequences are going to be enormous for us. We can't say we didn't know because the debates in this House tonight were so strongly put forward by my colleague from Herbert talking about the impact on rural and regional communities.


I really want to say to the minister, to the Prime Minister, to the advisers in the House tonight, to my colleagues on the government side and to the members of the National Party, in particular: stand up for your principles and your values, and stand up for rural and regional Australia. And to members of parliament from the Liberal Party who represent our regional electorates, I say: stand up for rural and regional Australia. Just don't let this go through tonight. It's poor law. It's poor law and it will have incredibly bad consequences for us.


What is so distressing and so disappointing is this sense that one size fits everybody when clearly with university education we need to differentiate. We need to make the case that those in the regions need special treatment. Government has done it in some areas—there's a limited loading there, but it doesn't go nearly far enough to actually address the imbalance of those statistics that I put up earlier. Seventeen per cent of my young people are going on to higher education—it's an appalling figure. It's something we really should be ashamed about. Certainly, it's something that I absolutely want to see changed. Part of the reason why I became a member of parliament was to do something very specifically about accessing higher education in the regions.


I say to the minister: it's time for a vision, and, if you can't have a vision for the whole of Australia, could you please have a vision for regional Australia? Could you please really consider the call from the Go8 and the call from the RUN universities and work together on a strategy that, over a period of time, will deliver equality. Sure, equality is important, but then it will deliver us a trained workforce. We are doing all this international work to bring foreigners to the country because we can't, in the regions, get enough of our own labour force, yet we do nothing positively to make sure that our young people are trained in the jobs that we've got. We've got so many jobs that we could have people working in in the country. It just seems to me quite ludicrous that we're not addressing the labour shortage in this most obvious way by training people in the regions, which seems so sensible.


The third area, to me, is so obvious. I'm on a committee at the moment, with many government members and opposition people, looking at regional development and decentralisation. It's a very productive committee to be on. We are working together to say, 'How do we grow the regions? How do we use decentralisation as a tool of government?' Universities have to be one of the most cost-effective ways—cost-effective investment of government money—for growing our regions. So much money goes from the Commonwealth coffers into the regions. It's such a good opportunity for us; with such a small increase—or appreciation of the impact—we could have the most amazing multiplier effect. 


It's a call from the heart to the minister, to the Prime Minister, to my colleagues on the government side. Really, if you can't support us on the move here, could you please pay attention to a regional strategy and work with the parties so we can make sure that in the longer term, when we look back on this particular parliament, we can say: 'That was the year the government got the regions. The government got the role of education in supporting the regions and helping the regions be the answer that they can be to so many of the problems this nation is facing'? 


I bring my comments to a close with a real call-out to the advisers in the box tonight and to the minister: reconsider your decisions around a regional strategy for rural and regional Australia.

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (18:51):  Let me start by reiterating all the things that have been said on this side of the house, in relation to this. Labor does not support this bill. This legislation is completely unfair and attacks students and undermines the fairness of our world-class student loan system. As I have said in this place many times before, one of the things that led me here was a comment made by my Liberal predecessor, Jackie Kelly, when she famously decreed that Western Sydney did not need a university; we were pram city. The people I get to represent—people like me, back then, as a 20-year-old—didn't deserve to have a university in their electorate, because they were capable of producing babies and nothing more. 


That's the difference between us and them, really. Outraged as I was at the time, my only ability, or the only thing available to me at that time, was to write a cranky letter to the editor of my local newspaper about my disgust. I'm glad Jackie Kelly's comments weren't heeded. But now, a few years later—just a few; I was 20 then and am only a few years older than that now—I get to stand in this place and defend the thing I came here for originally. 


I'm really glad that her comments weren't heeded. Instead, we have Western Sydney University right in my backyard. It's a university whose alumni I belong to, in fact, as does my mum, the first in our family to go to university. Through uncapping places, Labor opened the door of university to 190,000 Australians—many more who were the first in their family to go to university. This resulted in huge increases in the number of students going to university in Western Sydney, a place that is the jewel in the crown and a place where everybody comes to launch their campaigns. We've had former Prime Minister Tony Abbott coming into the electorate and spruiking all things great about Western Sydney—well, fund my university. 


Labor delivers real reform to higher education in this country. When we were last in government we lifted investment from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion—almost double—in 2013. But that growth will come to an absolute standstill because Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister, has effectively reintroduced a cap on the number of university places, taking us back to the bad old days of John Howard when your family's income and bank balance determined whether you could go to university or not. 


This MYEFO package of $2.2 billion worth of cuts is the government's fourth attempt, since coming to office, to cut universities and make students pay more. These cuts do real damage to our universities. At last year's budget they tried to make students start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000. Now they're proposing a new rate of $45,000. It's still too low when facing the crippling costs of higher living and no wages growth, not to mention penalty rate cuts. That is too low for people to afford to live and pay back their debt. 


We believe the current repayment rate is about right. We don't want to make students repay their debts when they are starting a career, saving for a house or starting a family. But what do we see from this coalition government? We see $2.2 billion in cuts to universities, and Western Sydney University is the second-worst affected by these cuts. Sixty per cent of the students who attend the University of Western Sydney—or Western Sydney U, as it's now called—are the first in their families. That is a staggering figure: 60 per cent are the first in their immediate extended families to be able to go to university. That is an extraordinary number. Families in Western Sydney want their kids to have a great education.


That extends to me. When we talk about City Deals and 30-minute cities, closing down the University of Western Sydney by defunding it and these cuts by stealth are not helpful. They will not create the 30-minute city this government constantly rattles on about. The people of Western Sydney and Lindsay in particular are being let down by this government. My community faces fewer employment opportunities in traditional jobs like manufacturing. Families in Lindsay need to be prepared for the jobs of the future. They want a learning pathway for their kids to give them a better job and a better life. Education will make a difference to the lives of people in my community. We need our kids to stay in school and go on to TAFE or university. I'm not even going to start on the VET sector tonight; I don't think we have enough time on the clock to talk about the cuts and lack of apprentices we now have.


The Turnbull government should properly fund universities and not attack students through these measures. I was privileged to attend O-week at the University of Western Sydney and talk to students excited about their future, their opportunities and the jobs they'll get when they have finished their degrees. They talked about their anxieties about HECS repayments when they're done. These students, most of whom have casual jobs and don't get support from their families, because their families are struggling to get by, don't need to be slugged any further by this government. These are not the wealthiest students going to university; they are from hardworking families, some from the lowest socioeconomic backgrounds.


It is pretty clear the government only ever had one plan for higher education—that is, for cuts and to make students pay more. To make matters worse, the New South Wales Liberals, who are spending $2.7 billion on demolishing and rebuilding two Sydney stadiums, are deaf to this problem as well. The Turnbull government is effectively slamming the door to educational opportunity in the faces of Western Sydney kids. Enrolments in university under Labor increased by 60 per cent in the seat of Lindsay. The University of Western Sydney will be the hardest hit, as I said before, with $93 million worth of cuts to funding. That is the greatest cut to any New South Wales university and the second highest to any university in this country. In 2016, the latest year with available data, about 25,000 women were enrolled at the University of Western Sydney out of a total of 44,000. Just over half the students were women. Instead of being supported, students are getting locked out. We are already facing an uphill battle, with the level of tertiary qualified people in my electorate sitting well below the state and country averages. We need to lift that, so we need more investment out there.


The Liberals' funding cuts also mean that the University of Western Sydney's critical programs that reach out to people in communities and ensure a pathway or option to get into university for everyone who wants one, and industry and government partnered programs, are all at risk, as is the Launch Pad, a great initiative built under Labor during the time of David Bradbury, a fantastic former Labor member for Lindsay. We built this Launch Pad, which is now serving as a tech hub. We have heaps of start-ups in there building 3D printers that were formerly being built in people's garages and are now being exported all around the country. This funding cut threatens that exact site, the place where we are training young people for the jobs of the future.


These programs are focusing on addressing the pronounced equity gap in education in my area. We know student debt is a genuine barrier to study for anyone in a low-SES or disadvantaged background. We should be doing all we can to increase participation in higher education, not making it harder. Why do we put challenges and hurdles in the way of our young people? Why don't we roll out the red carpet and give them every opportunity? They'll be here long after I'm gone. They'll be here making things and adding to our GDP well and truly after all of us have finished. Why are we making it harder? It is not good enough that these students are being left behind by this government. It is an especially cruel blow to the hardworking year 12 graduates who are now denied a place at university. Kids who studied last year and thought, 'Yes, I will get into university,' were denied a place because of the funding caps. Kids are starting their year 12 careers now, looking to go to university, and there is just so much uncertainty for them. They can have goals and aspirations but, because of this government, may have the door closed smack-bang in their face.


It is incredibly galling to see Malcolm Turnbull ripping funding away from students to pay for tax cuts for multinationals and millionaires. I think that's what leaves the foul taste in the mouths of so many people on this side. It's that we can seem to find $65 billion in the Treasury coffers to give to the big four banks, for example, who have already announced that they're going to slash 6,000 jobs, in the face and on the backs of those university students. How does he justify making it easier for big business to pay less tax but harder for kids who are 17, 18 and 19 to go to university? These are kids who just want to get ahead, who just want a decent job and who just want to be productive members of our communities.


Learning is a lifelong journey. I learnt that when I was studying to be a teacher back at university in 1999. It is a journey that starts well and truly before we are born and continues right up until the day we die. We need to make sure that our universities are there for everyone when they want to attend. The coalition government wants to slam the door on that lifelong journey.


We know that the disadvantage some families in my seat of Lindsay are facing prevents them from being able to go to university. In times of significant economic transition we should be investing in our people, not making it harder. The people in my community need a decent, well-funded university that supports their desire for a better life. People in Lindsay are calling out for courses at the Western Sydney University city campus, right in the middle of Penrith, to make it more accessible to go to university.


As Tanya Plibersek has said, Labor understands that a strong university sector  needs certainty and stability. You can't do anything without a stable policy. This undermines all of the planning that universities are able to do.


Taking away the 9,500 university places that are estimated to be unfunded in the coming 12 months, this government is again being cruel and out of touch—I don't think that they ever had the touch to be honest. They are denying opportunities to a better future and it's an absolute rip-off in the faces of those young people. But they can't help themselves. They have consistently tried to make students pay more, and why? All to pay and fund their $65 billion tax cut to big business, on the backs of hardworking students, who just want to get ahead. They say that it'll trickle down, but we're yet to see any evidence of that, and I can't find an economist who tells them that it's going to trickle down and rain on their heads.


No wonder the people of my community, and of Lindsay, feel incredibly let down by the Turnbull government, and the Abbott government before them. We deserve better. We deserve better than people who think that we're only capable of producing babies. We deserve better than people who think that all that we can get is an airport out there that's all the effects of a 24-hour airport. Where we have planes flying overhead 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Where we don't get investment in our people.


We've seen funding cut after funding cut to education. In the VET sector we've got 140,000 fewer apprentices than in times past. We're seeing this absolute demolishing of the funding for the Western Sydney University. Once again, Labor will not support this cruel, out-of-touch policy, and I ask those opposite to reconsider their support for this $65 billion tax cut on the back of university students.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (19:03):  I've often spoken in this place about the government's priorities and how they impact on everyday Australians. Have you ever wondered where students and universities sit on the scale of those opposite? You need to look no further than this bill that we have before the House today.


I want to acknowledge the member for Griffith, who has moved a second reading amendment to this bill, the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018, and place on record my thanks to her for moving this amendment, which is that the House declines to give the bill a second reading, because it attacks students and would undermine the fairness of Australia's world-class student loan scheme. I know the member for Griffith, alongside our deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, had been listening and consulting with the student sector, as we all have as representatives in this place. In one way or another we all represent higher education students in our combined electorates across this country.


The bill attacks students. It simply attacks students and undermines our world-class loan scheme, which has been a proven success for decades. I want to place on record how proud I am that Australia's higher education system is world leading. It supports more than one million students, both international and domestic, and our universities, as we've heard, directly employ 120,000 people and support another 40,000 jobs. Our higher education system must be protected. But, just like with everything else, it seems this government is hell-bent on tearing it down. And this MYEFO package with $2.2 billion worth of cuts will be the fourth attempt of the government's. I say again: it is their fourth attempt, since coming to office, to cut universities and make students pay more. It's not just the second or third time; this is the fourth attempt they've had at going after Australia's higher education students with a cheap tax grab. 


The government, as we know, are relentless when it comes to attacks on students. In last year's budget, they tried to make students start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000. Now they're proposing a new rate of $45,000. How generous! The government want to increase the threshold and want to be congratulated for it. They simply either don't understand the ramifications that this bill will have on Australians trying to earn a living who have a uni or TAFE debt or they're deliberately targeting those who can least afford to pay it. Either way, in my books, it's a shameful act. 


But this seems to be the common theme within the Turnbull government. Pensioners, jobseekers, young families, you name it—if you're a working Australian doing it tough, then you're in the government's sights. Whereas if you're one of the big banks you're in line for a tax cut. The hypocrisy is astounding. In this bill the government has raised the threshold from the previous attempt of $42,000 to $45,000, but the truth is it's still too low. $45,000 is barely more than the minimum wage, and would mean Australians with a HELP debt on low incomes would be required to make repayments. This change would also have a greater impact on women, particularly those who have returned to the work force part-time after taking parental leave. For example, Australians with a HELP debt earning $51,000, most of whom are likely to be women, will have less disposable income that someone earning, say, $32,000. How is that fair? 


What the government doesn't like to talk about is that the lower repayment threshold for HELP debt will also apply to TAFE and vocational students who take out VET FEE-HELP or VET student loans. This means some of the hardest working but most modestly paid people in the country will be affected. That means people with a diploma or advanced diploma qualifications, like early childhood educators, enrolled nurses and technicians, will be caught up in this. We know that this week thousands of early childhood educators will be walking off their jobs as part of the Big Steps Campaign. They are highly qualified professionals, yet are paid one-third less than those teaching and caring for children just a few years older. Despite the incredibly important work they do, many early childhood educators are paid as low as $20 per hour, half the average national wage. Making matters worse is that 97 per cent of educators are female, which only further widens the gender pay gap in Australia. Because of these measures and their inadequate pay they will be paying their HELP debts well into their forties. These are the people who will bear the brunt of this government's awful piece of legislation we have before the House today—not big bankers, not executives and not those with mansions down by the harbour side. No, it will be childcare workers, teachers and nurses. It will be those who can least afford it. Once again, that doesn't seem to faze this government. 


Australia's future economy will require a high-skilled workforce, and this bill does nothing to support it. In fact, the government is going out of its way and making deal after deal with One Nation, to prove that point. Just last week we saw One Nation, the so-called party of the battlers, do a deal to deliver $65 billion in tax cuts for the big end of town, in exchange for 1,000 apprenticeships. That is nothing more than a pathetic con job. It is selling out young Australians in particular. We know that since this government came to power Australia has lost over 140,000 apprenticeships—a decline of over 35 per cent. 


Locally, the apprentices in my electorate of Oxley have been hit harder. Our community has seen the loss of almost1,500 apprenticeships, which is equivalent to a 43 per cent decrease, and the signs are that this will only continue to get worse. The 2017 budget cut a further $637 million from TAFE training and apprenticeships, and the government's proposed Skilling Australians Fund, which is supposed to deliver 300,000 apprenticeships, has been widely panned as unworkable. It seems the only thing the government is interested in is lining the pockets of the big banks and, as we know, foreign investors, while Australia's apprentices and students are left behind.


I wonder whether those opposite are actually aware of where Australia currently sits in the OECD as far as public investment in universities is concerned. Are we near the top? Not even close. About mid-range? Nah. Australia has the second lowest level of public investment in universities in the OECD, and this government only wants to make it worse. In contrast, our students already pay the sixth highest fees in the OECD. So we're towards the bottom, or the second lowest level, for investment in universities but our students are paying the sixth highest fees in the OECD. And we know that the fee hikes in this bill will only make that record worse.


I'm proud to represent the people of Oxley, in the south-west of Brisbane, in this place; however, for some of them things can be tough when it comes to going to university or TAFE. We know that high student debt is a genuine barrier to study for low-SES and disadvantaged students, so why would this government possibly want to make it harder for young people who are trying to pull themselves out of the cycle of disadvantage by furthering themselves at university or TAFE, and harder for parents who are trying to support their kids? We should be doing all we can to increase participation in higher education, not putting up extra barriers to further education and training, yet that is what this government is doing to young people in this country.


Picture this, Mr Deputy Speaker: four years from now, as a 22-year-old, you have recently graduated with a degree in engineering and you can't wait to take the skills and knowledge you learned at university and apply them to the real world. The past four years of university have been tough. Since moving out of home you have had to fork out the expensive rent that comes with living near enough to the closest capital city university. You've been working casually more than 20 hours per week—maybe in a cafe, maybe late at night—to support your study. But it's been made tougher since the government cut penalty rates. Sundays used to bring that little bit of extra cash to help with the groceries, increasing electricity costs or just getting to and from university on public transport, but getting your pay cut, as a young person, hasn't helped with this.


Nonetheless, you've graduated from university and you're ready to take on the world. However, you quickly learn that the job market is pretty tough out there and finding employment in your field isn't easy. The youth unemployment rate for people aged 15 to 24 is still double the national average. You're desperately keen to get your foot in the door, so you take an admin role at a leading engineering firm until something opens up for you. The starting pay is just 48 grand but it's better than nothing. You soon learn that, because of the government cutting the threshold for HELP repayments, your take-home pay is now even less.


On top of hoping to land an entry-level engineering job, you also hope to save a home deposit. But, as the government has done nothing about negative gearing, house prices have continued to rise. The average modest home on the outskirts of a capital city will now set you back $500,000. With tight budgeting you're able to save $50 per week. The bank will require a 20 per cent deposit, meaning you have to save $100,000. At your current rate, this will take 2,000 weeks to save, or the next 38 years of your life.


It's pretty sobering, but that is the story facing thousands of young people right across the country. It is the story I hear when I'm out doing mobile offices at Orion shopping centre or Jindalee Village or the Forest Lake village near my own home. Parents say, 'Milton, I'm worried my kids can't get a long-term job but I'm more worried that they'll never be able to have the great Australian dream.' What we're seeing today very clearly, in clear language, is: we're going to hit students with higher fees, we're going to give them higher bills and we're going to make them pay them off sooner.


Among my Labor colleagues on this side of the chamber I note the member for Macquarie, the member for Brand and the member for Chifley have been, in particular, outspoken advocates in the area of kids from disadvantaged backgrounds getting ahead. That is a key reason I'm in this place—to make sure that the kids who have the brains, the abilities and the talent can reach their full potential. It should be government helping them to do that. Instead, we've got a government with a lousy set of rules and bills before this parliament today that are simply not going to achieve that.


It's why Labor has recently announced a national inquiry into post-secondary education, a once-in-a-generation national inquiry that will look at every aspect of the vocational, educational and higher training systems to ensure they can best respond to the needs of Australia's economy and society. It's about making sure that Australians have access to the best post-secondary opportunities in the world. We all want our kids to get the education and the skills they need to thrive. We need to make sure Australians have the opportunities of lifelong learning. It makes good economic sense. We are competing against a fast sector across the South-East Asian market. If Australia is to be a wealthy, highly educated nation, we must boost participation in quality post-secondary education. It's pretty clear that other countries in our region are not doing what this parliament is doing tonight. They are investing in education and skills. Experts have warned that if we rest on our laurels Australia risks being left behind.


We on this side of the chamber know that we delivered real reform to our universities. We invested in universities. We lifted funding from $8 billion to $14 billion in 2013. We opened the doors to our universities to an additional 190,000 Australians, many the first in their family to attend university. Why did we lift participation in universities? Because it's good for the individual, but it's better for the economy. We know that a qualification, be it from TAFE or uni, can set you up for life. We know that many jobs of the future will require a post-school qualification. Yet tonight we are making a decision which is going to make it harder for kids to get ahead. The minister at the table may think it's funny. He may think what I'm saying is not serious, but the reality is that with this bill tonight we will make it harder for kids in his electorate and kids in my electorate to get post-secondary education.


We know the reason the government is keen on this. There's only one reason this government exists. Let's be clear: it's to make sure that those at the very top who rely on government support—the multinational companies and the millionaires—are looked after. And at what expense? The expense tonight, on this day of parliament and in this moment in time, is to slug the university students of today and tomorrow to pay for that. Well, I say I'm not going to support it. Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, say that our side of politics will not support it. We believe in a better way—more importantly, we believe in a fairer way. Tonight I call on the government to abandon what I call a reckless policy that threatens the viability and future of students attending higher education, and to stand with working Australians and middle-class Australians—the people whom we are sent to represent in this chamber—to protect the right of every Australian to better themselves through university, further education, or TAFE.

"Templeman, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (19:18):  There will be a lot said about allowing access to education, and the impacts that the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 will have. I'm very pleased to be able to speak against this bill, because that is the key. As the member for Oxley has outlined, it's the disincentive that it creates and not just the cost that it forces still-young people to bear while they're trying to move from university and transition into a working life.


I want to tell you the story of Ellie. Ellie struggled to get through year 11 for a whole lot of family reasons. She was a bright student, but it wasn't always a place where she could concentrate. However, she made it through year 11 and she made it through year 12. In fact, she did so well that she was offered a place at university. She was to be the first person in her family to go to university. That seemed like a fantastic thing to start with—the idea that you get to university and this whole life would open up for you. At the time, she looked at what the costs of surviving university would be, but not the debt she would accrue and pay back—that conversation came later, and that whole process in itself was pretty daunting. But Ellie was lucky that she had people around her who said, 'You know what? This is worth it. This is an investment in yourself that is worth it.' And that was in spite of other voices saying to her: 'Why do you want to go to university? You're going to do an arts degree. That won't get you anything. Why don't you go and do hairdressing?' Well, Ellie wasn't terribly gifted at hairdressing, so that wasn't an option. But what appealed to her was the unknown of a degree at university.


So, in spite of different voices having different influences on her, she did accept her place at university. She went to the University of New South Wales and she began her arts degree. As luck would have it, Ellie thrived in that environment, but that doesn't mean it wasn't hard. Anyone who has taken a child through their first year of university knows the challenge of those first assignments: the tears, the late nights, the computers not necessarily doing what they ought to do and the struggle—not just the struggle of the practical but the struggle of the mind when you're struggling to deal with stuff you don't understand—but the very process of being at university and working through it is where you get the benefit.


Ellie got through this process. She got through her first lot of exams. She got through her next lot of exams. She got midway through second year, and suddenly the debt that she was carrying started to weigh on her. She started questioning herself: 'Can I actually repay this debt? I'm doing an arts degree. Will I ever get a job that will allow me to pay back all this money I owe?'—and by then it was already more money than she could ever imagine paying back. Again there were good people around her to encourage her, to keep her going, to say: 'You know what? This is the hard bit. You're halfway there. Keep going.' She managed to get through, but always there were other voices saying to her: 'You don't need to do this. You don't need to be worrying about this. You could go and get a job.' Fortunately, Ellie stuck with it throughout it all. There were lots of tears. She finished her final year, she did really well, she got offed a place to do honours and she did honours—the first in her family to have a degree and the first in her family to have an honours degree.


When I think about this legislation, I think about the one extra straw that it would have taken to dissuade someone like Ellie from going down a path that is hard. If anyone sits here and thinks, 'Oh, what a bludge, going to uni,' you have obviously forgotten what it was like going to university or you sailed through it differently from most of us, because it is hard. You are struggling with things that are making your brain explode. When I see legislation like this I think, 'Is this really what we want to do to young people? How much hope and possibility do we want to take away from them? How much debt do we want them laden with?' That's one aspect of it. And then, as they move from one phase of their life to their next, how much do we want to make it hard for them?


Clearly the government has decided it wants to make it a bit harder than it already is—in fact, significantly harder than it already is. I think the Prime Minister and this government think that, for students who are transitioning into the work environment, it won't really matter to them. I talked to some young graduates about their budget. I asked them what it would look like to repay on $42,000 a year instead of starting to repay their debt on an income of $45,000 a year. Here are the sorts of things that they told me.


For a budget for someone who's just graduated from a university in Sydney and has a job nearby, let's assume that the weekly take-home pay of someone who is earning, say, $45,000 is $736. That's the weekly breakdown. So let's do a weekly budget. Let's assume this person is trying to avoid the two-hour commute each way from the Blue Mountains or the Hawkesbury, which my electorate covers, but is happy to do a bit of commute into the city, so they rent in Strathfield. The average rent for a three-bedroom house is $680, and they pay a third of that. That leaves them with $510. Let's take away the cost of their mobile phone, their train tickets to get to work each day and about $150 a week for food: they now have $300 a week left. Then you've got the house-running costs, such as the cost of home internet, because, of course, we all work in a mobile world, and the chances of their job being nine to five, clock-on clock-off are pretty remote. Like all of us, they will be working late from home. Hopefully they will be able to download the odd Netflix here and there, but I haven't got that in the budget so I'm not sure that's going to be a viable option unless they can share someone's Netflix account. They've got their home internet, their water and their electricity, and those average at about, let's say, $200 a month—about $50 a week—and that's very conservative. Now they have $250 a week left, and that's if you somehow manage not to get a shock electricity bill for summer or winter. But that's only $250 left after the basic costs come out. 


Now that doesn't include putting in for your fair share of cleaning products in the house, nor does it include medical, dental or optical expenses. It doesn't address occasional costs like renewing a licence, maybe paying a fine, replacing a broken phone or computer, getting a haircut, or even joining a local sporting team or the gym. If you have a car, that's at least $50 a week in petrol and whatever the weekly breakdown of rego and insurance is. I haven't mentioned home contents insurance; of course, young people find that really stretches their budget. What if the washing machine carks it? What if you get a hole in your shoes in the rain? What if you're using a dodgy washing machine and it rips one of your tops and you need to replace it? There is no room in this budget for buying new clothes. You sure as hell can't afford to go out to dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. You probably can't afford to buy your mum much of a birthday present or a Christmas present, and you certainly can't have a pet. You might be able to afford one of these things: maybe you can allow yourself a haircut one week; the next week you might get petrol; you might go to the doctor the next. There really isn't even room for two of those things to happen in the same week. 


I don't actually think that you've got the opportunity to think about having children, buying a dog or buying your first home. There really isn't room in that budget. That is what we are saying; that's how you should live. What about a deposit for a property? Well, to get a deposit for a $600,000 property in the situation that I've just outlined, that person would have to not spend a cent outside of the bare necessities budget—certainly no children and no medical expenses or one-off expenses, like replacing a fridge. They could not buy one item of clothing, eat out, buy friends or family gifts, or even get a haircut. If you saved every one of those cents for five years, you might get yourself a bit of a deposit for your home. Of course, in that time the costs will have gone up and so you'll need even more. 


So this is what this government thinks is a suitable position for people to be in when they start paying back their HECS debt. This government wants to stick its hands into the pockets of people and take a chunk of the $250 that's left over. Not only do I fear that this will leave young people short of enough money to live properly, to eat properly and to look after their health properly, but the feedback I get is that it will absolutely reduce the number of people who even consider going to university in the first place, and that would be a tragedy. It's a tragedy for our economy, because our future depends on people, young and old, wanting to educate themselves. 


We know that accumulating a student debt is a genuine barrier to study for people from particularly poor and disadvantaged backgrounds. We already know that. It isn't an unknown; it's not a possibility. It is a fact. We also know that investing in education gives more back to society in the long term than it costs us in the short term. Let's picture Australia in 20, 30, or 40 years from now, and ask ourselves the question: do we want people who are doctors, nurses, journalists, teachers, engineers, planners, scientists, health professionals—anybody who requires a university degree—only to be coming from wealthy and privileged families? Do we only want one type of person who can afford to do those courses? We're already seeing an imbalance in professions like veterinary science and medicine. This sort of legislation is going to exacerbate that. I would have thought we'd want a mix of people. We want industries to be filled with people of different colours, different abilities and different genders—people from rural and regional Australia, Indigenous Australians, and people who know what it's like to go to school with a pair of shoes that has a hole in them.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2018-03-26,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (15:57):  As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted by 90-second statements, we do agree, across both sides of this House, on the importance of higher education and vocational education to ensure that students leaving high school have a pathway to a career that they wish to pursue. I rise today to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 to provide a new minimum repayment threshold for the compulsory repayment of Higher Education Loan Program debts. The government is committed—and this is the importance of this bill—to a stronger, more sustainable student-focused higher education system for all Australians. The government has, over the past two years, consulted extensively on higher education reforms in order to seek to achieve this. This bill plays a key role in delivering sustainability to our world renowned student loan scheme, which is underwritten by the taxpayer.


This bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 by providing a new minimum repayment threshold of $45,000. This bill also indexes the HELP repayment thresholds to CPI, instead of average weekly earnings, and introduces a limit on the amount that a student can borrow under the HELP scheme of $150,000 for students studying medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses, and $104,440 for other students. These provisions are about ensuring a fairer deal for Australian taxpayers, who, ultimately, provide this support to students. Through consultation with key stakeholders, the government found that there was strong evidence that we needed to get the cost of higher education under control, that universities were capable of making a contribution and that the student loan program needed to be made more sustainable.


It's worth noting that taxpayer funded student loans currently stand at some $55 billion, and, without changes to current policy settings, a quarter of all new loans are expected to never be repaid. The government has found that since 2009 taxpayer funding for Commonwealth Supported Places in higher education has increased by some 71 per cent, growing at twice the rate of the economy. Independent analysis from Deloitte also found that average funding per domestic student for universities increased by some 15 per cent between 2010 and 2015, while, over the same period, the cost for universities to deliver courses only increased by some 9½ per cent. Lowering the starting repayment threshold for loans to $45,000 with a one per cent repayment rate is an affordable and fair ask for students to start repaying their debt to Australian taxpayers. 


When the Turnbull government worked to bring the Australian people higher education reforms, the government put in the time to consult students, academics and policymakers, review more than 1,000 submissions to our discussion paper and work with a panel of experts guiding the development of this policy. The government is delivering on its promise to pursue quality and excellence in Australia's higher education sector. We're ensuring students have the support they need to succeed, while also making sure the system is financially sustainable for future generations. We want future students—our children and grandchildren—to have the same opportunities that this and other generations have had. Our reforms guarantee students will not have to pay a cent up-front and not face fee increases. Our reforms ensure the government continues to be the majority funder of higher education Commonwealth supported places on average and demonstrate that the scare campaign by those opposite, about prohibitive fees, has no validity. But we're used to that from those opposite. They sit there and they carp and complain about everything, but they never actually demonstrate anything useful to the Australian people, other than wanting to increase taxes, regulation and red tape. We've seen from their past record with the VET FEE-HELP debacle that they're not much good at managing anything either. 


One of the most important points I want to make about this bill is that students from disadvantaged backgrounds will continue to benefit from support through the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program, in which we're investing over half a billion dollars over the next four years. The government's reforms strike the right balance in fairness for all parties involved. The reforms will ensure our record level of investment in higher education results in better opportunities, better results for students and better value for Australian taxpayers. The government is providing record funding for higher education, with over $17 billion this year, and is supporting regional students through the $290 million in regional loading for regional campuses over the next four years, rural and regional scholarships and a new initiative around regional hubs.


Australia has a world-leading higher education system that continues to provide employment and income advantages to its graduates. Our government cannot afford to be complacent and risk jeopardising these opportunities for future generations of students who also want to be able to access student loans that remove all up-front fees from higher education, facilitating their enrolments, no matter their background or their financial circumstances. Australia's higher education system is excellent and recent rankings put it as very highly regarded, on global terms. In my electorate of Forde, Griffith University's Logan campus has gone from strength to strength, with students recognising its excellent educational opportunities and convenient location. I want Griffith University at Meadowbrook to continue to prosper and grow. By working with us, students, universities and taxpayers will see this government deliver improved choices, financial stability and accountability to Australia's higher education sector.


I reiterate my opening comments: it is important that we provide the opportunities for Australian students to pursue a career of their choice as they leave high school, whether that's facilitated through higher education study at university or through study at TAFE or a private college, through VET FEE-HELP. It is important that we ensure our students are given every opportunity as they seek to enter the workforce and further their careers in the future. This is in stark contrast to the approach of those opposite, who when last in government announced $6.6 billion worth of cuts to funding for the higher education sector. The coalition government is delivering a responsible suite of reforms that are fair and, importantly, seek to empower student choice. I commend the bill in its unamended form to the House.

"King, Madeleine, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (16:06):  I reflect on a couple of things the member for Forde said earlier about the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. One is the consultation said to have been done with the sector and students. I struggle to find any support for the measures the government is trying to introduce in this bill before the House. Universities Australia has done quite a lot of study into exactly what contribution universities and students have made to budget repair, and estimates that since 2011 universities and students have contributed over $3.9 billion to the task of budget repair in this country. I agree with what Universities Australia has said, that perhaps they have contributed their fair share to budget repair in this country. This government might want to consider its tax reform and the $65 billion worth of tax cuts it's giving to large companies, as well as to individuals earning more than $180,000 a year, rather than attacking universities and students earning $45,000 a year, if they even get to do that.


This side of the House does not support an attack on students, as I've suggested. This bill would attack and undermine the fairness of Australia's world-class student loan scheme. We on this side of the House, the Labor Party, have a proud record when it comes to higher education. Back in 1989 Labor introduced the first income contingent loan scheme, HECS, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. It contributed to an expansion of higher ed in this country and was part of the foundation of our fair and accessible higher education system. When last in office we increased funding for universities from $8 billion to $14 billion a year. We introduced the demand-driven funding system, which enabled more people to go to university. This led to an increase in participation from disadvantaged students. In fact, the system allowed an extra 190,000 students to go to university. This is an important point to consider when research tells us that by 2020, in only two years, two out of every three jobs created in Australia will require a diploma or a higher education qualification.


Despite this, the government introduced a bill that ignores the reality of the modern world, where further and lifelong study is essential to our economy. It is working to limit the aspirations of students and their families, denying university access to students and undermining the qualifications this country needs from its workers and workforce in the future. We need more, not fewer, people to go on to further education and gain the qualifications they need for the benefit of this country. This government has systematically attacked universities, students and education as a whole. This Liberal government has attacked higher education with a freeze on university grants—effectively a $2.2 billion cut—meaning 10,000 university places will be unfunded. So that means 10,000 fewer students at universities. 


We witnessed this government introduce an unfair funding regime that cut $17 billion from schools, hitting public schools the hardest. We all remember the 'not a dollar difference' campaign—well, there's a lot of difference. We've witnessed this government wallop vocational education and TAFE, with a whopping $3 billion being ripped from their funding. This government has the gall to say these cuts are necessary, while, at the same time, they can throw a staggering $65 billion tax cut bonus to the big end of town. I mean, what a nerve. 


We have consistently fought this Liberal government's attempts to introduce $100,000 degrees in this country, and we'll continue to fight this attempt to undermine the repayment threshold on student loans. It's known that higher student debt is a genuine barrier for low-income and disadvantaged students when it comes to study. We know these government cuts will affect students from Brand, from across the towns of Rockingham and Kwinana. We know this, yet instead of increasing participation and assistance in higher education this government is making it harder for people to study and harder for their families to support them. 


This is not the first attempt by this Liberal government to lower the repayment threshold for HELP. In last year's budget they tried to make students start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000 a year, and they failed. We will not support this latest attempt at lowering the Higher Education Loan Program repayments to a $45,000 threshold, which is only $9,000 a year more than the minimum wage in this country. It is simply too low. It will be a millstone around the necks of new graduates who are looking to begin their working lives. This debt will be a burden to people. 


How can someone starting out even think of paying a mortgage or getting married, or starting a family, when their income is sequestered by student loan repayments? Add to that the increased casualisation of our entire workforce, across the professions as well as in blue-collar work, where long-time employment contracts no longer exist or rarely exist. People find it impossible to secure housing loans, even personal loans for cars and the things that everyone takes for granted. Then you add in, with your profession, a debt of this magnitude—much higher than when I went to university and paid HECS—and they have to start paying it off at $45,000 per annum from their income. 


Contrary to the Prime Minister's advice that people go out and buy homes for their children, in the real world—certainly in the real world of Brand—this does not happen. In my electorate, I can tell you, parents struggle with paying their bills, thanks to this government's attack on penalty rates. I can tell you that parents are struggling every day with underemployment, unemployment, rising costs of living and stagnant wages growth. I can tell you that parents are struggling to pay their own mortgages—never mind being able to help their kids buy a house. I can tell you that in the everyday world, when they finish uni, young people, students, are on their own when it comes to finding their own homes and paying for them. 


Another concern to be had with this bill is the impact that the proposed changes to the HELP repayment thresholds will have on women. Mark Pace, the president of the National Union of Students, has stated: 'We know from the National Tertiary Education Union's submission to this Senate inquiry that 60 per cent of all Australians with outstanding HELP debt are women and that two-thirds of the Australians who will be dragged into the debt pool with the new proposed repayment thresholds will also be women.' So I cannot support this. 


In conjunction with this, student debt overall is a major concern in this country. Australian students already pay the sixth-highest contribution to the cost of their degrees in the OECD. This is significant. Making it harder for students to study, we are risking participation in post-secondary education that we need for the benefit of this country and for the economy of this country. We risk being left behind the rest of the world with short-sighted punitive measures such as those in this bill. We do not want a system where students have to take out commercial loans, or their families have to take out commercial loans, in order to fund their university fees. 


By putting universities in a funding vice, I can only imagine that the intention of this government is to push institutions toward having to institute higher fees. We saw this happen under the Abbott government when they tried to deregulate the entire system. That's when we saw the announcement of $100,000 fees—sadly, out of my home institution at UWA. 


There is no equitable scenario in the agenda being pushed here. What we are seeing is the opportunity of a better future that higher education affords being taken away from those who cannot afford it. This bill is about the wrong priorities of this government. We have a government driven on giving tax cuts to millionaires—to the detriment of those in need of support. It's a government delighting multinationals with tax cuts—showering the big end of town with a $65 billion tax cut—and then getting them to write letters to crossbenchers. This is the great compact that this government has with large corporations to buy some votes in the other place—a letter.


The flipside to the largesse of this government is the educational future, the employment opportunities and the standard of living for everyday people for whom university will be out of reach. Instead of breaking down barriers to higher education, this government is actively looking to build up barriers that prevent access to university. What we need to be doing as a country is investing in people and enabling them to realise their potential. We need to embrace the fairness of our world-class student loan system and we need to protect it, and we certainly should not be doing this act of destruction.


I mentioned at the start of my contribution on this bill the magnitude of what universities themselves, as well as students, have done in the activity of budget repair. I'm going to read from a Universities Australia paper from April of last year, 'The facts on university funding', where they conclude:


Australia's universities and their students have made a very substantial contribution to repair Australia's Budget position since 2011. They have done their bit.


Any further reductions would increase financial pressures for students already under stress and put at risk the ability of our world-class universities to continue to deliver excellence in education and research—the foundation of our third-largest export industry and the bedrock of future economic prosperity. 


It's important to understand how universities are funded. To ignore the fact that, over the many years of universities in this country, student fees do end up subsidising research is to ignore what is true. Maybe people don't agree with that being the case, but it is the case and, until we have a greater reform of our research and science funding system and how it intersects with our higher education student payments and fees system, it will remain the case—and we need to address the world as it is.


I want to chat briefly about the student experience because the bill before us will affect that. It puts the current student experience at risk, and I note that the student experience has been in decline for some time. It's a critical part of the role of universities to provide a safe and inclusive environment that enables young people—and mature age students, of course—to actively participate in the university community through clubs and societies, sporting or interest based, or culturally based focusing on international students, who provide us with our third-biggest export in this country.


As costs to attend universities increase, especially for local students, and students are exposed to ever-increasing fee liability on completion of their degree, it becomes harder for student societies, student unions and guilds to attract members, participants and the volunteers that keep these groups running—groups that add so much to the life and vibrancy of university campuses around this country. In parliament today, I spoke with the Australasian Union of Jewish Students, which is celebrating its 20th year. Groups like this get together and depend on the volunteer students who can generate interest on topics. Today, they were asking parliamentarians to talk about their experiences in this place and the road to this place. Firstly, I'd like to thank those students for their terrific work and what they're doing, and for organising for 60-odd members of the Union of Jewish Students to be here in the House today. But these kinds of groups are at risk when people can no longer afford the time because they have to work ever-increasing hours at their jobs, which pay less because penalty rates are cut, so that they can, in some way, contribute to their education because their parents are unable to support them, or they're simply not able to move out of home—all the things that seem to go along with a university education, or did once. I'd also like to thank Ariel Zohar for the invitation to speak to the Australasian Union of Jewish Students today.


There are other institutions that are important across universities. At the university I studied at, unbelievable fundraising activities took place. These groups face the very real challenge of students no longer being able to participate in them. I think of the university camps run at the start of each year for disadvantaged children across Western Australia. It's been going for a long time, but it's increasingly challenging for those groups to have students involved because of the pressures that the costs of education are placing on what we might think of as not study time but, nonetheless, a valuable part of the student experience at universities in Australia.


These institutions and international societies—the Association of Malaysian Students and the Singapore Students' Association—of course, are very important in the system in Western Australia, as they are where our educational exports come from. The highest number of Singaporeans outside of Singapore reside in Perth, and a lot of that is off the back of Singaporeans having come down from Singapore to study in Perth because it's close to their home. And so I thank all those students who participate, who help to welcome new international students to our shores and who make them feel welcome at our campuses.


Obviously, many of us in this chamber have been to orientation days. Recently, I was at Murdoch University and Curtin University, and whilst I did say hello to the Liberal clubs, of course I stayed and said hello to the Labor clubs. I would like to shout out to some good people who are engaging with local students about getting involved in talking politics: Lewis Whittaker, Kai Donaldson, Erin Horrigan, Chris Lesiter, Jay Wood, Conor McLaughlin and Braydon Wagstaff.


Over at Curtin, a great institution where I went with the member for Kingsford Smith, we talked about the Australian republic and the move for an Australian head of state. We had the great support of Jason Lawrence, Beck Bogdan and Bridget Edwards. There will always be students who can do it and who will do it, but I think it's time that all governments laid off students at universities in their passion for budget repair. We know that budget repair is critical. We support that, but these people—students and universities—are not the people to use to correct the budget.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (16:21):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. I thank the member for Brand for her contribution, and heartily endorse her work with the Australian Republican Movement to make sure we get some progressive change there. I want to say up-front that Labor opposes this legislation. I feel strongly about the measures that the Turnbull government is attempting to legislate in this bill.


I begin with a bit of history, both personal and national. I taught English, geography and a few other subjects in state and Catholic schools for 11 years. I have two sons, one in grade 4 at a state school and the other in grade 8 at a Catholic school. I was also a union organiser for private schools for a couple of years. I'm very passionate about the education of my own children—although neglecting them often by coming to Canberra—the education of all children in Moreton and the future of education in Australia.


There is a quote from Confucius that I like to use when talking about this topic. It says, 'If your plan is for one year, plant rice. If your plan is for 10 years, plant trees. If your plan is for 100 years, educate children.' Clearly, as a nation we should be planning for 100 years, but, instead, this bill before us is an unfair piece of legislation that attacks students and undermines the fairness of our world-class student loan system.


In 1989 Labor introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. It was the first income contingent loan scheme, and would become the foundation of Australia's fair and accessible higher education system. I do declare up-front that I did not pay HECS in my first qualification to become a teacher. That was a different time, and it is unfair that someone in my generation got the benefits of free education coming through under Whitlam and the like.


Nevertheless, Australian Labor brought in these changes, based on the belief that it is fair and reasonable in the current economic climate that students should contribute to the cost of their public education to the extent that they obtain a private benefit from such studies. It enabled many young people who would otherwise not have gone to university to gain a tertiary degree. It gave them an educational opportunity. I know that as the first of 10 people in my family, raised by a single mum, to obtain a higher education qualification.


It is not always an easy or direct path to university education, but we, as a nation, should be making it easier, not harder, for people. There are many examples of Australians who have gone on to make extensive contributions to society after taking a more meandering road, shall we say, to their educational attainment. Our country is far better off for their having made those sacrifices and taken those brave decisions. After becoming a teacher, I became a lawyer. I went through night school while I was teaching, and I saw how difficult it was. But I would like to point out two particular lawyers who work in the legal system. One is the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Hon. Chief Justice Susan Kiefel, a Queenslander. Chief Justice Kiefel left school at 15 after completing grade 10. She completed her secretarial training at the Kangaroo Point Technical College in Brisbane and worked as a secretary for a variety of companies, including a building society and an exploration company, before working for a group of barristers. While working she completed her secondary schooling and then began studying law. I think the Chief Justice has done all right for herself—being Chief Justice of the High Court—all things considered and by any measure. 


Another example that many in this chamber would know is my friend, the Queensland Attorney-General, the Hon. Yvette D'Ath. Yvette left school at 15 and worked in clerical and hospitality positions. Eventually, she put herself through night school while continuing to work and raise a family. The Attorney-General of Queensland obtained a Bachelor of Laws from QUT and she is now Queensland's first law officer—a great success in anyone's eyes—and is well loved by many in this chamber. 


They're just two examples. There are many other people, who may not be as well-known as the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General of Queensland, who for whatever reason have not thought that tertiary education was something they could or should attain when they finished high school but who have later obtained a higher qualification and achieved great things. 


HECS and, more recently, the HECS-HELP scheme, along with other measures designed to encourage university participation, have successfully boosted university attendance by minority groups, including first-in-family tertiary students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds and Indigenous students. In particular, participation for students with a disability has increased by more than 106 per cent; Indigenous students—an increase of 89 per cent; low-SES students—increased by 55 per cent; and regional and remote students by more than 48 per cent. One would think that the National Party—those supposed champions of the bush—would be doing all they could to support this legislation. Instead, they bend over and let it go through on behalf of the Liberal Party. 


The MYEFO package of $2.2 billion of cuts is the out-of-touch Turnbull government's fourth attempt since coming into office to cut universities and make students pay more. At Christmas the Turnbull government froze university grants effectively ending demand-driven funding. Also announced were the measures contained in this bill which seek to enact a number of changes to Australia's world-class income contingent higher education loan scheme. 


This legislation sets a new repayment threshold for HELP from 1 July 2018, starting with a new minimum repayment of $45,000. It aligns indexation of HELP repayment thresholds to CPI instead of average weekly earnings. It introduces a new combined loan limit on how much students can borrow under HELP, including VET student loans, HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP. The new limit would be $104,000, or $150,000 for students studying medicine, dentistry or veterinary science. It also makes changes to the Student Financial Supplement Scheme and its repayment thresholds. 


This legislation is unfair, out of touch and a complete rip-off for students. Students should not be looked at as cash cows for budget repair—the very same budget that is handing out $65 billion to large corporations, particularly banks and multinationals. We know that higher student debt and the potential for significantly earlier repayment are genuine barriers to study for low-SES, disadvantaged and regional students who may need to travel for study—so extra hurdles in front of them. These students are less likely to be able to rely on parental support during university or the early years of their careers—yet another reason this policy will cause those from certain backgrounds the most suffering. 


We should be doing all that we can to increase participation in higher ed, not making it harder. If we don't boost participation, we risk being left behind compared to the rest of the world. Universities should never be only for the elite. We need our brightest to be given opportunities, not just those who are the most well-heeled. Universities should be melting pots of society, bringing all parts of our community together—the bush and the city; Indigenous and non-Indigenous; and rich and poor. They should be bringing people together to research and make discoveries that will make all our lives better and develop the industries and jobs of the future. 


This bill is another episode in the sorry saga of this government trying to gut education in Australia, whether it's in schools, vocational education or at universities. Last year, the Turnbull government tried to make students start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000. That was just one of the measures in what was a fundamentally unfair LNP budget. It was the same budget that saw the big business tax giveaway to the top end of town blow out to over $65 billion. Labor joined with students around Australia and fought to stop this measure being implemented by the Turnbull government. Now it is proposing a new minimum threshold of $45,000, but it's still too low.


Labor believes the current repayment rate is about right. We don't want to make students repay their debts right when they're starting a career, trying to start a family or save to buy a house. This is yet another example of the Turnbull government failing to act to make Australia fair. Labor's proposal to limit negative gearing will give young first home owners a chance to compete in this market.


Recent analysis revealed that low- and middle-income areas of Australia will be hurt most by Prime Minister Turnbull's $2.2 billion of university cuts. Western Sydney, western and outer Melbourne and outer metro Brisbane and Perth are all being hit particularly hard. When Labor uncapped university places these areas saw a huge increase in the number of students attending university, because that's where the demand was. Statistics show that participation in higher education in outer suburban and regional areas still lags behind the wealthier inner urban areas. I've said in this place before that your bank balance or your parents' bank balance should not affect your ability to go to university; it should be your intellect, not your postcode, obviously.


Labor opened the door to higher education for hundreds of thousands more Australians, but the eternally out-of-touch Prime Minister Turnbull has slammed that door shut. It's estimated that up to 10,000 people could miss out on a place at university this year and next year, because of Prime Minister Turnbull's cruel cuts. This is a sorry blow to the many year 12 graduates who studied so hard in the hope of getting into university but now might not be able to enter. Since the cuts were announced before Christmas, there have already been reports of some universities turning away students and cutting programs. This bill puts higher education further out of reach for Australians.


In my own community, Griffith University is set to lose $92 million. I oppose this bill on behalf of all university students at all universities, but particularly the more than 13,000 students who attend Griffith University in my electorate. I was at Griffith University on the weekend for a citizenship ceremony as part of Harmony Day. It was a joint venture with the World Arts and Multi-culture Inc. I'm wearing the tie that Professor Martin Betts, from Griffith University, gave me to show my support for Griffith University. I also give a shout out to Lewis Lee who emceed a wonderful event on the weekend.


The Higher Education Loan Program, referred to as HELP, is the cornerstone of Australia's higher education system. In a submission to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, Universities Australia, the peak body representing the university sector, recommended that the government not set the minimum repayment threshold below a level that reflects a reasonable graduate earnings. A number of other submissions to the Senate committee inquiry raised concerns about the possible impact of a lower HELP minimum repayment threshold on access to higher education and graduate living conditions. The NUS and the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations have collaborated on a campaign called Bury the Bill to oppose this piece of legislation, stating it:


…condemns lower-earning graduates to pay back their student loans when barely earning minimum wage.


That's right, the government's proposed repayment threshold is only $9,000 more than the minimum wage.


Another submission, this time by the NTEU, raises significant questions about whether this government has bothered to fully understand the impact this change to HELP repayment thresholds will have on women. In their submission they analysed data obtained from the ATO showing that 60 per cent of people with a taxable income and an outstanding HELP debt are women. The same data also showed that the taxable income of these women was significantly lower. So not only are the majority of HELP recipients women, they are also earning less than their male counterparts. It is a real double whammy, made worse by the Turnbull government's further increase in the repayment burden in a system that is already skewed against women.


The Australasian Council of Deans of Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities argued in its submission that the measure will have a disproportionate impact on graduates of humanities, arts and social science courses. They often take a longer time to establish their careers and are more likely to be women, resulting in periods of lower earnings. The Equity Practitioners in Higher Education Australasia, in their submission, suggested the limit:


… may impact negatively on students who incurred a VET student debt as a pathway to higher education. In addition, the method of determining the loan limit is not explained, and may have implications for students accessing Start-up loans.


Likewise, Science and Technology Australia raised concerns about the impact on those entering university from VET pathways and then undertaking further training to become teachers, especially in science, technology, engineering and mathematics—the industries of the future creating the jobs of the future. 


Labor believes in fairness for all Australians. Labor believes in everybody having a fair go. Labor believes in all Australians being able to achieve their potential. That is why Labor opened the door to university for hundreds of thousands more Australians. But Prime Minister Turnbull has slammed that door in the face of young Australians who dreamt of a university education. The Turnbull government is ripping $436 million from Queensland universities. Griffith University, in my electorate, will have $92 million ripped from their funding. The Turnbull government's cuts to universities have effectively reintroduced a cap on the number of uni places, taking us back to the dark days of the Howard era. We should be supporting our young people to strive hard and let them get ahead. Some young people in my electorate who will now be prevented from enrolling in university will have worked hard throughout their schooling in the hope of going to uni, but they've had their hopes dashed by an uncaring Turnbull government. 


The Turnbull government have their priorities wrong. They're keen to make life easier for big business by giving away $65 billion in tax, but at the same time they're prepared to prevent our children from receiving a quality education, dashing the hopes of these young people, these smart people, these people who will create the jobs of the future. These proposals, coupled with the other MYEFO higher education cuts, raise significant questions and cast doubt over the future of the demand-driven funding system. They take a swipe at the ability of HELP to genuinely increase access and participation in tertiary education. That is why I do not support this legislation. (Time expired)

"Lamb, Susan, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (16:36):  I'm proud to be part of the party that stands up for education. In Labor, we believe in education. It's why Labor's been fighting for strong educational outcomes for Australians for many years. I don't believe investment in education is something we should be having to fight for, of course. We should be just fighting for what's right, for what just makes sense for the future of our country, for what all of the research says is a good idea, both in educational outcomes and as an investment in the future of Australia. But fighting for education is what we need to do with this government, because this Liberal-National government is doing whatever it takes to undermine every single educational system in Australia, from early childhood education all the way to tertiary studies. 


What we know is that families with young children will be affected by the government's planned childcare package, which will see 2,239 families in my electorate worse off, 2,239 families whose children will have reduced access to affordable early childhood education. Families with school-aged children will suffer the brunt of the Liberals' $17 billion cut from schools and, once you're out of school, young people are faced with a $3 billion cut to vocational education and training. For those who would rather go to university, they will have to endure a $2.2 billion cut to unis. The University of the Sunshine Coast, which has just begun its first semester operating at the Caboolture campus, will be hit with a $34 million cut. I've been having a number of conversations with the USC staff, who are worried about the impact of cuts on their existing operations and on their grand plans for the future for our region. These cuts are disgraceful, and they are in stark contrast to how we on this side of the House see priorities. 


When Labor were last in government, we lifted investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. The steps that Labor took opened the doors of universities to 190,000 more Australians, many of whom became the first in their family to go to university. This was a great step forward, but the conservatives are determined to stand in the way of progress, and they're seeking to do this today with a bill that directly attacks students seeking to further their studies. It attacks students and undermines the fairness and integrity of Australia's world-class student loans scheme, the Higher Education Loan Program, or, as we know it, HELP. 


Any changes to the HELP scheme need to be considered and evidence based. I'd like to point to a quote from Ms Catriona Jackson, the Deputy Chief Executive of Universities Australia. She said:


… the first principle—the first thing you must keep in your mind when you're changing this fundamentally important scheme—is to do no harm.


In last year's budget we saw the government attempt to compel students to start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000. That's barely more than the minimum wage. That failed, thank goodness, and unsurprisingly so, because Australians value people who seek to further their education. That's why, we know, the Liberals are trying again with a slightly higher repayment threshold. It's $45,000 this time but it's still far too low. In fact, as the ACTU have stated, it's a mere $9,000 more than the minimum wage.


The point of these loans isn't to churn someone through a degree and be done with them; it's to give them an opportunity to set themselves up with a career that will benefit them, benefit their families and, of course, benefit the country. Students should not have to repay all of their debts in their first, low-paying job after university, especially not when the cost of living has grown to such exorbitant heights under this government. We must do all we can to increase participation in higher education, not make it harder to access.


It's already hard enough for a student from a low-SES or disadvantaged background to access higher education. For many students in Longman, this is a genuine barrier. If you're already struggling to get by—maybe you've suffered a pay cut through the government's cuts to penalty rates or maybe you're already working two jobs to help support your family—your capacity to go to university is already severely limited. I'd like to further pick up on that limitation when it comes to women. The National President of the National Union of Students, Mark Pace, stated to the inquiry of the Education and Employment Legislation Committee into the bill:


We know from the National Tertiary Education Union's submission to this Senate inquiry that 60 per cent of all Australians with outstanding HELP debt are women and that two-thirds of the Australians who will be dragged into the debt pool with the new proposed repayment thresholds will also be women …


There's already enough day-to-day stress. Adding yet another financial burden would certainly take its toll. Let's be very clear: the government made no significant case in this Senate inquiry for a change to HELP beyond some budget savings.


As I mentioned, the University of the Sunshine Coast have just started up their Caboolture campus in my electorate of Longman, and they're doing their part to ensure that disadvantaged students have a pathway into tertiary education. Earlier this month I facilitated conversations between staff at the USC and a number of our special assistance schools in the area. We discussed how we could get our disadvantaged students interested in tertiary education—how to open up a pathway and help get them there. What was pretty clear at that roundtable was that the changes proposed by the government will have a devastating effect on getting disadvantaged students to engage in tertiary studies. Experts have warned time and time again that if Australia does not boost participation in post-secondary education there is a strong chance that we will be left behind by the rest of the world. It is estimated that about 10,000 people could miss out on a university place again next year because of the Turnbull government's cuts. This will affect people in the regions, particularly in areas like Narangba and Caboolture. It will hit students in these areas the hardest. These areas are already lagging behind the wealthier, inner-city urban areas when it comes to participation in higher education. Now, with all the cuts the Liberals have forced upon TAFE and the vocational education sector, it's not like there are many opportunities left to turn to if you're a student in my electorate.


But what makes it even worse is that the reason that the Turnbull government is pursuing these cuts is to give a $65 billion handout to big businesses. I find this truly, truly disgraceful. I also find it disgraceful that Pauline Hanson, who likes to claim she's a friend of battlers, has sold them out once again. After conspiring with her dear friends in the coalition here, Senator Hanson has agreed to throw $65 billion worth of taxpayer money at banks and big businesses. She's agreed to throw that money, while, at the same time, that will force the government to see universities like the University of the Sunshine Coast face $34 million worth of cuts in their aim to educate students, and we'll see $600 million worth of cuts to TAFE. That's what will happen.


When Labor win the next election, we will be putting Australia back on track. What you'll see is a government taking education seriously and investing in the future of this country, right from early childhood education through to tertiary education and TAFE. We'll be bringing Australia back to a position where we don't need to rely on so many 457 visa workers, for example. We'll be able to employ locally.


The Liberals and One Nation seem to think that the answer to a shortage of workers skilled through university or TAFE is to look overseas. Well, it's not. That's simply a bandaid solution. It does nothing to move more Australians into work, and it does even less to prevent this issue continuing into the future.


Senator Hanson's big-business-tax-cut sweetener, as we know, was 1,000 apprenticeship places. That barely scratches the surface. Under this government, we've seen 140,000 apprenticeships and traineeships lost. That's right. So what we've got here is a One Nation vote in the Senate that will cost this nation $65 billion worth of tax cuts for banks and big businesses in return for less than one per cent of the number of apprenticeships that have been lost under this government. That's what it will cost.


But I can tell you that Labor's commitment to reversing the government's cuts to TAFE and training will take a huge step forward, as will the 20,000 fast-tracked apprenticeships for people facing redundancies or whose jobs have been lost, and our revolutionary national inquiry into postsecondary education will bring it all together. Within our first 100 days of government, we will examine every aspect of the vocational and higher education systems, and we'll make sure that they have the resources and systems in place to best assist Australia's economy and society. Investing in education always pays off. Whether we're talking about early childhood education or schools or we're talking about TAFE, vocational education or our universities, it always pays off. By any other name, investing in education means investing in people. It's investing in Australians.


What we know are cruel changes that the government want to pass show that they're too busy throwing money at big business to look ahead. I'd like to invite the government—any government member they like—to come out to my electorate. Come to Caboolture and visit some of those special assistance schools with me. Come and talk to those young students from disadvantaged backgrounds, the ones who are looking for a pathway, those who, even before turning 18, are struggling to get by and have struggled to get by.


I visit them quite regularly because, whether it's Horizons College or Alta-1 or YJET, they're doing some really great work. So I visit them quite often. They're inspiring young minds to believe in themselves, to give themselves some aspiration in life to do better for themselves and their families, not just to accept hardship that's been dished out to them but to strive for something more. That's why we're having these conversations with the University of the Sunshine Coast: to give them that pathway. We want them to look at tertiary institutions—like, as I said, the University of the Sunshine Coast or maybe, if they want to head into Brisbane, QUT or UQ—and just know that that's not out of reach for them. So I invite any government member to come and talk to these students at any of those schools. Ask them about the impact of these changes and what effect not having that pathway would have on them. Ask them if watering down our world-class student loans makes it easier for them to get into university. I openly give this offer, because I'll tell you what those opposite will hear if they come out. They'll hear students unanimously saying changes to HELP are anything but helpful to them. We're not just talking about school leavers. I'd like to extend that invitation. Come and speak to some of the students that are in their 30s and 40s and for whatever reason didn't get the opportunity or didn't take that pathway and now want to. Come and talk to them about how the government's changes to HELP will affect those people who want to create a better future for their families. The other thing those opposite will hear is about cutting funds to TAFE. They'll hear just how those TAFE funding cuts are affecting students and children that might want to head down that pathway. 


Those opposite need to stop looking up at big business. Instead, we need them to look forward—and look forward to our students and to investing in their education. If they do that, they'll see that investing in people is the fastest way for our country to go forward into our future. Thank you.

"Swanson, Meryl, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (16:51):  I rise to speak against the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 because it is a blatant attack on Australian students. This bill stands to undermine the fairness of our nation's student loan scheme. Once again, my colleagues and I stand in this House railing against the Turnbull government's unfair and inequitable policies, which rip funding away from the most vulnerable to pave the path for the big end of town. 


This legislation stands against everything we know to be vital to encourage post-secondary education. It throws up yet another roadblock for the socioeconomically disadvantaged. It is a disincentive to the lifelong learning all progressive Australians know will be necessary to build the agile, smart workforce needed to futureproof our nation's industries and economy and to keep pace on the global stage—something the Prime Minister repeats over and over again as he ties our students' hands behind their backs. As it stands, the bill sets a new minimum repayment threshold of $45,000, which is just $9,000 above the minimum wage. It introduces a new combined loan limit, capping the amount students can borrow to cover their tuition fees. In these two points alone, there are two clear disincentives to post-secondary study. Those coming into the workforce on entry-level wages are often at a stage in life where they're trying to plan for a family or save for a home, and they are going to be slugged with extra financial imposts they can ill afford. Placing a limit on the amount students can borrow across their lifetime will really greatly hinder their ability to adopt the long-term theoretical, academic and practical skill development we know will be vital as technology changes what we do and, more importantly, how we live. 


In typical fashion, this bill is all about saving the Turnbull government money, and a lot of it. The changes to programs including VET student loans, HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP will save the government $345.8 million in fiscal balance across four years. Changes to the Student Financial Supplement Scheme will claw the government back an additional $32.3 million in cash balance across four years. Of course, those two amounts alone will very neatly cover the Turnbull government's $65 billion tax breaks for big business. But what's the real cost to our country? 


I am a proud alumnus of the University of Newcastle. I was born in the regional town of Heddon Greta, and I'm fortunate I came through my tertiary years at a time when education was truly accessible for all Australians. I started in 1989, the first year of HECS. I was happy to contribute to pay my bit, but now things aren't so rosy. Australian students in the year 2018 already make the sixth-highest contribution to their university fees in the OECD.


I know many families in my electorate—and there is profound socioeconomic disadvantage in some of these areas—where an erosion of the existing student supports will mean post-secondary education becomes nothing more than a pipedream. And, being first in family to go to university, I understand just how powerful that can be. These are areas where unemployment rates outstrip the national average, where youth joblessness is at crisis point, where people struggle to pay their electricity bills and where public transport is non-existent or so intermittent it might as well be useless. We know beyond doubt that higher debt is a massive disincentive for lower socioeconomic and disadvantaged students considering further education. They don't want that millstone around their neck.


We also know that, in this time of global economic transition, we need to invest in people. We need to build lifelong learners who embrace change and accept that growth and development are the only guarantee of future success. Why then are we making it harder for people to get post-secondary qualifications? Why are we making it more expensive to be smarter? It is just crazy economics. If we can for a moment take a break away from the Turnbull government's budget-centric view of managing our nation, there are many, many ways we could take a holistic approach towards encouraging post-secondary education.


Earlier this month, I met with Professor Caroline McMillen, the outgoing Vice-Chancellor of the University of Newcastle, and Leah Anderson, from the Tomaree Business Chamber, who also happens to be the Port Stephens Woman of the Year. We were discussing the barriers to post-secondary education faced by young people in Port Stephens. You may not have heard of Port Stephens, Deputy Speaker, but I imagine you have heard of Nelson Bay, which is the heart of this blue-water wonderland. It's an idyllic place for a beach getaway, but if you're a young person it can feel like the end of the earth. There is literally one road in and the same road out. There's only public transport via bus. The services are infrequent and the trip to Newcastle is long. Connectivity is a massive disincentive for students, jobseekers and even employees. There is a steady bleed of established professionals out of the area. It's blatantly obvious, then, that offering young people transport so that they can access training, education and even employment would make a massive difference to their lives, their futures and our economy.


As Deputy Chair of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation, I have sat in on a great many hearings across our country, hearing from people in our regional and rural communities about the issues they face. Whilst each area is diverse and boasts its unique set of opportunities and challenges, many could be cut and pasted from one town to the other. The big issues include connectivity, whether it be physical connection through public transport or internet connection through our failed NBN. I note the shadow minister sits at the table. She has worked so tirelessly for people across the nation who are just screaming out for decent connectivity. Educational opportunities are also going begging, as is quality health care. These are the things that people want in regional and remote parts of Australia. We must get these fundamentals right from day dot if we're going to level the playing field and ensure more young Australians get on a pathway to success earlier in their lives, especially if we'd like them to take up places in regional and rural Australia. Australia must do everything it can to support its young people, and the Turnbull government must really end this war that they seem to be waging on our youth, making it so hard. Young people are the very future of this nation, at every level and in every way. We must facilitate, encourage and enable, not throw up roadblocks and disincentives at every turn. 


Universities Australia and the National Union of Students found that in 2012 two-thirds of Australian students lived below the Henderson poverty line and one in five students regularly skip meals. How can the Turnbull government, with any conscience, now lower the student loan repayment threshold? In many instances, these young people have worked in casual, low-paid positions to fund their education. Then, when they finally graduate and embark on their new career, they are immediately slugged with loan repayments. It just isn't fair. It wasn't fair when the government proposed an income threshold of $42,000, and it is not fair under the $45,000 threshold that this bill prescribes. This short-sighted approach from a government that trumpets its economic nous really is quite ludicrous.


Experts warn Australia risks being left behind if it doesn't boost participation in post-secondary education. Instead of accepting this truth and stepping up to re-examine and re-invigorate our current model in favour of something that truly reflects the current landscape, this government continues to cut and cut and cut. We need to build, build and build something new, something that is built to meet the needs of this era, something that is built to meet the needs of the future, something that spans the whole of the post-secondary sector. It needs to be dynamic, it needs to be responsive to a changing system and it needs to happen quickly. The systems in place are not well equipped for lifetime learning, and this bill's cap on loans further restricts that potential. It is yet another example of the Turnbull government's myopic focus on the budget. This government is more concerned about the numbers on a page year to year than the long-term economic prosperity of our nation and its people.


I have a long-held passion for encouraging industries in my electorate to diversify and adapt to economic and technological change. I've been inspired and educated by many in the lower Hunter who work every day towards these goals. I'm proud to be part of the Hunter Youth Transition Advisory Group, and I commend to you an organisation called Youth Express, which facilitates young people's transition from education to employment and builds bridges between students and industry. Similarly, Alesco Senior College, which has campuses in two towns in my electorate—Raymond Terrace and Nelson Bay—is doing great things for young people in my area. Alesco is passionate about filling voids, not reinventing the wheel. It creates a place for young people who, for a variety of reasons, have opted out before completing their secondary education. Alesco gives them another chance, another pathway, another choice.


The University of Newcastle has three fantastic enabling programs. There is one geared towards Indigenous students; one called Open Foundation, which builds a bridge to university for those who did not achieve a TER; and one called Newstep. These are exceptional programs that change lives and in turn change our economic and social fabric. The University of Newcastle is also actively exploring innovation hubs in collaboration with local industry. There is a highly successful hub at Williamtown, which benefits from synergies with the defence and aerospace industries. I know other businesses are keen to explore the potential for similar hubs in the Hunter. These are all great examples of ways that we can create educational opportunities for our young people and encourage post-secondary study, all while working with industry and really capturing true innovation.


The government could be encouraging these wonderful initiatives. It could be funding our schools and giving them the resources to allow them to more actively engage with our local government and business chamber representatives to learn where our economy is headed. Educators could learn where the new jobs are likely to be and create educational opportunities based on these scenarios. Instead, the Turnbull government has cut school funding by $17 billion. The government could be exploring initiatives such as satellite campuses for our tertiary institutions. Instead, people such as Professor Caroline McMillen are dealing with the fallout of the federal government's $2.2 billion in budget cuts. What of vocational education and training? What of it, indeed. Under this government, we have seen nearly $3 billion cut. That translates into 140,000 apprenticeships and trainees lost since the Liberals took the reins. That is 140,000 opportunities for people to better their skills and their lives.


I will vote against this government's proposed changes to Australia's student loan scheme. I stand with Labor. Under a Labor government real and meaningful reforms were delivered to students pursuing higher education. Labor believes a fair and accessible higher education scheme must include income contingent loans, and that is why when in 1989 we introduced HECS as one of many reforms, it was broadly welcomed. People knew it was a fair system. We lifted Australia's investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013.


In more recent times Labor's equity and participation measures, including demand driven funding and HECS-HELP, transformed our tertiary education system. History proved Labor's measures worked: 190,000 more Australians were able to go to university. Many were the first in their families, as I was, to achieve that level of education. Universities Australia research shows marked improvement in the participation rates of students from underrepresented or disadvantaged groups. Between 2008 and 2016 the number of domestic undergraduate students with a disability rose by 106.5 per cent, Indigenous student numbers went up by almost 90 per cent, the number of students of low socioeconomic status increased by 55.3 per cent, and the number of students from regional and remote areas went up by 48.3 per cent. The world is changing quickly, and our policies must keep pace with those changes. We must look to the future and invest in our people if we are to help our young grow into smart, agile, lifelong learners who will innovate and adapt to survive this changing technological landscape. Without this investment right now, Australia will be left behind.

Mr MORTON
 (Tangney) (17:06):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. At its core these amendments ensure the sustainability of our student loan system, recognised as one of the most generous in the world. The bill introduces a new set of repayment thresholds for student loans, changes indexation arrangements for repayment thresholds, amends the order of repayment of some student loan debts and introduces a combined lifetime loan limit for taxpayer funded student loans. I support these amendments because I understand the importance of a tertiary education and want to ensure future generations have the same opportunity I had. Like the previous speaker, I was the first in my family, and one of only a handful at my high school, to go to university. It was a privilege to receive my university education with no up-front cost. My student loan was funded by people like my brothers, who work in the construction industry, and my family members, who work hard in their small business and who didn't go to university but paid taxes to give me the opportunity to borrow from them, the taxpayer, through the government to better myself and get the education. The privilege of receiving that student loan came with a responsibility for me to repay it.


Unfortunately, under the current system some students will never accept the responsibility of repaying their taxpayer funded student loans. They are happy to accept the student loan provided to them by the hardworking Australian taxpayers but have not repaid it. As of 30 June 2017 only $35.9 billion out of the total debt of $55.4 billion will likely be repaid. I absolutely support these amendments, which I believe will ultimately reduce the debt load. However, I believe that for the long-term sustainability of the system we will need to go further. I was pleasantly surprised by the contribution from the Labor member for Bruce, who last year spoke about the importance of debt recovery from the states. To be very clear, this would not be a death tax. As the member for Bruce said, it is simply:



… requiring HELP debts to be repaid, just like tax or social security debts …



I agree that there is a strong policy case to look at the option of recouping student debts from certain estates. I believe those who enter into student loan agreements do so freely. There needs to be an understanding that these loans are from the Australian taxpayer and must be repaid. It would be my absolute pleasure to work with the member for Bruce on further measures in a very bipartisan way.


It remains our intent to ensure Australians who have not gone to university are not unfairly bearing the costs of those who have not repaid their loans. In the same way, those who have had the opportunity to attend university and have diligently paid off their loans should not be made to bear the cost. We must continue to work on this issue. It is all about fairness. The reality is that taxpayer funded student loan repayments have not kept pace with lending growth. Since 2009 funding for Commonwealth supported places has grown at twice the rate of the economy, and from 2011 to 2017 the level of new debt not expected to be repaid increased from 16 per cent to 25 per cent. It is a serious concern that, according to the 2016 Australian National Audit Office estimates, on its current trajectory, by 2024-25 outstanding HELP debts will total $192.5 billion and almost 30 per cent—$55 billion—will not be repaid. Imagine the differences that $55 billion would make if invested in our education system or other government services.


We need to take action now the ensure that our higher education system is sustainable. Announced in MYEFO, these policy measures will replace the previous legislative proposals from the 2017-18 budget. I supported the previous reforms and I was disappointed they were voted down in the Senate.


We all have skin in this game of education, whether it be as a former, current or future student, a parent, a taxpayer, an educator, as administrators or, ultimately, as employers in business or service providers in every corner of Australia. The new amendments propose that from 1 July 2018 there be a lower minimum repayment threshold of $45,000 at a one per cent repayment rate. There will be smaller incremental rises in thresholds and repayment rates up to a top threshold of $131,989, at which 10 per cent of income is repayable. The minimum repayment threshold is $10,000 less than the current threshold of $55,000.


This repayment threshold will then be indexed according to the consumer price index rather than the average weekly earnings. This change is consistent with recommendations from both the National Commission of Audit in 2014 and the Grattan Institute. This change in indexation is important to ensure that those who have dropped out of the repayment streams as the thresholds rise faster than their income growth are brought back in and are repaying their student loans sooner. This will ensure repayment requirements are adjusted in line with the cost of living.


Other key changes come in the form of student thresholds for the Student Financial Supplement Scheme, which will be brought into line with the HELP repayment thresholds from 1 July 2019. This is to improve rates of repayment by replacing the three-tier threshold approach applied to Student Financial Supplement Scheme repayments with a new HELP threshold. This change ensures the HELP debt takes priority over other student loan debts.


Finally, there will be an introduction of new combined loan limits on how much students can borrow under taxpayer funded student loans to cover their tuition fees. The combined limit is $150,000 for students studying medicine, dentistry and vet science courses and $104,440 for other students. These limits would be sufficient to cover the study of even the most expensive courses for almost nine years as a Commonwealth supported, taxpayer supported student. The loan limit is not new, but it will now apply to HECS-HELP as well as students accessing the FEE-HELP, VET FEE-HELP and VET student loans.


But these amendments are all about fairness. Income contingent loans, the basis of our taxpayer funded student loan system, were introduced as an answer to maintaining access and equity as well as providing less of a burden on the taxpayer. From inception, the repayment threshold was never set according to an optimum economic model or theory. It was purely driven by a sense of fairness. I'm proud that this government is making changes to ensure that there is real fairness in student loans. It is not fair to take a loan from the taxpayer to further yourself, to better yourself, and then not pay that loan back to the taxpayer, because taxpayers are people like my brother and my family members, who work hard in small business, who have never been to university, who have worked hard and paid their taxes to give me that opportunity. If I was to take from them a loan in order to get an education but then not to pay that back, that would be robbing future societies and generations of the opportunity that I've had.


It is not fair that everyone who's paid off a taxpayer funded student loan in full, like I have, should shoulder the burden of those students who have chosen not to. The failure of some students to pay their loans makes our education more expensive for everyone. Taking a student loan from hardworking taxpayers and not repaying it is taking a free ride. But let's not forget that students currently only pay an average of 42 per cent of the cost of their degree. The rest is already subsidised by the taxpayer. 


When we're talking about student loans, we're not talking about students borrowing the total cost of their entire education. As I said, 42 per cent of their degree, on average, is funded through student loans—the rest by the hardworking taxpayers in Australia. Research from the Grattan Institute indicates that the split for average contributions would move to 64 per cent government and 36 per cent student if we take into account debt that would probably not be repaid, and this is unsustainable. 


I congratulate Minister Birmingham on these new amendments. Unfortunately, those opposite and a select group of education institutions have chosen to cloud and misrepresent this critical debate. Labor's Treasury spokesman called the measures an attack on one of the sources of Australia's long-term prosperity. Well, the shadow Treasurer is right about one thing: education is a source of Australia's long-term prosperity. This government's approach to student loan repayments is consistent with intergenerational equity. It is consistent with ensuring university education will be sustainable in the long term. This is a responsible suite of reforms and is in stark contrast to the brash approach from the Labor Party, who, when they were last in government, announced $6 billion worth of cuts to the higher education support sector. 


We cannot afford to be complacent and risk jeopardising opportunities for future generations of students, who will also want to access student loans that remove all up-front fees from higher education. The time to change is now, and the opposition's position on this legislation only puts the entire system in jeopardy. I would like all Australian kids to have the opportunity I had, the opportunity to go to university at no up-front cost. But if we don't have a sustainable system, we won't have that opportunity in the future. 


We need to ensure that our system can respond to the impact of the tremendous expansion in student numbers. Over the last quarter of a century, private education student numbers grew at more than three times the rate of the population as a whole. This growth has imposed significant costs on taxpayers. The astounding thirst for education has been enabled by the demand driven system in recent years. 


It has also been driven by the reality that a post-school qualification remains one of the best investments an individual can make. University graduates enjoy consistently higher employment and incomes than those who only complete high school. Our higher education system is exceedingly successful and has an excellent reputation, both here and overseas. Tertiary education now spans a competitive market, where providers are more numerous, more diverse and more commercially oriented than they ever were before. Education is one of our most successful exports and is a significant source of income for our universities. In 2016 education export income reached its highest level ever at $21.8 billion. 


This legislation lays out achievable reforms that can safeguard the position of the education sector for the future. We cannot underestimate the importance of a sustainable student loan scheme. It brings certainty to the sector, which has been unanimous about the need for change and has been left waiting long enough. The Australian taxpayer student loan scheme remains one of the most successful public policy innovations ever, ensuring a vibrant education export industry, support for student career aspirations and a skilled workforce for our industry.


Where this legislation does have a financial impact on students, we will implement changes in a way that is gradual, fair and appropriate. These reforms ensure our high-quality tertiary education system can grow while meeting the global challenges it will increasingly face. It guarantees that students will continue to have access to higher education, irrespective of their background or financial means. These amendments, in line with the broader government plans, will deliver $1.2 billion in savings over the next two years. 


In the lead-up to last year's budget the Prime Minister said:


… we call on the other parties … to support us in bringing the budget back into balance. It is a responsibility that weighs heavily on the shoulders of every single member of the house and—


in particular—


… the Senate …


This government has made substantial progress, with MYEFO showing this year's federal deficit has improved by $5.8 billion compared to forecasts in the May budget. Education savings are an essential part of this broader budget strategy. 


Frankly, we're all in this together. Taxpayers, whose support means that no-one must pay up-front course fees, will get a better deal knowing that the Turnbull government is looking after them and making sure their investment is repaid. Our taxpayer funded student loan scheme was not designed to facilitate a lifelong limitless cash pool for students who choose not to pay back their student loans. 


Taxpayer generosity should not be taken for granted. The measures in this bill were designed with fairness and sustainability at their core. Commonwealth financial assistance through taxpayer funded student loans still means that no student will need to pay one cent up-front for their higher education. But students cannot take this assistance for granted. Taxpayer funded student loans must be repaid to ensure that the system is sustainable and is available for future generations.


These amendments are about fairness. These amendments are about someone entering into a loan. These are amendments about making sure that people who enter into a loan repay that loan. To think that there is opposition to a situation where you're asking someone to pay back a loan that they've entered into means that my mind boggles. This is about fairness; it's about fairness for the taxpayer that funds these loans and it's also about ensuring that more and more students can have the opportunity that I've had in receiving an education with no up-front fees. I hope that more students can have the same opportunity that I've had as well. Thank you.

"McBride, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (17:21):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loans Sustainability) Bill 2018. I oppose the bill, as it attacks student and it undermines the fairness of Australia's world-class student loan scheme. As we have heard, the bill makes a number of changes to Australia's income contingent loan scheme, the Higher Education Loan Program—HELP—and makes technical changes to the Student Financial Supplement Scheme. This is the first point on which I will focus.


This bill sets new repayment thresholds for HELP from 1 July 2018, starting with a new minimum repayment of $45,000 and with a one per cent repayment rate. There are a further 17 thresholds and repayment rates, up to a top threshold of $131,989, at which 10 per cent of payment would apply. It aligns the indexation of HELP repayment thresholds to CPI instead of to average weekly earnings and introduces a new combined loan limit on how much students can borrow under HELP to cover tuition fees from 1 January 2019. The combined limit would be $104,440, or $150,000 for students studying medicine, dentistry or vet science.


The government has previously tried to make changes to the HELP repayment threshold, attempting to lower the HELP repayment rate to $42,000 a year. Labor argued that this was too low. The bill did not make it through the Senate and was subsequently withdrawn. The proposal for a lifetime borrowing limit is a new proposal from the government and has significant implications for students. While the borrowing limit has been introduced in the VET student loan system—a proposal that Labor took to the last election—there has yet to be a limit for all loan schemes in the system.


Traditionally, Commonwealth supported places, or HECS places, did not have a borrowing limit for students. Students taking other courses that are not subsidised, like full-fee postgraduate coursework places, could take out a loan for the fees through the FEE-HELP scheme. Full fees were set by universities and higher education providers and have not been regulated, which has led to some students taking on significant debt. While there is some merit to sending a price signal through a lifetime borrowing limit, the proposal in this bill may have a range of unintended consequences and therefore must not be supported.


Labor referred this bill to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, and the committee tabled its report on 16 March. I support the position of the Labor senators in their dissenting report. This bill would have unintended and negative consequences on students, particularly students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and therefore must not be supported.


Income contingent loans have been a part of higher education since Labor introduced HECS in 1989. More recently, Labor's demand-driven funding, in conjunction with the HECS-HELP scheme and other equity and participation measures, has transformed higher education in Australia. As Universities Australia has shown, there has been a significant boost in university enrolments from underrepresented and disadvantaged students. This is such a critical point: universities are now open, more than ever before, to students from those underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds. It is important that we spend some time looking at those numbers.


From 2008 to 2016 the following growth occurred: the number of domestic undergraduate students grew from 24,311 to 50,206, a staggering 106.5 per cent. The proportion of students with a disability participating rose from 4.3 per cent to 6.4 per cent. The number of Indigenous students grew from 7,038 to 13,320, an increase of 89.3 per cent. The number of students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds grew from 90,467 to 140,462, an increase of 55.3 per cent. The number of students from remote and regional areas, such as mine, grew from 110,000 to 163,292, an increase of 48.3 per cent. In total, the number of undergraduate students from all these backgrounds—students with a disability, Indigenous students, and students from remote areas—grew 39.6 per cent.


What a remarkable success story that we have nearly 40 per cent more students from these groups going to university. Why are they doing that? Because there are pathways available, because higher education is seen as valuable and it's accessible because barriers are being removed. We know that high student debt is a genuine barrier to study for students from low-SES and disadvantaged backgrounds, so we must remove barriers, not put them up again. In my electorate of Dobell, on the Central Coast, we have the Ourimbah campus of the University of Newcastle, which is playing a vital role in removing these barriers. I want to quote—I know she's been quoted already this evening—the Vice Chancellor and President of the University of Newcastle, Professor Caroline McMillen, who said to a parliamentary committee hearing earlier this month:


As our mission, we are committed to equity and excellence. We have some 37,000 students, 27 per cent from low socioeconomic backgrounds, which reflects our demographics in the regions we serve, and around 1,000 are Indigenous, which is the largest number of any Australian university.


She further said:


… this university since its foundation has served the demographics of the region by ensuring we do not trade equity for excellence.


'We do not trade equity for excellence' are important words, and that is an important mission. In higher education, excellence is vital, equity is vital and access is necessary. Yet this government wants to increase student debt and make it harder for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to get a foot in the door.


At the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle, health is a big area of study. The university partners with the Central Coast local health district, where I used to work, and the PHN. Health and social services, my area of training and background, is one of the largest employers in our region on the Central Coast. Importantly, it is also one of the growth areas for future work. With higher education comes jobs—local jobs, quality jobs.


At the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle, enabling programs such as Open Foundation and Newstep are trusted pathways for students to get started, pathways to further study. Almost one in four commencing students at our campus starts their education through these enabling programs. They are the pathway for so many, for nurses like Michelle, who was recognised as Wyong hospital nurse of the year last year. I have spoken about Michelle before. She would not be a nurse without enabling education. She would not be serving our community at Wyong hospital without access to higher education. I've also spoken about Sam, who is now a speech pathologist and whose sister is training to be a teacher. Sam said she really noticed the impact on her sons of seeing her study. They could see their mother was studying at university, and they could see that they might be able to study at university too.


Today I'd like to speak about my friend Renee, a graduate of the Central Coast campus Open Foundation course, and now a neonatal intensive care nurse. These are Renee's own words:


The fact that there is an opportunity like Open Foundation has given me the confidence to do something I never knew I could do. I never thought I was smart enough when I was at school to commence university. Never once did I ever think that I would complete a bachelor degree. I ended up completing a bachelor of nursing with distinction. Now I work within one of the elite hospitals and it's my privilege to work with vulnerable families in the neonatal intensive care unit.


Labor understands the benefits of education to families. We understand that it can transform lives. Dr Joyleen Christensen, who I went to primary school with, is a program convener for enabling education at the same campus. Joy speaks about the impact of higher education on students who are the first ever in their family to go to university. She said:


These students have so many obstacles already. The reason many of them are involved is to improve the financial situation for them and for their families. They are taking time away from work. They are taking time away from their families and money away from their families to find out whether they can do this. They have incredible potential. This program is life changing for them, their families and our community. It transforms lives.


It's transformed the lives of Michelle and Renee, and the contribution they make through their nursing is invaluable to our community.


The Dean of the Central Coast campus, Dr Brok Glenn, told me earlier today that in 2018 more than half of commencing students, 55 per cent, are the first in their family to go to university. It is an outstanding achievement. This, he said, is about enabling programs, working with high schools and actually getting students and their parents onto the campus so they can see for themselves what is possible. On the Central Coast, only half of students have the opportunity to finish high school, and fewer than half of the working-age population, 45 per cent, have qualifications post-school. Access to higher education is making a difference.


The effect on women of the changes to HELP repayment thresholds must also be considered, as women will be disproportionately affected by these changes. Sixty per cent of Australians with outstanding HELP debt are women, and two-thirds of the Australians who will be dragged into the debt pool with the proposed new repayment threshold will be women. This bill should be rejected on that premise alone.


Labor believes that the time for an inquiry into Australia's post-secondary education system has come. We must have a scheme that is fit for purpose, that intersects with our tax and social security systems and that treats all students equitably. We must have a system that suits the needs of a changing post-secondary education system; that suits the needs of lifetime learners.


While Labor is not opposed to sending a price signal through a loan cap, this bill would have unintended consequences. Under the current FEE-HELP scheme there are a range of courses which have fees in excess of $100,000. Labor fully supports a system that allows Australians to defer fees for postgraduate and further study. These days many students will choose both vocational and higher education qualifications. The proposal for a one-off borrowing limit is clearly inadequate for lifelong learning needs. Labor is concerned about reckless fee setting, and a price signal needs to be accompanied by further reforms. We must not have a system that forces students to take out commercial loans to pay for the gap between fees set by universities and the loan borrowing amount. This bill does nothing to discourage reckless high-fee setting. Student debt is a major concern for students, for their families and for all of Australia. The contribution Australian students make to the cost of their university education is already the sixth-highest in the OECD, and two-thirds of Australian students in 2012 were found to live below the Henderson poverty line, with one in five regularly skipping meals.


This government often talks about choice, but choice is a privilege. We need to make pathways to higher education easier, not harder. Labor is determined to end the war on young people in this country that's being waged by this government. We must not put barriers in their way, and the barriers to higher education are ones we have started to break down. This government continues to cut services and to try to charge students more. It is not the way to equity and it is not the way to excellence. Students at the Ourimbah campus of the University of Newcastle cannot afford cuts to education. They cannot afford to pay more.


As I said at the outset, I oppose this bill as an attack on students and an attack on the fairness of our world-class student loan system. Labor will not support any legislation that puts education out of the reach of the most vulnerable people in our community, people who are starting out in life, people who are starting over in life and people who have never had a start in life.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms CLAYDON

 (
Newcastle
) (
17:34
):  I rise to join with my Labor colleagues on this side of the House in our complete opposition to this bill. We have a series of grave concerns with the Turnbull government's Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. Firstly, it's an unfair bill that actively undermines Australia's world-class education system. It would penalise women and disadvantaged and vulnerable Australians, and hurt regional communities and economies like mine in Newcastle. It's yet another example of this government's relentless war on young Australians. It's telling that only two government members were willing to stand up today and back this bill. When government members can't even bring themselves to support their own legislation, you know something is wrong.


The bill proposes a number of changes to the Australian income contingent student loan scheme, HELP, formerly known as HECS. It sets a new, lower threshold of just $45,000 at which students must start repaying their student debt. It also introduces a lifetime limit of $104,440 on how much students can borrow for their tuition fees. This bill represents a terrible betrayal of young Australians, as it will make it harder for them to gain higher education. It will be the final nail in the coffin for some with university aspirations. From the beginning Labor had concerns about the impacts of this legislation, particularly for low-income earners, disadvantaged students and, as I mentioned before, women. We were concerned about the impacts it would have on young people in regional areas and the communities they live in, so we sent it to a Senate inquiry for consideration. Regrettably, the inquiry did little to allay our concerns.


The first measure proposed in the bill is to lower the repayment threshold to $45,000. This is the second attempt by this government, after failing to reduce the threshold to $42,000 last time around. Labor supports HECS-HELP. There is no argument from us on that front. We believe in the principle that Australians should contribute towards the cost of their education, from which they and all of us benefit, but we agree with those many people who made submissions to the Senate inquiry that $45,000 is simply too low. As the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations pointed out in its submission to the inquiry, $45,000 is only slightly more than half the average wage; it is in fact only $9,000 more than the minimum wage, as the Australian Council of Trade Unions rightly stated.


On this income, take-home pay is $37,928 a year, a little over $700 a week, after tax and Medicare levies are subtracted. Once you cover the basic costs of living, including—let's not forget—the skyrocketing rents many of these students are paying, transport, food, insurance and ever-increasing power bills, there is precious little left. For many, every spare dollar is funnelled into scraping together a deposit for a home, which could easily top $100,000 in many parts of the country. That is in no small part due to the Turnbull government's absolutely dogged refusal to do anything about the outrageous tax concessions provided to support property investors over and above what we offer to first home buyers. Incredibly, many young people are trying to do all of this with the extra financial burden of raising a young family at the same time. You can see no clearer example of pressure on our young people.


Yet, in another stunning display of just how out of touch it is with Australians on low incomes, the Turnbull government has decided it is completely fair and reasonable to start taking even more money from these people—utterly unbelievable!


It's no wonder that young Australians are furious with the Turnbull government. They have, of course, every right to be, especially given that a large number of government members went through university at a time of free education, bought their houses with the help of government subsidies and now get to rake in the tax benefits of negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions at the federal budget's expense. 


Labor doesn't believe that we should make students start repaying their debt at the same time when they're trying to start their careers and start families and when they're earning, often, the very lowest rates in their respective professions. Labor also has grave concerns about the impacts of reducing the HELP repayment thresholds on disadvantaged Australians and discouraging them from ever undertaking higher education in the first place. This is particularly relevant for many communities in and around the Newcastle and Hunter region, because those areas are characterised by very significant disadvantage and, indeed, lower levels of education attainment. I'm extremely proud of the equity record of my local university, the University of Newcastle, where 27 per cent of students come from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Many are the first in their family to go to university. But these are exactly the kinds of people who are going to be hurt by this bill, as they are more likely to decide against higher education rather than put themselves in a precarious financial situation. 


In a submission to the Senate inquiry on this bill, the University of Newcastle raised concerns that these cohorts are much more likely to be sensitive to price—I couldn't agree more—and that they are disproportionately likely to decide against taking on higher education if the repayment threshold were lowered. The submission also made the important point that, for some students, repayments could kick in before they even have completed their studies. This would only serve to further intensify the financial pressures potentially affecting completion rates and graduate outcomes. This will be a great shame for our universities and a huge loss for our region. When you add these measures to the estimated $69 million that the government is ripping out of the University of Newcastle through the MYEFO cuts, there's going to be a lot of pain ahead for our community. 


I'm also very concerned about the disproportionate impacts this lowering of the HECS repayment threshold will have on women. As the President of the National Union of Students, Mr Mark Pace, stated:


We know from the National Tertiary Education Union's submission to this Senate inquiry that 60 per cent of all Australians with outstanding HELP debt are women and that two-thirds of the Australians who will be dragged into the debt pool with the new proposed repayment thresholds will also be women …


I agree with Mr Pace that this is yet another reason for rejecting this bill. 


I'd now like to turn to the proposed cap in the bill which would put a lifetime limit of $104,440 on the value of higher education that can be supported through the loan system. For students doing medicine, dentistry and veterinary science, that cap would be $150,000. The new HELP limit would apply to HECS-HELP loans, FEE-HELP loans, VET FEE-HELP loans and VET student loans. Again, this is a measure Labor cannot support. As many people giving evidence to the Senate inquiry pointed out, many prospective students will find that there simply isn't the scope to take on further studies or to expand their expertise into new areas. Others pointed out that the cap is likely to hurt people who haven't taken a traditional pathway to study and many have taken extra courses to achieve their academic goals. The proposal for a lifetime cap also stands in stark contrast to the unavoidable reality that education is becoming a lifelong process, something that you don't bid farewell to in your early 20s. In fact, continuous upskilling will be increasingly important for people who want to remain competitive in a highly dynamic jobs market. Again, this proposed measure will have a disproportionate impact on regional communities like mine. As the University of Newcastle points out in its submission, this limit will hurt our region's economic transformation by preventing some people from engaging in critical retraining and reskilling, especially in the high-cost fields like STEM and health, which may require specialist postgraduate qualifications.


This bill provides yet more evidence that the only ideas this government has shown for higher education are to levy cuts and to force students to pay more. Just look at its destructive plan for university deregulation, which would have led to $100,000 degrees and lifelong debt sentences for students. Or perhaps we could consider the bill that preceded this one, which included $2.8 billion worth of cuts. Of course, the Senate refused to pass this. But, in a shameless display of its true 'born to rule' character, the government completely disregarded the will of the parliament and snuck $2.2 billion worth of cuts through the back door in the midyear budget update.


In contrast, Labor has a fantastic legacy of which I am very proud. When we were last in government, we increased funding for universities from $8 billion to $14 billion each year and introduced a demand driven funding system. This saw an additional 190,000 students get a place at university, many of whom were the very first in their family to ever set foot on a university campus. Investing in education is one of the best means we have to drive productivity and economic growth, especially by encouraging people from disadvantaged backgrounds to go to university, and we know that these reforms work.


As Universities Australia presented in its submission to the inquiry on this bill, there was a 106.5 per cent boost to people with disability undertaking undergraduate study. In the same time frame, there were 89.3 per cent more Indigenous students, 55 per cent more low socioeconomic status students and 48.3 per cent more regional and remote students. It is unquestionably a positive thing, not just for the individuals that improve their education levels and their life opportunities but for the entire country, because investment in education has flow-on effects for the whole society. This is backed up by recent figures from the OECD, which showed the Australian public, not individuals, benefit most from higher education. In fact, this OECD work shows that the public rate of return from tertiary education in Australia is twice the rate of return to the individual, despite the fact that individuals shoulder more of the cost.


The Turnbull government wants you to believe that the current HECS arrangements aren't sustainable. They want you to think that we need to rein in the amount of education that people can undertake and make them start repaying their student loans sooner. I'll tell you what's not sustainable: giving people who earn over $180,000 a year a tax cut while you're hiking up taxes for people on $30,000—that's not sustainable. Refusing to act on the billions of dollars of cash handouts that are going to Australian shareholders who don't pay any tax—that is not sustainable. And doing absolutely nothing to rein in excessive tax concessions for property investors—that is not sustainable. But I'll tell you what's really not sustainable: hiking the national debt to more than half a trillion dollars and then hatching a diabolical plan to shovel a further $65 billion out the door in corporate tax cuts, because that's what this bill is really all about. It's not about a crisis in the HECS or HELP scheme; it's about a government desperate to pay up on its promise to big business. This is a shameful bill before this parliament. I stand strong and proud with Labor in our opposition.

"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",CA,2018-03-26,"



Ms SHARKIE
 (Mayo) (17:49):  As I rise to speak on this bill, I must begin by reiterating my support for Australia's higher education sector. For the sector to thrive, it must be sustainable. There is a delicate balance to be struck and I believe that the government's previous reform package, which failed to pass the Senate, did not get the balance right. I believe this bill comes a lot closer, although there are amendments that NXT will be seeking before we give our wholehearted support. 


This bill presents two major changes to the current system: firstly, a reduction in the HELP repayment threshold to $45,000, and, secondly, a cap on the loan amount a student can access in their lifetime. The idea of a cap on the amount of money a student can borrow from the Commonwealth is one I agree with in principle. In fact, I first raised this idea with Minister Birmingham last year. I believe that Australia's Higher Education Loan Program is world leading and something this country can be proud of. It allows students from all backgrounds to access university education without having the burden of up-front cost that students in many other countries face. 


However, as with any Commonwealth loan, it should not be a free-for-all. A university education gives a proven benefit to Australian society, but it is not in the nation's interests for the HELP scheme to be open slather with mounting debts, some of which will never be repaid. A cap sends an important message to students that the government will not support elongated study where it results in excessive loan amounts that are unlikely to be repaid. A student should understand that. Just like any other loan or debt, student loans must be repaid. Being a professional student, collecting endless degrees and not moving into a job really isn't viable for our nation. 


However, a lifetime cap is also not the answer. Increasingly, it's becoming clear that lifelong learning will become a regular feature of the Australian way of life. This government has, indeed, foreshadowed this. I again make reference to the Prime Minister's first statement as the leader of our country, where he stressed that he wanted Australia to be innovative and agile. Clearly, the ability to learn new things and to upskill is a fundamental part of being an innovative nation. For that reason, I struggle to understand why the government has proposed a lifetime cap on student learning. 


We should not be asking Australian students to be put in a position where they can graduate, work and pay off their HELP loans and yet be prevented from accessing Commonwealth support for future study. We know that today's graduates are likely to change jobs 17 times in their lifetime, and will most likely change career sectors completely. So, for this reason, I'm calling on the government to amend this bill to ensure that we can place a cap on student outstanding debt but that we can also ensure that if a person does pay off that debt, if they get below their cap, they can continue to study in another area at another time in their life. I note that this recommendation was put forward by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and Employment and, indeed, government members of the committee supported that the cap would be replenishable. I understand the government will be moving amendments to change this aspect of the bill, and I look forward to those amendments being moved. 


This bill also seeks to reduce the payment threshold for HELP loans to $45,000. I spoke on this issue during the debate of last year's higher education reform package, where I and my NXT colleagues rejected a proposal to lower the threshold to $42,000. I said then that I was willing to consider alternative thresholds, and that is the position that I maintain and NXT maintains. Australia's HELP system is one of the most generous in the world, significantly more so than the New Zealand system, which has a repayment threshold of $18,000, and the UK system, which has a repayment threshold of approximately A$36,000. I recognise that there is a growing amount of outstanding student debt, and the government does not expect this to be repaid. For this reason, NXT is willing to consider the proposed change to the thresholds if the government can commit to changing the lifetime cap to being a replenishable cap. I believe that a significant benefit of this measure over the government's previous proposal is ensuring that the repayment rate does not lift above one per cent until a graduate is earning over $51,000 per year. We believe this is a reasonable balance. 


I take this opportunity again to reiterate my previous calls for a comprehensive review into the post-secondary education sector. I called for such a review last October, and I am pleased to see that this has become part of the policy for the Australian Labor Party. This review must involve the federal and state governments. It must involve universities and the vocational education sector, including, of course, apprenticeships. We need to examine how we prepare the next generation for the world of work and ensure the pillars are in place for young people to successfully transition to sustainable employment.


Australia's higher education sector is one of the best in the world, but it needs to be supported. The government's recent cuts to universities during MYEFO were a cruel blow to the sector, and it is a sector that has faced so many cuts in recent years from both sides of the House. I believe this bill should be amended and that it will contribute to a stronger higher education sector. So for this reason I support the bill in this House, pending those amendments by government, as I referred to. Thank you.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (17:55):  I, too, would like to speak on the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018. From the outset, I make it clear that Labor will be opposing this bill, and I also note the cacophony of voices opposite—all those rallying to support this piece of legislation! I just looked at the speaking list, and I noticed that of all those opposite they have only two members willing to come along and speak in support of the legislation.


This is an unfair piece of legislation and one that attacks students. It undermines the fairness and accessibility of Australia's higher education system. The bill is another example of the government's relentless attack on our universities, which are, no doubt, integral to the future of our nation. The bill also gives effect to a policy measure announced in the government's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This is very, very short sighted. It is a package of $2.2 billion of cuts for universities—measures that represent the government's fourth attempt since coming into office to cut universities and make students pay more. Nevertheless, we heard the Turnbull government—and the Minister for Education and Training, in particular—boasting that these cuts will put our higher education system on a more sustainable and responsible path for the future. 


This is the same style of rhetoric that we heard when the government tried to introduce their original package of cuts in the 2017 budget. That was $3.8 billion of cuts to universities and an increase in student fees. Those measures were not passed by the Senate and they were not passed for a very, very good reason: they were bad policy. It seems nothing has changed. These were the biggest cuts to the sector proposed since the Howard government's horror 1996 budget. These cuts were accompanied by a number of poorly designed policies and thought bubbles, and that continues today. None of the ideas that the government have proposed were really about reform that would produce or promote enhancement of the sector, and the same can be said about those legislative measures proposed by the bill we are debating today.


Real reform actually requires vision for the future, rather than a government solely driven to cut and diminish the significant role that universities play and, to that extent, that students who attend universities play in our future. This is solely about cost-cutting, and there's no doubt there's a reason that underpins that. Of course, you can't expect those opposite to change their spots and to take a different view of higher education. After all, they are the same bunch that came into this place intent on taking $17 billion from our schools, $637 million from our TAFE colleges and now $2.2 billion from our universities. The targets of the cuts are our higher education institutions—institutions which are, I submit, absolutely vital for our nation's future. But the justifications of these cuts and whether they're issues about pension or a whole raft of other things all fall back to that signature policy of this government: handing out $65 billion of tax cuts to millionaires and big business—effectively, the tax cuts to the top end of town. That justifies what these measures are all about.


Far be it from me to give the government advice, but I will chance my hand on this occasion. If you can't afford it, simply don't do it, but never, ever do it at the expense of future generations. That's precisely what is occurring here today. The unfairness of these cuts is plain and clear. This is a government that keeps proving that it can't be trusted when it comes to the most important investment in our nation's history. An investment in education is an investment in our future. It's an investment in the nation's future. Arguably, it's probably the most important investment decision governments can make, because a lot turns on this. While the measures in this bill are significantly narrower than the scope of the bill in 2017, the point I want to make is that it has the same underlying objectives.


For the purpose of discussion, I'll be focusing my time on talking about the proposed changes in the HELP scheme as opposed to some of the other, technical amendments that are also incorporated in this bill. The income-contingent loan has been a keystone or foundation of the architecture of Australia's fair and accessible higher education system. We on this side of the House understand the role that income-contingent HELP loans play. After all, it was a Labor government that introduced the concept in HECS in 1989. Universities Australia, I think, actually highlighted the integral role played by the HELP scheme when they noted that the scheme underwrote the growth of mass higher education in Australia, and it continues to support the expansion of opportunity. I think that's pretty right.


In conjunction with Labor's demand-driven funding, the HELP scheme has seen historic growth in higher education participation over decades. The transformation of higher education in this country has very much been a key aspect that's flowed from this scheme. As Margaret Gardner, Chair of Universities Australia, demonstrates, there's been a significant boost in the participation of underrepresented and disadvantaged students.


To put that in some perspective, I'd like to share with the House some statistics released by Universities Australia. Universities in Australia now educate 55 per cent more Australians from the poorest one-fifth of households, 48 per cent more students from regional and remote communities, 89 per cent more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and 105 per cent more students with a disability. I think they're outcomes that we should all be particularly proud of. Obviously those opposite have probably hung their heads in shame about this, because they're not participating in this debate—or only two of those opposite are. But this is something where we've shown we can actually transform higher education in this country and make it more accessible. As I say, that's something the House should be proud of, not condemning.


Labor opposes the government's move to lower the HELP repayment threshold to $42,000, because we recognise that it is unfair. As a matter of fact, we actually think the current proposal of a threshold of $45,000 is also unfair. As the Australian Council of Trade Unions indicated, the proposed threshold of $45,000 is only $9,000 more than the minimum wage today.


Illustrating the ramifications of the proposed payment threshold on individual earnings of $45,000 per annum, the ACTU observed that this would leave an individual with a take-home pay of $37,928 once income tax and the Medicare levy is deducted. We believe that the current repayment threshold strikes the appropriate balance. We cannot expect students to repay more than their current debts at the same time as starting a career, setting up and saving for a house—particularly in Sydney and Melbourne and probably Brisbane—and, in many instances, starting a family. 


We know that higher education debt is a genuine barrier to low socioeconomic and disadvantaged students. Equity practitioners in higher education encapsulate the heart of this problem, saying that this measure would disproportionately affect people of low socioeconomic backgrounds, people with disabilities, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. This measure will no doubt have an impact on the community I happen to represent. It's a community I'm certainly very proud of. It's very colourful; it's very vibrant—much like the community of my colleague the member for Werriwa. But our communities are not rich communities. 


The average household income in my community is just a tad over $60,000. We're not a rich community. As a matter of fact, my community's made up heavily of migrants and current refugees. So changing the income rate for all HELP thresholds from average weekly earnings to CPI is also a measure that will be hard-felt by many individuals in low socioeconomic backgrounds, certainly in communities like mine and, no doubt, those communities in regional Australia purportedly being represented by some of those opposite. 


As the Southern Cross Postgraduate Association has noted, it will place an additional hardship on low socioeconomic HELP debtholders at a time that combines with a stagnant wage growth and a rising cost of living. The proposed lifetime borrowing limit also has an impact of eroding the underlying objectives of universal access enshrined in the HELP scheme and the importance of lifelong learning, including the ability of workers to upskill. This will prove critical, given the considerable uncertainty of a future workforce in this country. We are all looking to the future and what that might hold, what the future industries might be, and workers will be undergoing upskilling and training. But this will be putting university education beyond the grasp of many in that situation. 


At a time when we have significant economic transition we should be investing in our people, not making it harder for them to get a university qualification. Australian students already make the sixth-highest contribution to their university fees in the OECD. As Catriona Jackson, the deputy chief of Universities Australia, has emphasised, when contemplating change to the magnitude of this, there should be a first principle in the legislator's mind: do no harm. This government, quite frankly, has done the exact opposite when it comes to education and, in this case, higher education. 


The changes to the HELP scheme are simply budget driven, and it's all about supporting the government's $65 billion tax cut to the big end of town. These measures are not fair, they're not good for universities and they're not good for students. On that basis, they cannot be good for the future prosperity of this nation. In the words of Margaret Gardner, I call on the government not to slam the door of opportunity shut, once more, to Australia's bright minds. Our nation cannot afford it, societally or economically. We must restore our nation's investment in Australian students and, in doing so, our investment in Australia's future.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:09):  What is it with conservative governments and access to opportunity and education for all—no matter what your postcode, no matter your gender, how much your parents earn, your race and your religion is? It took the Whitlam government to open the doors of opportunity for tertiary education. Prior to that, my mother and my father were bright, young Australians—bright, young Victorians. My mother grew up in a Housing Commission house in Preston in Victoria, just down the road from an abattoir. My father was sent off to do a trade, to become an electrician at the ripe old age of 15 because his parents couldn't afford for him to go to university. My mother was dragged kicking and screaming from high school—she also had to leave school at 15. She would have loved to have matriculated, as she calls it, but she was denied that opportunity, thanks to the conservative government that was running this nation for so long and that denied that opportunity for young Australians from working class backgrounds and from disadvantaged backgrounds.


It is the tradition that conservatives deny opportunity to those who are less well-off, to those who are doing it tough. My mother and my father are testimony to that. It wasn't until the Whitlam government and the opportunities that he opened through tertiary education—through free education for so many Australians—that I and my sisters, so many other Canberrans and so many other Australians were the first in their families to be educated.


What did that mean? For me it meant an awful lot. My father left me, my sisters and my mum with $30 in the bank in the seventies, when I was 11. There was no child support agency then, so things were pretty rough. I've spoken about this many times in this chamber, about the fact that we used to eat out every second or third night at family or friends' houses because mum couldn't afford to put food on the table every night of the week. On the nights of the week that we actually did eat at home mum invariably didn't eat, because she was on a seventies diet. The reality was that she couldn't afford to feed herself and her three daughters.


So I come from what I call a working class matriarchy. My great-grandmother was a cleaner in the Western District in Victoria. She left school at 11, denied choice and denied opportunity. She brought up 13 children on her own. She was denied choice and opportunity because she left school at 11. My grandmother left school at 13, and was also a cleaner. She worked three cleaning jobs in hospitals and theatres in Victoria. She brought up seven kids on her own in a Housing Commission house in Preston. Her abiding fear was that the state was going to take her children away. The reason she had that fear was not that she was a bad mother—she most certainly wasn't; she worked three jobs to put food on the table—but that she was poor.


When my dad left my mother and my sisters we were facing the same sort of cycle of disadvantage that had dogged three generations of the working class matriarchy of my family. But, thanks to the power of education—thanks to the transformative power of education—I broke that cycle, my middle sister broke that cycle and my little sister broke that cycle. Here I am, thanks to the transformative power of education, because it is a game changer. It is a silver bullet. I broke that cycle of disadvantage—three generations of disadvantage—and now I have the great honour of representing my community here in parliament. Thanks to the opportunity of education, my middle sister is now Australia's first female Master of Wine, and a scientist and a winemaker in her own right. My little sister is a neurologist, a world expert in dementia and stroke.


What was the game changer? What was the reason for this whole cycle of cleaning and cleaning, denial of opportunity and choice, poverty and disadvantage? The timidity with which you lead your life, where you don't think particular parts of the world are the right place for you, was because of lack of education. As a result of access to education, my sisters and I have been able to live bold lives determined by the choices and opportunities we sought. Education is the silver bullet, the game changer, and the opportunities, choices and game-changing abilities it provides are constantly denied by those opposite, through barriers such as this legislation, to all students, particularly disadvantaged Australians of low socioeconomic backgrounds and people in regional and remote Australia.


The government, as my colleagues have said, is proposing a new minimum repayment income of $45,000 for compulsory repayment of the Higher Education Loan Program, HELP. This change is absolutely outrageous. We've heard from the member for Fowler—I commend him on that speech—that Australia has the sixth-highest rate of student debt in the OECD, yet the government is making it even more onerous for students through these changes. This government is busy giving out $65 billion of tax cuts to the top end of town, yet is continuing to target students in universities right throughout the country. We're not just talking about the University of Sydney, the University of Canberra or the University of Melbourne. Shame on those opposite who represent regional and remote communities for talking in support of this bill! You are denying the young in your communities the opportunity to have a big life.


This government has already cut $28 million over the next three years from the Australian National University in my electorate. Last year the government introduced a plan to make students repay their HELP debts on incomes as low as $42,000; they're currently looking at making it $45,000. Labor opposed that change then and opposes this change now. University graduates face a housing affordability nightmare, a spike in the price of utilities, a second-rate NBN, cuts to penalty rates—the list goes on. Now the government wants students to start paying back their fees at an unreasonably low income. It is unfair: $44,999 sole income is not a lot of money. It's $865 per week. The average rental price for a house in my electorate of Canberra is $540 per week. Factor this in, and university graduates are left with just $325 each week to pay for utilities, transport, mobile phone bills and groceries. This amendment would add student fees to that already long list of expenses. And, if a sole income earner had any dependants, it would force them close to the poverty line. Can you imagine trying to pay back the debt and deal with those utility costs, particularly rent here? The average rent here in the electorate of Canberra is $540. If you've got dependants, it's mighty tough. The government is asking people to pay back their student loans before they even consider what they'll be able to feed their family.


Students in my electorate are already struggling with the prospect of paying back these debts. This amendment will change the future of students who have planned their life after university. Students will feel forced to take a job they may not have studied for because the salary's bigger, just so they can pay back that loan sooner than expected. I've heard of students who, as I said, are doing it tough—rent, utilities, and just trying to get food on the table. We all know that textbooks are expensive. They're always a huge hit for parents doing it tough at secondary schools and they're a huge hit for students doing it tough at the tertiary level, because we are looking at hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars for textbooks.


I've heard about the concerns amongst Canberra's students about this proposal. They are very, very concerned about it. Some of them are wondering whether they'll continue to study. We've got a student who says she feels betrayed by the government, particularly if this amendment's passed. She labels it 'a new level of pressure'. These students are already under significant pressure and here they are faced with a new level of pressure by this conservative government—another cut in education. It's just constant.


The 2014 budget was probably the piece de resistance when it came to the tone, values and principles of this conservative government opposite. The government haven't learned from the 2014 budget. Nothing has been learned from the 2014 budget. It's just constant attacks particularly on those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, particularly on those doing it tough, particularly on those from regional and remote Australia, and particularly on the disadvantaged.


Not only is education about opportunity but it's about fairness. The same opportunity should be offered to every Australian, no matter where they live or what their income. I've spoken about my story and how it unleashed so much opportunity and choice for me and my sisters. I am blessed to have participated in a quality public education and am blessed to have participated in free education as a result of a Whitlam government—a government that realised the opportunities for all Australians in innovation, in creating a modern society, in creating an inquisitive society, in creating a curious society. It was a government that realised the wonder that is offered up as a result of education.


Then we've got conservative governments. We started with Menzies and then Fraser, and now we've got this Abbott-Turnbull government, a government that has never, ever had one plan for education. It's had multiple plans, and they were all about cuts—at the secondary level, at the tertiary level, at the vocational level. Since this government took office, $17 billion has been cut from our schools, nearly $3 billion has been cut from vocational education, and Australia has lost 140,000 apprenticeships and traineeships. My electorate of Canberra has seen a 30 per cent decline in apprentice and trainee graduates since this government's been in power. And, with universities, we've seen cuts after cuts—$2.2 billion worth of cuts nationally; $28 million worth of cuts from here in Canberra under this government. It was Labor that opened the door of universities to 190,000 more Australians, many of whom were the first in their family to be educated. This government just slams it shut in their faces.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (18:25):  Labor does not support this bill and nor do I. I believe that a university education should not be denied to anybody. My parents would dearly have loved to go to university, but they came from families where it was financially not possible. My parents went without so that my siblings and I could have a good, quality education, and that included a university education. I am privileged and honoured to be here representing my electorate in this parliament, and that is as a result of my hard work and the university education that I had. I have two brothers, one who is principal of a boys college and one who is executive principal of a large secondary college, and I have a sister who is a family law barrister, all because our parents worked hard to ensure that we had the opportunity they were denied—that is, a university education.


This then begs the question: what is wrong with the entitled members sitting opposite me on the government benches, given that a large number of these Turnbull government members have happily risen to the top of their careers and entered this parliament on the back of Labor policy? Many government ministers and backbenchers have benefited from Labor's free higher education, yet when they come to power in government they simply slam the door shut in the faces of others.


There are a number of Turnbull government ministers who attended university between 1974 and 1988, when students did not pay fees. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and other frontbench figures, such as our former Attorney-General, George Brandis, and the Minister for Defence, Marise Payne, are among those who attended university when education was free. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott received a free university education. Foreign Minister Bishop, the former Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, Treasurer Scott Morrison, and the Minister for Defence Industry, Christopher Pyne, attended university for one year when education was free. The Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, the former Minister for Social Services, Christian Porter, and the Minister for Jobs and Innovation, Michaelia Cash, also attended university for at least one year when their education was free. In total, seven Turnbull government ministers were at university when students were not charged fees, while the other eight would have had at least one year of free university education. It is an absolute disgrace and a blatant demonstration of double standards that these Turnbull government elected representatives have benefited from a Labor policy—that is, a free university education—but they in turn feel justified in making it harder for anyone else wanting to attend university.


Labor has always been a party of high aspirations for all of our citizens. Labor has always said that it should never be your financial status that decides whether or not you can attend university. Whether you are a young kid from Kelso or from inner Sydney, Labor does not discriminate based on your postcode. No matter who you are, Labor believes that you have the human right to access education in order to better yourself and increase your contribution to society.


Labor is very aware of the strong links between education, quality employment and prospering economies. The skills of the future will be taught in our universities, and particularly in regional universities. Yet this government is hell-bent on punishing students from disadvantaged backgrounds by denying them the opportunity to attend university and to build a competitive Australia, because they most likely will not be able to afford to attend university. That is why Labor opposes this bill, and that is why I once again say I am proud to stand with Labor and fight these unfair cuts. The Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 is an unfair piece of legislation that attacks students and undermines the fairness of our world-class student loan system. The MYEFO package of $2.2 billion cuts is the government's fourth attempt since coming to office to cut university funding and make students pay more.


In all of Australia there is only one degree that is internationally ranked, and I am proud to say that it is at James Cook University, in my electorate of Herbert. ANU, University of Queensland, Monash—none of them can lay claim to having an internationally ranked No. 1 degree, but James Cook University in Townsville, North Queensland, can. Yet this university will be severely punished by this unfair cut. James Cook University holds the prestigious honour of being awarded the No. 1 status for a marine science degree, yet this government is cutting $36 million to James Cook University. James Cook University is a genuine regional university that was built by the blood, sweat and tears of local business people because our community dared to dream that our young people, whose families could not afford to send them south to study, could study at home.


Then there is my university, Central Queensland University, where the Turnbull government is cutting $38 million. These are universities that are embedded in regional Queensland communities. These are universities that strive for excellence to deliver across vast distances and provide quality education for all regional, rural and remote Queenslanders. Clearly the Turnbull government is totally unaware and out of touch with regional Australia and, in particular, Queensland. This government does not understand that the participation rate in universities in regional communities is almost half of what it is in metropolitan universities. Linking funding to population growth is absolutely unfair and demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the regional challenges.


In the last couple of weeks, I attended graduation ceremonies of both JCU and CQU, with both delivering outstanding results. It was really exciting at both ceremonies to witness young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students receiving their degree awards. It was great to see international students coming to our great city to study at these quality universities. This is particularly the case at JCU in the marine science area.


It is unfair and it's a complete rip-off to students. At last year's budget, the Turnbull government tried to make students start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000. Now the government is proposing a new rate of $45,000. It's still far too low. Why is this government changing the threshold when new graduates are really struggling? New graduates need time to get their feet on the ground, to establish themselves in their chosen career and not be forced into a state of anxiety as to whether they can afford to immediately start to pay their HELP debt, pay rent and survive. It is not fair that new graduates will have to choose between paying their HELP debt or saving to buy a house. It is also not fair to make graduates choose between starting a family or paying their HELP debt. There are a large number of graduates who are barely surviving whilst trying to make ends meet on a wage of $45,000 a year. In my community, rental prices are high, cost of living is expensive and energy prices are through the roof under this government, so students and graduates are already doing it tough. This government's decision to lower the income threshold to $45,000 for graduates to start to pay their HECS debt is just another burden for them to carry. It is unfair and it does not reflect a fair go for all. In fact, it is quite the opposite.


In my last meeting with James Cook University Vice Chancellor Sandra Harding, we discussed how we want more people enrolled in higher education across North Queensland because higher education leads to greater employment choices and opportunities. Across North Queensland, we have some of the highest rates of unemployment in the country, and that is particularly the case for youth unemployment. A university education is the beacon of hope for employment. A university education is the vehicle that will deliver the industries and jobs of the future. University education builds a community's capacity to grow its economy. But the Turnbull government is hell-bent on strangling North Queenslanders' hopes for future employment based on a quality university education. These added burdens on students and graduates will not entice people to enrol at university. Placing additional barriers and making it harder for students to pay back their debts will simply deter students from enrolling at university, and that is the very last thing we need in regional Queensland. In regional Queensland we need to create an environment that increases participation and does not make it harder.


Experts have warned Australia that if we do not boost participation in post-secondary education we risk being left behind by the rest of the world. But this back-to-the-future government probably wants that. This is 1920s style thinking from the government. If you want a country to get back on track, then you must invest in its people. In a time of significant economic transition, we should be investing in our people, not making it harder for them to get a university qualification.


Labor has always been a party for the people. Labor is the party for the many and not just the few people who have healthy credit cards and a strong social status. Labor does put people first. But it's pretty clear that the Turnbull government have only ever had one plan for higher education, and that plan is to cut funding and make students pay more. Of course, that always affects those disadvantaged in our community. It is critically important in regional Queensland, and particularly in my electorate of Herbert, that our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people have the opportunity, once they finish high school, to access a university education. Financial status is not an indicator of capability, but it is an indicator of ability to participate. Australian students already make the sixth-highest contribution to their university fees in the OECD. But the Liberals can't help themselves. They have consistently tried to make students pay more. Why? That is the question. It would appear, at the moment, it's all about paying for their $65 billion tax cut for wealthy corporations. We've seen it in schools, with a $17 billion cut. We've seen it in the vocational education and training sector, with nearly $3 billion cut and more than 140,000 apprenticeships and traineeships lost since the Liberals came to office. In my electorate alone, that is 1,591 apprenticeships. Again, we see it in universities with a $2.2 billion cut. 


Labor delivers real reform to higher education in this country. When Labor was last in government, it lifted investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013. Labor opened the door of universities to 190,000 more Australians, many of whom were the first in their family to go to university. Coming from that situation myself, I completely understand what a privilege it is to have the opportunity to attend university when you know how desperately your parents would have loved to have had that opportunity. The Liberals, through their latest round of cuts, are slamming that door firmly shut for many people in our community. The Turnbull government will never be a government for the people. They are a government for the top end of town. 


Investment in people starts with education. However, this government have completely missed this fact, as they are completely out of touch with people. I don't think we can emphasise enough how absolutely important it is that we invest in the people of this country, that we invest in our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people, and that we also invest in the people who are leaving the defence forces, people who need to reskill or get skills to transition into new employment. University is the ticket out of poverty and disadvantage. I urge this government not to make these severe cuts to university funding.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2018-03-26,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (18:38):  Tonight, in my comments regarding the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 I particularly want to focus on its impact on rural and regional Australia. Today, in this place, I introduced a private member's bill which spoke of the importance of positive discrimination in favour of, just as my colleague has just expressed, rural and regional Australia, and that one size does not fit all. So I want to take my opportunity tonight to further that argument. I want to take the opportunity to ask the government to seriously consider a regional strategy that actually takes holistic thinking and looks at the national good and at how we, as a nation, can educate ourselves, have the workforce that we need and have the economic growth that we need, as a direct result of good education.


I just can't enforce enough in tonight's debate, as I know many of my colleagues have, the fundamental importance of education—tonight we are talking about post-school higher education—as one of the pillars of a developed nation. What I'm so sad to see in the discussion we've had from the government is the lack of a vision, the lack of a strategic approach, in how education is going to come together to be the driving force that we need. In the five years that I've been in this parliament, higher education and the government approach to it has been one of the significant disappointments with the lack of vision, the lack of a way forward and often the lack of partnership in our ability to actually move forward.


I wanted to talk a little bit tonight about my electorate of Indi, why this topic is just so important and why I think that the changes are going to have a negative impact on my community. I quote from Higher education information navigation: an exploration of parent information needs in the Hume region, presented by Regional Development Australia and RDV. It says on page 6:


It is of concern, therefore, that the Hume Region has some of the lowest educational outcomes in Victoria. For example, the region shows lower retention rates for Years 7-12 than the average for non-metropolitan regions. The region also has an estimated 22% of young people leaving school through years 10-12, in comparison to metropolitan Melbourne where only 15% of this cohort leaves school.


The percentage of people aged between 25-34 years in the Hume Region in 2006 with a Bachelor degree or higher was 17.35%—


Let me read that again:


The percentage of people aged between 25-34 years in the Hume Region in 2006 with a Bachelor degree or higher was 17.35% compared to the Victorian rate of 30.4%. Hence, the region has just over half the Victorian average of people aged under 34 years with a university degree.


They're shocking statistics, and I live in a really well connected part of Australia. We are getting better internet. We've got trains that sometimes work. We've got roads that work. Yet we've got those appalling statistics for young people accessing tertiary education.


So what happens? The young people leave. It's our biggest export. The consequences for a nation that doesn't pay attention to this are really serious. Obviously you have bigger cities, but not having a young, educated, well-trained cohort and not having universities in our regional centres to drive economic growth are just the most short-sighted policies we could possibly have.


So I'm beseeching the advisers tonight. I'm beseeching the minister to actually seriously do something about this, to do something about a region. If you can't solve the problems for the nation—and I get that it's complicated—surely for regional Australia we can begin work on a strategy and we can actually do something for the regions where I live and where those appalling statistics are in existence. Not wanting to be totally negative, my office has been working with the Parliamentary Budget Office to come up with solutions for how there might be some positive things we could do to make it easier and better for the regions. I've sent them across to the minister's office with some of the costings the Parliamentary Budget Office did around changing the HELP repayment-free period and amended it for rural regions. I've got all the details but, in summary, they came back with an expected fiscal balance impact of minus $9.7 million over the 2017-18 budget forward estimate if we just changed the payment-free period. This is such a small impact compared with the government's expected saving of over $3.8 billion.


So I say to the colleagues in the House: at what cost do we keep going with this track of making higher education harder and harder to get and we as a nation not accepting the responsibility I believe we have not only to give people equity but to actually provide education, which provides the driving force for our regions and will enable the whole of regional Australia to take its place in the nation in the years ahead? By this legislation, by not paying attention to the impact on the regions, we're really working against the ability of our regions to do that.


I say to my colleagues here tonight: you can make some great friends listening to what I've got to say, because it's not just me who thinks this. Clearly I'm on the back bench. I'm an independent member of parliament, but the Rural Universities Network put out a press release that says:


The Regional Universities Network (RUN) strongly endorses Cathy McGowan MP's motion on regional universities before the House of Representatives, and the need for a National Regional Higher Education Strategy.


That's the RUN universities. La Trobe University's John Dewar supports strong local campuses because we need them for regional development.


The thing I really want to bring to the House tonight is a letter from what I thought was a most surprising ally—and please forgive me for making that assumption—the Group of Eight. I have a letter today from the Group of Eight and I'd like to read it into Hansard as part of my speech. It is signed by the Vicki Thomson, Chief Executive of the Group of Eight, which represents the universities in our cities:


Dear Ms McGowan,


As Chief Executive of Australia's leading research universities, the Group of Eight (Go8), I'm writing to you to offer my support for your Private Member's Bill, the National Regional Higher Education Strategy.


There often appears to be the view that the Go8's teaching and research is confined to the major cities. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. The Go8 remains committed to ensuring not only equitable access for students to higher quality education, but also long-term sustainability and economic growth for the regions—


as should the government be, let me say. The letter goes on to detail the Go8's contribution to regional Australia:


More than 25,000 regional and remote students study at a Go8 university each year—


that's our great export—


One in eight rural and regional students study at a Go8 university


50 per cent of agriculture and environmental students in Australia study at a Go8 university


60 per cent of veterinary students in Australia are trained by Go8 universities.


They tell me they invest in outreach to regional communities, which of course they do, and it's important. But the point is: imagine the situation we've got today. Here I am on the back bench, independent and a strong advocate for the regions and I've got the Go8 onside, we've got the rural universities onside and I'm beseeching the government to please do something to make sure that the unintended consequences—and I say that kindly—are not going to be felt in the long term by the nation because at this particular time we fail to pay attention to the impact of this legislation before the House tonight on rural Australia. I don't know how to say it other than the consequences are going to be enormous for us. We can't say we didn't know because the debates in this House tonight were so strongly put forward by my colleague from Herbert talking about the impact on rural and regional communities.


I really want to say to the minister, to the Prime Minister, to the advisers in the House tonight, to my colleagues on the government side and to the members of the National Party, in particular: stand up for your principles and your values, and stand up for rural and regional Australia. And to members of parliament from the Liberal Party who represent our regional electorates, I say: stand up for rural and regional Australia. Just don't let this go through tonight. It's poor law. It's poor law and it will have incredibly bad consequences for us.


What is so distressing and so disappointing is this sense that one size fits everybody when clearly with university education we need to differentiate. We need to make the case that those in the regions need special treatment. Government has done it in some areas—there's a limited loading there, but it doesn't go nearly far enough to actually address the imbalance of those statistics that I put up earlier. Seventeen per cent of my young people are going on to higher education—it's an appalling figure. It's something we really should be ashamed about. Certainly, it's something that I absolutely want to see changed. Part of the reason why I became a member of parliament was to do something very specifically about accessing higher education in the regions.


I say to the minister: it's time for a vision, and, if you can't have a vision for the whole of Australia, could you please have a vision for regional Australia? Could you please really consider the call from the Go8 and the call from the RUN universities and work together on a strategy that, over a period of time, will deliver equality. Sure, equality is important, but then it will deliver us a trained workforce. We are doing all this international work to bring foreigners to the country because we can't, in the regions, get enough of our own labour force, yet we do nothing positively to make sure that our young people are trained in the jobs that we've got. We've got so many jobs that we could have people working in in the country. It just seems to me quite ludicrous that we're not addressing the labour shortage in this most obvious way by training people in the regions, which seems so sensible.


The third area, to me, is so obvious. I'm on a committee at the moment, with many government members and opposition people, looking at regional development and decentralisation. It's a very productive committee to be on. We are working together to say, 'How do we grow the regions? How do we use decentralisation as a tool of government?' Universities have to be one of the most cost-effective ways—cost-effective investment of government money—for growing our regions. So much money goes from the Commonwealth coffers into the regions. It's such a good opportunity for us; with such a small increase—or appreciation of the impact—we could have the most amazing multiplier effect. 


It's a call from the heart to the minister, to the Prime Minister, to my colleagues on the government side. Really, if you can't support us on the move here, could you please pay attention to a regional strategy and work with the parties so we can make sure that in the longer term, when we look back on this particular parliament, we can say: 'That was the year the government got the regions. The government got the role of education in supporting the regions and helping the regions be the answer that they can be to so many of the problems this nation is facing'? 


I bring my comments to a close with a real call-out to the advisers in the box tonight and to the minister: reconsider your decisions around a regional strategy for rural and regional Australia.

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (18:51):  Let me start by reiterating all the things that have been said on this side of the house, in relation to this. Labor does not support this bill. This legislation is completely unfair and attacks students and undermines the fairness of our world-class student loan system. As I have said in this place many times before, one of the things that led me here was a comment made by my Liberal predecessor, Jackie Kelly, when she famously decreed that Western Sydney did not need a university; we were pram city. The people I get to represent—people like me, back then, as a 20-year-old—didn't deserve to have a university in their electorate, because they were capable of producing babies and nothing more. 


That's the difference between us and them, really. Outraged as I was at the time, my only ability, or the only thing available to me at that time, was to write a cranky letter to the editor of my local newspaper about my disgust. I'm glad Jackie Kelly's comments weren't heeded. But now, a few years later—just a few; I was 20 then and am only a few years older than that now—I get to stand in this place and defend the thing I came here for originally. 


I'm really glad that her comments weren't heeded. Instead, we have Western Sydney University right in my backyard. It's a university whose alumni I belong to, in fact, as does my mum, the first in our family to go to university. Through uncapping places, Labor opened the door of university to 190,000 Australians—many more who were the first in their family to go to university. This resulted in huge increases in the number of students going to university in Western Sydney, a place that is the jewel in the crown and a place where everybody comes to launch their campaigns. We've had former Prime Minister Tony Abbott coming into the electorate and spruiking all things great about Western Sydney—well, fund my university. 


Labor delivers real reform to higher education in this country. When we were last in government we lifted investment from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion—almost double—in 2013. But that growth will come to an absolute standstill because Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister, has effectively reintroduced a cap on the number of university places, taking us back to the bad old days of John Howard when your family's income and bank balance determined whether you could go to university or not. 


This MYEFO package of $2.2 billion worth of cuts is the government's fourth attempt, since coming to office, to cut universities and make students pay more. These cuts do real damage to our universities. At last year's budget they tried to make students start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000. Now they're proposing a new rate of $45,000. It's still too low when facing the crippling costs of higher living and no wages growth, not to mention penalty rate cuts. That is too low for people to afford to live and pay back their debt. 


We believe the current repayment rate is about right. We don't want to make students repay their debts when they are starting a career, saving for a house or starting a family. But what do we see from this coalition government? We see $2.2 billion in cuts to universities, and Western Sydney University is the second-worst affected by these cuts. Sixty per cent of the students who attend the University of Western Sydney—or Western Sydney U, as it's now called—are the first in their families. That is a staggering figure: 60 per cent are the first in their immediate extended families to be able to go to university. That is an extraordinary number. Families in Western Sydney want their kids to have a great education.


That extends to me. When we talk about City Deals and 30-minute cities, closing down the University of Western Sydney by defunding it and these cuts by stealth are not helpful. They will not create the 30-minute city this government constantly rattles on about. The people of Western Sydney and Lindsay in particular are being let down by this government. My community faces fewer employment opportunities in traditional jobs like manufacturing. Families in Lindsay need to be prepared for the jobs of the future. They want a learning pathway for their kids to give them a better job and a better life. Education will make a difference to the lives of people in my community. We need our kids to stay in school and go on to TAFE or university. I'm not even going to start on the VET sector tonight; I don't think we have enough time on the clock to talk about the cuts and lack of apprentices we now have.


The Turnbull government should properly fund universities and not attack students through these measures. I was privileged to attend O-week at the University of Western Sydney and talk to students excited about their future, their opportunities and the jobs they'll get when they have finished their degrees. They talked about their anxieties about HECS repayments when they're done. These students, most of whom have casual jobs and don't get support from their families, because their families are struggling to get by, don't need to be slugged any further by this government. These are not the wealthiest students going to university; they are from hardworking families, some from the lowest socioeconomic backgrounds.


It is pretty clear the government only ever had one plan for higher education—that is, for cuts and to make students pay more. To make matters worse, the New South Wales Liberals, who are spending $2.7 billion on demolishing and rebuilding two Sydney stadiums, are deaf to this problem as well. The Turnbull government is effectively slamming the door to educational opportunity in the faces of Western Sydney kids. Enrolments in university under Labor increased by 60 per cent in the seat of Lindsay. The University of Western Sydney will be the hardest hit, as I said before, with $93 million worth of cuts to funding. That is the greatest cut to any New South Wales university and the second highest to any university in this country. In 2016, the latest year with available data, about 25,000 women were enrolled at the University of Western Sydney out of a total of 44,000. Just over half the students were women. Instead of being supported, students are getting locked out. We are already facing an uphill battle, with the level of tertiary qualified people in my electorate sitting well below the state and country averages. We need to lift that, so we need more investment out there.


The Liberals' funding cuts also mean that the University of Western Sydney's critical programs that reach out to people in communities and ensure a pathway or option to get into university for everyone who wants one, and industry and government partnered programs, are all at risk, as is the Launch Pad, a great initiative built under Labor during the time of David Bradbury, a fantastic former Labor member for Lindsay. We built this Launch Pad, which is now serving as a tech hub. We have heaps of start-ups in there building 3D printers that were formerly being built in people's garages and are now being exported all around the country. This funding cut threatens that exact site, the place where we are training young people for the jobs of the future.


These programs are focusing on addressing the pronounced equity gap in education in my area. We know student debt is a genuine barrier to study for anyone in a low-SES or disadvantaged background. We should be doing all we can to increase participation in higher education, not making it harder. Why do we put challenges and hurdles in the way of our young people? Why don't we roll out the red carpet and give them every opportunity? They'll be here long after I'm gone. They'll be here making things and adding to our GDP well and truly after all of us have finished. Why are we making it harder? It is not good enough that these students are being left behind by this government. It is an especially cruel blow to the hardworking year 12 graduates who are now denied a place at university. Kids who studied last year and thought, 'Yes, I will get into university,' were denied a place because of the funding caps. Kids are starting their year 12 careers now, looking to go to university, and there is just so much uncertainty for them. They can have goals and aspirations but, because of this government, may have the door closed smack-bang in their face.


It is incredibly galling to see Malcolm Turnbull ripping funding away from students to pay for tax cuts for multinationals and millionaires. I think that's what leaves the foul taste in the mouths of so many people on this side. It's that we can seem to find $65 billion in the Treasury coffers to give to the big four banks, for example, who have already announced that they're going to slash 6,000 jobs, in the face and on the backs of those university students. How does he justify making it easier for big business to pay less tax but harder for kids who are 17, 18 and 19 to go to university? These are kids who just want to get ahead, who just want a decent job and who just want to be productive members of our communities.


Learning is a lifelong journey. I learnt that when I was studying to be a teacher back at university in 1999. It is a journey that starts well and truly before we are born and continues right up until the day we die. We need to make sure that our universities are there for everyone when they want to attend. The coalition government wants to slam the door on that lifelong journey.


We know that the disadvantage some families in my seat of Lindsay are facing prevents them from being able to go to university. In times of significant economic transition we should be investing in our people, not making it harder. The people in my community need a decent, well-funded university that supports their desire for a better life. People in Lindsay are calling out for courses at the Western Sydney University city campus, right in the middle of Penrith, to make it more accessible to go to university.


As Tanya Plibersek has said, Labor understands that a strong university sector  needs certainty and stability. You can't do anything without a stable policy. This undermines all of the planning that universities are able to do.


Taking away the 9,500 university places that are estimated to be unfunded in the coming 12 months, this government is again being cruel and out of touch—I don't think that they ever had the touch to be honest. They are denying opportunities to a better future and it's an absolute rip-off in the faces of those young people. But they can't help themselves. They have consistently tried to make students pay more, and why? All to pay and fund their $65 billion tax cut to big business, on the backs of hardworking students, who just want to get ahead. They say that it'll trickle down, but we're yet to see any evidence of that, and I can't find an economist who tells them that it's going to trickle down and rain on their heads.


No wonder the people of my community, and of Lindsay, feel incredibly let down by the Turnbull government, and the Abbott government before them. We deserve better. We deserve better than people who think that we're only capable of producing babies. We deserve better than people who think that all that we can get is an airport out there that's all the effects of a 24-hour airport. Where we have planes flying overhead 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Where we don't get investment in our people.


We've seen funding cut after funding cut to education. In the VET sector we've got 140,000 fewer apprentices than in times past. We're seeing this absolute demolishing of the funding for the Western Sydney University. Once again, Labor will not support this cruel, out-of-touch policy, and I ask those opposite to reconsider their support for this $65 billion tax cut on the back of university students.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (19:03):  I've often spoken in this place about the government's priorities and how they impact on everyday Australians. Have you ever wondered where students and universities sit on the scale of those opposite? You need to look no further than this bill that we have before the House today.


I want to acknowledge the member for Griffith, who has moved a second reading amendment to this bill, the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018, and place on record my thanks to her for moving this amendment, which is that the House declines to give the bill a second reading, because it attacks students and would undermine the fairness of Australia's world-class student loan scheme. I know the member for Griffith, alongside our deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, had been listening and consulting with the student sector, as we all have as representatives in this place. In one way or another we all represent higher education students in our combined electorates across this country.


The bill attacks students. It simply attacks students and undermines our world-class loan scheme, which has been a proven success for decades. I want to place on record how proud I am that Australia's higher education system is world leading. It supports more than one million students, both international and domestic, and our universities, as we've heard, directly employ 120,000 people and support another 40,000 jobs. Our higher education system must be protected. But, just like with everything else, it seems this government is hell-bent on tearing it down. And this MYEFO package with $2.2 billion worth of cuts will be the fourth attempt of the government's. I say again: it is their fourth attempt, since coming to office, to cut universities and make students pay more. It's not just the second or third time; this is the fourth attempt they've had at going after Australia's higher education students with a cheap tax grab. 


The government, as we know, are relentless when it comes to attacks on students. In last year's budget, they tried to make students start repaying their HELP debt when they started earning as little as $42,000. Now they're proposing a new rate of $45,000. How generous! The government want to increase the threshold and want to be congratulated for it. They simply either don't understand the ramifications that this bill will have on Australians trying to earn a living who have a uni or TAFE debt or they're deliberately targeting those who can least afford to pay it. Either way, in my books, it's a shameful act. 


But this seems to be the common theme within the Turnbull government. Pensioners, jobseekers, young families, you name it—if you're a working Australian doing it tough, then you're in the government's sights. Whereas if you're one of the big banks you're in line for a tax cut. The hypocrisy is astounding. In this bill the government has raised the threshold from the previous attempt of $42,000 to $45,000, but the truth is it's still too low. $45,000 is barely more than the minimum wage, and would mean Australians with a HELP debt on low incomes would be required to make repayments. This change would also have a greater impact on women, particularly those who have returned to the work force part-time after taking parental leave. For example, Australians with a HELP debt earning $51,000, most of whom are likely to be women, will have less disposable income that someone earning, say, $32,000. How is that fair? 


What the government doesn't like to talk about is that the lower repayment threshold for HELP debt will also apply to TAFE and vocational students who take out VET FEE-HELP or VET student loans. This means some of the hardest working but most modestly paid people in the country will be affected. That means people with a diploma or advanced diploma qualifications, like early childhood educators, enrolled nurses and technicians, will be caught up in this. We know that this week thousands of early childhood educators will be walking off their jobs as part of the Big Steps Campaign. They are highly qualified professionals, yet are paid one-third less than those teaching and caring for children just a few years older. Despite the incredibly important work they do, many early childhood educators are paid as low as $20 per hour, half the average national wage. Making matters worse is that 97 per cent of educators are female, which only further widens the gender pay gap in Australia. Because of these measures and their inadequate pay they will be paying their HELP debts well into their forties. These are the people who will bear the brunt of this government's awful piece of legislation we have before the House today—not big bankers, not executives and not those with mansions down by the harbour side. No, it will be childcare workers, teachers and nurses. It will be those who can least afford it. Once again, that doesn't seem to faze this government. 


Australia's future economy will require a high-skilled workforce, and this bill does nothing to support it. In fact, the government is going out of its way and making deal after deal with One Nation, to prove that point. Just last week we saw One Nation, the so-called party of the battlers, do a deal to deliver $65 billion in tax cuts for the big end of town, in exchange for 1,000 apprenticeships. That is nothing more than a pathetic con job. It is selling out young Australians in particular. We know that since this government came to power Australia has lost over 140,000 apprenticeships—a decline of over 35 per cent. 


Locally, the apprentices in my electorate of Oxley have been hit harder. Our community has seen the loss of almost1,500 apprenticeships, which is equivalent to a 43 per cent decrease, and the signs are that this will only continue to get worse. The 2017 budget cut a further $637 million from TAFE training and apprenticeships, and the government's proposed Skilling Australians Fund, which is supposed to deliver 300,000 apprenticeships, has been widely panned as unworkable. It seems the only thing the government is interested in is lining the pockets of the big banks and, as we know, foreign investors, while Australia's apprentices and students are left behind.


I wonder whether those opposite are actually aware of where Australia currently sits in the OECD as far as public investment in universities is concerned. Are we near the top? Not even close. About mid-range? Nah. Australia has the second lowest level of public investment in universities in the OECD, and this government only wants to make it worse. In contrast, our students already pay the sixth highest fees in the OECD. So we're towards the bottom, or the second lowest level, for investment in universities but our students are paying the sixth highest fees in the OECD. And we know that the fee hikes in this bill will only make that record worse.


I'm proud to represent the people of Oxley, in the south-west of Brisbane, in this place; however, for some of them things can be tough when it comes to going to university or TAFE. We know that high student debt is a genuine barrier to study for low-SES and disadvantaged students, so why would this government possibly want to make it harder for young people who are trying to pull themselves out of the cycle of disadvantage by furthering themselves at university or TAFE, and harder for parents who are trying to support their kids? We should be doing all we can to increase participation in higher education, not putting up extra barriers to further education and training, yet that is what this government is doing to young people in this country.


Picture this, Mr Deputy Speaker: four years from now, as a 22-year-old, you have recently graduated with a degree in engineering and you can't wait to take the skills and knowledge you learned at university and apply them to the real world. The past four years of university have been tough. Since moving out of home you have had to fork out the expensive rent that comes with living near enough to the closest capital city university. You've been working casually more than 20 hours per week—maybe in a cafe, maybe late at night—to support your study. But it's been made tougher since the government cut penalty rates. Sundays used to bring that little bit of extra cash to help with the groceries, increasing electricity costs or just getting to and from university on public transport, but getting your pay cut, as a young person, hasn't helped with this.


Nonetheless, you've graduated from university and you're ready to take on the world. However, you quickly learn that the job market is pretty tough out there and finding employment in your field isn't easy. The youth unemployment rate for people aged 15 to 24 is still double the national average. You're desperately keen to get your foot in the door, so you take an admin role at a leading engineering firm until something opens up for you. The starting pay is just 48 grand but it's better than nothing. You soon learn that, because of the government cutting the threshold for HELP repayments, your take-home pay is now even less.


On top of hoping to land an entry-level engineering job, you also hope to save a home deposit. But, as the government has done nothing about negative gearing, house prices have continued to rise. The average modest home on the outskirts of a capital city will now set you back $500,000. With tight budgeting you're able to save $50 per week. The bank will require a 20 per cent deposit, meaning you have to save $100,000. At your current rate, this will take 2,000 weeks to save, or the next 38 years of your life.


It's pretty sobering, but that is the story facing thousands of young people right across the country. It is the story I hear when I'm out doing mobile offices at Orion shopping centre or Jindalee Village or the Forest Lake village near my own home. Parents say, 'Milton, I'm worried my kids can't get a long-term job but I'm more worried that they'll never be able to have the great Australian dream.' What we're seeing today very clearly, in clear language, is: we're going to hit students with higher fees, we're going to give them higher bills and we're going to make them pay them off sooner.


Among my Labor colleagues on this side of the chamber I note the member for Macquarie, the member for Brand and the member for Chifley have been, in particular, outspoken advocates in the area of kids from disadvantaged backgrounds getting ahead. That is a key reason I'm in this place—to make sure that the kids who have the brains, the abilities and the talent can reach their full potential. It should be government helping them to do that. Instead, we've got a government with a lousy set of rules and bills before this parliament today that are simply not going to achieve that.


It's why Labor has recently announced a national inquiry into post-secondary education, a once-in-a-generation national inquiry that will look at every aspect of the vocational, educational and higher training systems to ensure they can best respond to the needs of Australia's economy and society. It's about making sure that Australians have access to the best post-secondary opportunities in the world. We all want our kids to get the education and the skills they need to thrive. We need to make sure Australians have the opportunities of lifelong learning. It makes good economic sense. We are competing against a fast sector across the South-East Asian market. If Australia is to be a wealthy, highly educated nation, we must boost participation in quality post-secondary education. It's pretty clear that other countries in our region are not doing what this parliament is doing tonight. They are investing in education and skills. Experts have warned that if we rest on our laurels Australia risks being left behind.


We on this side of the chamber know that we delivered real reform to our universities. We invested in universities. We lifted funding from $8 billion to $14 billion in 2013. We opened the doors to our universities to an additional 190,000 Australians, many the first in their family to attend university. Why did we lift participation in universities? Because it's good for the individual, but it's better for the economy. We know that a qualification, be it from TAFE or uni, can set you up for life. We know that many jobs of the future will require a post-school qualification. Yet tonight we are making a decision which is going to make it harder for kids to get ahead. The minister at the table may think it's funny. He may think what I'm saying is not serious, but the reality is that with this bill tonight we will make it harder for kids in his electorate and kids in my electorate to get post-secondary education.


We know the reason the government is keen on this. There's only one reason this government exists. Let's be clear: it's to make sure that those at the very top who rely on government support—the multinational companies and the millionaires—are looked after. And at what expense? The expense tonight, on this day of parliament and in this moment in time, is to slug the university students of today and tomorrow to pay for that. Well, I say I'm not going to support it. Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, say that our side of politics will not support it. We believe in a better way—more importantly, we believe in a fairer way. Tonight I call on the government to abandon what I call a reckless policy that threatens the viability and future of students attending higher education, and to stand with working Australians and middle-class Australians—the people whom we are sent to represent in this chamber—to protect the right of every Australian to better themselves through university, further education, or TAFE.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (19:18):  There will be a lot said about allowing access to education, and the impacts that the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (Student Loan Sustainability) Bill 2018 will have. I'm very pleased to be able to speak against this bill, because that is the key. As the member for Oxley has outlined, it's the disincentive that it creates and not just the cost that it forces still-young people to bear while they're trying to move from university and transition into a working life.


I want to tell you the story of Ellie. Ellie struggled to get through year 11 for a whole lot of family reasons. She was a bright student, but it wasn't always a place where she could concentrate. However, she made it through year 11 and she made it through year 12. In fact, she did so well that she was offered a place at university. She was to be the first person in her family to go to university. That seemed like a fantastic thing to start with—the idea that you get to university and this whole life would open up for you. At the time, she looked at what the costs of surviving university would be, but not the debt she would accrue and pay back—that conversation came later, and that whole process in itself was pretty daunting. But Ellie was lucky that she had people around her who said, 'You know what? This is worth it. This is an investment in yourself that is worth it.' And that was in spite of other voices saying to her: 'Why do you want to go to university? You're going to do an arts degree. That won't get you anything. Why don't you go and do hairdressing?' Well, Ellie wasn't terribly gifted at hairdressing, so that wasn't an option. But what appealed to her was the unknown of a degree at university.


So, in spite of different voices having different influences on her, she did accept her place at university. She went to the University of New South Wales and she began her arts degree. As luck would have it, Ellie thrived in that environment, but that doesn't mean it wasn't hard. Anyone who has taken a child through their first year of university knows the challenge of those first assignments: the tears, the late nights, the computers not necessarily doing what they ought to do and the struggle—not just the struggle of the practical but the struggle of the mind when you're struggling to deal with stuff you don't understand—but the very process of being at university and working through it is where you get the benefit.


Ellie got through this process. She got through her first lot of exams. She got through her next lot of exams. She got midway through second year, and suddenly the debt that she was carrying started to weigh on her. She started questioning herself: 'Can I actually repay this debt? I'm doing an arts degree. Will I ever get a job that will allow me to pay back all this money I owe?'—and by then it was already more money than she could ever imagine paying back. Again there were good people around her to encourage her, to keep her going, to say: 'You know what? This is the hard bit. You're halfway there. Keep going.' She managed to get through, but always there were other voices saying to her: 'You don't need to do this. You don't need to be worrying about this. You could go and get a job.' Fortunately, Ellie stuck with it throughout it all. There were lots of tears. She finished her final year, she did really well, she got offed a place to do honours and she did honours—the first in her family to have a degree and the first in her family to have an honours degree.


When I think about this legislation, I think about the one extra straw that it would have taken to dissuade someone like Ellie from going down a path that is hard. If anyone sits here and thinks, 'Oh, what a bludge, going to uni,' you have obviously forgotten what it was like going to university or you sailed through it differently from most of us, because it is hard. You are struggling with things that are making your brain explode. When I see legislation like this I think, 'Is this really what we want to do to young people? How much hope and possibility do we want to take away from them? How much debt do we want them laden with?' That's one aspect of it. And then, as they move from one phase of their life to their next, how much do we want to make it hard for them?


Clearly the government has decided it wants to make it a bit harder than it already is—in fact, significantly harder than it already is. I think the Prime Minister and this government think that, for students who are transitioning into the work environment, it won't really matter to them. I talked to some young graduates about their budget. I asked them what it would look like to repay on $42,000 a year instead of starting to repay their debt on an income of $45,000 a year. Here are the sorts of things that they told me.


For a budget for someone who's just graduated from a university in Sydney and has a job nearby, let's assume that the weekly take-home pay of someone who is earning, say, $45,000 is $736. That's the weekly breakdown. So let's do a weekly budget. Let's assume this person is trying to avoid the two-hour commute each way from the Blue Mountains or the Hawkesbury, which my electorate covers, but is happy to do a bit of commute into the city, so they rent in Strathfield. The average rent for a three-bedroom house is $680, and they pay a third of that. That leaves them with $510. Let's take away the cost of their mobile phone, their train tickets to get to work each day and about $150 a week for food: they now have $300 a week left. Then you've got the house-running costs, such as the cost of home internet, because, of course, we all work in a mobile world, and the chances of their job being nine to five, clock-on clock-off are pretty remote. Like all of us, they will be working late from home. Hopefully they will be able to download the odd Netflix here and there, but I haven't got that in the budget so I'm not sure that's going to be a viable option unless they can share someone's Netflix account. They've got their home internet, their water and their electricity, and those average at about, let's say, $200 a month—about $50 a week—and that's very conservative. Now they have $250 a week left, and that's if you somehow manage not to get a shock electricity bill for summer or winter. But that's only $250 left after the basic costs come out. 


Now that doesn't include putting in for your fair share of cleaning products in the house, nor does it include medical, dental or optical expenses. It doesn't address occasional costs like renewing a licence, maybe paying a fine, replacing a broken phone or computer, getting a haircut, or even joining a local sporting team or the gym. If you have a car, that's at least $50 a week in petrol and whatever the weekly breakdown of rego and insurance is. I haven't mentioned home contents insurance; of course, young people find that really stretches their budget. What if the washing machine carks it? What if you get a hole in your shoes in the rain? What if you're using a dodgy washing machine and it rips one of your tops and you need to replace it? There is no room in this budget for buying new clothes. You sure as hell can't afford to go out to dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. You probably can't afford to buy your mum much of a birthday present or a Christmas present, and you certainly can't have a pet. You might be able to afford one of these things: maybe you can allow yourself a haircut one week; the next week you might get petrol; you might go to the doctor the next. There really isn't even room for two of those things to happen in the same week. 


I don't actually think that you've got the opportunity to think about having children, buying a dog or buying your first home. There really isn't room in that budget. That is what we are saying; that's how you should live. What about a deposit for a property? Well, to get a deposit for a $600,000 property in the situation that I've just outlined, that person would have to not spend a cent outside of the bare necessities budget—certainly no children and no medical expenses or one-off expenses, like replacing a fridge. They could not buy one item of clothing, eat out, buy friends or family gifts, or even get a haircut. If you saved every one of those cents for five years, you might get yourself a bit of a deposit for your home. Of course, in that time the costs will have gone up and so you'll need even more. 


So this is what this government thinks is a suitable position for people to be in when they start paying back their HECS debt. This government wants to stick its hands into the pockets of people and take a chunk of the $250 that's left over. Not only do I fear that this will leave young people short of enough money to live properly, to eat properly and to look after their health properly, but the feedback I get is that it will absolutely reduce the number of people who even consider going to university in the first place, and that would be a tragedy. It's a tragedy for our economy, because our future depends on people, young and old, wanting to educate themselves. 


We know that accumulating a student debt is a genuine barrier to study for people from particularly poor and disadvantaged backgrounds. We already know that. It isn't an unknown; it's not a possibility. It is a fact. We also know that investing in education gives more back to society in the long term than it costs us in the short term. Let's picture Australia in 20, 30, or 40 years from now, and ask ourselves the question: do we want people who are doctors, nurses, journalists, teachers, engineers, planners, scientists, health professionals—anybody who requires a university degree—only to be coming from wealthy and privileged families? Do we only want one type of person who can afford to do those courses? We're already seeing an imbalance in professions like veterinary science and medicine. This sort of legislation is going to exacerbate that. I would have thought we'd want a mix of people. We want industries to be filled with people of different colours, different abilities and different genders—people from rural and regional Australia, Indigenous Australians, and people who know what it's like to go to school with a pair of shoes that has a hole in them.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (19:30):  The Prime Minister has visited my electorate twice in the last three weeks, and we welcome the attention. He didn't come by train, and we all know his affection for catching a train. There's a very good reason for that. It's because his party—the government, in fact—have abandoned the rail commuters across the Illawarra and South Coast. At both the state and the federal levels, the Liberals have failed to take opportunities to improve the rail network throughout the Illawarra and South Coast.


In 2017 the Turnbull government heralded a better rail service, including for Wollongong, through its faster rail prospectus. In fact, it released this plan, highlighting in its explanatory material the reality faced by commuters travelling from Wollongong to Sydney: travel times of up to two hours each way. This is a journey which even the former Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, said belonged in the 19th century. Commuters and their parliamentary representatives from Wollongong agree with the former Deputy Prime Minister.


The government's own material highlights that increasing speeds from 60 kilometres an hour to 80 kilometres an hour would reduce the travel times by almost one-half. The government's material mentions the Wollongong commute to Sydney—the Illawarra line—more than any other journey in its entire document. You can imagine how surprised we were when it published the results of the prospectus program and announced the programs that it was going to fund. There was not a single cent for any region in New South Wales south of Sydney—abandoned by the federal Liberal Party.


Despite the Prime Minister continually talking about his affection for trains, he seems to be blind to the needs of commuters on the Illawarra and South Coast. My state colleagues, Paul Scully and Ryan Park, have been taking up the same issue with their state colleagues, because the state Liberals are just as bad as the federal Liberals. In 2012 the New South Wales government released its long-term transport master plan, which was to address faster road travel times and reliability for Illawarra residents. It's been six years since the publication of that. I see the member for Cunningham is in the chamber with me now. She is shaking her head as well, because her constituents, like mine, understand the pain that these commuters are going through. It has been six years, and last week the New South Wales government released the results of their studies and what they intended to fund. There was not a brass razoo for the Illawarra and South Coast! This is how the Liberals, at both the state and federal levels, treat the commuters from the Illawarra and South Coast.


The Illawarra is more than just a southern suburb of Sydney, even though over 24,000 people make the journey from the member for Cunningham's electorate, from my electorate and even from the member for Gilmore's electorate through to Sydney to do their work on a weekly basis. Fast rail is not an option: it is essential if we are to grow as a region and to get the jobs and investment that we need. Fast rail and fast internet are absolutely essential.


The Turnbull government talks a lot about regional development but doesn't do much when it comes to the suburbs and the regions south of Sydney. With regional universities and state-of-the-art hospitals throughout regional Australia and throughout southern New South Wales, the commuters and the residents of these regions need a better deal from the government.


Freight rail also needs a better deal. The Maldon-Dombarton freight rail project was commissioned by the Wran Labor government in New South Wales and, indeed, half-built by the Wran Labor government in New South Wales, only to be cancelled by the Greiner Liberal government in 1998. Labor governments have been doing their best to get that project back on track. In two elections, the member for Cunningham and I have been so happy to be able to present a promise to the electorates for $50 million to get that project back on track. On each and every occasion the New South Wales Liberal government has thwarted the progress in this freight rail project.


We need to get rail back on the agenda, and the Prime Minister needs to stop taking selfies on trains and start looking after the commuters of the South Coast.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (10:30):  This week the government is pushing their agenda of $65 billion worth of tax cuts to big business instead of investing vital funds into education and health care. This government has its priorities all wrong. As a former teacher and principal, I understand, personally and professionally, the importance of properly funding our schools in a needs-based, sector-blind manner to ensure that our kids have access to the best quality education so that all schools get to the student resource standard. However, this Prime Minister's cuts to education are ruthless and demonstrate just how out of touch this government is. 


I know: I visited Iramoo Primary School, sat with the principal, Mrs Findlay, and looked at that school's performance data across a five-year period. They are doing amazing things at that school. It's a school of 800 students in a very low-socioeconomic area in my electorate, and everybody's getting the care and attention they need and they are making great learning progress. But, over the next two years, nearly $17 million of funding is not going to appear in the schools in the electorate of Lalor. Of our 57 schools that are state schools, every single one will be disadvantaged. 


It's not just about that; it's also about population growth in Victoria. The Victorian population is predicted to reach 6.26 million by the end of June 2018 with an average growth rate of 1.79 per cent over the last seven years. That population density is extraordinary and rising every day. Locally, in the electorate of Lalor, the City of Wyndham is one of the fastest growing areas in the country. Over 80 babies are born each week to a mother in Wyndham, and our population has surpassed 250,000 people—that means we are building schools at a rate of knots. I am proud that the Victorian state Labor government is building those schools while maintaining our local schools. 


The Victorian Labor government is also making a commitment to our local hospital with an $80 million investment in the Mercy Hospital set to open soon. The problem is that, while the Victorian Labor government is busy spending billions on infrastructure, the federal LNP government is cutting costs to our schools and hospitals. It seems they have little care for the ordinary people I represent in this place. They care little about our health and even less about our education. This Prime Minister is absolutely out of touch when it comes to providing for working-class people.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (11:00):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a)International Women's Day is celebrated on 8 March;


(b)the theme for 2018 is 'Press for Progress', recognising the strong and growing global momentum striving for gender equity; and


(c) now more than ever, governments must recommit to addressing entrenched gender inequities including:


   (i) high rates of family and domestic violence, sexual violence and harassment;


   (ii) pay inequity and the undervaluation of work in traditionally female industries; and


   (iii) the under-representation of women in Australian public life and leadership; and


(2) calls on the Government to:


(a) end its complacency and ensure gender equality is a central priority for government; and


(b) commit to urgent action to improve Australian women's:


   (i) safety and physical security;


   (ii) economic security and retirement incomes;


   (iii) health and reproductive rights; and


   (iv) representation in Australian parliaments.


I could not be more pleased than to be standing here to recognise International Women's Day for another year. The 2018 event, which was held during our parliamentary break on 8 March, calls on us all to press for progress, and that's exactly what I and my colleagues in Labor intend to do. International Women's Day provides us with a terrific opportunity each year to take stock—to recognise and celebrate the advances we've made, but also to knowledge our failings and to reaffirm the direction that we need to be heading in.


In too many areas of Australian life, gender inequality remains entrenched. Women still earn 15 per cent less than their male counterparts. Political and broad representation is years off gender parity, and, 10 years after the establishment of the National Council to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children, one woman every week is killed at the hands of a current or former partner. In so many areas there is much more for us to do. But this won't happen automatically. Sadly, progress is not inevitable, and, if we're to bring about real change, we need determined will, political will and action.


Nearly a year ago today, I addressed this House about International Women's Day 2017. I reported that Labor's Status of Women Committee, which I chair, was about to embark on a series of consultations across the country with Australian women and the organisations they represent. I reported that we planned to talk to women from all walks of life, from right across the country, about the issues they faced and the solutions they wanted to see in place. I am very pleased to report, a year on, that this is exactly what we did. Committee members hit the road throughout 2017 for a series of national conversations. This included 35 community meetings, workshops and roundtables, with more than 500 women engaging. We reached out to women in every state and territory, in the cities, rural and regional areas, including my home town of Newcastle. We heard from thousands of women across the country who attended these meetings, took part in the online survey or made a submission or whose views were represented as members of women's organisations. Participants said that their top five priority areas were: (1) ending violence against women and girls; (2) closing the gender pay gap; (3) preventing sexual harassment; (4) supporting marginalised women; and (5) improving access to reproductive rights and healthcare in Australia. 


Labor has listened, with this feedback already helping to shape Labor's first policy response. In fact, on the eve of this year's International Women's Day, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for women, Tanya Plibersek, launched Setting the Agenda, a national strategy for gender equality which places gender issues at the very centre of government decision-making. It does this by setting out targets and frameworks for gender-responsive policy. This includes running a gender lens across every piece of legislation to consider its gender impacts, returning the women's budget statement, and convening a ministerial council for gender equality.


The strategy also includes a range of concrete targets that will deliver measurable change. Under the strategy, a Labor government will work with the states and territories to set a family and domestic violence reduction target. We will take measurable action to close the gender pay gap and report back to the parliament on our progress. We will aim to reduce the gap in workforce participation by a quarter by 2025. We will increase women's participation on government boards to 50 per cent in our first term and set a target of 40 per cent of chair and deputy chair positions to be filled by women by 2025. We will boost funding for the six national alliances, which represent more than 180 women's organisations, and fund the ABS to deliver a time-use survey in 2020 and 2027 so we can get real data to help us understand how government policies impact women.


We will act to protect university students from harassment and sexual assault. We need to do a better job of considering the impact of government policies on Australian women. There is no clearer example than the fact that Australia still levies GST on tampons but does not for Viagra. I agree with our deputy leader and shadow minister: this was a dumb decision when it was made in 1999; it is still a dumb decision, and we must fix it.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (11:06):  Thank you to the member for Newcastle for calling for this debate today. International Women's Day is perhaps the most important issue day in the calendar. Women are half of our population, but not half of this parliament and not half of most workplaces. They aren't equal to men in pay and, devastatingly, they are dramatically overrepresented in statistics regarding domestic violence and sexual assault. This year we have seen the rise of the #MeToo movement, outing numerous predatory males who for years have been feted as exemplars.


My mother was a teacher. When she married my father she was forced to leave her job because having a female breadwinner just wouldn't do. Decades later my sister followed her into the teaching profession. On her marriage in the sixties, she was downgraded to a temporary employee. Today, thankfully, these are both abhorrent ideas that would be rightly criticised, so we have come a long way or, as when women's professional tennis began and Virginia Slims was their advertiser, the motto was: 'You've come a long way, Baby.' But there is still much further to go.


I was fortunate enough to celebrate the day at Medtronic, one of our great local medical companies. They put on a breakfast to commemorate the day, and I was honoured to be invited to speak. There was a lot of talk and aspiration about teaching gender equality in the workplace, but Medronic have put their money where their mouth is, with over 50 per cent of their employees being women and 40 per cent of the executive positions held by women. The sector, more broadly, much of which is based locally, also boasts fantastic results in this area. Health care has one of the highest proportions of women in senior leadership roles across any industry, with 70 per cent, according to the recent Workplace Gender Equality Agency report.


I would like to take this opportunity today to recognise the thousands of incredible women in the electorate I have the honour of representing. Bennelong is an incredible electorate with a fiercely vibrant community. Everywhere you look, we have people working together with businesses leading the world and strong cohesive narratives. But look a little closer: so much of this is because of the women who are giving their all to make our community a better place with people like Roseanna Gallo, who is giving our community a voice and getting us all to sing in tune together—a work in progress. Or, on the sporting field, Anne Doring has been getting girls into netball and sport by the thousands for decades. Every Saturday, through winter, Meadowbank courts are packed to the rafters with players from Anne's Eastwood Ryde Netball Association—one of the largest in the country. There are also groups like Ryde District Mums, promoting women across our community, giving them support and ensuring they have access to everything they need.


Of course, our community is one of the most ethnically diverse in the country, and there are many women in the many community groups representing their different diasporas. Agnes Shim from the Korean Women's Association and the ladies of the Australian Asian Association of Bennelong, including Melissa Foong and Ester Lee, exemplify this. These groups help new arrivals to fit into their new home and ensure those who have been here for a long time retain memories of their roots. They are responsible for the vitality of our community and we can't thank them enough. 


Bennelong is also home to over 14,000 small businesses, many thriving and many run and supported by women. There are clearly too many to name, but I'd like to highlight the great work done by some who bring this all together. Nora Etmekdjian has been a stalwart of the Ryde small business community for many years now and was integral to the success of the West Ryde Easter fair, which was celebrated this past weekend. Similarly, Lydia Scuglia and her sister Marcella Letteri are small business owners who manage to juggle their workload with work for the Riverside Business Forum, which brings together and supports businesses across the electorate. 


Time is short, shorter than I hoped. So many of the people I would like to mention here today, I can't. Many know who they are, and I hope all the women that I deal with through representing Bennelong know how grateful I am to them. Before I conclude, I do need to mention my family, in which my son and I are thoroughly outnumbered. Thank you to all the women in my life: my mother, my three sisters, and now my daughters, who take up the task.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (11:11):  I rise today proudly to speak on International Women's Day, which is the focal point for the movement of women's rights right around the world and has been celebrated for over 100 years. Disappointingly, though, we're going to have to keep celebrating and keep going to all of those breakfasts for the next 200 years if we continue on the trajectory that we have already set for ourselves. The day helps us to recognise and honour some of the amazing women and the important, impressive achievements of women right around the globe. International Women's Day also helps us to galvanise collective action across the globe. We have seen this movement gain more momentum and we've seen the fourth wave of feminism, if you like, across the globe, fuelled by movements like #MeToo, Time's Up, and the one that Tracey Spicer, our own, launched right here in Australia over the weekend, the NOW movement, which is a way for Australian women in the workplace to be heard on sexual harassment. 


International Women's Day marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity, which the World Economic Forum's Global gender gap report 2017 tells us is 200 years away. That's a lot of International Women's Day breakfasts right there, just to be treated equally. We don't want to get above you guys—don't panic. We just want to be treated equally: pay, conditions and all of those things. And we must take steps to close the gender gap. As Bill Shorten, our leader, has said:


Achieving equality for women and men is a test of our national character and an essential building block for national prosperity.


I am incredibly proud of Labor's rich legacy in addressing the gender gap, not just delivering empty words. 'Legacy' is probably the wrong word, given that we're still championing this cause and taking steps to reduce the unfairness between the sexes, including introducing the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act; the national women's alliances, so women had a voice in government; and the Workplace Gender Equality Agency to help close the gender gap. We set up 1800RESPECT and had to fight for the funding to continue, and we saw the dreadful privatisation of that service last year. We introduced the National Women's Health Policy in 2010. We raised the childcare rebate to 50 per cent—not entirely a women's issue though. We listed RU486 on the PBS. And we set ourselves quotas for female representation in the halls of power. We are on track to deliver those quotas and the key targets that we set for ourselves. We haven't stopped and will not stop fighting for the 75 per cent of women who have lost their penalty rates. 


Last year on International Women's Day Bill Shorten announced that we would develop a comprehensive blueprint for gender equality, which my colleague Sharon Claydon ran through before. Through our Labor Status of Women Caucus Committee, which I am very pleased to be a secretary on, chaired by the member for Newcastle, we spent last year hearing from over 5,000 women at 35 hearings as part of our Setting the Agenda conversation, giving women in our communities a voice. I am proud that a Labor government will work to set up frameworks for gender responsive policy and decision-making. We will introduce gender impact assessments on cabinet submissions and new policy proposals, and bring back the Women's Budget Statement, unbelievably scrapped by then Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was also the Minister for Women, disgracefully. Further, a Labor government will convene a ministerial council on gender equality.


When International Women's Day first began, women were championing their rights and demanding that they be given the right to vote. We have moved on from that argument. In terms of political representation, back in 1994, Labor said we needed more women in parliament. Back then, we had about 14 per cent. In 2018, and with the recent election of Ged Kearney in the seat of Batman, today we are now at 48 per cent. The coalition, by comparison, pathetically, are at 22 per cent. I did hear the member for Bennelong talking about the importance of women. I challenge him: set up your own status of women caucus committee within your own party. The motion that is before us today is not even supported by the Minister for Women, who is supposed to represent half the country. Also, two out of the three speakers offered up by this government are blokes—telling us about our women's issues. Having women in parliament and in positions of power makes a massive difference to all women around the country and also around the world. Sadly, we're seeing the coalition have to play catch-up, and all we ever hear from them is whingeing about our quota system. Well, guys, boys, it works. 


I am proud that, in Lindsay this year, we brought together 130 women for my International Women's Day event. We had Jane Caro join us as our special guest, and she was inspirational and formidable, as she always is. We had an awards ceremony for the incredibly impressive women who are doing great things in our electorate that you never hear about because, typically, women go about what we're doing quietly, amongst ourselves, and we don't put ourselves out there to be recognised or big-note ourselves and put ourselves up for awards—which is one of the challenges that we've got. I want to thank all of those people and wish everyone a happy International Women's Day.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-03-26,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (11:16):  I want to begin by saying how important it is to have men stand up for women. On International Women's Day, it's a celebration of women's achievements and what women can do, but critical to that is making sure that men have the courage and capacity to stand up, and will not be derided for standing up, for women. We know International Women's Day has been celebrated since the early 1900s. The advancement of the interests of women and fighting for their rights, for gender parity, has been critical, but no more critical than having incredible role models. I have the great privilege of being able to represent an electorate that is named after one of Australia's most significant women, Vida Goldstein.


In 1984, the division of Goldstein was founded to honour a particularly courageous woman, Vida Goldstein, who was instrumental in winning the right to vote for Australian women, two decades before the United Kingdom. Vida Goldstein's legacy was not just as a suffragette; she was one of the first women ever to stand for parliament in the entire British Empire—for the Senate for the great state of Victoria. She fought for the right for women not just to vote but also to buy property and enter into marriages on the same terms as men. Some might say that she was the marriage equality advocate of her times. Today we have female CEOs, prime ministers, soldiers and astronauts. Progress is visible. Female success, through freedom, choice and empowerment, is there for all of us to celebrate on International Women's Day. But we must continue to press for more progress.


In acknowledging the progress, 8 March was also about recommitting ourselves to smashing the remaining barriers to true gender parity in society—in particular, the high rates of domestic violence, sexual violence, and harassment that many women still endure. A recent ABS survey of 21,000 women shows, tragically, that as many as half of all women in Australia have been sexually harassed. Many other statistics still have alarming numbers. Globally, each day, 830 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Women also make up 64 per cent of the world's illiterate population.


A century ago, Vida Goldstein fought for these foundational rights and freedoms for women in our country. Today, in the same vein, we must take up the battle, and it must be about men and women working together to advance the interests of women. It isn't just a fight by women. We have to fight for women's domestic safety, as well as for their economic health and reproductive freedoms.


In the Goldstein electorate we are lucky to have many female role models to celebrate, many of whom we acknowledged with Australia Day honours this year: Beryle Campbell Foster OAM, from Brighton, for her service to women in Victoria, including legal service, the National Council of Women Victoria and the League of Women Voters Victoria; Faye Haskin-Dubrowin OAM, from Caulfield South, for service to interfaith relations and to community as the first female president of B'nai B'rith Victoria; and Hatice Basarin, from Hampton, for her dedication to the preservation of Australian and Turkish military history.


Featuring in the Bayside City Council awards this year we had Millicent Roper and Stevie-Lou Answerth, who are new, up-and-coming women trailblazers. They were the recipients of the 2018 Young Citizen of the Year award for their work to develop an inclusive culture at Bayside schools, including for LGBTI students. Meren Reid received the City of Bayside's 2018 environment award for her longstanding volunteer contribution to Bayside's wonderful natural environment.


Similarly, in Glen Eira, we had Cara Morgan, from McKinnon, who won the Young Citizen of the Year award as chair of the 5th/6th Central Moorabbin Scouts Group's Venturers. That was along with Lital Weizman, from Caulfield South, who volunteers with Stand Up's Encounters Mentoring Program and tutors year 8 Sudanese students while also assisting with Sudanese youth and culture events.


I'd also like to give a special mention to Martine Harte, a fierce women's advocate who was awarded a prestigious Melbourne Press Club Gold Quill award for excellence in journalism. Martine also received a Logie award nomination and is judging this year's Telstra Business Women of the Year awards. We're very proud to have her as part of our community. She was described by The Age newspaper as 'an ideal general for the growing female army'. Martine uses new media to challenge thinking about the rights of women and girls, and I'm proud to be able to say that we're working with her to try to advance and celebrate women in the Goldstein electorate and the capacity they can have to influence and shape the future of our community, our state and our nation.


I'd also like to acknowledge Michelle Ayyuce, from Black Rock, who is another leading voice working towards a future where women are able to successfully manage career breaks and family commitments and to recognise the modern reality that women need to be able to make choices and continue with their careers without disadvantage.


Lastly, to finish on an optimistic note—and I say this with difficulty as a Melbourne Football Club man—the Western Bulldogs took home the AFL women's 2018 premiership over the weekend. It's great to see so many talented young women finally given the opportunity to inspire on our sporting fields.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:21):  It is with great pleasure that I'm able to speak today about the importance of International Women's Day. It's a time to observe and reflect on the progress that we've made in attempting to achieve parity for women and also to focus on the fact there are many, many areas that still need addressing if we are to achieve real progress for women. We're pressing for progress, and we need to keep pressing for progress, because there is still a lot that we need to do to ensure equality for women throughout the world.


I want to thank my colleague and friend the member for Newcastle for bringing this motion forward. I just want to comment on those opposite. We had an opportunity for five speakers on this motion. Two speakers on the opposite side have been blokes; one of them is a woman who hasn't fronted yet, as far as I'm aware; and there are still two opportunities that are going begging. There are still two opportunities to speak on International Women's Day, which those opposite can't bring themselves to do.


They can't muscle up a speech to talk about the inequality that faces women throughout Australia, throughout their communities and throughout the world. It's an absolute disgrace that those opposite cannot muscle up five speakers to speak on something as important as International Women's Day, something as important as press for progress, something as important as equality for women in their communities, in Australia and throughout the world.


In speaking very proudly on this motion, I acknowledge and support the sisters who have blazed the trails for us, who have led the way over decades in some hard-fought fights in their fight for fairness and equality. Thank you, sisters, for fighting the good fight over those many, many years, over many decades, but unfortunately there is still a long way to go, so we cannot rest on our laurels.


Each day, women are confronted with injustices at every level, be it the high rates of family violence, be it the pay gap, be it underrepresentation of women in leadership positions. Every woman has a right to feel safe in her community and in her home. We know that in Australia one woman is killed by a current or former partner every week. In my own community, Canberra was devastated by the death of Tara Costigan at the hands of her partner. Tara was killed in 2015. She was a devoted mother of three children, and her life was stolen as a result of the scourge that is domestic violence in our community. Unfortunately, Tara's story is not rare. It's one that many Australian women face each and every day as they fall victim to family violence. One of the real concerns that I have is the fact that these women are not just suffering at the hands of domestic violence but also don't feel that they can escape these abusive relationships—because of a lack of financial independence, because of a lack of economic opportunity or because of a lack of somewhere safe to go in terms of a home.


Globally, less than 20 per cent of women own land and 70 per cent of people living in poverty are women. We have the responsibility of ensuring that women have viable plans for financial stability, including in retirement. Relying on a man for financial security is not a financial plan for the future. This is what I tell women and girls in my community endlessly: a man is not a financial plan.


Sisters, you have to become financially independent. You have to take control of your fertility if you are to determine your own future, if you are to have choice in life and if you are to have opportunity in life. If you want to pursue the dreams that you've had since childhood, you have to be financially independent and you need to take control of your fertility.


And the framework, the premise, behind all of that is education and having access to education, no matter what your background is, no matter how much your parents earn, no matter what your gender is, no matter what race you are and no matter what your religion is. That's why it's deeply concerning to learn that our early educators are struggling to be treated seriously and struggling to get decent pay and conditions. We've got a campaign rolling out this week that acknowledges the significant contribution these educators make to educating for our future and to ensuring that the children of our nation have opportunities to get a decent education.


I encourage Australians to support their campaign.

"Banks, Julia, MP",LP,2018-03-26,"



Ms BANKS
 (Chisholm) (11:27):  I rise to speak to this motion that acknowledges that we celebrated and observed International Women's Day on 8 March. International Women's Day celebrates the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. It is a big day for inspiration and change. This year the theme of International Women's Day was 'press for progress'. I am very proud to be a member of the Turnbull government, a government that is continuing to deliver progress and better outcomes for women in my electorate of Chisholm and indeed across Australia. To put it simply, the Turnbull government is fully committed to supporting and encouraging women in Australia so that there will be no limits to what they can aspire to achieve. The Turnbull government is certainly pressing for progress regarding the status of women in our society. Indeed, equality for all Australians underpins our government's agenda. The Turnbull government is committed to redressing entrenched gender inequities through striving to achieve equality of opportunity for all Australians by implementing integral policies, including a focus on galvanising women's safety and economic security through access to employment, as well as minimising homelessness and optimising educational outcomes, to name a few.


As the chair of the newly formed Parliamentary Friends of Women's Health, which is to be launched today, I'm particularly pleased to speak today about our broad-based health initiatives, which target the health issues that specifically pertain to women or for which there are high incidences or differing symptoms between women and men. Most notably, I'm proud to report on the Turnbull government's groundbreaking policies that are saving and will continue to save lives by significantly reducing the incidence of health challenges such as the diagnosis of ovarian, cervical and breast cancers. The Turnbull government is committed to tackling cancer and provides, through Medicare, support for women who are suffering from cancer. Last November we added two new Medicare items for the testing of gene mutations that predispose women to cancers. We've also moved to ensure that medicines to treat cancer are more affordable by increasing government spending on PBS medicines in the last financial year.


With regard to early detection and screening for breast cancer, the last federal budget announced funding of $64.3 million over the next four years to allow BreastScreen Australia to continue to actively invite women aged 70 to 74 to screen for the early detection. More broadly, the government has invested over $10 billion for cancer control activities, and in the last financial year the government invested around $2.9 billion for cancer control activities. These measures are just some examples of how our government is striving to ensure that all Australian women can reach affordable and timely health care.


The Turnbull government is committed to ensuring the safety of Australian women and children and redressing the rates of family and domestic violence in our nation. Most notably, our $100 million Women's Safety Package is directly targeting the causes and effects of violence against women, including $59 million for practical and immediate action to keep women and children safe, including provision of security technologies; the development of the Australian government's eSafety Women website, which empowers women to take control and safeguard themselves and their children from technology-facilitated abuse; $36 million for training in frontline services; $5 million for outstanding educational resources; importantly, $25 million to address family violence in Indigenous communities; and $30 million for frontline legal assistance and family law services.


The Turnbull government is fully committed to supporting women's employment, encouraging women into leadership positions and increasing financial empowerment of women. We've set an ambitious but achievable target for women to hold 50 per cent of Australian government board positions. From a productivity and intergenerational perspective and given our ageing population, there must be increased participation of women in the workforce and in leadership. As such, our government has made it a priority to reduce the workforce participation gap for Australian women by 25 per cent by 2025. More women in the workforce means more women being made ready for leadership positions. Increased participation of women in the workplace is intrinsically linked to providing these opportunities for women, so the Turnbull government's significant childcare reforms include the allocation of an additional $2.5 billion for a number of childcare initiatives and also investing $430 million to support universal access to preschool and $263 million for the rollout of ParentsNext, as well as other measures to boost women's workforce participation. I'm proud to be part of the Turnbull government which has focused on support for women to ensure progress for future generations of Australian women.

"Keogh, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-03-26,"



Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (11:31):  I commend the member for Newcastle for proposing this motion in support of International Women's Day, which was celebrated on 8 March this year. The theme for 2018 is 'Press for Progress', recognising the strong and growing global momentum striving for gender equality. Now, more than ever, governments must recommit to addressing entrenched gender inequality.


An important issue that must be addressed is paid domestic violence leave. Domestic violence leave will cost only about 5c per day per employee, but the real point is that the human cost of a type of leave that is used only in the most critical of circumstances must come before profit. The statistics in this area are shocking. One in five women experience harassment within the workplace; on average, one woman is killed every week by a current or former partner; Indigenous women and girls are 35 times more likely than the wider female population to be hospitalised due to family violence. A lack of domestic violence leave means further trauma for domestic violence victims, rather than the assistance a compassionate society should provide.


The Western Australian, Queensland and Victorian state governments have now introduced 10 days paid domestic violence leave for public servants. That is a terrific decision. Here, the minister for employment, who is also the former Minister for Women, instructed this government's departments and agencies to oppose paid domestic violence leave in their enterprise agreements. Frankly, this is disgraceful. Those who oppose this policy due to cost need to think about the human cost of not acting. If you believe the issue is too prevalent and, therefore, too costly, focus on reducing the scourge of domestic violence; don't stop the protection of the victims.


Penalty rates, also, are a fundamental part of the Australian way of life. They protect our weekends, seek to compensate for a loss of time with family and provide a way for low-paid workers to get a bit more in their wallets each week, making it easier—though not easy—to make ends meet. Many Australians earn an annualised salary where they trade off those penalty rates for greater flexibility for both their employers and themselves. The quid pro quo here is that these salaries should compensate for that reasonable overtime and weekend work penalty rates that they forgo. But analysis shows that women earn 33 per cent less than men in Australia when rates of part-time work are taken into account. The cut in penalty rates will exacerbate the gender pay gap, with women making up the majority of workers in these lower paid jobs that are affected by these cuts. Juggling family life and work is a tough gig. I know that, and my wife, Annabel, especially knows that. Everyone in this place should know that. So, with this government cutting penalty rates for the people who need them the most, the result is another hurdle for equality for women in the workplace.


But gender equality is not just about those individuals. It is an issue of international economic and social importance. For too long, it has largely been women who have been advocating at the front, achieving hard-won improvements, while so many men hold the power and influence to help advance this work.


The Male Champions of Change movement and approach is a growing part of removing entrenched gender inequalities. The Male Champions of Change coalition now encompasses eight action groups, with over 130 leaders from across Australian industry, but, of course, this needs to grow, and it needs to grow much more. Currently there are, frankly, unacceptably low levels of women in leadership in politics, especially in this government, and business, with the percentage of women on ASX 200 boards now at a whopping 26.7 per cent! That's half the proportion of the actual population. It's also less than the number of men named John, Peter or David on those boards. In the legal profession, which I hail from, it is clear that the pace of change has been especially slow, with over 63 per cent of graduates now being women, yet women only occupying 10 per cent of high-level positions in the profession.


With the election of Ged Kearney to the Labor Party, we now have a magnificent gender balance in our caucus of 48 per cent, demonstrating that gender quotas do actually work and are needed. Of course, there's still more work to do. The Prime Minister, though, likes to talk a big game about his support for women, yet, as evidenced by the proportion of women in his party room and ministry, the Prime Minister is all talk and no action. Unfortunately, the results for women's policy under this government are also woefully inadequate. I commend this motion to the House, and I stand here as a proud feminist in support of it.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (11:37):  It's a delight to speak on the member for Newcastle's motion on International Women's Day. I had the privilege this year of partnering with two organisations to bring International Women's Day to the Blue Mountains. Springwood Neighbourhood Centre, led by Toni Quigley, has marked International Women's Day with a breakfast for as long as any of us can remember. Women with Altitude is a networking and support group for businesswoman started in the mountains by Andrea Turner-Boys, who has organised International Women's Day events in more recent years. So the coming together of these two groups was destined to be a success.


I joined a panel discussion that included Jen Ballard, who has been a woman in the sport of motorcycling racing; Molly Cameron, a Winmalee High School student; and SJ Staszak, a mum who lost the use of her legs after a supposedly simple operation on a bulging disc, but that hasn't stopped her from abseiling. The panel discussion brought a whole group of women, everyone who was in the audience, to consider the progress that has been made to date, the sort of progress that we need to see and how to press for that progress, living the themes of International Women's Day. I'd like to add that it was wonderful to have Winmalee High School senior students there, represented by Erin, Hayley and Georgie, and the deputy principal, Voula Facas. It's just wonderful to see the sort of support that this community gives to young women. I'd like to congratulate all involved, including Jacinta Tobin for her very moving and beautiful welcome to country. Let's hope that it's the first of many collaborations, which are, of course, what women do well.


The North Richmond Community Centre continued its tradition of hosting an International Women's Day event. This year, Anne Lowe revealed some of the challenges of being a woman in an Australian defence coding unit during the Vietnam War. It was quite a pertinent choice, because the movie that the group saw was Hidden Figures, which is, of course, the story of a team of female African-American mathematicians who served a vital and secret role at NASA in the early years of the US space program doing coding. They were women in non-traditional roles. It was wonderful to hear Anne's stories about what it was like for her. As always, Birgit and her team at North Richmond provided an inclusive and supportive event for women of all ages, and my thanks go to Stacy Etal and Maree Fayne from the Hawkesbury Community Outreach Services, both of whom played a key role in the event.


While International Women's Day is an important day, there are many women who celebrate and support the power of women every day. One such group is Pink Finss. They provides practical and emotional support to women with cancer. Saturday night was the third Pink Tie Ball to raise funds for the many things that Pink Finss do—and yes, almost a pink tie over there; coming close. Two brave women told very powerful and gut-wrenching stories of their experiences of losing their sister and friend Amanda to breast cancer. Once again, as is always the case at this event—and this is my third time there—they proved to be totally inspirational. 


Pink Finss founder, Jodie Amor, and a team including Emma-Jane Garrow, Kym Burton and Maria Miller focus on supporting women as they recover. They go through the treatment and they ensure quality of life when the days that remain are short. Jodie, the founder, was just 33 and married with two young children when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a journey that changed not only her life forever but also that of hundreds of other women and their families. 


The work Pink Finss do from their base in Windsor is an incredible model of women supporting women. They also support families and friends, so it enhances the environment in which women can deal with their treatment or come to terms with the fact that their treatment hasn't been successful—and, sadly, it happens. 


Pink Finss are master fundraisers, as Saturday night's event was evidence of. They attract terrific support from the Hawkesbury community, and I would like to congratulate all those who made donations on the night or beforehand, including the Hawkesbury Race Club which proudly hosts the ball. They've raised more than $1 million and helped over 100 women. This group has extended the support to women with any cancer now, and they are doing a great job. I commend their work as women who every day push the progress.

Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (15:59):  Last week I had the opportunity to welcome the Minister for the Environment and Energy, Josh Frydenberg, to my electorate of Indi to meet with a wide and diverse community of representatives, including Winton Wetlands, Wangaratta Sustainability Network, Renewable Energy Benalla, the Murrindindi Climate Network, Up2Us Landcare Alliance in Mansfield, Yackandandah Health, Totally Renewable Beechworth, Renewable Albury Wodonga Energy, Totally Renewable Yackandandah, AusNet Services and Mondo Power. The minister noted, 'I'm amazed to see the depth of commitment from local communities.' But I'm not amazed. This is true rural Australia.


It is this commitment which has resulted in the report called Towards a totally renewable Indi: a case study in community action. It shows how communities across Indi are working together to create a clean energy future, and there are opportunities for everybody. So I encourage anybody and everybody to talk to your local council, form a group, go to the web page and download a copy, or go to my office in Wodonga or Wangaratta and ask for copies for your community. I really encourage you to get your friends organised because, if not now, when are we going to take action on climate change and, if not you, who's going to do it? We've begun the work. There's so much going on in Indi, and now there's an opportunity for every single community to do something about renewable energy.

Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (16:45):  I'd like to start by commending the member for Perth and his staff for championing the small-amount credit contract and consumer lease reforms. The National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Small Amount Credit Contract and Consumer Lease Reforms) Bill will improve the lives of some of our most vulnerable Australians and may very well prevent others becoming trapped in dodgy and shady small-amount credit contracts, or SACCs.


In the Territory, we have had many instances of individuals being ripped off by payday lenders and rent-to-buy operators. In one instance, a payday loan client who borrowed $150 was told within six weeks by a payday lender to repay over $1,000. We also had a Centrelink recipient who had four rent-to-buy payments deducted from her Centrelink payment each fortnight, leaving her with only $50 to feed her family. On top of that, she had a payday lender attempting to withdraw a further $66 repayment each fortnight by direct debit. We've had a case of an age pensioner paying $1,500 for a set of drawers worth $600, and we even had a ridiculous case where a lender charged a $50 dishonour letter fee on top of a $49 payment dishonour fee. We also had the case of Amazing Rentals Pty Ltd in the Northern Territory. In one disturbing instance, a man on Newstart allowance, with English as a third language, could not afford to pay for electricity or food because his lease payments to Amazing Rentals were so high. But for the great work of ASIC and the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency—NAAJA—this organisation would still be operating and ripping off Territorians.


In the Territory, there are 72 remote Indigenous communities where services are coordinated by the NT government, and we also have about 500 homelands in the Territory. The final report of the Review of the small amount credit contracts laws in 2016 noted:


The issue of unsolicited sales (of any products or services) in Indigenous communities has been long recognised as causing significant harm, with these communities targeted as suppliers can make multiple sales in a short period of time with little effort or outlay of capital.


Officers from ASIC's Indigenous Outreach Program have been told of instances where businesses, including rental companies, have given inducements to senior or respected community members to obtain introductions to individuals in the community so that they can make as many sales as possible. That is shameful. They have heard, both firsthand when visiting a community and second-hand through financial counsellors and consumer advocates, of regular instances of this practice being used in numerous communities around Australia. In some instances, unscrupulous lenders are able to operate in these remote communities due to loopholes in current regulations. So, I am very pleased that this bill will prevent door-to-door selling of consumer leases at residential homes and introduces broad anti-avoidance protections to prevent SACC loans and consumer lease providers from circumventing the rules and protections contained in the credit act.


The reforms in this bill aren't groundbreaking or revolutionary. We know that members opposite support the measures—or at least they should, because this bill implements the government's own policy in relation to SACC reforms. I'm sure that we can all agree that strengthening penalties will increase the incentive for SACC providers and lessors to comply with the law and that imposing a cap on the amount that can be paid will protect consumers.


ASIC agrees with the changes. The bill adequately balances the need to protect consumers from harm whilst ensuring that the useful parts of the industry remain viable. We know that there are times when those on low incomes need quick access to cash, and we are not—not!—advocating the total elimination of payday lending. Instead, we are protecting those people from exploitation by predatory lenders. Needless to say, it would be a disgrace if members opposite voted against its implementation when we all know they agree with the changes being proposed. We have a chance to help vulnerable Australians, some of whom are suffering because of payday lenders and small-amount credit contracts, so I urge the government to accept the member for Perth's proposals and pass their own legislation.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (16:51):  This issue is one that is pretty close to my own heart. There are something like seven different payday lenders within 450 metres of the front door of my electorate office. Two of them are in fact right next door to each other. So in great communities like mine, which have a lot of disadvantage, we see a concentration of payday lenders.


I want to commend the work of the member for Perth and the member for Oxley. It's an honour to speak after the member for Solomon, who made some very good points a moment ago in his characteristically eloquent way. This is an important issue. It touches communities like mine and communities right around the country. It treats vulnerable people very poorly, so I appreciate the work not only of the members for Perth and Oxley but of all of my colleagues here. It is disappointing that there aren't any speakers from the other side.


The payday lending industry makes a lot of promises about fast cash, giving everyone a fair go, and being there when they are needed, so it is not surprising that people who are doing it tough, including people in my community, turn to payday lenders or rent-to-buy schemes to get through those tough times. I do understand that in some cases these loans can play a legitimate role for low-income families in smoothing out some of those unforeseen financial pitfalls. But in the main I think it is true their promises don't always match up with reality. There are a lot of rip-offs and a lot of damage is inflicted on communities like mine. There are leases and loans going to people already crippled with the debt of existing loans. You have rent-to-buy contracts, where families are paying more than $3,000 for a clothes dryer that would normally cost $345, which is equivalent to an interest rate of 884 per cent. You have leases where an item isn't replaced when it's faulty. You have credit providers using rent alone to calculate people's living costs, but not all of the other costs associated with life. I could go on and on, unfortunately.


I want to make it really clear that when we talk about the concerns we have with payday lending and consumer leases we are not in any way reflecting on the good people who work in these businesses, a lot of them being in those seven outlets near the front door of my electorate office. We're in no way reflecting on the people who work there, but we are reflecting on a system that allows this sort of behaviour to go on. We need to fix it, to change it, and that is what this private member's bill is about. It is about protecting consumers and not demonising the workers who sit at the front counters of those businesses.


All we are trying to do here is to implement the key recommendations from the small-amount credit contract laws review. We want a cap on the total payments that can be made under a consumer lease. We want small-amount credit contracts to have equal repayments and equal payment intervals. We want to remove the ability for providers to charge monthly fees on the leftover length of a loan when the loan is paid off early. As the member for Solomon said, we want to prevent the door-to-door selling of leases at residential homes. We want to introduce broad anti-avoidance protections and strengthen the penalties for people who do the wrong thing. These asks that we have of the government are not that ambitious, frankly. They simply reflect what the government said they were interested in doing in the first place. We are seeking a bipartisan outcome, where the government would introduce its legislation and we would support it. Unfortunately, for reasons that are really beyond comprehension, it is left to us on this side of the House to move the government's own legislation to implement the recommendations of the government's own review. That's a pretty unfortunate, pretty shameful outcome, really, and we would prefer that it were otherwise.


There are all kinds of other elements to it, including the proportion of people's incomes that can be paid on loans and all of these sorts of things. We want to adopt, for example, the same 10 per cent income cap for lease payments on rent-to-buy schemes that we are proposing for payday lenders as well, to get that cap on how much you have to pay out of your income down to 10 per cent.


As I said, we've introduced this private member's bill because the government has failed to act. There hasn't been the action that has been promised, and so we are once again stepping into the leadership void left by those opposite. We just want to implement the government's own policy, and we think that enough is enough. We think that the government needs to realise this is about helping people trapped in a vicious cycle of debt and dependence on these schemes, whose lives can only be improved by this parliament standing up for them in the way that we've outlined in this private member's bill.

Ms LAMB
 (Longman) (16:55):  It's not often that I eagerly await legislation from this government. Actually, I usually dread it, but that's because usually legislation from this government hurts people who don't deserve it, as with cuts to TAFE and cuts to university—I've just come from the chamber downstairs, where I spoke against the cuts to universities—or maybe the attacks on hospitals or the public health system. But I've been waiting for their promised small-amount credit contract, or SACC, legislation for some time now—too long, in fact. I've been waiting because this legislation should provide protections to vulnerable consumers who've been ripped off by unscrupulous payday lenders and rent-to-buy schemes.


Just to go through a quick time line of what has led us up to today, when Labor was in government we enacted the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, a national regime for regulation of consumer credit, with some additional protections. This legislation included a mandated review of the legislation, which was commissioned by the then Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg back in 2015. When the government received the review in March of 2016, they waited eight months before noting, in November 2016, that they supported the vast majority of recommendations in part or in full. So, a year later, in October of 2017, the then minister, Michael McCormack, gave us a promise that the government would introduce the legislation later that year.


Well, here we are, still waiting, months after yet another government promise has been broken. We are still waiting despite Labor repeatedly calling upon the government to introduce this legislation. We are still waiting despite the member for Perth doing the government's job for them and bringing forward this private member's bill, the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Small Amount Credit Contract and Consumer Lease Reforms) Bill 2018, which replicates, word for word, the exposure draft legislation that the government released in October last year.


This bill that we're speaking about today is consistent with the small-amount credit contract review recommendations. It seeks an imposition of a cap on the total payments that can be made under a consumer lease, it removes the ability for an SACC provider to charge a monthly fee in respect of the residual term of a loan when a consumer is able to repay the loan early, and it strengthens the penalties to increase incentives for providers and lessors to comply with the law, amongst other measures.


These are all critical reforms that are vital to protect vulnerable consumers. You see, some small-amount credit contract providers prey on people with low incomes. They know that 40 per cent of people who enter into an SACC loan are unemployed, and they know that 25 per cent of those people receive more than 50 per cent of their income from Centrelink. They know that these people are struggling and are looking to SACC loans as a way to smooth out some unforeseen swings and roundabouts that affect low-income families. Yet some providers are locking these vulnerable people into contracts that end up costing three or four times the retail price of the good that they're purchasing. They use rent alone to calculate an applicant's expenses, not taking into account the cost-of-living bills, even for things as simple as groceries.


I'm not saying that all providers are bad. I'm not saying that there's no place for small-amount credit loan contracts; I'm not saying that at all. What I'm saying is that we need protections in place to ensure that vulnerable Australians don't fall victim to unscrupulous lenders who are taking advantage of their situation. There are people in places like Caboolture in my electorate of Longman who are being trapped in cycles of debt by exploitative lenders. Without proper regulation, this is going to keep happening time and time again. It's time the government took charge and introduced the legislation that they promised all those months ago. It's time to do it.


So I say to the government that this is something that Labor will work with you on. We will work with you to pass this through parliament as quickly as we can, because we know just how important this is. We say to the government: quit stalling and introduce this legislation. There are people in my community who are counting on this legislation moving through. I say to this government: once and for all, do your job.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (17:01):  In their current form, the small-amount credit contracts have become a blight on our community and on my community in particular. Payday lenders are preying on vulnerable low-income earners who are trying to keep their heads above water, with leases and loans that are causing them to spiral further into debt. We've all seen or heard the flashy advertisements in the media where payday lenders are promising quick and easy loans. We don't need to detail them, but the most affronting of those for me is the one that suggests that if your child's having a birthday party it might be a good idea to take out a loan. It all looks like a quick and easy fix to help in circumstances where the finances are tough. But these loans are ripping off vulnerable consumers and causing them further financial strain in the long term.


And it doesn't stop there. When I sat with the Victorian Consumer Action Law Centre more than two years ago, they told me that one of their major concerns was that people didn't have one of these loans or one of these contracts or one of these leases; people had three or four of them. In those circumstances you've got to wonder about the impacts on the anxiety levels in households and the flow-on effect of that anxiety to their children. As someone who worked in schools, let me tell you: for a child coming from a home filled with anxiety and financial stress, it comes into those children's lives in very detrimental ways.


So it's important that this parliament and this government do something about this. Labor knows this, and in fact the government knows this too, because this bill, the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Small Amount Credit Contract and Consumer Lease Reforms) Bill 2018, is identical to Treasury's exposure draft in every way—word for word. Others here have highlighted the sorry tale in which the member for Higgins did the work in this space and the now Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, completed the work—had the bill drafted. But what happened after that? Beyond reason, this bill has not been brought into the parliament. I believe the member for Deakin is the person who failed to do that—failed to bring it into this parliament to protect vulnerable people from seeking loans that they cannot afford.


In my electorate of Lalor we have three payday lending shopfronts within a 500-metre radius of the Werribee train station. Further to this, Digital Finance Analytics, in the report The stressed finance landscape data analysis, commissioned by the Consumer Action Law Centre, identified payday lending hotspots and indicated that the postcode 3030, including Point Cook, Werribee and Werribee South, was the ninth highest hotspot for small-amount credit contracts. This is the same area that last year was identified as having the highest mortgage stress and mortgage default rates and for many years had been in the top 10 for people being evicted from their rental properties.


So what we're seeing is layer upon layer of financial stress. You've got to start to understand that these payday lenders are acting with full knowledge of the stress these people are under, yet they're giving loans. They are providing loans when they know. Digital Finance Analytics recently estimated that over $1 billion in small-account credit loans would be written in 2018—that is, this year—and that there will be an increase of about 10 per cent in overall loans taken out this year. They know that families can't afford these loans. This legislation takes some small steps to make sure that, in situations where the loans are becoming easier to apply for, with 75 per cent estimated to be online, we need to take action now.


Amongst other important measures, reforms in this bill will prevent payday lenders from facilitating loans with consumers that exceed 10 per cent of the individual's net income and, further, these reforms will prevent lenders from offering loans for household goods that exceed more than 10 per cent of their net income. I welcome the bill into the House because it will crack down on unfair deals which are exploiting vulnerable people. I go further and suggest that we need a national database so that these lenders can be held to account when they give a loan to someone who is already in deep financial stress because they have a payday loan with somebody else.

Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (16:45):  I'd like to start by commending the member for Perth and his staff for championing the small-amount credit contract and consumer lease reforms. The National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Small Amount Credit Contract and Consumer Lease Reforms) Bill will improve the lives of some of our most vulnerable Australians and may very well prevent others becoming trapped in dodgy and shady small-amount credit contracts, or SACCs.


In the Territory, we have had many instances of individuals being ripped off by payday lenders and rent-to-buy operators. In one instance, a payday loan client who borrowed $150 was told within six weeks by a payday lender to repay over $1,000. We also had a Centrelink recipient who had four rent-to-buy payments deducted from her Centrelink payment each fortnight, leaving her with only $50 to feed her family. On top of that, she had a payday lender attempting to withdraw a further $66 repayment each fortnight by direct debit. We've had a case of an age pensioner paying $1,500 for a set of drawers worth $600, and we even had a ridiculous case where a lender charged a $50 dishonour letter fee on top of a $49 payment dishonour fee. We also had the case of Amazing Rentals Pty Ltd in the Northern Territory. In one disturbing instance, a man on Newstart allowance, with English as a third language, could not afford to pay for electricity or food because his lease payments to Amazing Rentals were so high. But for the great work of ASIC and the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency—NAAJA—this organisation would still be operating and ripping off Territorians.


In the Territory, there are 72 remote Indigenous communities where services are coordinated by the NT government, and we also have about 500 homelands in the Territory. The final report of the Review of the small amount credit contracts laws in 2016 noted:


The issue of unsolicited sales (of any products or services) in Indigenous communities has been long recognised as causing significant harm, with these communities targeted as suppliers can make multiple sales in a short period of time with little effort or outlay of capital.


Officers from ASIC's Indigenous Outreach Program have been told of instances where businesses, including rental companies, have given inducements to senior or respected community members to obtain introductions to individuals in the community so that they can make as many sales as possible. That is shameful. They have heard, both firsthand when visiting a community and second-hand through financial counsellors and consumer advocates, of regular instances of this practice being used in numerous communities around Australia. In some instances, unscrupulous lenders are able to operate in these remote communities due to loopholes in current regulations. So, I am very pleased that this bill will prevent door-to-door selling of consumer leases at residential homes and introduces broad anti-avoidance protections to prevent SACC loans and consumer lease providers from circumventing the rules and protections contained in the credit act.


The reforms in this bill aren't groundbreaking or revolutionary. We know that members opposite support the measures—or at least they should, because this bill implements the government's own policy in relation to SACC reforms. I'm sure that we can all agree that strengthening penalties will increase the incentive for SACC providers and lessors to comply with the law and that imposing a cap on the amount that can be paid will protect consumers.


ASIC agrees with the changes. The bill adequately balances the need to protect consumers from harm whilst ensuring that the useful parts of the industry remain viable. We know that there are times when those on low incomes need quick access to cash, and we are not—not!—advocating the total elimination of payday lending. Instead, we are protecting those people from exploitation by predatory lenders. Needless to say, it would be a disgrace if members opposite voted against its implementation when we all know they agree with the changes being proposed. We have a chance to help vulnerable Australians, some of whom are suffering because of payday lenders and small-amount credit contracts, so I urge the government to accept the member for Perth's proposals and pass their own legislation.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (16:51):  This issue is one that is pretty close to my own heart. There are something like seven different payday lenders within 450 metres of the front door of my electorate office. Two of them are in fact right next door to each other. So in great communities like mine, which have a lot of disadvantage, we see a concentration of payday lenders.


I want to commend the work of the member for Perth and the member for Oxley. It's an honour to speak after the member for Solomon, who made some very good points a moment ago in his characteristically eloquent way. This is an important issue. It touches communities like mine and communities right around the country. It treats vulnerable people very poorly, so I appreciate the work not only of the members for Perth and Oxley but of all of my colleagues here.

I do understand that in some cases these loans can play a legitimate role for low-income families in smoothing out some of those unforeseen financial pitfalls.

Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (17:06):  I want to thank the Speaker and the member for Fadden. This motion mentions the 70th anniversary of a very exciting, vital and happy nation of eight million people, but I'm not going to focus on that; I'm going to focus on the main point of the member for Fadden's motion: the sharp contrast with what nearly happened during the Second World War. This was synthesised in a sinister speech delivered at the Berlin Sportpalast on 30 January 1939 by Adolf Hitler. It was an attempted repudiation of President Roosevelt's attempt to deal with aggression throughout the world and to seek some assurances from the German Chancellor.


I want to particularly thank the member for Fadden for his thoughtful taking up of the member for Isaacs' raising of the 80th anniversary of the fateful Evian conference, convened by President Roosevelt in 1938 at Evian-les-Bains in France, with 31 other countries to discuss the plight of refugees fleeing the horror of Nazism. It's an anniversary the member for Fadden has given us an opportunity to atone for. Unfortunately, the representative of Australia at the conference, Lieutenant Colonel TW White, brought a message of indifference to that conference. He didn't go on his own authority; he spoke for the executive government of the day. Australia said it didn't have a racial problem and didn't seek to import one—a grotesque message given the sinister events of the time.


I also want to commend my good friend the member for Eden-Monaro, former Brigadier Mike Kelly, who recounted in his speech little known connections with the Jewish people of Palestine, who were trying to survive the Second World War, and connections with the First World War, including with his extraordinary family. They were amazing stories. I didn't know that David Ben-Gurion, the first Labour Prime Minister of Israel, served under the Australians in the First World War and that Moshe Dayan lost his eye with the Australian machinegun battalion, spotting for the 7th Division as a forward artillery observer in Lebanon in the Second World War.


I focus on the fact that the member for Fadden has organised for the resolution, supported by all sides of the Australian parliament, to be presented to the Israeli museum, Yad Vashem, which is famous throughout the world. It's a memorial museum to the murdered millions of the Second World War. The idea of this resolution was to be presented as a bipartisan, non-partisan repudiation by modern-day Australians of that terrible indifference to our colleagues in the Israeli Knesset and to be placed right next to Colonel White's infamous declaration: 'We don't have a racial problem and we don't seek to import one.' I think nothing could be more thoughtful than this, and I commend the many members who spoke on it in the debate earlier today in the House.


On the weekend I had the joy of celebrating my niece's wedding in Byron Bay to Gil Baker, the grandson of Yossele Baker. I danced with Yossele Baker, the patriarch of the shattered Baker family, who came to Australia after the Second World War. The Baker family is now united with the equally small Danziger family from which I come. My father was one of the refugees who luckily made it to Australia.


Australia's rhetoric prior to the Second World War was a lot worse than its actual actions. Eight thousand refugees from Germany were accepted into this wonderful country. Our two families who survived—indeed flowered—in this extraordinary country are a repudiation of the indifference of Lieutenant Colonel White. My late uncle's firm is responsible for all of the woodwork around us in this very parliament—all the floors, all the parquetry, everything—because he was sent to Schleswig-Holstein by his parents to get him out of Germany to Australia to learn, and he had to have carpentry. All I can say, in response to this resolution is: Am Yisrael Chai.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Wicks
):  There being no further speakers, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.
