"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-09-15,"—I would like to continue, briefly, my comments from last night. I was talking about the various concerns that we have about the government’s proposed amendments in the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009. The Australian Greens position is that we do believe that this bill will offer some improvements on the current citizenship test. I put firmly on the record once again that the citizenship test is something that the Greens have always opposed. We do not believe that the most appropriate way of testing or ascertaining somebody’s allegiance to Australia is by doing a written test. However, we understand that that is the current situation and that this bill does build on the current legislation and improve it somewhat.
We also would like to highlight, briefly, that there were a number of recommendations made by the Australian Citizenship Test Review Committee—on which the amendment that has been put forward by the Greens and circulated in the chamber is based—that have been adopted by the government. But there were a number of other recommendations which the review committee put in their report which have not been adopted by the government. I encourage them to do so. One of the main issues was to ensure that we maintain transparency and appropriate levels of scrutiny over the make-up of the citizenship test. I strongly urge the government to reconsider the recommendation made by the Citizenship Test Review Committee to ensure that all questions are made publicly available, to allow the appropriate scrutiny and discussion around what are appropriate questions to be included in the test.
In summary, our major concerns are with the current wording of the definition of torture and trauma. We understand that the government’s approach is to try to be more inclusive of vulnerable people who are disadvantaged by the way that the test is currently carried out. We understand that, but we believe that the terminology put forward by the government in this amendment bill is not quite clear enough and does not necessarily deal with all of the concerns. We are also concerned that, for people who are listed as sufferers of torture or trauma, and who therefore have an inability to complete the test, that suffering of torture or trauma has to have happened offshore. The legislation does not recognise that there are people who come to Australia on various types of visas. They may be trafficked to Australia as part of the sex trade and they obviously suffer torture and trauma while here in Australia. We would like to ensure that those people are looked after as well.
We are concerned also about the amendment that has been circulated by the government in relation to changes to do with the length of time that somebody needs to be a permanent resident before applying for citizenship—in particular, elite sportspeople. I will take some time during the committee process to question the minister about that. The Greens are not necessarily opposed to the idea, but we would like to see what the evidence is behind needing those amendments, seeing as they were put forward after the committee process. It would have been helpful to have been able to deal with that issue during the committee inquiry. I know that that is the opposition’s view as well. It would have been good to have been able to do that. We were not able to, so I guess in the committee stage we can try and get some more clarity on that issue.
I also stressed last night the issue in relation to minors and removing the ability for somebody under 18 to apply for citizenship without being a permanent resident. I am concerned that that amendment will mean that decisions are not always going to be made in the best interests of the child. That is obviously a concern. We are signatories to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and we need to ensure that decisions are made in the best interests of the child. Many of the migration decisions and visa options put forward for children are not put forward by them, so the ability for the minister to uphold their rights and to act in the best interests of the child I think is an important element we need to maintain. Therefore, the Greens do not support that particular part of this amendment bill. Thank you.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TEST REVIEW AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2009-09-15,"—I stand to speak on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009. I would draw the Senate’s attention to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report just tabled, in September 2009, and in particular the Liberal senators’ comments in that report. I note that the bill was referred to the Senate committee on 25 June, to deliver a report by 7 September.
The bill seeks to amend the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, and we know that it makes changes to the citizenship program which you might consider technical and administrative but are actually very important. The funding for the citizenship program is $123.6 million, provided over five years in the 2007-08 budget, to establish and implement the test. The need for the test has certainly received strong community support. There has been a review of the citizenship test. The Hon. Dick Woolcott headed the Australian Citizenship Test Review Committee, undertaking that review with others and delivered a report, which of course took many months.
I give that as the background, because, just days before the report was tabled by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on September 7, the government introduced amendments to their own amendments. And then, subsequent to that, they introduced further amendments to those amendments. What we have here is a problem for the government in terms of process—in terms of getting their act together to ensure that the parliament, the public and certainly the people in this chamber have a proper opportunity for full and frank discussion to take place with respect to the merits or otherwise of these amendments. Senator Hanson-Young has quite rightly noted on behalf of the Greens the concerns that she has in this respect. She needs time to review those amendments and consider them. Of course she does; all senators should have adequate time to consider and review them. So there is a real problem there.
The government have had time. They had so many months during the Woolcott review, the Australian Citizenship Test Review Committee. The review committee went all around Australia, took submissions, listened to members of the public and delivered their report. The government acted on that report, but subsequent to that they had a knee-jerk reaction and introduced further amendments. I will come to those shortly, but, clearly, the cart has been put before the horse.
The substantive bill, prior to those recent amendments, provides:
… that certain applicants may be eligible for citizenship without sitting the citizenship test if, at the time of application, they have a physical or mental incapacity that is as a result of suffering torture or trauma outside Australia …
Senator Hanson-Young referred to this provision, and the committee report made it very clear that there were concerns, certainly from the Liberal senators’ perspective, about the focus on the torture or trauma being ‘outside Australia’. I will come to that in a minute. The bill also provides:
… that the citizenship test must be successfully completed within a period specified … and
provides that to be eligible for citizenship by conferral, applicants who are under 18 years of age must be permanent residents at both the time of application and the time of decision.
The bill also streamlines the application process so that citizenship testing and citizenship application can take place in one visit to an Immigration office.
The Senate committee had 21 submissions, with a public hearing in Melbourne on 27 August. At this point in time I would like to register my thanks to the committee secretariat for their great support and assistance: Peter Hallahan in particular, Tim Watling, Cassimah Mackay and others in that team. We had some very capable, competent witnesses, including Professor Kim Rubenstein, who sat on the Citizenship Test Review Committee; she provided invaluable advice. We thank her and the other witnesses for their submissions.
Concerns expressed about the bill in the opposition senators’ dissenting report made it very clear that the effort to remove the requirement for a ‘permanent’ physical or mental incapacity was not on. We did not support it, we still do not support it and we note that the government has now amended the bill to substantially accommodate at least the coalition senators’ views, and, I believe, other people’s views, to ensure that that is taken into account.
Concerns were raised at the hearing about the extension of the exemption to one category of people, namely those who had suffered torture and trauma outside Australia, to the exclusion of others—for example, women who have suffered torture and trauma in Australia as a consequence of trafficking. That is a very important issue. In fact, I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, view that with abhorrence. Why should they be excluded because it happened in Australia? The government have tied themselves up in knots by identifying one group only, to the exclusion of others. Even this week we have heard from the Voices for Justice people, who support the Make Poverty History campaign and the Millennium Development Goals, and we know their views with respect to people-trafficking, whether it is in Australia or in another country. They certainly oppose it, as do I, and I know others in this chamber do also.
The methodology suggested by the Citizenship Test Review Committee is simpler and non-discriminatory, and coalition senators suggested in their dissenting report that the review committee’s proposed amendment be adopted, with the addition of the word ‘permanent’. We have an amendment circulating in the chamber, and I know Senator Fierravanti-Wells, during the committee stage of the bill, will prosecute the case to ensure that we get a balanced, fair approach rather than a discriminatory approach, as was listed in the primary amending bill.
What we do support is providing as much assistance as possible to people who perhaps for physical or mental incapacity or whatever other reason are prevented from sitting the standard test. That is set out in our report. For example, the administrator may read aloud the questions and multiple-choice answers, ask the person which answer they think is correct and select on the computer the answer that the person indicates, and an applicant would have 90 minutes to complete the test, double the time allotted for others. So we support extending the assistance available to people to help them pass the test rather than opening up the category to a wider group of people and hence to potential exploitation.
I note the fact that the Hon. Chris Evans, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, provided the amendments to our Senate committee in a letter dated 31 August. As I indicated earlier, we had to deliver our report on 7 September, so there was an entirely insignificant and inadequate amount of time to consider those amendments. There were some four pages of amendments and some seven pages of notes, which obviously had to be considered on their merits. I also note that the government has now amended those amendments, which puts everybody under pressure and makes it challenging and difficult at the very least. So the onus is on the government to outline the urgency of waiving the residency requirements for athletes and other categories. In the ordinary course, the proposed amendments ought to have been open to proper examination and scrutiny by the committee and by groups and organisations wishing to make submissions on them. That will now have to take place in an ad hoc and challenging way.
I will speak very broadly to those amendments. There appear to be two significant additional amendments. One relates to elite athletes. That has been rushed into the bill. The other relates to discounting the residency requirements for citizenship for professionals whose work takes them regularly offshore. With respect to elite athletes and, indeed, non-citizen tennis players currently unable to satisfy residency requirements for citizenship in time for international competitions where they would like to represent Australia, I have to say, frankly, that I am a very keen tennis player, as many senators and members know—I play tennis on a Thursday morning with colleagues to ensure a healthy, active lifestyle in and around Parliament House—and I strongly support Tennis Australia and the work that they do. However, with respect to determining the appropriateness or otherwise of certain tennis players for citizenship purposes, I am at a loss to understand why the government would want to go down the track of picking out Tennis Australia and certain elite athletes and passing an amendment specifically for them.
What is wrong with the ministerial discretion approach, where the minister can take into account the public interest and the circumstances of the person concerned and pass that person in terms of their citizenship test? Why not go down that track and ensure that the minister has that discretion? I think that is a far better and safer way to go. Perhaps there is a workload issue there for the minister, but that is what ministers are for. Particular with respect to immigration, they are to provide the check and balance in the public interest, to determine what is right and wrong, to look at the merits of the case and to make that decision. We can still accommodate the needs of any particular stakeholders or people concerned, so long as that is in the public interest and so long as they meet the relevant requirements of the citizenship test.
We look forward with interest to the committee stage of this bill and to the government fleshing out in further detail the reasons they have introduced not only the initial amendments but the amendments to the amendments. We want to get a good grip on the government’s objectives and to express the coalition’s views in response to them. Again I commend Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her work and effort in prosecuting the case to ensure that we get a balanced approach.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TEST REVIEW AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-09-15,"—Before addressing the specifics of the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009, I wish to make a few comments about the history of the citizenship test. The stated rationale for the introduction of the test was to make sure that new citizens had a good comprehension of the rights and requirements of citizenship, that they had a sound understanding of the application process and that they had a basic knowledge of English. That first test commenced, as I understand it, back in October 2007.
The original testing process was to answer a series of multiple-choice questions which were selected randomly and answered via a computer. This immediately raised issues of fairness around the level of computer literacy of those undertaking the test—in other words, a person may have had a basic ability in English but they may not have had any experience with computers. This is a challenge that is not unique to people new to Australia. Computers can be daunting for many people who are already Australian citizens—such as me!
Other questions were raised about the confidentiality and content of the questions that were included in the test. And, given that the questions were selected randomly, some asked why it was a requirement for the questions to be confidential: surely if this information is so important for all Australians to know, it can hardly be a secret? There was also some public concern that historical and sporting figures and facts were included amongst the list of possible questions. Most notably, the media coverage was quite extensive about questions on Don Bradman’s performance in test cricket. It was in the information booklet, and perhaps the minister can correct me if I am wrong, but I do not think it was actually in the test itself. It may have been alluded to obliquely in one of the test questions, but it did become a focus of public and media concerns.
Due to these concerns the government announced an independent review into the citizenship test and its report was released in August last year. This bill seeks to implement the findings of that review. However, there is much more to the story of this bill than this brief history of it. There has been a debate about the nature of the test and what is the fairest and best process for becoming an Australian citizen. One of the key findings of the review was that there was a need for a greater emphasis on education and the civic responsibilities required of Australian citizens. I welcome the change stipulated in this bill to put the emphasis of testing on the pledge of commitment, while information about the history and lifestyle of Australians has become an important but untested resource provided to test applicants. I also note that the review was critical that there was not enough allowance for those who understood the requirements of citizenship but struggled to retain the English language due to mental incapacity, traumatic experiences or other incapacities. I welcome the spirit of these changes made in this bill, although I am aware of the coalition’s concerns in relation to aspects of these changes.
In relation to these specific changes, the bill firstly seeks to make it easier for certain people who have a mental incapacity due to torture or trauma suffered outside Australia to be eligible to apply for citizenship by not sitting the citizenship test. Secondly, it allows prospective applicants for citizenship by conferral to sit the test at the same time as making the application. Thirdly, it makes arrangements for applicants under 18 years of age who apply for citizenship to be permanent residents both at the time of application and time of decision.
On the whole I think it is fair to say that the main thrust of the bill was supported by all parties. That said, I note the Greens have raised concerns about the definition of torture and trauma used for exemption from the test, the need to include trauma caused within Australia as a criterion and the importance of matching the international standards of the rights of the child when considering conferral. I discussed these with Senator Hanson-Young last night and I am quite persuaded by the arguments she has put forward. I can indicate that I am supportive of the amendments to be moved by the Greens.
The government has also foreshadowed amendments to the bill. These amendments have been the subject of a more concerted interest in the last few days. My office has had consultation with the offices of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and also Senator Fierravanti-Wells over the past few days in relation to these amendments. I would like to thank both the minister’s and Senator Fierravanti-Wells’s offices for their assistance.
The purpose of the government’s most recent amendment is to provide for a reduced period of residence for persons in special circumstances who wish to become Australian citizens. My understanding is that originally these persons included athletes for whom the full residence period would prevent them from qualifying for international sporting events and offshore workers whose work, by its nature, requires them to be away from Australia regularly, such as offshore oil workers or airline staff. The government has argued that without these changes their professional opportunities would be inhibited, making it impossible for those who must travel overseas for work to ever become Australian citizens.
I am aware that the coalition has expressed its concern that these amendments need to be more overtly in the public interest and more transparent. Further, in relation to the access for athletes to shorter qualification periods, I understand the coalition is concerned about any move that may represent ‘medals for citizenship’. In information received by my office this morning, the minister’s office has flagged further amendments to expand the definition from ‘athletes’ to ‘a specialised activity’ and I think that is much better approach. This would broaden the category to other important groups, such as scientists or musicians, who contribute to the public interest in a sense. They have valuable skills that this country would benefit from. I am looking forward to the committee stage in relation to these changes, but I can indicate that I think that broadening the category is a much better approach. I am also looking forward to the committee stage debate on a number of these matters. In relation to the other coalition concerns about the definitions of torture and trauma, as well as the whole issue of permanent or long-term incapacity, I understand that these will be supported and I think that Senator Hanson-Young has a number of amendments in relation to these issues.
I think the public interest test and greater ministerial discretion over decisions will be the main battleground of this bill. My understanding is that the government is concerned that a public interest test would open a floodgate of applications. I note that the minister has shown a disinclination towards greater ministerial discretion on a number of issues. He has set that out clearly in the past and I am sure we will hear more about that in the committee stage. I would like to hear the debate on the issue of the public interest test, along with greater transparency of decision-making processes. In relation to the issue of immigration, citizenship and Australian identity, I think in the past there has been a bit of ideology used, but I think that what the government is seeking to do is, on balance, a good thing and that broadening the categories is the right thing to do. I look forward to having an improved citizenship test process because Australia is one of the countries that has been built by immigration, particularly in the post-war period. Australia really has a proud record of multiculturalism and being welcoming to citizens from all around the world.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TEST REVIEW AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-09-15,"—I wish to thank all the senators for their largely positive contributions to the debate on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Test Review and Other Measures) Bill 2009. I table a replacement explanatory memorandum relating to the bill. The government is very committed to a pathway to Australian citizenship that is robust, involves active learning about citizenship and empowers our new citizens with knowledge of this country, our people, our traditions and our laws. We believe it can play an important role in a migrant’s journey to Australian citizenship.
We also believe that there ought to be pathways for all who seek to join our society and who meet our basic requirements. We do not believe we should place artificial barriers that are unreasonable or unfair in the way of potential citizens. A lot of what this bill is about is making sure that, having seen the experience of the citizenship test, we ensure that there are no false or unfair barriers. I think the Citizenship Test Review Committee did a fantastic job in speaking with the community, analysing their concerns and coming back with recommendations which the government, in large part, have adopted. I think their move to put the pledge of commitment as the centrepiece of our citizenship test provides an intellectual framework that was missing from the previous test. It is a great initiative and that is why the government endorsed it.
We are very keen to get through this bill before question time today, so I will be brief. In this bill we have attempted to respond to the concerns of the committee regarding torture and trauma victims. During the review by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, their attention was drawn to the fact that the bill, as it is currently worded in relation to this provision, may have been inadvertently focused too heavily on incapacities arising from traumatic events only when they have occurred outside Australia. Obviously there are instances of people who have been trafficked et cetera who may require a broader definition.
I hasten to stress that these provisions are designed for a small group of people who might be incapable of meeting the other requirements. It is not envisaged that they will be used for a large group. They are to deal with a specific group that the committee found to be disadvantaged and perhaps incapable of becoming citizens as a result of those requirements. Senator Hanson-Young indicated she would move amendments that I think will address concerns about incapacity arising from traumatic events, where they have may have occurred inside Australia. I think those amendments are worthy, and the government is inclined to support them. As I say, all the measures in the bill and the measures we are taking in relation to the test are designed to ensure that everyone has a pathway to citizenship, that we meet their needs and that they have a knowledge and understanding of the step they are taking.
I want to focus on why the government will today move further amendments to those we moved on 7 September. Effectively, we will do so in response to the debate we have had not in the chamber but around the parliament. I appreciate that Senator Fierravanti-Wells and others have engaged with us on how we might address genuine concerns with how we originally framed those amendments. I understand they may well move further amendments, but I want to stress that this is our response to the concerns they have raised. We think these amendments adequately address those and are in the best format to address them. I am grateful that people have attempted to deal with these issues in a constructive way, and we think the response is constructive in meeting those concerns. We think the bill will be better for the amendments I will move today. Those amendments have come out of suggestions and concerns raised with us as part of the discussions.
On 7 September in response to a number of organisations and individuals the government circulated a draft amendment to this bill. I know there has been some concern about process, but these issues arose more recently and this is a good opportunity to include them in this bill now rather than wait until we get through the whole legislative process again. The amendments seek to introduce a special resident requirement for a small group of people who did not have a pathway to citizenship due to work related travel requirements. While such people remain in those occupations, they will never be able to meet the current residence requirement for Australian citizenship. This issue has been raised with me by a number of members of parliament, including Liberal members of parliament, who have had constituents come to them. I think Ms Julie Bishop raised the issue with me regarding a scientist in the Antarctic. We were able to resolve it. This is an issue where people basically cannot, as a result of their occupation and being out of the country for long periods, get access to citizenship. They are Australian permanent residents—that is, people who have made their lives here. As we know, we live in a global economy now and people work in quite unusual arrangements.
In order to meet the current resident requirement, people who became permanent residents of Australia on or after 1 July 2007 must have been present lawfully in Australia for four years immediately before applying, including for 12 months as a permanent resident immediately before applying. In this period of four years, a person may have had absences from Australia of no more than 12 months, including no more than 90 days in the 12 months immediately before applying. I remind the Senate that these changes were made in July 2007 by the previous government. The changes increased the residency requirement from two years to four years. If you like, what we are dealing with now are some unintended consequences—that is, issues that were not addressed then—and the impact of moving to the higher residency requirement. I do not think any of the changes run counter to the intent of the legislation of 2007, but with the experience of the new act we have come across a range of problems with pathways for people. These amendments seek to address those.
Elite athletes, tennis players and professionals such as international airline pilots and offshore oil rig workers often do not meet the residency requirements for Australian citizenship because they travel extensively outside Australia as part of their employment. Some would say I do not meet the residency requirement to be classed as a West Aussie these days, given the amount of time I spend here. But luckily that is not a formal requirement. I keep my biases, which is the main qualification! Many people in this category have partners who are Australian citizens and children who are Australian citizens and attend Australian schools and it is simply because of their professional travel commitments that they have not become Australian citizens. Their partner and their kids may be Australian citizens, but they are prevented from qualifying. This effectively excludes a cohort of permanent residents who are 100 per cent committed to Australia. We do not believe that the general residency requirement as applied to this group is fair. We think it is an artificial barrier that ought to be fixed.
There are some activities, such as those conducted by elite athletes, which further require them to have Australian citizenship to participate in their chosen activity. There is a lack of a variable pathway to citizenship for people who require citizenship and travel for work related activities. They are particularly disadvantaged by the current residency requirements. People in the special circumstances outlined above will under the proposed amendments: need to have been a permanent resident for two years before their application, with at least six months physically in Australia; require citizenship for a specified activity; and have to have their application supported by a recognised national peak body. Specialist professionals such as oil rig workers and airline pilots will need to: have been lawfully resident in Australia for the four years immediately before applying for Australian citizenship, with at least 16 months physically in Australia; travel extensively in the course of their work; and have their citizenship application supported by their current employer. One person in this category I was approached by was an Emirates pilot. He was unable to qualify because of the nature of his shifts.
All applicants will need to be able to show that, despite spending periods of time overseas, their home is in Australia. They will also need to meet all other legal requirements for citizenship, including sitting and passing the citizenship test. We believe the revamped requirements will create a fairer system for people who, due to circumstances related to their work, are currently ineligible for citizenship.
Since moving those amendments, the Liberal opposition and others have raised with me issues that effectively say the amendments, as currently worded, are defined too narrowly. The effect of this is that the amendments may have excluded some people who require citizenship to engage in particular activities which are of benefit to Australia. Therefore, the government is proposing to introduce the revised provisions, which I have circulated, which seek to provide, in schedule 2 of the bill, for a special residence requirement for (1) people seeking to engage in activities that are of benefit to Australia and (2) certain people engaged in particular kinds of work requiring regular travel outside Australia. This takes away what was an unnecessary focus for the requirement of a person to represent Australia at events, which is one of the concerns the opposition raised, and refocus it on the nature of a person’s activity and the requirement for citizenship to engage in that activity. These amendments, while minor, will give the flexibility to include people, as Senator Xenophon mentioned, who are engaged in activities which are of benefit to Australia, activities which require them to be citizens and to travel extensively outside Australia.
I understand the opposition will be proposing an amendment to give more discretion to the minister in relation to these measures. Effectively, I think that puts us in the same policy space and direction but also in an argument about the best way of doing this. If that is the case, and it seems to be, I would argue that the way we have constructed these amendments in response to those concerns expressed by the opposition is a better legislative solution. Perhaps I will be clear on that during the committee stage when Senator Fierravanti-Wells speaks to the amendments.
We reiterate that the bill is an important advancement on the citizenship provisions. It takes advantage of the experience and the work of the Citizenship Test Review Committee. The amendments which I have moved today seek to address a number of problems which have been raised by sporting organisations—such as the Australian Olympic Committee and Tennis Australia—and by individuals and members of parliament on behalf of those individuals who have been frustrated by the lack of a pathway to citizenship. The fundamental approach and principles behind this bill are to ensure there are pathways for genuine applicants for Australian citizenship, that all those who make a genuine commitment to Australia and are of good character can find a pathway to citizenship and can fully participate in our society. It is not in the nation’s interests to exclude people who would otherwise be good citizens. This amendment bill seeks to address some of those issues and continues to build on what is probably one of the world’s leading pieces of citizenship legislation. Australia has been at the forefront of development of citizenship concepts and legislation and I think this will further enhance that position.

Honourable senators interjecting—
—One moment, Senator Minchin. I cannot hear your question when there is noise on both sides.
—Has the government taken into account the security and position of Telstra’s 30,000 employees, its 1.4 million shareholders—who have today lost $2 million as a result of the government’s announcement—and its nine million customers in reaching its decision to force the breakup of Telstra?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2009-09-15,"—I thank Senator Minchin for his question and for his 150th press release since he became shadow minister. There has not been one policy in the 150. It is an auspicious day today—150 press releases and not one single policy!
The historic reforms that the government will introduce today will fundamentally reform existing telecommunications regulations in the interests of Australian consumers and businesses. They will drive future growth, productivity and innovation across all sectors of the economy.
For years, telecommunications companies, industry experts and the regulator have been calling for fundamental reforms in telecommunications. In the past, these tough decisions have been avoided by governments of both persuasions. Regulatory reform is critical for the future of communications in Australia. It should have been done in the past, a fact acknowledged by the former Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, who on 13 May 2008 conceded that, ‘More thought could have gone into a policy that would have separated the network.’ Senator Helen Coonan said that just last year.
Today, we are delivering historic reforms in Australia’s long-term national interest that will address Telstra’s high level of integration to promote greater competition and consumer benefits; streamline and simplify the competition regime to provide more certain and quicker outcomes for telecommunications companies; strengthen consumer safeguards— (Time expired)

They have a choice about the path they want to take: they can sit on their existing assets—the decrepit, dying, old, copper network—or they can move into the future with the new mobile spectrum and the new applications and technologies that will bring. Telstra have the choice about how they want to proceed—

There was $30 billion in value lost at various points due to the management and leadership of those opposite. The share price when Mr Trujillo left the country was $3.30. Two dollars per share—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! When we have silence on both sides, we will proceed.
—The value of Telstra shares fell from $5.30 to $3.30 under the regime promoted, supported and welcomed by Senator Nick Minchin. When Mr Trujillo left the country, who was the one person in the country who said he had done a fantastic job and that we would miss him? Senator Nick Minchin!

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-09-15,"—I am just reminded that I should be able to remember that! In terms of providing the number of people who have breached I can indicate that any issues around breaching can be serious matters. The Minister for Human Services, whose portfolio this matter falls under, has advised me that Centrelink is currently conducting an investigation into areas where there are issues with the social security system. Investigations are currently underway and it would be inappropriate for me to comment given the serious consequences, including criminal charges, that can follow from those types of investigations.
But, more generally, this government has a zero tolerance approach to social security fraud. In terms of ensuring that those people are dealt with under the social security system, it is appropriate that there are penalties for those people who do not undertake the requirements of the social security system. It is a system that is designed to ensure that those people, such as job seekers, should be looking for employment and, if they are not looking for employment, there is a range of other activities that they can undertake. It is important to keep that in mind when you are talking about the issue of breaching. Breaching usually comes about as a consequence of there having been a failure on behalf of the job seeker to participate in the system. In terms of the precise figures, which Senator Williams is seeking, I will undertake to check with the Minister for Human Services and get back to the senator. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-09-15,"—What I have already indicated is that Centrelink has a responsibility to apply the legislation as stated in the social security law and this includes decisions relating to Newstart allowance. While the government is committed to providing a safety net to those who through no fault of their own cannot support themselves, it is always committed to ensuring that unemployment benefits only go to those people who are genuinely unemployed. In return for financial support, the government expects unemployed people to demonstrate that they are actively looking for work or undertaking activities to improve their employment prospects. In order to qualify for Newstart allowance, a customer must meet a number of requirements, including activity tests. But in terms of providing an answer to the specific question, which goes to a named individual, I will take that on notice.

Centrelink is an organisation that has sufficient resources to deal with a whole range of work activities. They are currently operating in the Northern Territory emergency response. They are currently responding to the bushfire disaster in Victoria with continuing support. Centrelink works to provide Newstart allowance to customers who meet the requirements. They have an activity test, which means that customers must be actively looking for suitable paid work.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-09-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) and the Minister for Climate Change and Water (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senators Minchin, Macdonald and Milne today.
Today the government has announced significant changes to the regulation of telecommunications. I took the opportunity to ask Senator Conroy, as the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, about one of the announcements that he—
—Order! Would senators on my right and my left please move out of the chamber or resume their seats.
—I asked Senator Conroy today about one of the policies that he has announced today as part of his package of telecommunications regulation changes. One of those policies is in fact to propose the forced break up of Telstra, one of Australia’s major corporations, a major employer, and the principal provider of telecommunications in the country today. One of the audacious things among many that Senator Conroy purported to convey to us today was that in fact the government is not proposing to force the break up. No-one believes that proposition. All the financial press today are reporting that the government is proposing the forced break up of Telstra. That is what this government has in fact announced and it has had a dramatic impact on the value of the company already. This announcement of the forced—
—Order! I have asked senators on my right to please leave the chamber or resume their seats. I can understand the whip having to move around, but not everybody else.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President, I appreciate your indulgence. Today’s announcement by the government of its policy of forcing the break-up of Telstra contradicts everything that the government has said, to this point, whether as an opposition or as a government. It certainly contradicts what the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy said as recently as the May estimates and what former spokesmen in this area have said.
The Labor Party never told the Australian people when it went to the last election that after it got elected it would sneak through the forced break-up of Telstra. It has never been Labor policy to propose the forced break-up of Telstra. Indeed, as we all know, it was the Labor Party, when in government back in the early 90s, that actually created Telstra—this company which it now says is too big and too much of a monster and has to be broken up by force of law. This is their creation. At no point since then have they dared to suggest that they would want to see this company broken up by force of law.
The government will, of course, go on pretending that it is not about forcing the break-up, but it is evident from the statement made today that the government intends to hold a cannon—not merely a handgun, but a cannon—to the head of Telstra to force it to behave in the fashion which this Labor government wants to dictate to it. This is a radical and risky policy which the Labor Party has announced today. This is a company which employs 30,000 Australians. This is the Labor Party which professes a concern for employees—there are 30,000 in this company who are now being put at risk by this policy.
There are 1.4 million shareholders. We know the Labor Party totally opposed the sale, but apparently this is the punishment that mums and dads of Australia who bought shares in this company are now having meted out to them by the Labor Party. Today, already, within minutes of the government making this announcement, the mums and dads of Australia who own shares in this company have seen $2 billion wiped off the value of their shares by this government.
This company has nine million customers. This company is critical to the telecommunications infrastructure of Australia, but this risky, radical and careless government is now going to adopt Telstra as its plaything. Why break up this company? Why take all this risk if, indeed, the government is serious about building a national broadband network? The government says that it wants to borrow up to $43 billion to roll out, right across Australia, a whole new optical fibre network—fibre to the premises—to service 90 per cent of Australian homes in order to provide them with a new wholesale-only, fixed-line network to compete with Telstra. If the problem with Telstra is that it is this so-called monopoly—which of course it no longer is—that we cannot have and must break up, why on earth would you do that if you were going to build a $43 billion telecommunications network to compete with it?
The question the government has got to ask today is: why is it undertaking this radical and risky policy if it is serious about building this network? What we see today is the government itself implicitly accepting that its $43 billion NBN is pie in the sky. It knows that this is a radical and risky proposal which it has put on the desk, that it will never be able to raise the money, that this will never be commercially viable and that there are so many questions about this NBN that it simply cannot answer. And the money that is going out the door on this NBN is unbelievable—a CEO being paid $40,000 a week to run a company which has no employees, no revenue, no customers and no nothing!",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1,speech
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2009-09-15,"—I rise to take note and to make the observation that Senator Minchin has made some announcements today himself. One of them related to the relevance of fast broadband when wireless is popular with the Australian population. Labor’s policy provides both for fast broadband and for wireless. One of the things that—
—To whom? Where is your analysis?
—Senator Fisher seeks to interject. Our proposal is very clear. We are going to provide a combination—we will provide fast broadband to as much of the Australian population as we can and, for those who live where we cannot, we will provide wireless. Nothing that the Labor Party is proposing to do—
—Is that a promise?
—Yes, we keep our promises, Senator Fisher. That is what distinguishes the Labor Party from the Liberal Party. We do keep our promises. One of the promises we made to the Australian people at the last election was that we would introduce fast broadband to this country. You did nothing about this issue for the 11 or 12 years that you were in government, but Labor is going to do something about it. We are going to introduce fast broadband to this country.
This is the way of the future. If you have children, you know how important broadband is to them. As soon as they get home at night they race not to the fridge, not to the television, but to the computer. They turn on their computer and turn on the internet. They start facebooking or they start twittering or they start youtubing. Yes, Senator Kroger, this is what they do. This is the future for Australia. We have politicians now, even Mr Turnbull, doing this. The Deputy President will know the Premier of South Australia is a big twitterer. He gets involved in twittering.
—He is a big twit.
—No, he is not a twit. He is a twitterer. There is quite a distinction, Senator Macdonald, between being a twit and twittering, as you ought to know.

Senator Ludwig interjecting—

—As Senator Ludwig points out, he comes from Queensland and he knows a lot more about you, Senator Macdonald, than I do. This is all about the future. The future involves fast broadband. That is not to say that we will not have wireless. Of course we are going to have wireless. Lots of people will have wireless, maybe in Maitland, for example. I do not know whether they get fast broadband over there, but they would like some wireless.
What fast broadband enables you to do is have wireless in your own house. That is what a lot of families do. They connect to ADSL at the moment, but they have a number of laptops. The children, in particular, have laptops at school thanks to our education revolution. They can go home and they can access the computer so they can download their movies, their TV programs or whatever else it is that they might want to do on the internet.
Our fast broadband is going to speed that up. We are going to speed up access on wireless. I am not an expert on this, but I understand that this new fast broadband might be up to 10 times as fast as wireless is able to provide at the moment. In other words, we will still give people the option of having wireless but will enable that at a much faster speed so that people can access whatever they want to do on the internet at a very much faster speed. We are all about choice—not about Work Choices; we know what Work Choices was all about. This is about choice: broadband, wireless and freeing up the system that at the moment is quite restrictive.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2009-09-15,"—I rise to take note of answers given today by Ministers Conroy and Wong, and in particular Minister Conroy’s answer to Senator Minchin when he had the cheek to suggest that the government’s legislation today gives Telstra choice. Minister Conroy had the cheek to suggest that today’s legislation gives Telstra choice to structurally separate or not, or else ‘We’ll do it for you.’ That is the choice: Telstra can choose to cooperate with the government or ‘We will do it for you.’ The government says the only choice left open to Telstra is to cooperate so that the government can, says Minister Conroy, deliver equivalence of access and equivalence of service to the National Broadband Network so that everybody will get the same and nobody will be worse off. That sounds a bit like a promise made elsewhere by this government: no worker will be worse off, no business will be worse off—for example, with its award modernisation program. It is the same sort of promise with the same sorts of underpinnings: no analysis to prove that the promise is deliverable, when there is the same competition between supply and demand.
In saying to Telstra, ‘Choose to cooperate,’ what is the government saying to Telstra’s workers in the face of warnings from the Telstra workers’ union, the CPSU, that Telstra’s workers face competing supply and demand sides of the equation? Is the government really saying to Telstra’s workers, ‘You won’t be worse off through this’? The CPSU says that not only do Telstra’s workers need their award conditions transferred to the government if Telstra structurally separates, in order to ensure that workers are not worse off, but there is a double-sided hit for Telstra’s workers in structural separation, because Telstra’s workers are also Telstra’s shareholders in many cases. So what is the promise that the government is making to Telstra’s workers?
The government and Minister Conroy know this game. Minister Conroy knows why he can have the cheek to suggest that Telstra has a choice—‘choose to cooperate’—because it is the same so-called choice that the government has foisted upon every other participant, every other stakeholder and would-be participant in the National Broadband Network. It is silencing them with the process of having them hope that they will be able to participate in the process. It is saying: choose to cooperate and we will look after you; choose to not cooperate and we will do it without you.
Experts talk about the National Broadband Network as the biggest infrastructure spend ever. Mark McDonnell, an analyst at BBY, said:
… few analysts have been moved to describe it as a rational investment proposal.
When it comes to risk, this is about as high risk as it gets.
… lacking in any measure of financial or commercial rigour.
How does a government get away with no cost benefit analysis for the biggest infrastructure spend ever? There is no cost benefit analysis to show who will want this thing, how they will get it or whether they will be prepared to pay for it. There is no analysis from the government. On the other side of the coin, there is no indication to consumers as to who will get what, when they will get it, where they will get it, how they will get it and what price they will be required to pay for it. No, no—we have a government confident to make promises because it knows it is able to silence the would-be and should-be critics by a supposed choice: choose to cooperate or not.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2009-09-15,"—I am pleased to be able to join this taking note debate today, and particularly to follow Senator Fisher. As a woman in this chamber, it is interesting to note that all four questions asked by the government today were asked by women. I note that only one question asked by the opposition was asked by a woman. In taking note of—
—We don’t have a quota system, though. I got here on merit.
—And so did I. I would like to observe that before taking note. Hopefully, I will get an opportunity to get to the subject of the Traveston Crossing Dam, because I am sure there is plenty to say about that. What a great day this is for communications in this country. I commend Minister Conroy for the work that he has undertaken over the last 18 months or so, his openness to consult, his ability to manage the enormous portfolio responsibilities that he has and his ability to announce historic reforms to telecommunications regulation today.
The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, announced fundamental reforms today to existing telecommunications regulations in the interests—and this is the important thing—of Australian consumers and businesses. The reforms will drive future growth, productivity and innovation across all sectors of the economy by addressing Telstra’s high level of integration to promote greater competition and consumer benefits, by streamlining and simplifying the competition regime to provide more certain and quicker outcomes for telecommunications companies, by strengthening consumer safeguards to ensure service standards are maintained at a high level, and by removing redundant and inefficient regulatory red tape.
I think the important message out of today’s announcement is that consumer safeguards will be strengthened. For a person who comes from rural Australia, that is something that I know my constituency will particularly welcome. We have had difficulty ensuring access by rural, regional and remote Australians to telecommunications generally and broadband and mobile phone services in particular. I am thrilled that our government, the Labor government, has ensured that access to telecommunications services will be a priority wherever you live. I am particularly proud of that.
The universal service obligation requires Telstra as the universal service provider to enable all people in Australia to have reasonable access on an equitable basis to standard telephone services, including payphones. The legislation will strengthen the USO by enabling the minister to specify the standards, terms and conditions of services, connection and repair periods and reliability requirements of the standard telephone service. Telstra will be required to meet new minimum performance benchmarks. Failure by Telstra to meet the requirements will expose it to a civil penalty of up to $10 million.
The legislation—and I welcome this as well—will also include more stringent rules on the removal of payphones and new provisions to allow people concerned about payphone removal to apply to the Australian Communications and Media Authority to direct Telstra not to remove a payphone. Failure to comply with the new rules will expose Telstra to civil penalties or on-the-spot fines.
Unfortunately, I will not be able to get to the Traveston dam issue, but I certainly will listen with interest to Senator Macdonald’s contribution.
In closing, this is a really important day for telecommunications in Australia. We will see a revolution in terms of access to services and the ability of services to be provided, particularly to those who, over the last 10 to 15 years, have been missing out—we know that. Australia’s access to broadband services in particular lags behind and, as a result of it lagging behind, our children, our businesses and our opportunities, particularly for those in rural Australia, have been limited.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-09-15,"—The hypocrisy and mismanagement of the ALP knows no bounds. If they had not stopped the OPEL contract, which was in place at the change of government two years ago, all of the people that Senator McLucas and Senator Farrell talked about benefiting from broadband would have had broadband today. This thing that Senator Conroy has announced today might happen, but I regret to say I probably will not be alive by the time it is in place. We could have all been using it today if it had not been for the Labor Party.
I wanted to draw attention to Senator Wong’s answers, or lack of answers, to the questions over the Traveston Crossing Dam on the Mary River in South-East Queensland, the home of the critically endangered lungfish and the Mary River cod and turtle, all of which could be destroyed as a result of this dam, which the Labor Premier of Queensland is determined to construct. A few months ago, just before the Queensland state election, she promised Queenslanders that it would be delayed for four years—that is, two state election periods—before any work was taken to construct the dam. In another massive breach of trust and promises that this Premier of Queensland is becoming renowned for, she has upgraded the work and has just this week sent to the federal Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts the draft proposals for the Traveston Crossing Dam. She tells Queenslanders every day, ‘The dam will go ahead.’ I do not know how she can be so confident, unless her lobbying, which has been reported in major Queensland and national newspapers in the last couple of days, of the Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, is achieving results. Why else would she spend the time talking to Mr Rudd—in her own words, ‘lobbying’ him—for this dam approval if she did not believe that the close political association between Ms Bligh and Mr Rudd would not bear fruit?
We all know that, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, introduced by my Liberal colleague, former minister Robert Hill, the decision on the dam has to be taken by the environment minister on certain grounds and bases, mainly on the science and environmental aspects. But here is the Queensland Premier talking to the Prime Minister. Can anyone imagine that the time for a decision will come and Mr Garrett will say, ‘Oh, sorry about the lungfish; I’ll stop it’? If he does that the Queensland Labor Premier will stand guilty of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a dam which nobody wants but which she is determined to press ahead with. How is she going to get the approval? If Mr Garrett has an ounce of environmental sensitivity within his body he will refuse the application. The Queensland Premier should know that, but she is circumventing that by approaching the Prime Minister and lobbying him over the dam, as the headline in the Australian says.
I am not one of those conspiracy theorists, but I do wonder how Mr Garrett, when he was head of the Australian Conservation Foundation, and Mr Rudd, when he was a senior adviser to Premier Wayne Goss, worked together to stop the Wolfdene Dam. It is well recognised in Queensland that, if the Labor Party had not stopped the Wolfdene Dam, we would not have had the critical water situation that we have had in South-East Queensland for 10 years. One could be forgiven for thinking that perhaps Mr Rudd and Mr Garrett feel some guilt at having stopped water to South-East Queensland and, for that reason, will roll over and give Anna Bligh what she wants with the Traveston Crossing Dam. I certainly hope that does not happen. I think that we have made it very clear that we on this side—and, on this rare occasion, the Greens agree with us, even though they gave preferences to Ms Bligh to help her win the election, knowing that she would construct a dam—will be watching Mr Garrett very, very closely as he makes his decision on this awful abomination of a proposal for a construction.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,7,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-09-15,"—I wish to take note of an answer given by Senator Wong regarding the Green Loans Program. I want to remind the Senate that the Green Loans Program was announced by the Labor government last year. This was a big opportunity for people to borrow money at no interest in order to implement green initiatives, and this was a good idea. But the good idea has translated into a complete shambles under the so-called oversight of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett. I think that it is time that the government found somebody in the department who can administer this with some degree of competence. I want to outline to the Senate what a complete shambles and mess this is in.
It was announced last year and meant to start in January this year. It did not start in January and was postponed until July, when it finally got under way. Since then, some 800 assessors have gone out and assessed 25,000 households—25,000 assessments have been done by 800 assessors. The contracts for those assessors say that they must be paid within 30 days for the work that they do, but what has happened? They have not been paid within 30 days. That is a breach of their contract. These, too, are members of working families; these, too, deserve to have their money within the 30 days specified in the contract.
But worse than all the talk from the government is the reality of these assessments on the ground. The assessments were made, but then the assessors tried to generate the reports from the assessment. The report is what you needed as a householder to take in your hand to the bank—to the provider of the loan—so that you could get the loan, and not one report has been issued. There have been 25,000 assessments and not one report. And why not? Because the government-designed software has failed—it has got mistakes in it and is generating inaccurate reports. The assessors cannot generate the reports because the software is wrong, and it is still not fixed.
I heard Senator Wong tell the Senate today that it was fixed in late August. Well, that is news to the people out there who are assessing these projects, because they have not been able to generate accurate reports. Minister Wong herself acknowledged that the reason people have not been paid is that the invoices are all wrong. What sort of a shambles is that? Add to that that there was supposed to be an online facility through which the assessors could book the various assessments, but it has failed; it has not happened. They are stuck with a call centre where they have to hang on the phone lines for up to half an hour, in the worst case scenario, in order to be able to register the booking that they are trying to make. Where is the online booking facility? Why has the call centre not got more people in it?
If the government have failed to deliver the online booking facility, they should at least give people the opportunity to get their bookings organised; the government should honour the 30-day contract—if they say they are going to pay, they should pay within 30 days; and, if the software is wrong, the government should get it right. The government promised that the reports would be issued within 10 days of an assessment being completed, and here we are, nearly three months down the track, and there are still no reports.
This matters very much, particularly to people who believed the government when it said that they would get their report in 10 days. After their assessment, expecting to receive their report in 10 days, some of them went and paid a deposit on equipment—on technology—so that, when the green loan came through, they actually had the money to pay for it. The green loans have not come through, and the result is that people have lost their deposits. That is plain wrong, and I am calling today on the government to go back and sort out the green loans. We desperately need them. People want to take this opportunity to borrow money and be able to put in energy-efficient technologies. They want to be able to do it, but this is a complete and utter shambles from the government, overseen by a minister who, clearly, has not taken the time out to get this right.
There has not been one green loan, and it is more than a year since this program was announced. It is time that the government got its act in order, supported the assessors, supported the community and reimbursed those deposits that people have lost. Let us get this program rolled out, make it efficient and, for goodness sake, get some accountability going, because—as it currently stands—this is one big shambles of a program.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2009-09-15,"—It has oft been said that a country that loses control of its borders is no longer a country. It has been said that a country that loses control of its borders loses control of its destiny. I regret to say, standing here in the Senate chamber today, that the Rudd government is rapidly losing control of Australia’s borders. I have no doubt that in this debate there will be attempts by the Labor Party to obfuscate and to hide the real crisis that is appearing on Australia’s doorsteps. There will be much talk about legal and illegal asylum seekers. The Labor Party would have you believe that those who arrive here with a valid visa and then seek asylum are exactly the same as those that arrive here illegally. They are prepared to break the law to get into our country, fleeing countries of safe haven. There is no question that we have been seeing more asylum seekers entering Australia illegally since this government started winding back the policies that served Australia so well.
Once again, it will come as no surprise to you, Mr Deputy President, but it may surprise those who are listening to this broadcast, that once again the Rudd government has broken promises. In an interview just before the last election, on 23 November 2007, the very day before the last federal election, Mr Rudd made a number of promises that have since been broken. In that interview, with representatives of the Australian newspaper, he said we need:
… effective laws, effective detention arrangements, effective deterrent posture vis-a-vis vessels approaching Australian waters.
He said:
You’d turn them back. You cannot have anything that is orderly if you allow people who do not have a lawful visa in this country to roam free.
He was going to turn the boats back. But what he has done is to turn back the clock to a time before 2002 when the Howard government strengthened our border protection laws. He turned back the clock to a time when thousands of people were entering this country illegally. The consequences of his irrational, ill-considered and, quite frankly, cruel policies are there for all of us to see. Since Mr Rudd was elected, 1,464 illegal arrivals have entered Australian territorial waters. In 13 months we have had 31 boats. There is no sign that they are stopping. There is no sign that they are dissuaded at all by our border protection policies. The only sign we have is that they are being encouraged by the winding back of the laws. They are being encouraged to hop into dangerous leaky boats by people smugglers in Indonesia, who are going around saying, ‘We can get you into Australia, life will be better there and you will be out in the community within a couple of months.’
The laws that the Rudd government have wound back—the legislation that it has repealed or changed—go to the very heart of our border security. It scrapped the Pacific solution, which many people did not agree with but which, frankly, offered an extreme deterrent to those who sought to enter our country illegally. It has abolished temporary protection visas. It has abolished the 45-day rule, which was designed to stop rorts of our Medicare and our social security system. The Rudd government has cut the budget for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship by $124 million and it has cut 600 staff over the last 18 months. This is a shameful record. The government has abolished the debt which acted as a deterrent to those who were found to have claimed fraudulently, illegally and without any basis to have refugee status or asylum. It acted as a deterrent for them to try again to get into this country. I am ashamed to say that we are now getting people who were rejected under the Howard government’s legislation from entering this country illegally trying to again enter. Why wouldn’t they? They get put up on Christmas Island. They get fed and clothed. The conditions there are much better than they have perhaps experienced from where they have come.
The Rudd government will have you believe that these people are impoverished and fleeing some sort of persecution. They may have indeed fled persecution from their original domicile or residence, but more often than not they have been through one, two and sometimes three other countries. They have paid along the way thousands—if not tens of thousands—of dollars to get into a leaky boat to come to Australia. Just yesterday I heard from one of the senators on the government benches that these people hopped into these boats and did not actually know where they were going to. They just knew they had to get somewhere safer than a hotel in downtown Jakarta or a village in Indonesia, where their lives are not under threat. They are paying hard cash to cruel people smugglers to get to Australia because they know that when they get here they are going to get a better life. They know they are going to get it because there is very little penalty attached to it.
This government is losing control of the battle against illegal arrivals. As I said, 1,464 people have arrived illegally in this country since the Rudd government started to change the laws. It is a record which no country should be proud of. It is a record that stands in stark contrast to the humanitarian efforts that Australia has typically represented on the world stage in dealing with those people who seek through the appropriate channels genuine humanitarian or refugee assistance. As I understand it, on the refugee scale Australia ranks third in the world in accepting those who are displaced. We had a prudent, effective and very sensible approach to migration and humanitarian assistance to refugees in this country. Every single one of these 1,464 illegal arrivals in this country that is granted asylum, refugee status or permanent residence in Australia is taking the place of those people who seek to do the right thing and are waiting in accordance with the United Nations mandated requirements or are complying with Australia’s own visa and migration requirements. No other conclusion can be drawn by a sensible and considered analysis of what has transpired. This government has changed the laws. It has wound back the clock. As a consequence of this, in less than 13 months, more illegal arrivals have bobbed up in Australian waters than in the previous six years since the Howard government enforced and strengthened the integrity of Australia’s borders.
I jump back to my opening remarks. A country that loses control of its borders is no longer a country. A country that loses control of its borders is no longer in control of its destiny. The very question of the integrity of the future of our nation resides in making our borders strong and secure and in ensuring that we decide who will come to this country and who will be allowed to stay here. It is not humanitarian, fair or equitable, and it is completely unrealistic, to expect that you can soften our borders, you can soften our laws and you can wind back the clock and not be implicitly supporting those who seek to breach our border security. Mark my words: there are people smugglers that are plying their trade up and down the coast, looking for people to arrive in our country and to enter Australian waters illegally. They are making a grotesque profit by putting people’s lives at risk and making promises based on the headlines in the paper which are directly related to the softening of these border protection programs. This is not a question of Australia’s humanitarian efforts. It is not a question of Australia not doing its bit. It is a question of Australia maintaining its integrity and sending a very strong message to people smugglers that Australia is not open for their business. (Time expired)

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-09-15,"—The Rudd Labor government are taking all possible steps to ensure the integrity of our border, but we are certainly winding back some of the more punitive aspects of the Howard government’s border protection policies and its Pacific solution. The Rudd Labor government has taken strong steps since it came into power in 2007 to combat people-smuggling, principally by regional engagement and cooperation, including through the International Organisation for Migration. It has taken significant steps to enhance border protection at both sea and air ports and to ensure that the integrity of our borders are protected.
Where the Rudd Labor government differs from the Howard government is in not assigning blame to the people who come to our border seeking protection. Senator Bernardi referred repeatedly to ‘illegals’. I take exception to that description of people who come to our borders by boat. They are often people who are quite legitimately seeking protection as refugees. I believe it is wrong and extremely misleading to refer to them as ‘illegals’, and it does indeed hark back to the former attitude of border protection and the Pacific solution policy. Senator Bernardi referred to the way that the Rudd government had ended the Pacific solution policy, under which asylum seekers—not ‘illegals’; ‘asylum seekers’—who arrived offshore were processed overseas.
The Rudd government also abolished the temporary protection visa for asylum seekers who arrived unauthorised, which was much hated, and announced reforms to the policy of mandatory immigration detention for unauthorised arrival. The Rudd Labor government has people detained only for as long as necessary to perform initial health, identity and security checks. The checks are in place. The protections are in place. It is just that they are in place in a way that is more humane and that allows for the fact that the people seeking protection on our borders might indeed be trying to seek, as Senator Bernardi said, a better world and a better life. And who amongst the opposition would blame anyone for seeking a better world, a better life?
Many of the people opposite have come from immigrant backgrounds. I do not accuse anyone in the opposition of any racism or prejudice against immigrants, because I know that most if not all of the opposition members, certainly in this place, support what immigrants have done for Australia and the backgrounds they have brought to Australia, which have improved and enhanced life in Australia and the success that Australia has been able to enjoy. But I think that, by overenthusiastically adopting the border protection package and the Pacific solution, the former Liberal government fostered a culture which was harsh and unreasonable in terms of its attitude to asylum seekers in our country.
Nowhere is that clearer than in the attitude towards detention debt. This was a means by which, having allowed people to stay permanently in our country, the then government continued to punish immigrants to our country by allowing the threat of debt to hang over them. This was indeed very difficult for many people. In my office I dealt with several people in exactly this situation. One was an Iraqi citizen who was granted asylum on his arrival. But, after a period of detention, because he had come through Germany and was deemed to have come through another country that might have given him asylum, this person, who was eventually allowed to stay in Australia because of his pre-eminent expertise in chess, was asked to repay a debt totalling just over $150,000. This person, although he immediately got jobs in Australia and participated in the life and culture of Australia, and was very happy to be here, was overshadowed by this enormous debt of $152,000, which he was unable to get waived. He spoke to lawyers through his contacts in the Chess Federation but felt that he could not get married, he could not start his life in Australia with this debt hanging over his head. Through my office I did take his case up, but this poor man felt that he could not make a life at all. Before the Rudd government was able to come in and abolish this detention debt, he declared himself bankrupt and has had to start all over again.
Another person who came to my attention, through the Blackwood Hills Circle of Friends in Adelaide, was a Sri Lankan person who was given a bill of $187,000 for his detention. This person arrived in Australia as an unauthorised air arrival in August 2005. He was granted a bridging visa—removal pending—and released from detention. But in February 2007 this Sri Lankan refugee lodged an application for a permanent protection visa and was granted it in December 2007. Until very recently he was still uncertain as to whether he would have to pay that money back. Even though he had been living in Australia with friends and was prepared to undertake an active part in Australian life, he was nevertheless prevented from fully participating by the, again, enormous debt hanging over his head.
It is clear, even though we still have the opposition claiming that it is not so, that most of those unauthorised arrivals did get refugee status—they were recognised as genuine refugees. Yet some in the opposition continue to propagate the misleading impression that people who have come to Australian shores are illegal refugees who are sent back. It was the Howard government that in fact said to people, ‘Go back home and apply again.’ We heard a senator here today decrying the fact that someone is trying again, when in fact that was something that was encouraged under the Howard government.
In view of the fact—and it has been repeated many times by all parties in this parliament—that we in Australia have benefited from immigration and from the children and grandchildren of the immigrants that we have seen in this country, it is hard for those of us who do believe strongly in the value of immigration, and those immigrants who take up citizenship, to see people in this place still decrying immigration. Governments in America, in Europe, in countries such as Italy and Greece and even in little Malta would laugh at the hysterical reaction to increasing numbers of people coming to Australia given the many, many thousands more people that they see coming to their shores.
The minister has said, and it is demonstrably true, that the latest wave of people seeking asylum in Australia is part of an international trend. These trends will continue from time to time, depending on what is happening around the world. Countries around the world have noticed an increase in people seeking asylum and people taking the most extreme measures to seek asylum, including coming to Australia by boat. The latest figures are not extreme at all. In 1999, there were 86 boat arrivals in Australia. We have something like a third of that number at the moment. It might increase or it might decrease. But we should not condone again the hysterical reaction of the government to that increase that saw the border protection policy and the Pacific solution. It demeans our country and it demeans the contribution of immigrants to this country. To call anyone who seeks asylum in this country an ‘illegal’ and talk again about queue-jumping is going back in time. It is a place that most people in Australia do not want to see us go back to. That is not the place that we want to go back to. I think that has been demonstrated very clearly by the general public reaction to the Rudd Labor government’s policies.
In the last few minutes I want to talk a little bit more about citizenship. I also want to congratulate the minister on the proposed changes to the citizenship laws. Once we do accept immigrants to this country we should encourage people to take out citizenship. That is something that we probably did not do enough in the wave of citizenship that came through after the Second World War. Clearly a number of people did take up citizenship and proved to be very valuable citizens. They did not have to pass through the hoops that were put in place, such as citizenship testing and English testing, in order to become citizens. We have measures in place now and I do support education in civic responsibility and in what it means to be an Australian citizen.
I am very pleased to see some changing in the period of time that permanent residents have to be in Australia before they are allowed to take up citizenship. I have one case that I am pursuing at the moment where a person is an actor and model and is out of Australia fairly frequently. He is clearly a successful person in modelling and gets contracts overseas fairly regularly. He has so far been prevented from taking out citizenship, even though he has an Australian wife and has been living in Australia as a permanent resident for eight years. I think that sort of case illustrates that we must not complicate our systems too much otherwise we miss out on accepting as citizens people who are going to be very valuable to our country. It is not only those persons themselves; it is their children and grandchildren. I do not need to repeat the stories of the immigrants and their children and grandchildren who have been extremely valuable to our country even when they have not completely complied with the rules when they have come here. Even back in the immigration wave after the Second World War people lied about where they came from and lied about their religion in order to get to Australia to have the better world and the better life Senator Cory Bernardi referred to. I do not think anyone would now complain about that wave of immigration after the Second World War because many of us—not me but many others in this parliament—are children or grandchildren of that wave of immigrants. But I think all of us value the contribution that those people made to Australia and I am sure we will value future contributions by migrants.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Border Security</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-09-15,"—I cannot believe that we are back here discussing this issue of asylum seekers. The coalition moved a matter of public importance very similar to this only six months ago. They tried their very best to whip up fear, to whip up hysteria around refugees—desperate people seeking protection, seeking freedom, seeking our assistance. I just cannot get over how out of touch the opposition are on this issue. We have come so far. We have come out of the dark days; out of the dark old ages where we saw children locked in detention centres in the middle of the desert, where we saw young people so desperate for somebody to listen to them, for someone to see their desperation that they sewed their lips together. So dark were these days that people were so desperate that they did have to come on boats to seek our protection.
What has changed is government policy. What has changed is the will of the community and the belief in the community that we need to have compassion. What has not changed is people around the world still needing protection, people still fleeing persecution and war. In fact, we have seen an increase of that over the last few years, which obviously adds to the increase of people knocking on our door and asking for our protection.
It staggers me that the opposition want to continue to drag out these issues when we know that the Australian community will not stand for it, when we actually want to be a country of the fair go, when we want to be a nation that prides itself on compassion, on human rights, on justice. Yet clearly the opposition must be feeling so irrelevant in their position that the only thing that they can do to make themselves feel good, to add to their own self-assurance, is to attack those who are more vulnerable than themselves. That is what today’s debate is about; they are trying to make themselves feel a bit better. It is like the grumpy kid in the schoolyard, not having many friends anymore and thinking: ‘What will I do? I’ll go and pick on the small guy.’ That is exactly what the opposition are doing today. It is disgusting. It is gross. It is absolutely disgusting.
A term like ‘illegals’ is absolutely offensive. Not only is it offensive but it is completely inaccurate. It is actually not illegal to seek asylum in Australia. Australia has signed the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees that says people can seek asylum, it is not illegal and they should have their claims processed. They should not be demonised and they should not be punished for their mode of arrival or the claim that they are making. As a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention this is something that Australia pledged to do; that we would act in the best interest of the global community and help those people who are seeking protection, knowing that we are pretty lucky here in Australia. We have a safe and stable country, and, despite the antics in our chambers of parliament, we actually get along quite well. Why would we not have a responsibility to share that with people who are vulnerable, who deserve our protection and who deserve that type of freedom as well? It is not illegal to seek asylum in Australia. I am getting sick and tired of hearing various voices from the coalition benches referring to innocent asylum seekers as ‘illegals’.
I do not know how many times this has been raised over and over again by members of the Australian Greens, members of the government, as well as various experts in the field, that advocating for harsher immigration policies—as the opposition tends to do, and this is becoming more frequent of late—does not stop desperate people fleeing war and persecution. Desperate people will seek freedom. Desperate people will do what it takes to ensure that they can give their children the best life possible. If that means jumping on a boat with some hope and desire that they will give their children a better future, that is what they will do. Members in this chamber need to have a good long think about what they would do in their position; if they had no other choice to give their children a future. Would you really care whether Australia had some policy written up on its website that said that it will charge you a debt for your immigration detention? No, of course not. It does not work like that. Desperate and vulnerable people fleeing war and persecution will do what it takes to give their children the best chance at life. Frankly, so they should. Every parent should do what it takes to give their child the best life possible. They should not be demonised for it. They should not be blamed for it.
This whole idea of whipping up fear and scaremongering and hysteria around the recent boat arrivals takes us back to the days when we used to lock children in detention in the middle of the desert. We know that is wrong. Let us not go back there. Let us not allow ourselves, as parliamentarians—as representatives of an amazing democratic country where we do have safety, where we do have stability—to debate these silly ideas of hysteria about something that is actually not there. Australia takes in hardly any refugees in comparison to comparable countries such as Canada. In fact, we have a responsibility to help those people who do apply. We should not be blaming innocent people for seeking protection.
It is fair to say that on all sides of politics we can agree that the people-smuggling trade is an appalling way to exploit innocent people who are in a desperate situation. The point at which we differ is at the role that Australia should be taking; it is not to punish those innocent people who have sought protection through those services but to help to combat the global rise of numbers of asylum seekers fleeing their homelands in search of a safe and peaceful environment.
That is where we should be expending our energies, not on punishing those people who arrive in Australian waters by boat. So the question I put to Senator Bernardi is: given what you say, Moses was a people smuggler by your definition but do we demonise him? Do we say that Moses was the lowest form of vile? No, of course we do not. We understand that desperate people do desperate things in order to seek protection and freedom. Australia has a really important role to play but we need to make sure we play the right role in helping to ease the numbers of asylum seekers around the world. As one of the wealthiest nations in our region, we need to provide positive support and not put our energies into whipping up fear and hatred. Instead of spending millions of dollars on pushing people back from our borders, we need to be thinking of innovative ways to create a safer, more humane pathway by which people can seek asylum. Simply demonising innocent people who are arriving in Australian waters by boat does not do that. It is simply for political gain.
It is time that some members in this chamber and in the other place stopped peddling a myth of fear around asylum seekers. We all need to recognise that the exploitation of innocent people through the trade of people-smuggling is not to be encouraged and that what we need to be doing is encouraging our neighbours, such as Indonesia, to sign the UN convention on the status of refugees, which would then allow them to recognise the need for these people to be protected. We need to be working with our neighbours to do these things, not simply pushing boats back and saying it is somebody else’s problem. If we espouse to be leaders in the global community, we need to take some responsibility for helping those desperate people around the world as well. Simply pushing them back out to sea and saying it is not our problem is just not good enough.
Language such as ‘queue jumpers’ and ‘illegal entrants’ whips up an unnecessary storm over those seeking asylum in Australia. Surely all of us here can recognise that when you are fleeing persecution or a war ravaged country you may not have the necessary means to apply for a visa to arrive in Australia lawfully. People who are desperate enough to jump on a boat in the vain hope of protection and safety for their children are not in a position to put in an application and wait year after year after year for a response. That is not the way it works. In fact, if some members of the opposition believe that is the way it is, I suggest that they take some study leave and go off to spend a few weeks in Afghanistan.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Border Security</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2009-09-15,"—I rise to speak to the matter of public importance, namely ‘the Rudd government’s inability to manage Australia’s border security’. There have been a couple of contributions to this debate today which I have found to be somewhat startling, and I will get to those in a moment. Clearly we have seen an increase in the numbers of people principally leaving ports in Indonesia and travelling to Australia. We know this is because there has been a change in policies by the current government. I remember Senator Hurley, in her contribution, saying that the government she represents was winding back policies that somehow were offensive. I would like to put that in another way. They are winding back policies that worked and prevented people from taking risks and putting their families’ lives at risk. That is not just an emotive statement. We know that many people have lost their lives. Many more that we would not even know of have lost their lives. All we know is that they have left port and simply not arrived in Australia. So those policies ensured that we minimised the opportunity of those people making that voyage. In fact, Senator Wong acknowledged in April this year that a range of asylum seekers from Afghanistan ‘intercepted in the last few days’ had left Afghanistan in the days of the Howard government.
That is the case, and I think it is important to reflect on the situation in Indonesia around that time. I remember hearing an interview with a refugee who was in Indonesia. He had been there for a number of years. He was bemoaning the fact that he had been assessed by the UNHCR, which was sponsored and paid for by the Australian government at the time to be able to assess individuals over there. He said it was taking so long that if it were possible to go to Australia directly by boat he would have done so. In the interview, they said, ‘Why haven’t you done so?’ He said, ‘Well, there are no boats going.’ The reason there were no boats going was of course the Pacific solution, and the outcome was not the outcome that the people smugglers desired as it had a real impact on the opportunities to traffic in human misery.
According to the UNHCR’s annual global trends, there are about 16 million refugees and asylum seekers around the world. As most people in this place have reflected, and nobody would disagree, many of those people are in dire circumstances. But we have had a lot of emotive discussion today about the circumstances as to whether someone is arriving lawfully or otherwise and whether or not they are queue jumpers. I think this is the most important aspect of this debate. Whilst the Greens senator who spoke previously has said that obviously we in this country are pretty small minded and small hearted, I note that per capita we take the second highest number of humanitarian refugees in the world. But the most important point is that, somehow, we are cruel.
Take people arriving by boat—for each person on that boat who will go through the process of seeking permanent residency in Australia and get it, one person will come off the humanitarian aid list. Let me talk for a moment about the sort of people who are on that list. People say there is no queue. Well, there is a queue and it is characterised by people from the Horn of Africa who have lived in a refugee camp for the last five or six years. One of them would be a woman whose day or month gets better because another one of her children dies and that is one mouth less to feed. People in those sorts of circumstances are the very highest priority and it is the responsibility of this government to prioritise who comes to this country. I think it is laughable to suggest that it be otherwise for those who come to this country in a vessel. Let me tell you that the convention of 1951 says that people shall seek refuge in the first country that they go to—so you do not leave Afghanistan and get on a plane to fly to Malaysia, then get on a ferry to get to Jakarta and then seek a fishing vessel to travel to Australia. If the very first place that you went to you were safe, that is what the convention encourages. It says that we do not encourage people to forum shop.
But for those on the other side who say we are all mean hearted on this side, just remember it is about two principal things: we do not want people to put their lives and their families’ lives at risk, and we also think that it is so important that we prioritise those 13,000-plus people who come to this country as humanitarian refugees as those who are in the most in need. And if you can envisage for a moment those circumstances, the worst possible circumstances, compared to somebody in a family who decides: ‘I can afford it. I’m going to leave. I’m safe now in another country, and in fact I travelled through several safe countries.’ Those are the sorts of issues that do need to be discouraged, and I do not think it is reasonable or fair to describe the coalition as people who are heartless and have not thought about those things.
There is a whole suite of scientific indicators that said back in 2000 that we had some 4,000 refugees. The previous government acted strongly to provide disincentives to those who wanted to come and forum shop and come around the long way to come here. We did that because we thought the people who were in refugee camps, particularly in the Horn of Africa and other places, were such a priority that they were the people who needed the most help, and so we helped those most in need. It made sense, and it was with a wide and Australian heart that we took that focused decision.
Of course as soon as those opposite came in they changed the policies. They said: ‘We’re abolishing the Pacific solution. In other words we’ll ignore the convention of 1951 and we’ll provide an end-game or an end-stop, so you can forum shop and you can come to Australia and we’ll hold you in Australia.’ Those numbers are increasing, but let me tell those who are listening: for every single person who comes that way, there is somebody in the most heinous circumstances in a refugee camp somewhere who does not come to Australia and does not get the help or the opportunities that they deserve. So all of the rhetoric from the other side about how heartless the coalition is is absolute rubbish, and it detracts from the facts of the matter—that is, that at the heart of the coalition’s policy it ensures that those most in need are helped.
Their principal policies abolished the Pacific Solution, they abolished the TPVs and they ended by returning the boats—we actually go back and pull them forward. We actually go and give them a hand to bring them in. Well that has increased the numbers of people who come to this country in a way that the convention never envisaged and never encouraged. And so the coalition stands proudly behind its policy of ensuring that those most in need of humanitarian aid get the opportunity to come to this country. (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2009-09-15,"—I rise to make a contribution to Senator Parry’s MPI too. The only thing that all members of this chamber could agree on is that this issue is very emotive. But it does sadden me to witness what happens on that side of the chamber when they get bored during general business. We have seen it; we have seen it for the last 12 or 18 months. They bring on MPIs about the reckless spending of the Rudd government on our stimulus packages. How reckless we were! We should be condemned because we took the initiative. We should be condemned because we tried to save jobs. We should be condemned because on Treasury figures 200,000—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, to that lot over there—Australian jobs were saved. Week in, week out what do the hapless, leaderless opposition do over there with the assistance of the doormats? I tell you what they do: they bring up these nonsense MPIs—an absolutely ridiculous waste of the Senate’s precious time—to talk about us.
And then you know what happened? Out came the surveys. The majority of Australians supported the Rudd government’s decisive and quick action on our stimulus spending and saving jobs. So what do they do next? They sit there and they think, ‘The former member’—I am sorry, that was a Freudian slip: she is still the member for Curtin, but is the former opposition Treasurer. Her view of the world when the global financial crisis was confronting us was, ‘Let’s sit on our hands and see what happens first.’ Great policy. What do they do on that side? Move her aside. Then they bring out the big guns: Mr Turnbull and Mr Hockey. They say we should be backing off. That has all gone quiet now because they have egg over their faces. And if I can use Senator Boswell’s terminology, they have egg over their faces from head to toe. No answer? No, that is right. Sorry I had to remind you, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President.
So the next attack comes in the form of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, Mr Turnbull, saying to the crew over there: ‘Look, we’ve really absolutely stuffed that up. Let’s talk about individual contracts. That’s it! We’ll deflect the wonderful job that the Rudd Labor government’s doing on stimulus spending and saving jobs and saving the economy. We’ll talk about Work Choices. No, we won’t call it Work Choices. Sorry. Let’s not call it Work Choices. I think I mentioned Work Choices, but I think we got away with it. Let’s just call it workplace flexibility individual contracts.’ That lasted about three or four days. What a spectacular crash that was! ‘What do we do next?’ I would love to be a fly on the wall in the opposition party room. It must be like a scene from Sesame Street. ‘What happens next? Hello, let’s tug on the next emotive issue we can raise because we have absolutely mucked up our attack on the Rudd Labor government’s stimulus spending packages. We’ve absolutely mucked up again. Oops-a-daisy, we’ve mentioned individual workplace agreements and that didn’t work, so let’s yank on the Tampa chain; let’s have a grab at that.’
I will come to the MPI, but I do want to make my contribution as a first generation Australian. My parents are from war-torn Europe. They had the opportunity to come to Australia—they did not know each other; they met over here—to give not only themselves the opportunity for a wonderful life, but to also bring their children up in what I would say is God’s greatest country on this earth. What if we had those same views back then? While I am on it, I just want to keep touching on the opposition’s claims of policies, because there is so much emotion, but there are so many untruths.
I think Australia is a fantastic country. There is room for all of us, but there must be procedures. We agree with that. But let us look at where these asylum seekers are coming from. Through 2009, 1,181 of these irregular maritime arrivals—IMAs—have arrived in 22 vessels. In 2008, there were 161 arriving in seven vessels. Let us compare that with other countries around the world. I have figures here from 2008 which say that in Greece alone there were 15,300 IMAs. In Italy, there were 36,000. Remember that this year so far we have had 1,181—I am not detracting from that. In Spain, there were 13,400. One could argue that Greece, Italy and Spain would be wonderful places to relocate, if it were possible. So would Australia. We have to start using some sensibility in this argument. Those three countries are closer to where the majority of these asylum seekers are coming from.
Let us look at where they are coming from. It has been mentioned, but I would like to take the opportunity to reiterate for those opposite. I have a list here of where they are all coming from. There are Afghans, Iranians, Sri Lankans, Afghans, Iraqis, Iraqis, Afghans, Iranians, Sri Lankans—the list goes on and on. We know why these people are desperately trying to leave these war torn countries. Senator Scullion makes a good point: there are other war torn countries around the world. It is a lot easier to get to Australia by land-hopping through Asia, as we all know, than it is to jump on a rickety boat out of Africa and take your chances crossing the Indian Ocean. That must not go unchallenged.
It brings me to the opposition’s claims. Time is against me, unfortunately, because I would love the opportunity to spend most of my time on this, but I am constrained. These are the opposition’s claims. I opened the Saturday paper and read this. I could not believe it.  I thought, ‘No, I must still be in bed dreaming.’ Unfortunately, I was not; I was awake. Dr Stone, the opposition spokesperson on immigration and the member for Murray, had used some wonderful mathematics. She started doing a few calculations and thought: ‘Right, this is the latest scare tactic. This will get Australians jumping up and down. Let me throw out this ridiculous statement.’ She did. She got a run. That is fine. I think it just denigrates her position even more, but that is just my opinion. She said that Australia will be the recipient of 8,000 to 10,000 IMAs each year in coming years. She just used the figures for how many had come for a couple of months and then multiplied that by the number of months that were left and that is the figure she came to. That was on 13 September.
The opposition have no policy. I am very, very happy to have the debate. If they have a policy, I invite them to jump up and come on the attack. I will take any interjection. As I thought—silence. It is just political expediency. We must clarify where the coalition has been. I did not interrupt the other speakers. I let them go. I had the view, ‘Make sure they get it out and then I can have my turn to correct the record.’ In December 2007—I know that seems a long time ago but it was not that long ago; it was only one month after Australians decided to change their government—they did not oppose the closure of the Pacific solution. The silence is deafening. In August 2008, the opposition did not seek to disallow regulations which abolished temporary protection visas. They are on their high horse. There is nothing else to frighten the Australian public about, but the mistruths cannot go unchallenged. Dr Stone, the shadow spokesperson on immigration, supported in December 2008 the detention policy through the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. She supported Labor’s detention policy. Only now do the coalition have a problem. Despite the decisions they made in December 2007, the decisions they made in August 2008 and the detention policies they supported through the Joint Standing Committee on Migration in December 2008, all of a sudden today the coalition have a problem. Where were they two years ago? They were silent. I can understand why.
It is in their DNA. It is etched in their DNA—deflect at any opportunity. If the government is doing something that is good for Australia or good for future Australians, deflect. Bring out the fears. We have seen it all before: workplace relations, the attack on our stimulus spending and now good old-fashioned race—yank that chain. Unfortunately, the coalition are playing politics. They are not good at it, but they are playing politics by blaming Labor’s policies for the five tragic deaths resulting from the boat explosion in April. Fortunately, they were rebuked by Mr Turnbull. There is some leadership there. But here is a classic claim for my last 20-odd seconds—this is fair dinkum; I am not joshing you here. There was a claim that there was a link between asylum seekers and swine flu—asylum seekers from the Middle East and swine flu from Mexico. I do not know how that claim came about. Maybe the person on the opposition who made that claim had just eaten a worm out of the tequila bottle, I do not know. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Border Security</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2009-09-15,"—Senator Sterle said that today’s matter of public importance on the inability of the Rudd Labor government to protect Australia’s border security is a waste of time. Senator Sterle sees it as a waste of time discussing Australia’s border security. Senator Sterle, I will remind you that all serious policymakers—and you will certainly never be mistaken as one—know that a fundamental responsibility of a federal government is to ensure the security of its nation. Therefore, ensuring that Australia’s borders are properly protected is a fundamental responsibility of the current government. It is a fundamental responsibility which Labor is failing at. However, what the current government is very, very good at is spin over substance. How do we know that? Last week, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in answer to a question without notice regarding whether Rudd Labor’s new border protection policies were actually working, said yes. The minister’s answer was:
The Rudd Labor government remains absolutely committed to strong border security measures.
With the evidence that is now before us in relation to the increase in unlawful arrivals, that answer demonstrates to all Australians just how out of touch with reality the Labor government is. I ask as part of this debate today: which part of ‘Labor has gone soft on border protection’ doesn’t the minister understand? Which part of ‘Labor is unable to manage Australia’s border security’ does the minister just not get? Is it the part where the evidence shows that Labor’s softer border protection measures have given the green light to people smugglers? Maybe it is the fact that, as at 13 September 2009, 31 new boats and 1,456 new asylum seekers have attempted to enter Australia illegally since August 2008. What is the minister’s response to this in question time? He pathetically tries to make light of the fact that the opposition has called for an urgent inquiry into the effect of the government’s immigration policies on people-smuggling. This is what the minister said:
We are not proposing an inquiry because we are proposing to continue strong action to try and combat people-smuggling. We are absolutely committed to the task at hand.
The only task at hand that the Labor government is committed to is to systematically and deliberately unravel the suite of measures that the Howard government put in place over time that collectively gave Australia strong border protection.
Why has the coalition called for an urgent inquiry? Because, based on last week’s rate of unlawful arrivals, we could see between 8,000 and 10,000 people attempting to enter Australia unlawfully in one year.

Senator Sterle interjecting—

—Senator Sterle laughs at those figures, but those people are being exploited by the people smugglers to whom you, with your policies, have given the green light, and that is absolutely shameful. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship last Thursday during question time also said that boat arrivals are ‘an ongoing problem for Australia’. Without doubt, on that point he is correct.
I will get to Mr Rudd’s evidence based policy shortly, but let us get the facts straight. The increase in the number of unlawful arrivals is only a problem for Australians because of the Labor government’s soft border protection policies. The facts speak for themselves. Under the Howard government Australia sent a strong, consistent message to people smugglers: our doors are closed to unlawful people. The weakening, though, of the immigration policy by the Labor government has encouraged the biggest surge in people-smuggling since 2001 and 2002. In fact, after the Howard government put in place strong border protection measures, how many boats arrived in Australia between 2002-03 and 2004-05? None.
The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship raised an interesting statistic yesterday. He said, ‘But hold on, we need to look back at the figures from 2001 and 2002, when we had some 4,137 people arrive illegally here in the first year and 1,212 in the second year,’ and the minister is right. But, based on that evidence—because we know the Labor Party love evidence based policy—the Howard government took steps to put in place policies that would ensure that people smugglers were not able to ply their despicable trade. What did we have as a result of the strong policies implemented by the Howard government? The number of people trying to come here unlawfully went down to zero.
Unlike Senator Sterle, unlike the Labor Party, the Howard government recognised that the most fundamental responsibility of a federal government is to ensure the security of the nation and its people, and it took effective steps to ensure that it discharged its responsibility. Mr Rudd keeps telling the Australian people he is committed to evidence based policy. Well, Mr Rudd, here is some evidence for you in relation to the unlawful arrivals into Australian waters and onshore since your Labor government was elected. Thirty-one boats have been intercepted. I have here pages and pages setting out the number of people who have arrived in this country unlawfully. If you want evidence, there it is, and the evidence supports your inability to manage Australia’s border security. (Time expired)

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-09-15,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document on pension reform.
I am concerned that, throughout the ministerial statement today on delivering pension reform, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs continues to refer simply to pensioners. This might be taken to imply that all pensioners were included in these changes, when this of course is not the case. There is one very important group of pensioners who were deliberately excluded from these reforms: single parent pensioners. The Australian Greens welcomed the move to increase the base rate of the age pension and a range of other pensions by $32.49 per week for singles and $10.14 for couples. The Greens have been campaigning for a number of years on the inadequacy of pension payments in the face of the rising cost of living and other costs and welcomed the increase in the pension rate as an important step in the right direction.
The increase announced by the minister to the base pension rate includes some, but not all, disability support pensions as well as carers pensions and veteran widows and wives pensions. It does not include the single parent pension and it also excludes disability support pensioners who are under 21 and do not have dependent children. That these groups were excluded from an increase in the base pension rate, which was designed to deal with the rising cost of living, makes absolutely no sense to us as these groups face exactly the same cost of living pressures—greater pressures, in fact, in the case of single parents, who have several mouths to feed and growing children. It does not extend to those on unemployment benefits, which includes those single parent families with school age children, who were forced onto Newstart under the previous government’s punitive Welfare to Work regime.
In the ministerial statement, the minister shared with us a heartbreaking story about an age pensioner living on vegetable scraps and noodle soup. While increasing the base rate of the age pension may now help out this particular pensioner, which of course we are very pleased about, you have to wonder: are unemployed Australians struggling to get by with even less income support, now to the tune of around $106 less per week, any less deserving than these age pensioners? What about the plight of children growing up in single parent families who are excluded from the increase in the rates of the other pensions? Not only will they suffer poor nutrition, which of course will impact their health and wellbeing in exactly the same way as it does age pensioners; they will also suffer long-term developmental impacts, reducing their prospects in life and increasing the risk of chronic long-term health problems. The Greens remain extremely concerned that these groups have been excluded from the pension rise for no valid reason and that the disparity in the different types of income support payments continues to grow.
This measure arguably represents one of the most significant changes to Australia’s social security safety net since the Whitlam era. For the first time in our history, we have a Labor government deliberately making a distinction between types of pensioners. On the one hand, we have a group, including those on the age pension, who are finally receiving a deserved significant increase. On the other hand, we have those on the single parent pension and younger disability support pensioners who will not receive this increase. There is no credible rationale at all for this distinction. On the face of it, the only reason could be that perhaps we have the deserving poor and then another group of undeserving poor. No evidence has been presented that the impacts of the cost of living are greater for one group than for another—none. There is no justification for why one group gets it and one does not.
If current pension rates cannot adequately sustain a single age pensioner, which, of course, they clearly do not, how is it that the government thinks that those on sole pensions trying to raise children or unemployed people will be able to get by on even less? The minister uses quite legitimate examples to show what impacts the costs of living have on age pensioners, but it seems those costs of living do not apply to those trying to raise children on a single pension. I suspect and I hope that some of my colleagues in the government can see and are uneasy about this one-sided reform. I know that many people in society share our concern about these inequitable changes to pensions.
I will say it again so no-one is under any illusions: the Greens strongly support and always have supported the increase in the age pension. But we absolutely reject any justification for the fact that that increase was not delivered to single parents, who are raising the next generation of Australians. You will have nearly one million people living in poverty because they have not been granted that increase. Then you will have the people trying to survive on Newstart who are struggling on even less than single parents receive. How is that fair in a so-called equitable and fair society? It is not. A lot more work needs to be done to improve our income support and pension system. We need ongoing pension reform so that those left behind in these last increases are included in further reforms. These reforms represent the introduction of significant structural changes and we need further reforms.
The government has attempted to argue that there was an opportunity for consultation around these increases—or an increase in one case and not in another. There was no consultation in that process. There was no consultation on the issue of only delivering the pension reforms to one group of people and not another. The government claims that that was done through the Harmer pension review and the Henry review of retirement incomes and that these reforms were based on the findings of those inquiries. However, both of those inquiries had narrow terms of reference. They did not include the social security system as a whole, so the government cannot use those reviews to justify the fact that whole groups of people were left out of the reform process. It did not look at the impacts of the cost-of-living pressures on other groups on income support, including single parents and unemployed people.
We are now seeing a significant change to our social security system where, as I said, we are moving away from the base rate of pension being delivered to all pensioners and towards an approach where there is a deserving group and an undeserving group. Not only did the government not increase the pension for single parents; they also changed the family tax benefit A and B rates, which also have a significant impact on single parents trying to raise children.
These people need our support. These children who will be growing up in poverty need the support of a just and equitable society. Unfortunately, they are not getting it. The Greens are extremely concerned about the plight of the 600,000 or more children growing up in 360,000 single parent homes. As I said, that is nearly one million people who will be living in poverty and moving further down the poverty ladder because they simply cannot meet the increasing cost of living.
At least 20,000 other single-parent families have been moved onto the Newstart allowance under Welfare to Work. These people have also been excluded from these pension increases. I ask the government: how do they think this policy is consistent with their policy agenda of social inclusion? It is complete anathema to social inclusion.
Then there are the issues around Newstart, which, as I said, is now $106 less per week than the single age pension. This was designed as a short-term payment for unemployed people to support and encourage them in transitioning into the workforce; it was not designed as long-term support to families. However, that is exactly what is happening, as an increasing number of people, unfortunately, are becoming unemployed. People are not helped by living in poverty, even on a short-term basis. We know that social science shows us that, if people remain in poverty, they become involved in a poverty trap and that it is a downward spiral; they do not easily come out of that.
If you only look at this from an economic perspective, leaving aside the social perspective, you know that the social science shows is that it is better to support people, not drive them into poverty. It is much better from a societal point of view to assist people out of poverty, not to condemn them to poverty. That is what this government’s approach did—it condemned a million people in this country to poverty, and it is not good enough. These people deserve a rise, the same as any other pensioner. The government has let these families down, and I urge them to reconsider their position. (Time expired)

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-09-15,"—On behalf of Senator Mason, I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, Statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, together with the Hansard record of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to have the tabling statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
I am pleased to speak to the Joint Corporations and Financial Services Committee’s report on the statutory oversight of ASIC. I would like to thank the secretariat for their assistance in preparing this report and ASIC officials for their continuing cooperation with the committee. I would particularly like to thank former Deputy Chairman Jeremy Cooper for all his assistance to the committee over the years and wish him the best in his new role as head of the government’s recently announced review of Australia’s superannuation system.
The oversight report covers a number of issues including the lift on the short selling ban; ASIC’s efforts to improve market integrity; and recent corporate collapses including Storm Financial, Timbercorp and Great Southern. The committee also continued to seek information about mortgage fund redemptions, credit rating agency regulation and professional indemnity insurance arrangements for the financial services industry. The ban on covered short selling of financial stocks was lifted on 25 May, exceeding the length of similar measures in overseas jurisdictions. ASIC defended its cautious approach and suggested that a ban could be re-introduced if extreme market conditions justify it. The committee welcomes the lifting of the ban. We will monitor the effectiveness of the new reporting arrangements for covered short sales in bringing transparency to this area.
ASIC has also sought to address the market integrity issues that made short selling such a problem during the period of market volatility. Although the steps ASIC has taken to stamp out false and misleading market rumours have not generally led to successful prosecutions, they claim that their efforts had a deterrent effect. The committee expects that the resources allocated to this task through Project Mint will result in more tangible results in the near future. We also look forward to seeing more effective market surveillance now ASIC has taken responsibility for this from the ASX.
The collapses of Storm Financial and agribusiness MIS companies Timbercorp and Great Southern have led to the committee conducting two separate committee inquiries into the regulatory issues around these events. In terms of the collapses themselves, the committee strongly supports ASIC taking whatever steps it can that lead to prosecution of regulatory breaches, wherever they may have occurred.
Freezes on redemptions from mortgage funds and cash management trusts continue. A number of hardship payments have been made so far, and ASIC has announced that it will extend the scope for hardship payments to assist those who remain affected by the freezes. But the task of unfreezing these funds is a difficult one—they need new funds to allow redemptions, yet such an inflow of funds is unlikely while they remain frozen. The committee welcomes the expansion of hardship payments and will continue to monitor this sector.
The new arrangements for the regulation of credit rating agencies have been delayed until the first of January 2010. These changes will require credit rating agencies to hold an Australian financial services licence and report on their ratings processes and on how they manage conflicts of interest. ASIC told the committee that the delay is due to international developments. The committee reiterates ASIC’s warning that the ratings provided by these agencies should not be blindly relied on.
Finally, the phasing in of professional indemnity insurance requirements for financial services providers is causing concern in the industry. Cover is getting more difficult to obtain, which might cause problems for smaller operators when the implementation period for compulsory cover concludes at the end of this year. The committee will continue to seek further updates on this problem as the requirement for a higher standard of cover begins. The committee would also like to see ASIC better explain the limited capacity for PI insurance to compensate investor losses.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2009-09-15,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Philippines, Cambodia and Malaysia, which took place from 19 April to 1 May 2009, and move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
In April 2009 there was a parliamentary delegation to Cambodia, the Philippines and Malaysia. The delegation members were the member for Parramatta, Ms Julie Owens MP; the member for Lyne, Mr Rob Oakeshott MP; and me. The purpose of the delegation was to examine opportunities to broaden links with those countries, focusing on economic development, including responses to global economic issues and opportunities to strengthen trade and investment links; the environment, including policies and initiatives to meet the challenges of climate change; security, including defence cooperation and responses to the threat of terrorism; co-operation within the multilateral system; and social development, including community health and education.
In February of this year, a free trade agreement was signed between Australia, New Zealand and ASEAN. As a group, ASEAN and New Zealand constitute Australia’s largest trading partner, valued at over $103 billion in 2007-08, accounting for no less than 21 per cent of Australia’s total trade. Australia’s two-way trade with ASEAN has grown by an annual average of 10 per cent, therefore the delegation felt it was an opportune time to begin this program of visits.
In each of these three countries we were warmly welcomed and supported by our embassies, high commissions and their staff. We had numerous meetings with politicians, community leaders, NGOs, Australian expats and proud Australian companies doing business in these countries. We visited these countries at the height of the global financial crisis and although there are challenges for the world I would like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the challenges for these countries in particular.
In the Philippines there are three major issues. One is people-smuggling, a topic that is very relevant to this country. Another issue is terrorism at Mindanao, in the southern end of the Philippines, where the Abu Sayyaf Group are still operating. Fortunately, through the efforts of the Philippine government with the assistance of other countries—Australia being one—that threat is being slightly reduced, but not to the point where you could honestly say that these extreme terrorist groups are completely on the way out. There is a lot of work to be done down there and I am proud that Australia is continuing to be part of that work.
Obviously, another problem for the Philippines is corruption, and the perception of corruption. We noted that the Philippines was ranked 131st on Transparency International’s 2007 corruption perception index, which rates countries—the best being No. 1 to the worst lower down. The rank of 131st speaks for itself.
We had a very interesting time in Cambodia. As most senators would know, Cambodia is the least developed of the three countries that we visited. It was a moving experience to learn of the history of Cambodia, which is currently in the process of rebuilding following the terrible years of the Khmer Rouge regime from 1975 to 1979. Up to one quarter of the Cambodian population died as a result of the Khmer Rouge purges, starvation and disease. The Khmer Rouge also destroyed much of Cambodia’s infrastructure, including the irrigation systems. Professionals such as doctors, teachers and lawyers were targeted, leading to a lack of educators and role models in Cambodian society. We are very mindful that it has only been for 10 years that Cambodia has experienced the current peace. It is quite daunting when you think about that. Rebuilding in Cambodia is taking place; however, it has unfortunately started from a very low base, and it is happening at a snail’s pace.
One of the confronting things that I took away from Cambodia is that the major industry is the textile and garment industry—I believe that 20-odd per cent of America’s garment market comes from Cambodia. We witnessed in the time we were there in April, when the financial crisis was well and truly affecting the world, that no fewer than 70,000 Cambodians had lost their jobs in just that industry. It was alarming. I do not know how far that number has increased but although 70,000 was a lot back then I would say the number would be a lot higher by now. The sad part is that it was put to us during the delegation that 70,000 jobs going in the garment industry would be fine—it does not matter!—because these low-skilled farmers would go back to the family farms. So everything would be all right!
Our other port of call was Malaysia. The big industry in Malaysia is electronics, and they were certainly feeling the effects of the global financial crisis. It does not take Einstein to work out that, if money is drying up and jobs are disappearing, without aid from the government people certainly will not be investing in televisions and electrical hardware. Malaysia is the most developed of the three countries that we visited. The delegation’s briefing from the economic policy unit indicated that Malaysia is at risk—it was, back then—of being affected by downturns in the United States economy, which they rely so heavily upon.
In fact, it was important to note that the Malaysian government had initiated two stimulus packages. I remind senators in the chamber that we were there in April. It did not take the Malaysians long to work out that they had to start spending and injecting the money into the economy very quickly if they were to save their economy from sliding into the red. Their first stimulus package was seven billion ringgits and their second stimulus package was a mini-budget of some 60 million ringgits.
I know time is against me but I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank the embassies, the ambassadors, the high commission in Malaysia, their staff, their secretaries and all the Australian expats that we met overseas. When we are travelling the world, one thing we have in common is that we are all Aussies when we get together. It is wonderful to see what Australian companies are putting into these ASEAN countries and what they are doing, especially in Cambodia, in terms of training and employment and sharing our skills and knowledge.
A special thanks has to go to the delegation secretary, Ms Natalie Cooke, who had to put up with us for those eight or nine days. As you, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, and every senator in this building would know, they do a sterling job and without them our job would be absolutely unbearable. They make it all happen. They are the glue. Natalie, mate, thank you very much.

At the request of Senator Fielding, I also move:

Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins, as we discussed at the tabling of the report on the disallowance of AQIS fees and charges yesterday, it is with no pleasure that we do this, but we find it necessary because of the complete and utter mismanagement of this process. There are real concerns about the way that the minister has negotiated this process, right from the time that we first put a disallowance on the table.
We are genuinely concerned about this process. If the government had been prepared to have or were interested in a genuine reform process, it would have adequately resourced it right from the start. It would not have come as a complete surprise, out of the blue, from the Beale process. The industry understood that Beale was reviewing AQIS in respect of imports into Australia. Industry told us at the inquiry last week that they had no expectation at all that Beale was going to make a recommendation to remove the 40 per cent rebate on AQIS export fees and charges; therefore, they did not engage with that issue. Had they known that it was going to be a problem, they would have engaged with it and put their point of view. The first the meat industry knew about it was at a meeting with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Burke, in February. They told us that at the meeting on Friday.
Over the last 24 hours, when the minister has suddenly realised that this is going to go pear shaped, there has been this frantic process to try to negotiate a way out of his problem. Again, it is a demonstration that the government has no real plan for reform. It has tried to cobble together a deal at the last minute. In fact, as late as two o’clock, when the beef industry found out that there was supposedly a deal floating around—they had not been consulted—they were trying to negotiate an outcome on behalf of their industry with the minister. But what about the fishing industry? What about the horticulture sector? What about those small abattoirs who still do not know, under this alleged deal that Minister Burke has done with the Greens, whether they are still paying an extra $50,000 a year? This does not demonstrate that. All that we know will happen under this deal is that the fees and charges will go up. We do not know how it is going to be applied. The government said in the budget that by going to full cost recovery there would be a $43 million a year saving in the budget. That is what the budget papers said. The government put $40 million on the table. Supposedly that $40 million is going into ‘effectively allowing a rebate on fees’, but what does that mean? Nobody knows what it means. Nobody knows what the bottom line of the deal is. We cannot tell the abattoirs in Victoria who look after the emu industry or the ostrich industry—the only abattoirs that do that—whether they are going to have to pay a $50,000 registration fee or whether the only export abattoir in Western Australia is going to be charged extra. We do not know.
The industry has put to the minister a list of demands. We do not know whether the minister has signed that off or not. He was almost promising them anything they wanted at one stage during the afternoon, but they have not had that signed off. He has looked after the big guys, but what about the rest? Those that ring up and complain might get some attention. Yet the Greens call this a great deal. They are prepared to sell-out agriculture for a bit of publicity. Granted, there is some money attached to this, and we said all along that there should be some more money put into this process.

Senator Milne interjecting—

—Senator Milne, I am glad you interjected, because that brings me to another point about the dishonesty of this government. John Cobb, the opposition spokesman on agriculture, went to the minister yesterday to try and do a deal. He was told there was no more money.
—What did he ask for?
—He was told there was no more money at one o’clock yesterday, yet by yesterday evening there was $20 million on the table. How can you trust what this government says? How can the industry trust what this government says? They do not know whether there is going to be some money on the table. They do not know what it is going to apply to. We gave the government an opportunity three months ago to work through the industry plans and to put them on the table. We suspended our disallowance motion so that the government could have the opportunity to work through things with industry. We gave them the chance to work and negotiate with industry and to come back and show us the progress on the industry plans. They came to our inquiry last week on Thursday night and told us that all this could be sorted out in 12 months. AQIS said to the committee, ‘We are confident that all of these six reform plans can be dealt with within six months.’ Industry came the next day and said, ‘We don’t think that’s the case.’ The grains industry told us that it would be at least two years. The meat industry told us a minimum of two years for the big items and out to five years. The government appears now to be conceding that this is the case. Where is the confidence that existed last Thursday night? The whole process is a complete shambles. The government will not negotiate with the opposition but can do a deal worth $20 million later that night with the Greens.
What this deal does not do is protect the industry from higher prices. The government is going to charge higher fees. Then it is going to put it into the industry liability accounts and perhaps apply it later to fees and charges. This is what the letter says:
All cost reductions will accumulate to the benefit of affected sectors within the industry liability accounts, potentially enabling downward adjustment of fees and charges for 2010 and 2011, or continued investment in further reforms.
We said that this process needed funding in the first year and that the rebate should continue for the next 12 months. This does not guarantee that. The charges will continue. The only way to guarantee the rebate continues for 12 months is to disallow these regulations. That is the only way industry has any guarantee that the rebate will continue. The government is also saying, as I said yesterday, ‘reform or rebate’. The government needs to continue this process. Everybody accepts that there needs to be reform. The opposition has said all along that there should be reform, and we support reform. What we want is a proper process.
We said at the outset: put the industry plans in place, fund them, implement them and then pass the savings back to industry. That is a reasonable process. And industry sector after industry sector came to us last week and said exactly that: ‘We want the reforms identified, we want them implemented and then we’re prepared to go into a new cost structure.’ Where is the problem with that? Why is that an issue? The problem is that the government is not being straight up and down. It will not deal with the opposition. The opposition spokesman went to meet with the minister and was told there was no money.

Senator Milne interjecting—

—Well, if you are told there is no money, Senator Milne, what are we supposed to say?
—I don’t accept that; I never accept that!
—It is just absurd, Senator Milne.
 (Senator Hutchins)—Order! Address your remarks through the chair, Senator Colbeck. And Senator Milne, please cease your interjecting.
—The way that the government are treating agriculture generally is completely absurd. It is completely and utterly absurd. This industry exports close to $30 billion a year. They almost wet themselves when there is a gas deal signed with China that runs for 25 years for $25 billion—they go berserk. But here is an industry that is doing more than that every year, and what are they prepared to do? They will not even genuinely fund the reform process. There is $30 billion worth of exports every year. The beef industry on its own exports more than the car industry. They supply hundreds of millions to the car industry but they will not fund a simple reform process of export fees and charges. It is absolutely absurd.
Let us have a look at what happens in other countries. In Argentina, industry funds the on-plant inspection component only. In Australia they want us to fund that plus all the overheads. In Canada: on-plant inspection only. In Denmark: on-plant inspection only. In Great Britain: on-plant inspection only. In Japan: laboratory testing regimes only. In Korea, industry pays nil. In Mexico: vet costs only. And in the United States: shift and overtime only.
This is a significant industry for Australia. It is the sector that kept us out of recession, yet this is how this government treats it. It is not prepared to put up the money. The department have been absolutely decimated because of the fact that the minister will not stand up for them in cabinet. They have been copping all the cuts, and yet the government will not put in the money for a simple reform process, even though we are talking about an industry that exports $30 billion a year.
—Oh, come on Richard—what did your lot do in 11½ years?
—You’ll get your chance. We put the 40 per cent rebate in place, Senator Sterle.
—Order! Senator Sterle.
—I say to industry that, by moving this motion, what we are looking to do is to ensure that the government engages with them in a genuine reform process. That is what we are looking to do. Moving this motion does not mean that reform is all over. The government might be threatening that, but the government knows that it has to go ahead with the reform process. Yesterday there was no money available; suddenly today there is $20 million. We know that they have the money. They can spend $43 billion on stimulus but they cannot put money in to effectively fund a reform process. It is absolutely ridiculous. What we want the government to do now is to put in place a process that has agreed timelines, that has agreed work plans, that has agreed costings—and then to fund it. They can then come back to this place with that new reform process.
We have tried to be constructive all the way through this process. We could have knocked this off back in June. We could have disallowed these regulations back in June. But we did not. We gave the government the opportunity to continue with its reform process—to work with industry, to come back with agreed work plans, and then for us to have the opportunity to peruse that, look and see how they were getting on and then to assess whether or not we saw things as being genuine.
On top of that, we asked industry to come and speak before us. We put in place a Senate inquiry—which the government opposed; they were not interested in genuinely hearing what industry said—and industry came in and told us that they wanted a reform process that allowed them to work out what the savings might be: implement the reforms and then change the fees and charges. There is no equivocation on industry’s part. They want a reform process—as do the opposition and as do the miners, I am sure. I am sure they are all looking to see something like this happen. So, we say to industry: we know there is concern out there about what is happening here today, but now is your opportunity to sit down with government and negotiate a proper reform process. The pressure is now on the government. We said last week, in a taking note debate, that if this fell over it would be the government’s fault. Do not go blaming us: we gave you every chance. We gave the government every chance to sort this out, and they did not. They were running around between 10 o’clock this morning and four o’clock this afternoon trying to negotiate some sort of last-minute deal, but nobody can tell us what the deals mean. So how can we, with confidence, go back to that small abattoir in Myrtleford and say: ‘Look, you are not going to be charged a $50,000 registration fee’? We cannot. How can we go back to the cherry growers in Tasmania and say: ‘We are confident that you are not going to see an explosion that puts you out of the Japanese market’? We cannot. We cannot even go to the abattoir in Western Australia, which is the only one between South Australia and Townsville, right around the top, and say, ‘Your fees and charges will not go up.’
So what I say to industry is: go back to Minister Burke, take your proposals and your plans, and come and talk to us as well because we are genuinely interested in progressing this reform process. If the government is prepared to put a real deal on the table, we will support it. We have tried to be constructive all the way through this process. We did not come in here quoting press releases that were three months old or read last week’s submission to the inquiry to try to justify our position. We have worked with industry all the way through. We have taken on board their concerns and we will continue to do that so that we get a good outcome. We are prepared to work with the government to achieve that if they are prepared to work with us. So here is the opportunity for the government: if you want to get this right, sit down and deal with industry and this parliament in a genuine way and we will be part of the deal.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT CONTROL (FEES) AMENDMENT ORDERS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,25,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-09-15,"—Here we are after having only a few weeks ago debated this same issue about the AQIS export certification functions, the fees associated with it and the 40 per cent rebate that is given. The heart of the issue is: should we at this time be slugging horticulture, meat and livestock and the agricultural sectors, which are exporting, with extra costs. I do not think so. I have been consistent on this since the last time we debated the issue. Do I think that the government needs to ensure that the services that are provided to these industries become more efficient and are of a lower cost so as to increase Australia’s competitiveness? Of course I do. But to basically say to the industries that are exposed and are being given higher costs at this time, ‘We need to partner with you but you bear the costs,’ is ridiculous. At the last minute the government has come up with another $20 million to say, ‘We will cover the costs for the industry.’

Senator Milne interjecting—

—I will tell you something: you have got to smell a rat when the Greens say that they are friends of the meat and livestock industry. You have got to smell a rat when they stand up and say that they are friends of agriculture or that they are there for horticulture. I have listened to them in the last two or three years that I have been here and they are not friends of those industries at all. When you see them doing a deal with the government you can bet your bottom dollar that there is something horribly wrong here.
The government has to get fair dinkum. They are going to have to do their homework. They are going to have to put decent reform in place. Get the efficiencies up-front before you start slugging hardworking Australian industries that are exposed competitively internationally. Talk to the exporters. They are still very concerned. I have spoken to them today, even since the other $20 million has come in. It is still basically saying, ‘You have got a one-year reprieve.’ The government should get on with it, get the efficiencies in place and then, as the costs come down, come back to the parliament and seek approval for jacking up the prices. That way it is a fair deal—rather than just saying, ‘No, industry can bear the cost.’ And then they say, ‘Don’t disallow this stuff now because we have got a deal with the Greens which says that the $20 million will actually help to offset the cost.’ How much it will do that, I do not know. But then at the end of that year, guess what? They are exposed again. And the government would say, ‘Trust me.’ Well, this one is a problem.
I do not see enough work being done in this area and I do not want to slug hardworking industries, that are exposed internationally, with extra costs at this time. You use the global financial crisis—which is there; it is legitimate—but you pick and choose what you use it for. These are hardworking Australians. They are already doing it tough. I cannot see the sense in getting them to foot the bill for your inefficiencies. The report itself said that a common theme in submissions was that the removal of the rebate should not have been contemplated ahead of the implementation reform. It is in the report as part of 2.4 under the heading ‘Industry support for removal of the rebate’.
I have spoken to some people this afternoon, even since the $20 million, and I tell you: when the Greens say that they are friends of the meat and livestock industry they have got to be kidding. When the Greens say that they are friends of agriculture they have to be joking. Let us be fair and reasonable here. Get on with the reforms yourself and get the efficiencies in there. The costs savings need to be there first and then we can look at how much of the rebate should be passed on to these hardworking Australian industries that are exposed on exports.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT CONTROL (FEES) AMENDMENT ORDERS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,25,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-09-15,"—I rise to comment on this issue, with which I have been involved since the start. People in the Senate will be aware that it was my disallowance that went on the Notice Paper straight after the budget. I note with interest that it is Senator Fielding and Senator Colbeck who have taken over my motion, because the one on the books that Senator Colbeck had did not do the job. It did not get it right.
I want to say to the Senate that I find Senator Fielding’s remarks beneath contempt. If you check the record, my colleague Senator Siewert served as chair, and I have served as deputy chair, of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee in the time that I have been in the Senate. Senator Siewert and I have consistently been members of that committee and have served on inquiry after inquiry and moved for inquiry after inquiry, unlike Senator Fielding, who has not moved for any rural and regional inquiries, that I am aware of, and nor is he a regular attendee at the committee or at the hearings. Also, he was not at the hearing last Friday when we heard the evidence in relation to this. I am very happy to debate the issues, but I have to say it is a reflection on the speaker if you cannot deal with the issues and you just contribute what is no more than a bigoted diatribe.
However, I move on to the issue in relation to this motion for disallowance. I want to say that I am totally committed to reform in the primary industry sector, in particular in relation to the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service and the reforms that are on the table. As everyone else has said in here, every single one of the sectors that have come before the committee and made a submission over this time have said that they are committed to reform. The issue that they had was that they wanted the reforms in place before the 40 per cent rebate was taken away. That was their issue. They did not want to have to incur the cost until the reforms were in place. I said that yesterday. I make it very clear that it was in 2001 that the rebate was introduced, under the Howard government. But I also want to say that in December 2002 the Howard government adopted a formal cost recovery policy aimed at improving the consistency, transparency and accountability of their cost recovery arrangements. It was the Howard government that did nothing to facilitate reform. They paid the rebate and they said the reform was necessary, but they also indicated that the rebate would run out. It was moved by the Howard government for one more period of time but the expectation was that it would run out. It was due to run out this year.
The Rudd government came back and said, ‘We will put $39.3 million on the table to facilitate the reform process and the agricultural sector will go to 100 per cent cost recovery for the department.’ In other words, they will pay 100 per cent. I did not believe that was fair because I did not think there was enough time to transition and because there is a global economic crisis. There is a high dollar. Every industry group that came before us said: ‘Look, we’re concerned about this. We actually want the reforms but we are concerned about the money.’ I went through all the evidence and I heard Senator Colbeck say several times that they need more money on the table. I believe that $20 million was the figure that Senator Colbeck referred to. But I want to put on the record in this Senate that it was not the Liberal Party and it was not the National Party that went to the minister and said, ‘I believe we need to have this much money and this is our proposal.’
I have done it twice. I went to the minister when I first moved this and said, ‘I would like to have a work plan on the table by 1 August which will do these things for the horticulture sector,’ because that was the sector that was most divided at the time. The minister agreed. I have to say that on 1 August there was a work plan on the table for the horticulture sector, as had been agreed. After the hearing last week, I was deeply disturbed by the fact that this was going ahead without money on the table for the farmers, so I went to the minister yesterday. I have to say that I am the only one who actually sat down and said, ‘I want $20 million, Minister, because these people need the rebate paid for the next 12 months, while the reform agenda is implemented.’ The minister already had $39 million on the table. He agreed to put $20 million on top of that so that the rebates and fees will be paid, the 40 per cent will be paid, for the next 12 months, until the end of the financial year. The farmers all know now that they will get the reform agenda, the work plans and the whole system that they are working on in place and they will get their rebate of fees and charges until the end of the financial year.
—There’s not enough money.
—It is interesting that the National Party says there is not enough money when the National Party did not put a proposition to the minister. How much money did you ask for? I do not believe the coalition spokesperson went to the minister and put a figure on the table. I will stand to be corrected. I would like to hear from any senator in here who knows that Mr Cobb or anyone else went to the minister and said, ‘I want X amount of dollars.’ I do not believe they did. I believe they said, ‘We need more money.’ They did not ask for a specific amount. They did not have a specific proposal. They are clearly not used to negotiating if they take no for an answer. I do not believe in taking no for an answer if someone says that there is no more money. There was $3 billion on the table yesterday for the car industry. I made the point in my speech in here that if there is that much money on the table for the car industry then there is money available for the farmers. Senator Colbeck said before that $20 million would fix the problem. I am back here with $20 million, in addition to the $39.3 million the government had on the table. Now the coalition, together with Senators Fielding and Xenophon, are going to reject the $39.3 million for reform and the $20 million rebates for the farmers.
For the next 12 months that money will be recouped and they will get their 40 per cent, but the reforms will not proceed because there is no additional money in order to take both the rebates and the reforms beyond this particular package. I was at least prepared to go to the government and say, ‘This is what we need.’ The grain industry said that they want this to proceed; they do not want the disallowance. The horticulture council, having been very conflicted before, I have to say, were back today saying that with that $20 million on the table and the fact that they will get their rebate on fees for the next 12 months, until the end of the financial year, they do not want the disallowance to proceed.
I think you are going to find as you go out there that a lot of industry sectors are very annoyed, because the progressive end of the industry sectors realises that the best way forward for them is to get the reforms in order to reduce the costs. There is duplication. There is no doubt that there is duplication between federal and state inspection services. There is no doubt that we need an electronic system to be able to lodge documentation for accreditation and that sort of thing. There is no doubt that we need the AAs in place and the government negotiating with our high-value export markets like Japan and the US to get the protocols changed. Whether that can be achieved in the time frame I do not know. If it cannot then there has to be another mechanism because we have to get these costs down.
The only way you are going to get efficiencies is if you actually try for a reform process. I have to say that the coalition did not push a reform process between 2001 and 2007. Not a single reform was on the table from the coalition in that time, and nor is there today a proposal from either the Liberal Party or the National Party for how to progress the reforms—not one. There was not a proposal to the minister about a sum of money. There was not a proposal on the table for the minister about how to proceed. In my view this motion is just purely playing politics, because we now have a situation where the Liberal Party and the National Party are refusing $20 million for rural and regional Australia. What is absolutely on the table is an additional $20 million so that the rebates will be paid for the next 12 months while the reform process is on. So it is almost $60 million—the $39.3 million and the $20 million—that is on the table to get the reform agenda up and the rebates paid for the next year.
You are now risking all of that, and I have no idea what the minister and the government would do in response. But let me say that it will not be Family First putting any proposals on the table. It clearly is not the Nationals, it clearly is not the Liberals and it clearly is not Senator Xenophon with a proposal on the table. I know it is the citrus growers in South Australia who have been talking to Senator Xenophon, and of course he is listening to his constituents and that is more than reasonable. But we have got several industry sectors here who want to proceed. Grains said they want to proceed. Dairy want to proceed. The meat industry want to proceed with the reforms and they were very clear about that. They want the reforms, but they want to make sure they get the rebates so that they have a transitional package, if you like, to the new arrangements. They all want to proceed so that by the end of the next financial year the reforms would be in place, with a transitional arrangement.
Now there is nothing. If this goes down, there is no transitional arrangement. There is no $20 million on the table. There is confusion out there. Yes, they will get their fees and rebates paid for the next 12 months, but under this arrangement that is precisely what I intended—that is what the $20 million is intended to do. So I really think this motion is letting down rural Australia with a lack of leadership, to be honest.
Leadership requires that you go out there and drive a reform process that is in the interests of the country in the longer term. It is about making rural and regional Australian export industries more competitive, and that is what they want. I spoke to the cherry growers and what they want is the AAs in place. They want to have accreditation. They want to be able to compete with their New Zealand counterparts. That is what they want, and their frustration is that AQIS has not gone out there and finished the process for them. AQIS has let them down in terms of the reforms that they want, and they want those reforms now. They are not going to get those reforms if this goes down, and there will be a lot of progressive people out there who are frustrated in their efforts to become more competitive in their business and to hold AQIS to account. For years they have been saying that AQIS has been promising these reforms and has not delivered. This was a process for forcing actual reform to occur because the whole thing had to be done in the next 12 months in order to get the fees and charges down in the longer term.
I am not naive about the whole reform agenda being able to be delivered in 12 months. We heard evidence from a number of people that some reforms would be more readily accessible in terms of savings than others and that other reforms may take longer. But the clear evidence is that once you start the reform process you build momentum through that process and you get continual improvement; you get the department focused on actually delivering reform, which is what the agricultural community wants.
Contrary to Senator Fielding’s very poor understanding of this matter, I have been part of the agricultural community for my entire life, having been brought up on a dairy farm in north-west Tasmania. It was in order to save the farmlands of Wesley Vale that I campaigned against the Wesley Vale pulp mill for all those years. I stopped subdivision after subdivision of agricultural land. I brought in the mapping of soils in Tasmania so that we protected high-quality agricultural land, and to this day I am trying to stop the incursion of urban areas into high-quality agricultural land. We have to protect that land for food production into the future, and I am passionate about that. I am also passionate about making sure the people who are growing our food are competitive.
Biosecurity is a key area for Australia’s export competitiveness. We have to do better than we are currently doing in biosecurity, and that is why I have put so much effort into this. That is why I went to the minister the last time we were discussion this here, in June, and said to him: ‘We have to drive this process. We have to get an agreement for horticulture. I want those plans on the table by 1 August.’ And on 31 July I was on the phone to the minister’s office saying, ‘Are you meeting that?’ As a result of the deadline, they had a massive phone link-up that went for hours with the producers to try to get some agreement on a work plan and drive the process during that time. When we came back here after last Friday, I was the one who was then in the minister’s office yesterday with a proposal on the table, and I think $20 million is not to be sneezed at.
I think most growers would be relieved to know that that $20 million was to be spent on giving them their fees and rebates for the next 12 months while that $39 million is being spent on reform. If this goes down, that process will not occur. That would be appalling for competitiveness, because why would there then be any drive for reform into the next 18 months? There will not be, and a lot of these sectors will be very annoyed. So if the National Party and the Liberal Party and the two Independents think that this is some kind of leadership for rural and regional Australia, let me tell them it is not. It is actually pitching to a populist response rather than looking to industry leaders, who are the ones who are going to take us into the future with the best innovation in their sectors. It is the innovators in their sectors who are begging for this reform. And it is the $20 million that the government was going to deliver on top of its $39.3 million that would have supported those innovators in bringing about the changes in AQIS that need to occur to give us better biosecurity and better security for the producers and exporters around rural and regional Australia.
I ask people to think very carefully about moving this disallowance because this is an opportunity. Of course, there are risks associated with it. I sat and listened to all of the people giving evidence to the Senate inquiry about the risk that the reforms may not be delivered in time and that they would be passing out the cost recovery while the reforms may not be delivered. That is why I said, ‘We want the $20 million to give them the rebate at the same time that the reforms are being implemented so it is not costing them in the meantime.’ You can argue about whether 12 months was long enough, and perhaps it is not. I would have loved to have got more for years further out for some of these sectors; nevertheless, the letter signed by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry says in black and white that there is $20 million of new money. It says:
… the additional funding will effectively allow a rebate on fees and charges for the 2009-10 financial year to all affected sectors while the full reform agenda developed jointly by industry representatives and AQIS is implemented …
That is my proposal, that is the proposal I went to the government with, that is the proposal that they agreed to and that is why we now have $60 million on the table. Senator Back said to me last night, ‘Surely there must be some resolution to this,’ and that is right—we want a resolution to it. At least I thought people were committed to finding some way through this to a resolution so that we got reform and money. But it appears that is not the case. I think that you are doing a disservice to the innovators and all of the sectors that have said that they want reform. You are now jeopardising reform for an uncertain future, whereas what is on the table is a reform agenda and 12 months guaranteed to get their fees and rebates paid. I think that is a good proposal for rural and regional Australia. It guarantees improvements in biosecurity and efficiency—those things that the coalition never did when it was in government. From 2001 to 2007 not one single reform was implemented or attempted, yet in that time the coalition government made the decision to go to full cost recovery having not implemented a reform. At least this is an attempt at a reform agenda and $20 million to help farmers adjust to it. The coalition—the Liberal-National Party—Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding will deny rural and regional Australia this $20 million.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT CONTROL (FEES) AMENDMENT ORDERS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,25,1,speech
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2009-09-15,"—I rise to make some remarks on the disallowance motion for the 40 per cent rebate. It astounds me how many ways this Labor government can find to belt regional Australia. Here we have yet another example of this government being completely disconnected from and out of touch with our agricultural communities. We are talking about one of the few sectors that is underpinning the recovery of this country from the global financial crisis. But what do we get from the government? ‘Let’s find another way to whack another tax on them.’ It is not fair or right. Not only that but it is completely stupid. Why would this government go down a path that one of the people appearing in front of the inquiry said was an antistimulus move? Why go down this track when the government says it wants to do everything to stimulate our economy? Why would you put a new tax on one of the very industries that is underpinning the recovery of this nation? It is completely stupid.
There has been some discussion around industry support for the removal of the 40 per cent rebate. As far as I could ascertain through our inquiry and all the discussions with industry, there is no actual support for the removal of that rebate—none, nada, not any. We recognise support exists across all the sectors for reform. We all agree that there needs to be reform. Let us be clear—we have just heard a long contribution from my colleague Senator Milne on my left here—that the only thing tying together the removal of the rebate and progress on reforms is the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. There is nothing else that is predicating that happening. It is entirely within the minister’s purview to retain the 40 per cent rebate and to progress the reforms. Others in this debate and in this chamber would have you believe that it is some sort of ‘fairies in the garden’ thing, that you cannot possibly have the two together. Let me tell you that you can and you should be very clear that it is within the minister’s purview to do that.
What we have seen pop out of this absolute mess today—and I must say that it is my good colleagues Senator Back and Senator Colbeck who have driven this very clearly—is $20 million. It has popped out of nowhere. My gosh, here is $20 million that the government did not have yesterday and all of a sudden now they do. The question has to be asked: if that bucket of money comes out of nowhere—and we understood prior to now it did not exist for the minister—why on earth was consideration not given to retaining that rebate with the $40 million cost attached to it and putting the other bucket of money towards the reform? Why put the industry through all of this pain and angst when the government could simply have come up with that bucket of money and put it into the reforms to start with? Make no mistake: this is going to cost jobs and industries in regional Australia. We on this side of the chamber are not going to stand and wear it and just watch it happen. We are not going to let it happen.
Gary Burridge of the Australian Meat Industry Council stated last Friday that the removal of the 40 per cent Federal subsidy on inspection fees would come straight off processor margins which are already low and in many cases negative. He said that some small processors will be devastated and suggested it will put some out of business. He said the only option for many processors would be to pass back the cost to farmers who can ill afford to bear these extra costs. Either way there would be jobs lost and big impacts on regional communities. We have had enough of regional Australia and farmers having to bear the cost of all of these things. It is simply not right. The minister very clearly outlined in his letter to Senator Milne:
The $60 million Export Certification Reform Package is a very substantial reform package that warrants the support of the Senate. If the fees and charges were disallowed, the Government would not be in a position to proceed with this reform package.
Why not? They have got the money. Why can’t they proceed with the reform package? The minister is having an absolute hissy fit because he cannot get his own way. It stands to reason that, if the money is there, he can put it towards the reform process. No amount of talk in this place, no amount of garble coming out of this place, can remove the very simple option of keeping the rebate and moving down the path of the reform process.
One thing that clearly came out of this inquiry was that the efficiencies from the reform process would not happen until further down the track. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that, if you remove the fees and charges now and if the efficiencies from the reform process will not become effective until further down the track—and some industries are saying for up to five years—there will be a massive hit on our industries. Our industries, particularly our smaller industries, will have to bear the burden now of a massive tax. Some industries will be hit with a $50,000 extra impost, which apparently the minister did not even know about. How is that fair? How is that right? How is that going to provide any incentive or stimulus—and the government is so keen on talking about that the entire time—whatsoever for the industry to grow and be sustainable? This is again a complete disregard from this government of regional Australia and of what they do.
One thing that was raised was that a lot of these costs are actually legitimate costs of government, and we are seeing the government trying to put the whole lot back onto the industry. A lot of the costs are legitimate costs of government and we know a lot of them are recognised in other countries around the world as for the public good. Yet what do we see our minister trying to do? We see our Labor minister trying to rip the guts out of all of these industries out there in our regional communities. They are doing it tough anyway.
Let us compare this $20 million bucket of money with what the government has on offer for other industries. My good colleague Senator Colbeck compared the beef industry and the car industry. What have we seen from this Labor government? We have seen $6 billion in assistance for the car industry. How many people do they employ, Senator Colbeck? I think it is around 50,000. They produce about $2 billion worth of exports. Let us look at the meat industry in comparison. It employs around 55,000 and generates about $8 billion worth of exports. That is four times what the car industry generates. What are they getting? They are getting relatively nothing.
—Higher fees and charges!
—They are getting higher fees and charges. Thank you very much, Senator Colbeck. I will take that interjection. It is simply stupidity to go down that track. All of a sudden, we are told that Senator Milne has found $20 million. Please. That money suddenly materialised today. Why on earth didn’t the minister come up with it a short time ago? He should have said: ‘Okay, industry. Here we go. We recognise we are going to rip the heart out of so many parts of this industry, particularly the smaller sectors, if we impose this new tax.’ That is what it is, my good colleagues. Do not look at it as anything but a new tax on the agricultural export industry. The minister should have said, ‘We’re going to impose this tax.’ That makes a lot of sense, doesn’t it? This tax is being imposed on the one industry, as I said when I started, that is underpinning the recovery of this nation. It is a little bit too cute by half for other senators in this place—and I recognise their absolute right to do it—to sit here and say, ‘I did this and I did that.’ Let us have a look at what it is actually going to do. In the letter from the minister to Senator Milne, he said:
The additional funding will effectively allow a rebate on … charges …
When talking about the cost reductions, he used words like:
… potentially enabling downward adjustment …
I do not have the trust in this government that others do. I think I am very well founded in not trusting this government. This is about jobs in regional communities. This is about industries in regional communities. This is about sticking up for those parts of the industry that need someone to stick up for them. We are not going to stand here and say, ‘Yes, it’s okay for the minister to use standover tactics and say to the industry’—and this is effectively what he did—‘“If you don’t make any noise about losing this rebate then I’ll give you some money for the reform process.”’ It is not on. The minister knows he could quite effectively have left the funding there for the 40 per cent rebate and at the same time embarked on the reform process. We are not going to stand here and let those industries be belted by a new tax imposed by this Labor government. It is not fair. Anybody who understood regional Australia would not stand by and let it happen. Senator Milne has a bucket of money, but that is not the answer. The answer is to do it in a way such that the industry will not be belted by a tax while at the same time having the reform process go ahead. The minister knows it is well within his purview to do that, and he should do it.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT CONTROL (FEES) AMENDMENT ORDERS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,25,1,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2009-09-15,"—What a disappointing process we have found ourselves in this evening. Last Thursday night the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport had the opportunity to hear from AQIS and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. On Friday we heard from industry. It was a very balanced committee inquiry. The process was excellent and the questions were good. The comments from industry all pointed in one direction—that is, that there was a willingness to work with AQIS, to work with industry and to work with the government to achieve the reforms that they wanted to see but that it was essential there was no risk at the time and that the rebate stayed.
We came to this chamber yesterday and flagged what we were going to do. As a result of that, the shadow minister attempted to speak to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in an effort to come to some understanding as to what would move this whole process forward, armed with the fact, as I said last evening, that AQIS itself was in a position of negotiation. Most industry was in a position where they were willing—they wanted to see reforms but they wanted to see the rebate in place first. The shadow minister reported that Minister Burke could not give him any undertaking that there were any funds. It was within the capacity of the minister, if he chose to, to convene a meeting with the committee members. I do not think there would have been any members of the committee who would not have been prepared to meet.
—It never happened in the time you were in government.
—We have all been in this place, as Senator O’Brien is well aware. Yesterday afternoon, the shadow minister attempted to meet with Minister Burke to put to the minister what the real issues are. The real issues are straightforward: firstly, that the 40 per cent rebate would be retained; secondly, as part of the reform process, that we would see agreement of work plans in each of the six industry sectors; and, thirdly, that those work plans would be fully funded. Only this evening have I had the courtesy, through Senator Milne, of receiving a copy of a letter from the minister to Senator Milne—not to others on the committee—in which he states that he will provide $20 million of extra funding. It was not there yesterday afternoon but was there by last night or by this morning, or by whenever this letter arrived. As Senator Nash has said, far from there being a guarantee of the 40 per cent rebate still being in place—I image the letter is accurate—the letter states:
The additional funding will effectively allow a rebate on fees and charges for the 2009-10 financial year—
How much is it? Is it two per cent? Is it 40 per cent? What is it? Why could the minister not have said in that letter to Senator Milne and why could he not have entrusted others by copying it to them? I do not even know whether my two colleagues on the other side of the chamber, Senators Sterle and O’Brien, have seen a copy of this letter. But why would it be that the minister could not have come straight out and said, ‘There will be a retention of the 40 per cent rebate while we go on with the reform process’? No. We have not been involved in this process. We have not been given the courtesy of the minister’s confidence. All we know, per the courtesy of Senator Milne, is from a copy of a letter to her in which the minister says that he will effectively allow some sort of a rebate on fees and charges while we go on. But it does not stop there either because he then says:
… all affected sectors will … benefit from efficiency gains and cost savings—
but that these cost reductions—
… will accumulate to the benefit of affected sectors within the Industry Liability Accounts—
which are themselves at this time accruing. So we may or may not get cost savings and if we do, they will go into the industry liability account. Then the letter says:
potentially—
potentially—
enabling downward adjustment of fees and charges for 2010-11 …
He has no confidence in industry and he has no confidence in his AQIS executives. Industry has confidence in the AQIS executives—they told us so—but the minister clearly has not because he is talking about cost reductions going into a liability fund and only then potentially will they enable downward adjustment of fees and charges. What a cop-out to go about this in this process, when there was a time when all of us working collectively and collaboratively could have achieved something. I am only new in this place, as you know. If this is the way business is done for an industry which is worth $30 or $40 billion, employing hundreds of thousands of people, with a downside possibility if this fails, as Senator Colbeck said, in Western Australia we will have to go from South Australia around the north of Australia to Townsville to find another export abattoir that kills cattle. That could be the effect of this and to see this opportunity lost in this fashion is a deep disappointment.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT CONTROL (FEES) AMENDMENT ORDERS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,25,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2009-09-15,"—I rise today to support the motion for disallowance of the 40 per cent government rebate for the export certificate charges. I do not want to see the export markets that we fight so hard to obtain and hold made less competitive. The industry have said publicly that they do not believe that 12 months will be sufficient time to get the efficiencies through. Senator Milne has $20 million and that $20 million cuts out on 30 June next year. But we were told—and I listened carefully—that many of these efficiencies and reforms could take up to five or six years. Countries relied on having certificates from AQIS and they would not accept other forms of verification. You have to commend Senator Milne. She has tried, but I do not think that $20 million is going to satisfy the needs of the rest of the industries.
Another issue has come up. There is another way of licensing abattoirs and processing works. No-one knows what those costs will be. They could be a huge amount. They could be huge on smaller facilities such as processing works, refrigeration works, fish processing works and so forth. I have thought about this. I was even reluctant to get up to speak because the more I listen to this the more I understand it. Listening to the people from all industries coming to give evidence to the Senate committee, we were told: ‘We are happy for reforms. We want reforms. We are prepared to pay for reforms, but we are not going to take this huge leap in faith and pay on the never-never for something which we do not have.’
We want to see AQIS actually perform. We want to see AQIS say to some of these people who are redundant: ‘Here’s your redundancy. You can leave.’ Some AQIS inspectors do not even live in towns where there are abattoirs. I have one in mind who has to drive probably a couple of hundred miles from one town to another town. By the time he gets there, he has to drive back. Those are the inefficiencies that need to be cleaned up.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum—I do not deny that—but I do not think it will meet the needs of the industries that came before us. The cherry industry, for example—and Senator Milne would know these people because they come from Tasmania—virtually said that to get these efficiencies through, in terms where the government will accept other verifications, could take five years. If we abandon AQIS, it might take another eight to 14 years to get back in the Japanese market. Twenty million dollars is not going to solve the problems of the beef industry or the cherry industry. It is a short-term fix.
I am not churlish enough to say to Senator Milne that she has not tried, but I do not think that $20 million will take us across the line. I do not think it will fix the problems that the industries told us about in the Senate inquiry.
—Well what’s your proposal?
—My proposal is that we take the $40 million that was put up, try to implement the reforms and, as the reforms become available, go to the exporters and say: ‘We can reduce your fees by this; you pay this. Pay as you go.’
This is a giant leap of faith. We will pay for something that we have not got, on the assumption that AQIS will deliver. AQIS then have to say to their employees: ‘Sorry, Fred. We have to sack you. We want reforms.’ It is understandable that they will not want to do that. They will be reluctant to do it, and you can understand that. Senator Milne, I think you have tried, but you have not gone far enough. You cannot buy some of these things. You are trying to buy your way out of this, and I do not think you can.
—It was Senator Colbeck who said $20 million would do it.
—Twenty million dollars is a considerable amount of money, but it is not going to solve the problems of the cherry industry, which cannot get AQIS to sign off on its verifications. We are not playing around here with tiny industries; these are the biggest industries in Australia. They support and sustain the regional and rural communities. Goodness knows after Senator Wong has tried to garrotte them they are going to need all the support they can get.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I think Senator Boswell’s comment was completely out of order and disrespectful to the minister. I think it should be withdrawn.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: the minister is not a shrinking violet. She gives plenty. I am sure she can take a bit back. If she asks me to withdraw, I will withdraw in deference to her. I think she can play the game. She is pretty tough and robust. I do not think she would take offence at that.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: I thank Senator Boswell for what I think was a compliment, but ‘garrotting’ is a form of murder, so it is probably not the sort of thing that we say in this place, even when we are in a robust debate, which, as Senator Boswell says, I do not mind a bit of when appropriate and necessary. Perhaps you could use a better form of words.
 (Senator Humphries)—Are you withdrawing, Senator Boswell?
—If it offends the minister, of course I withdraw, but I cannot think of a better description.
—Senator Boswell, I think an unqualified withdrawal does not allow you to say what you have just said. Do you withdraw on an unqualified basis?
—If that is what the minister requires, I will withdraw.
—Thank you. Please proceed.
—I have a bit of advice from my friend from Western Australia, who is a vet and does understand these things. He suggested the word ‘emasculate’, and that is what is going to happen to rural Australia with the ETS. This industry and all the industries that run fridges and electric motors and provide jobs in rural Australia do not need at this time another 40 per cent tax put on them. For that reason I support this disallowance motion—and I have thought this through. The $20 million only buys 12 months, and those reforms are impossible to implement in 12 months. You cannot do it. The industry has told us that we cannot do it. Senator Milne, if she is honest with herself, will say it cannot be done. I support the disallowance motion and I hope it is carried in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT CONTROL (FEES) AMENDMENT ORDERS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,25,1,speech
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2009-09-15,"—I will only take a couple of minutes to add my support to my colleagues on this side. Adding costs to export industries does nothing but harm. Of course I have an interest in this. We are fortunate to have Bindaree Beef at Inverell, a magnificent abattoir employing around 600 people. It means an extra $350,000 a year for that abattoir. They are going to face enough if the emissions trading scheme is brought in. It is going to cost the abattoir about an extra $1million a year in electricity alone. So I have just put $1.35 million extra cost onto that industry.
Those costs are not being borne in America. Under the Waxman-Markey bill, when they get the ETS they are not going to have that cost put on them. So this is just another cost put onto export industries, another nail in the coffin of these vital, value-adding industries that are so essential for jobs in our rural communities. That is why I support the disallowance.
The government must get serious about not putting extra costs on or removing benefits from export industries, but instead get behind those very industries. Times are tough in the bush and we know very well that as soon as abattoirs face extra cost they will pass it onto the farmers, the beef producers. Then it will flow right through the whole community and regional communities will lose that money. We know who is going to pay for it. It is wrong. The analogy that some have made about the car industry and our meat industry says it all. The government is putting billions behind the car industry, which exports $2 billion a year. But they want to add some costs to our meat industry, which exports around $8 billion a year. I think that it is unfair and I gladly support the disallowance.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT CONTROL (FEES) AMENDMENT ORDERS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,25,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2009-09-15,"—I guess we have had a contribution from every member of the National Party present, the Liberal Party spokesman on agriculture, and a Liberal Party senator from Western Australia, all talking about why they are going to vote for this motion and disallow this particular regulation. There is a lot that could be said in this debate, but we have limited time in which to conclude it and if it is not concluded by 6.50 pm the regulation is automatically disallowed. That is a point of contention as far as I am concerned. So much time has been taken up in this debate by those speakers that it will limit the way that the debate can be concluded, because we now have 18 minutes to conclude the debate. So I really take exception to the use of that time by senators opposite given that their spokesman is here to speak to it. I do not object to the National Party making a contribution, but when every member of the National Party makes a contribution, and Senator Back makes a contribution as well, that really does put pressure on the way that this matter can be dealt with and, with respect, we have had plenty of opportunities to address this, and here we are going to have more time taken.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I waited until either Senator O’Brien or Senator Sterle wished to speak before I stood. Neither did.
 (Senator Humphries)—There is no point of order.
—Another waste of time, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator Back sought to make a point in his contribution about the fact that he had not been contacted by the minister—he had not got a copy of a letter. I had a message passed to me from the minister’s office just after he made his contribution. The minister’s office said that they rang Senator Back’s office before question time, or left a message for him to get back, to talk to him about the issue, and he did not return the call. I do not know what is happening in his office if he did not get the message, but that is the bona fides of the minister. He did contact Senator Back and something has either gone wrong or the senator has been unable or unwilling to return the call.
But let us get back to tintacks on this. We have a proposition for reform of the import inspection charges regime, which has been put on the table after many years of complaints by the industry. This was not done by the coalition, who were in government up until the end of 2007. The coalition were content to put a bit of money into the pot and say: ‘We will pay you off. We are not going to actually do anything about the system. We will let the system roll on because it is too hard for us to do something about it.’
So what happened? As usual, Labor came into government and we said that we wanted to do something about it. But we want to do it in such a way that there is not going to be a double-dip, that when we make the reforms we do not come here and see that the Liberal Party and the National Party say: ‘Yes, but we are going to disallow your regulation anyway. We want to keep the charges lower so that we keep the subsidy, because they should be subsidised.’ This is the proposition which is effectively being put: ‘You, as government, go and put the money in and do the reform and then we will tell you whether we will pass your regulation for an appropriate charging regime.’
For years the coalition talked about full-cost recovery. But they avoided dealing with all of the issues by putting a subsidy into the budget and keeping it going, all the while saying, ‘We really want achieve efficiency; we really want to see that these charges are paid for by industry,’ but they were never prepared to bite the bullet. They were never prepared to go down the road and say, ‘Here is a way that we can achieve it, where you the industry make a contribution towards it and we all accept that at the end of the day there is cost recovery and you get the greatest benefits that we can achieve.’
We established in our inquiry that many of the charges that are imposed on the exporters are imposed because the importing country requires them. The biggest charges, which are costs imposed on our system, are because there is respect for our system. We have a system of quarantine inspection which is respected overseas, and that costs money.
In the evidence before the committee in the hearings we were told that if this regulation were disallowed there would be a $103 million black hole in the Quarantine Biosecurity budget. Those opposite are saying that the government should just put that up, but at the same time we should be funding all of the work that is necessary to achieve efficiencies in the system. At the end of the day, what is a promise from them? Have I heard an ironclad, believable commitment that then they will agree to full cost recovery? No. I know that a reasonable minister would be saying, ‘How could you depend on that?’ What we are again going to see are opportunistic approaches saying that, because someone overseas does not have to pay for their quarantine inspection charges, Australians should not have to pay. Yet that was basically the underpinning of the coalition policy for years: all they did was avoid it with a subsidy that they put into the budget.
As for the shadow minister, Mr Cobb, speaking to the minister yesterday, the suggestion was that he put something concrete forward. What he put forward was: ‘Yes, we will disallow the regulations; we’ll go back to the old fees, and you do the work.’ That is all he put forward. The only person in this debate who has put something to the government to try and take things forward is Senator Milne, who put forward a proposal for an additional $20 million towards effectively subsidising the fees while the work was done.
What we do have from evidence before the committee is that most industry participants want the work done. Most industry participants were keen for the work to be done and indeed had signed up for the work to be done. Frankly, I would have to say that they are in a position now where someone is saying, ‘We can disallow it for you; are you really going to say you don’t want it disallowed?’ And they are saying, ‘Well, we’re happy to have it disallowed as long as we get the work done.’
I do not think a reasonable minister would accept that. I do not think a reasonable minister would accept having a gun held to the head of the Australian government by someone saying, ‘Blow $100 million on your biosecurity budget and put all the work in to put the reforms into the system, but I’m not going to guarantee that you’re going to get full cost recovery then.’ How would the minister be able to convince his cabinet colleagues that it was worth while putting $103 million and more towards this reform when he could not guarantee that at the end of the day there would not be a further drag on the budget for these services—even though there has been a longstanding agreement within both parties that, underpinning it all, there should ultimately be cost recovery? We are dealing here with political opportunism which really does tell the government that it cannot trust those opposite to deliver full cost recovery, even if it puts the work in, even if it spends $100 million, $150 million or $200 million towards achieving that.
I did think that the comments made by Senator Fielding with regard to Senator Milne and the Greens were unfortunate. I have a lot of disputes with the Greens on a range of issues—we do not agree on a lot of things—but I thought that he had, frankly, quite a cheek to suggest that the Greens had come to this issue with some ulterior motive. It demonstrated that Senator Fielding came to the debate not understanding—of course, if you had heard Senator Milne’s contribution you would understand—where Senator Milne was coming from in terms of her rearing, her family background and the interests she has. I fully accept that Senator Milne and Senator Siewert in particular in the Greens have close contacts with rural industry, and the last thing I would suggest is that somehow they would come to a debate such as this or any rural debate without some regard, whatever their other views, for rural industry. I do think that Senator Fielding should reflect carefully on what he said. I thought it was very unfair, I thought it was very unreasonable and I thought he lowered the tenor of the debate as a result. I think if you reflected on what you said you would say something quite different.
What Senator Milne did in seeking a resolution of this matter was to make a proposal to take this matter forward so we would actually make progress. What those opposite are now doing is leaving us with a proposition where it is clear that this regulation will be disallowed. The minister will then be faced with having to convince his ministerial colleagues that it is worth putting more money into this area to achieve the reforms that everyone wants, but he cannot guarantee that that will result in the aim which he started out to achieve—that is, that the costs incurred in the provision of export inspection services be paid by the beneficiaries of those services and not the taxpayer. That puts him in a difficult position. I do not know what decision he will ultimately come to.
I do hope that, when this matter is dealt with, those opposite, the minor parties, whoever, decide that they can come to a resolution of this matter which gives certainty to the government that enables us to pursue these reforms in a way that is equitable to the taxpayer as well as to the industry. I would urge senators not to support the disallowance. It is pretty clear that the coalition are committed to it. It is clear that Senator Fielding is committed to it. I understand Senator Xenophon, who cannot be here because he is not well, is not prepared to oppose the disallowance, and that is unfortunate, but I am not going to comment on that; I do not fully understand why. That is what we have to live with and, at the end of the day, it may be that the reforms this industry wants just get left sitting on the shelf because it is too hard for those opposite.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT CONTROL (FEES) AMENDMENT ORDERS 2009 (NO. 1)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,25,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2009-09-15,"—I just want to quickly sum up this debate and I thank those who have made a contribution to it. At the end of the day, it is Australia’s farmers who are going to pay the bill for this. It is Australia’s farmers who will pay the bill. We have seen from what is happening in the dairy industry at the moment that, when there is a shift in costs in the industry, the farmers pay. The Grain Council said the farmers would pay. The beef processors said the farmers would pay. It depends on what savings would be achieved, but the farmers are going to pay the bill for this.
What we would like to see is a genuine reform process. That is what we are asking for. We are happy to talk; we have said that in our contributions. What we do not want to see is farmers paying for government to reform itself. That is what they believe is going to happen and that is what we believe is going to happen. So let us have a genuine process, let us deal with it properly, and make sure that Australia’s farmers, who are contributing so much to the economy this country, who are exporting up to $30 billion worth of product on an annual basis, do not end up footing the bill for the process that the government has put in place which can only be described as flawed.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2009-09-15,"—Last month on the Sunshine Coast over a thousand people gathered at the University of the Sunshine Coast Sports Stadium to mourn the passing of and to celebrate and talk about the life of an amazing woman, Dr June Canavan. Dr Canavan and her friend Keith Gracie, a local builder from the region who shared her strong community involvement, were killed in a plane crash on their way to fulfil a dream, a dream they shared with all the people who wanted to walk the Kokoda Trail. The sports centre was festooned with yellow flowers and many of the people who were there were dressed in Dr June’s favourite sunny colour. So many people were there to share their own experiences of Dr June: Olympic and national sports people, families and schoolchildren. They were all people who had had some contact with a woman who had truly changed their lives. As part of the process, her family, who had been overwhelmed by the support that they had received and by the outpouring of love and of grief, had put up a website on which they encouraged people to put forward their own experiences of Dr June. The website is truly an amazing place, Mr Acting Deputy President Humphries. If you get the chance, and I encourage anyone to do this, go to this website and learn about Dr June Canavan and the difference that she made.
Several words kept coming up consistently on the website about this woman, who turned to medicine late in her life, was a native of Wangaratta, having been born there and having gone to school there after which she did not go immediately into studying medicine. She went out and did other things and then turned to medicine in her 20s. As one of the website contributors said, she might not have been the absolute brightest student but she had enough heart for the whole class and turned into a truly remarkable doctor. People talked about the way that so many turned to Dr June for medical help and then turned into friends. Consistently it was stated how Dr June ‘was first my doctor and then my friend’ and how Dr June made such ‘a difference in my life’. They talked about the process by which she actually changed lives. They spoke consistently of her smile: ‘By all the things in life that you did you made me smile’ and ‘You created miracles every day.’ The process confirmed the fact that Dr June truly believed in working with and caring for her patients. There were many comments about the way in which she listened to the needs of the patient. She listened to her patients and then, as we saw consistently, she left ‘no stone unturned in the way she sought to find ways to help people to make the choices that they had to make’. She ‘always made it easy to understand what was occurring with my injuries and she showed so much compassion’. She was a ‘truly caring doctor’:
She took the time to actually listen to what her patients were saying and to keep searching for an answer when other doctors would have given up long ago.
Many people, particularly her professional peers, talked about her stubborn tenacity and her relentless pursuit to make sure that people reached their goals. She was a ‘wonderful caring doctor and true friend’ who ‘gave real hope and help when we were out of options’.
Dr June was killed when she was in the middle of a process that she had put in place in June 2008, launching a project called ‘Klocking up the Ks’. Her aim was to climb five mountains whose names all began with the letter K during 2009 and to achieve sponsorship for each step that she took for the cause of the St Jude orphanage, which had been set up in Tanzania. Mr Acting Deputy President, you may well know the story of St Jude’s. It was set up by an Australian woman as an orphanage and, as the School of St Jude, is looking at education for people with genuine disadvantage in Tanzania. Gemma Sisia, the woman who set it up, has recently toured Australia seeking further sponsorship and she met with Dr June at that time, leading to the five-Ks plan. The process that Dr June had put in place had been almost completed. She had climbed Kiel Mountain, outside the Sunshine Coast, Mount Kosciuszko and Mount Kinabalu, and had been on her way to Kokoda. This process was going to end with climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and at that stage Dr June was hoping that she would have about $50,000 to put towards her chosen charity.
The community around the Sunshine Coast were caught up in her program to raise this money because she was such a strong community person who drew people into her circle and encouraged them to take up hope. One of the contributions left on her website was put there by the students of grade 6TS at St Thomas’s School Mareeba, in Far North Queensland. I quote it now because I think the kids have actually poured out their own feelings about what happened to their new friend, Dr June:
Dr June visited our class last term and we feel very privileged to have met her. She was very inspirational as she explained her goals and told us about the school of St Jude. We thought she was very kind-hearted, adventurous and generous. Because of Dr June, our school is participating in ‘Klocking up the Ks’ by running laps of our school oval each week for 6 weeks, and collecting money as sponsorship and donations. We are trying to run as many kilometres as Dr June was planning to climb. We have painted a mountain and are keeping track of our progress. We are now even more committed to raising money for the School of St Jude so we can honour the memory of Dr June. We are even thinking of having an annual fundraising event so we can always remember Dr June. We feel very lucky that we had the chance to meet such a wonderful person who had such an enthusiasm for life and for helping others.
Another contribution to the website was from the Mountain Creek State School Student Council, students and staff. It talked about the way Dr June was concerned with sport and how she was known so far and wide for her interest in sports medicine. It said:
Sport was important to you. You inspired athletes who, like you, wouldn’t settle for the ordinary or the mundane, but aimed for the stars. You would diagnose, treat and ensure a successful recovery to allow athletes to return to high performance of body and mind. You always gave your time so willingly.
And that was a consistent message. Someone said that she was probably the busiest person she ever knew, but, in giving up time to be there to help someone throughout their illness or some bad times, Dr June was always there for them.
John Mendoza, ex-CEO of the Mental Health Council, was a good friend of Dr June Canavan and put a tribute on the website. They were friends, they had worked together in the sporting area, but what John talked about in his tribute was something that I feel very strongly about—that is, the issue of mental health. I quote from John’s tribute:
In 2005, at the time of the release of “Not for Service” Report June rang me and said she would do whatever she could to support the messages from the report about the woeful state of mental health services in Australia. She had numerous first hand experiences of helping patients and their families and managing serious episodes of mental illness with little or no access to acute care services. She was there 24/7 for those who needed her.
It went on to say that June put her enthusiasm into practice and that with her knowledge of sports medicine she was a true expert who understood the serious risks and consequences that come from participation in elite sport from a mental health perspective. He goes on to say that she was always looking at learning and self-development, and in 2007 at the age of 57 she enrolled at the University of Lausanne to do a doctorate on the issues around the impact of elite sport and mental health.
It is so important that we as a community know the difference that Dr June Canavan made to so many people. Her family at this wonderful service on the Sunshine Coast talked about her importance to them, the way she was always there for her family, and the inspiration she was for people to move onwards and do better and achieve their goals. There was a great deal of sadness among the community with the passing of Dr June Canavan; she made a genuine difference to so many lives. She set goals for herself and for other people and she helped people to achieve those goals. The world was a much better place for the work that June Canavan did in her life—naturally for the area of sports medicine, and most particularly for so many patients who relied on her—and I give my messages of sympathy and also celebration to her family. I thank June Canavan for her life.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Dr June Canavan</title>,Adjournment,27,1,speech
