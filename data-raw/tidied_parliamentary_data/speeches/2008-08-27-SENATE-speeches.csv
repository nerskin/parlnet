"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-08-27,"—I rise to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2008. I indicate from the outset that the coalition will support this bill. It is an omnibus bill that makes a range of amendments to the Migration Act 1958, the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Act 2007 and the Customs Act 1901. These amendments come about as a result in part of some court decisions last year and over a period of time since then. I think it is fair to say that, in some of the cases, the coalition when it was in government was looking at amendments of a similar nature to address these decisions.
I turn firstly to schedule 1. Schedule 1 of the bill will streamline the procedures for notifying the parties of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. The current notification procedures have been the source of considerable litigation over some years. The coalition notes that schedule 1 of the bill was also intended to reinstate effective time limits for applying to the courts for judicial review of migration decisions. The current time limits in the Migration Act have been made largely ineffective as a result of the April 2007 High Court decision of Bodruddaza v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the July 2007 full Federal Court decision in the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and SZKKC.
The government’s new amendments will remove schedule 1 of the bill. It has come to light that the bill as drafted would not have worked appropriately in relation to decisions which have no merit review rights attached. The coalition understands that further consideration is required to determine how best to reinstate effective time limits for all judicially reviewable decisions. That is a fairly straightforward process and one which the coalition supports.
Schedule 2 of the bill clarifies the requirement for operators of aircraft and ships to report on passengers and crew prior to entering Australia via the advanced passenger processing system and establishes an infringement notice regime. This is a very important part of border protection. When I was Minister for Justice and Customs I dealt with it from the Customs angle and saw firsthand the very good system we have in place in relation to advanced clearing of incoming passengers to Australia. It is therefore very important, both from the immigration side and the customs side, that we have streamlining in relation to this and that we have an infringement regime which applies to noncompliance. The government’s amendments will insert a new subsection at the end of sections 64ACD and 245N of the Customs Act 1901 to make it clear that an operator of an aircraft or ship is liable to separate prosecution under these offence provisions in relation to each individual passenger and crew member rather than in relation to each journey not reported on prior to arrival in Australia.
Schedule 3 of the bill makes a number of minor amendments to the act to clarify immigration clearance of non-citizen children born in Australia, compliance with visa conditions and the operation of certain provisions relating to bridging visas. That again is a technical amendment and one which is needed.
Schedule 4 of the bill includes measures that aim to increase protection for clients who engage offshore migration agents, by enabling the department to refuse to communicate with those offshore migration agents when there are concerns about their professionalism, competence, conduct or character. Schedule 4 of the bill was not considered urgent at the time of the bill’s introduction; however, the legislation must now be passed quickly due to the full Federal Court’s decision on 17 July in Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.
In relation to migration agents offshore, the situation is one where we have an accreditation process but we do not have the jurisdiction, extraterritorially, to legislate as such. So it is important that we have in place an ability for the department to take some action where it thinks that the migration agent concerned is not competent or professional or where there is some question as to their character.
I mentioned the case of Sales v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. The issue there was more to do with cancellation of visas, on the basis of character. Of course, it is important that the minister have an ability to cancel any visa on the basis of character. What happened in the Sales case was that, due to the technical interpretation of whether a visa was granted or held, there was a setting-aside of a decision in relation to Mr Sales. It is important that this is remedied, because the minister should have that ability. The coalition certainly support that and we support these amendments in the bill.
Schedule 5 seeks to clarify the meaning of certain provisions in the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 and the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Act 2007. The amendments also aim to ensure that Australian citizenship law is consistent with our international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness 1961, and that again is fairly straightforward.
For the range of reasons that I have outlined, the coalition supports this bill. In some part, it sets straight the situation as a result of previous court decisions where the interpretation of the courts was not as we had anticipated. I understand the government has some amendments to bring in relation to this bill. I will deal with those when we come to them in the committee stage. I can foreshadow that from what we have seen of the amendments they seem to be fairly straightforward, but best I leave my remarks to the committee stage in relation to them.",SENATE,"<title>

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2008-08-27,"—I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Removal of the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements and National Governance Protocols Requirements and Other Matters) Bill 2008. The opposition will not oppose the passage of the bill at the second reading. We support the bill, but of course there is one important exception that I flagged in an earlier debate in this place. Therefore, I give notice that I will move an amendment on behalf of the opposition at the committee stage of the debate. I understand that the proposed amendment has been circulated for the benefit of honourable senators.
This is a debate about the level of accountability that universities owe to those who fund them—that is, the parliament and of course the Australian taxpayer. The coalition’s amendment that I will move at the committee stage of the debate will seek to ensure that universities and other higher education providers continue to meet what are termed ‘national governance protocols’ as a condition of their increased funding. In short, national governance protocols are protocols or standards of governance and accountability in the administration of universities that are required to be met as a condition of funding. The amendment will put back what should never have been taken away.
The opposition’s amendment that I will introduce will require universities and other higher education providers to keep meeting the national governance protocols as a condition of increased funding under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. It will retain the provision that, for additional funding, the minister must be satisfied that the provider meets the requirements known as the ‘national governance protocols’. In the event that the minister is not satisfied that the protocols have been met, he or she can apply a penalty. This mechanism is necessary because the opposition believes that the protocols should be supported by the parliament with incentives, financial incentives, for universities and other higher education providers to strive for excellence and best practice in university governance.
Importantly, the coalition’s amendments in no way affect the government’s amendments to remove the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements from force. In fact, in a recent instrument the government has already removed the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements from the relevant regulations, and the opposition did in fact support that change. There was argument earlier on in this place about certain regulations being disallowed. Much of that debate is now irrelevant because those regulations have been removed—with, indeed, the opposition’s consent.
If the coalition’s amendments are not successful, the opposition intends to oppose the government’s bill currently under debate before the Senate—that is, if the amendment fails, we will oppose the entire bill. In essence, the opposition will not support any legislation that removes increased funding levels of 7½ per cent conditional on meeting National Governance Protocol provisions. It is fair to ask: why does the opposition believe in maintaining the National Governance Protocols for universities and higher education providers? The opposition is committed to retaining the National Governance Protocols because we are committed to ensuring accountability in the way the taxpayers’ money is spent and to encouraging professionalism and best practice in the way our universities are governed. The Commonwealth will provide nearly $9 billion to the higher education sector this year alone. The government, on behalf of taxpayers and the entire community, clearly has a stake in this debate, an interest in ensuring good management of universities and a responsibility to see public money administered and spent in a wise and transparent manner. This is about accountability.
Concerns about the standards of governance at universities were expressed as early as 1995 in the Hoare review. They were echoed in the 2002 Victorian government review of higher education and, most consequentially, in the 2002 review, conducted by the then Minister for Education, Science and Training and current Leader of the Opposition, Dr Nelson, called Higher education at the crossroads. All these reviews came to the conclusion that universities need not only to improve their internal governance but also to be seen to lift their standards so the public’s confidence in them can be maintained. This conclusion was born out of specific concerns that the old-style university boards, filled with politically appointed amateurs, were no longer coping with the demands of running modern universities in an increasingly globalised, business-savvy and, indeed, competitive world. Universities were not seen to be accountable for the increased public funding they were attracting. Internal university governance was not transparent and, indeed, not professional enough.
I have served on a university board and I know Senator Carr has as well, and I think we did our best. I am not sure I added a lot to the process; perhaps Senator Carr added more. But this is not a partisan debate in that sense. I think that it is fair to say that professionalism was lacking from university governance until recent times. National Governance Protocols were instituted by the previous government in order to remedy this state of affairs by tying the increase in funding to universities that happened to improve their internal governance according to these protocols. The protocols ensured various things. For example, the protocols require that members of the governing bodies act in good faith and in the best interests of the university as a whole—that is in protocol 3—and mandate that the size of governing bodies must not exceed 22 members—that is in protocol 5. I think that when Senator Carr and I were serving on the board of the Australian National University the membership of that board was something approaching 40 or 50, which was not an appropriate figure for good governance. How the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Chubb, and the Chancellor, Professor Baume, made it work says more about their ingenuity, I think, than about my contribution.
The protocols also set out the appointment, induction and professional development of members—that is in protocols 4 and 6. This is all about governance, administration, transparency and, indeed, accountability. It is true that universities are not, of course, primarily businesses. However, the funding they receive, from both public and private sources, necessitates that they be run in a more professional way according to best practice, including by people with appropriate business and commercial expertise.
I note that the Minister for Education, Ms Gillard, in her second reading speech introducing this bill into the House of Representatives, said of the previous government’s approach that they were:
… the worst manifestations of the distrust that the Howard-Costello government had for our universities. They thought they knew best how to run workforce management in universities and how to govern those institutions. This was another manifestation of their born to rule mentality and their contempt for their fellow Australians.
I assure the Senate that this is not a question of distrust and certainly not a question of a born-to-rule mentality. This is a question of accountability.
—Senator Mason, on that brilliant note I ask you to seek leave to continue your remarks. I need to swear Senator Sherry in.
—Of course. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2008-08-27,"—Thank you, Mr President; the pleasure was all mine. Mr President, can I add my congratulations on your election. I know you will do a terrific job as our President and it will be wonderful to work with you. I also congratulate Senator Sherry on his swearing-in.
—Thank you very much.
—To continue the second reading debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Removal of the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements and National Governance Protocols Requirements and Other Matters) Bill 2008, I say that this is not a question of distrust or a born-to-rule mentality on behalf of the opposition; this is a question about accountability for nearly $9 billion of public funds. The taxpayers who provide billions of dollars every year—as well as private donors—expect greater accountability for the way their money is spent.
I note that Ms Gillard, in her second reading speech, also said:
At the same time that it was ordering universities around, the previous government failed on the very matter it had direct responsibility for. It presided over a massive decline in public investment for our universities—
and so on. I should just correct this. It paints a very misleading picture of the health of our university system and should be corrected. First of all, the previous government’s funding for the higher education sector increased significantly over its term in office, from $4.2 billion in 1995-96 to $6.7 billion in 2007-08, an increase of 60 per cent, or 13 per cent in real terms. But of course the government is stuck in the old socialist paradigm: unless it is public funding, it somehow does not count. In reality, universities today have access to far higher levels of revenue than ever before and from many different sources. That is what has changed. It is estimated that the total revenue available to higher education institutions from all sources was $13 billion in 2004, almost $5.1 billion or 65 per cent more than in 1996. That is the change: the mix going into higher education has changed significantly. What this points to is that, because of government spending combined with the ability of Australian universities to attract funding from other sources, total tertiary education funding is actually above the OECD average—1.6 per cent of GDP in Australia versus 1.4 per cent, which is the OECD average.
Finally, I note that Ms Gillard also said in her second reading speech:
While the governance protocols will be removed as a condition of funding, the government will of course encourage universities to pursue good governance practices and increase productivity and efficiency.
You might ask: ‘How will the government ensure that universities continue to adhere to the best governance standards if it does not have any power to enforce those standards—in other words, if there is no sanction for following those standards?’ If the principle of self-regulation is so good and so worth while, will the government apply it, for example, to corporate regulation? After all, if it is good enough for universities, which receive nearly $9 billion a year of taxpayers’ funding, why should it not be good enough for corporations, which do not? And why is the Minister for Education rallying for the freedom of universities to manage their own affairs with respect to governance but at the same time trying to lock them into more rigid arrangements through university compacts which can set the agenda for universities for years ahead—certainly in the medium term?
The question you need to ask is: ‘Why is Labor against these governance protocols that ensure accountability?’ It is clear that it is in the best interests of the government, the Australian taxpayer and business donors to ensure accountability, transparency and increased professionalism in the way university governing bodies spend money. Furthermore, universities have been supportive of the protocols in the past—surprise, surprise! Let me quote from a joint submission from the University Chancellors Council and Universities Australia to the review of national governance protocols just last year. They said:
The view of the Chancellors and Vice Chancellors is that the existing National Governance Protocols have worked well and that little variation is needed at this stage.
They continued:
It is clear, however, that the effect of the Protocols has been positive overall and has prompted improvements in a number of areas, including in some cases the induction and continuing instruction of members of governing bodies. They have also been helpful in clarifying the respective roles of governing bodies and the executive in the governance framework.
It is highly supportive stuff. They went on to say:
The introduction of the Protocols has provided a useful focus for discussions among Chancellors and Vice Chancellors on governance issues. Some would also give them credit for a renewed focus on risk management and the relations with controlled entities.
On the question of whether the protocols have had any negative impacts on universities, the chancellors and vice-chancellors had this to say:
Not of any significance. They have increased the cost to Universities of compliance. However, to this point, Chancellors and Vice Chancellors have not seen this as a matter of major concern.
So we have a policy that has worked and has the support of all the stakeholders, yet Labor is hell-bent on abolishing it and turning back the clock for Australian universities. I think it is a good idea that when people serve on university boards they are, as the protocols say, ad personam—that they represent themselves and the university, not another governing body, not another professional body, not a trade union, but that they are there in the interests of the university and the university alone in a personal capacity.
If this is indeed the case then I am concerned about this bill. It represents an example, perhaps a scandalous example, of what the supposedly new Labor stands for, which just like old Labor puts the interests of unions and their finances above other interests—in this case the interests of universities, students, taxpayers and accountability to the public. Sure, some universities might like this idea because they, particularly, would not want accountability. That is not their major aim; their major aim is to spend money as they will. I am not as concerned about universities as I am about the taxpayer and making sure there is accountability to the Australian public and the Australian parliament. That is the issue here. It is far more significant than any other issue. The issue is accountability.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (REMOVAL OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE PROTOCOLS REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-08-27,"—I rise today on behalf of the Australian Greens to support the Higher Education Support Amendment (Removal of the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements and National Governance Protocols Requirements and Other Matters) Bill 2008. The bill effectively repeals a provision in the Higher Education Support Act which tied university funding to compliance with workplace relations requirements and governance requirements. The Australian Greens did not support this provision when it was introduced by the previous government; it was bad policy then and it is bad policy now.
I listened carefully to the contribution from the opposition. The point is not accountability; the point is tying everything to funding. It is a punitive provision. It is a bullying provision. The best thing about this legislation, apart from the fact that it removes these punitive provisions in relation to university funding, is that it spells the end, I hope, of that meanness, of that awful culture, that has existed for the last 10 years whereby everybody was threatened with their funding if they did not behave and do as the government told them, regardless of whether it was in the best interests of their university, their school, their community or whatever it was. It became a feature of the Howard government years that people were afraid to speak out for fear of losing their funding. Artists were afraid to say anything because they were in fear of losing their grants money and so on and so forth. In this case it was universities who were told, ‘Either you introduce the AWAs or you do not get your funding. You have these protocols or you do not get your funding.’
It is not an issue of accountability. There is not a single person in this chamber who does not want to make sure that taxpayers’ money is used wisely, that whichever institution or individual receives that money is accountable for the way it is spent, and that it is transparent. I would be supportive of that regardless. This bill does not abolish the protocol that is there. What it does say is that it is no longer tied. There is not that punitive imposition of the government’s will by holding universities to ransom to an ideological perspective. That was what it was about. It was simply holding universities to ransom to an ideological perspective.
Whilst I appreciate the opposition’s contribution in relation to the vice-chancellors, I also draw attention to the fact that in the vice-chancellors review they said:
... it was not wise to apply a “one size fits all” governance model (that extends into areas of management), particularly when the stated object of the Government is to promote diversity ...
We can all quote from various reports about what vice-chancellors may or may not have said. It is quite clear there that they are not saying that the governance protocols en masse have been necessarily bad; what they are saying is that when you impose something and make it a condition of funding you take away the capacity for diversity.
What I hope this bill will signal is a more collaborative and cooperative approach. If there is one thing that I would welcome from this government—apart from a change of position on climate change, which of course I do not need to tell the Senate about—it is the education revolution. I long for this education revolution. We cannot move to a low-carbon economy, we cannot move beyond being a resource based economy where we dig up, cut down and ship away until we invest in education—and public education and in the public interest—and get rid of this notion that all research has to be tied to some commercial outcome. We have lost much investment in public interest research in the last decade and we are not going to get through this transition to a low-carbon economy, we are not going to get to where we need to be, unless we unshackle the brilliance of the minds in our universities to pursue their higher education research without being tied to a commercial objective by funding from some private entity. Yes, there is a role for private investment in universities; I could not agree more. But I am tired of the fact that so much of the research in the universities is now owned in partnership by commercial entities and we are not unshackling that brilliance to go out and pursue public interest research, which has led to some of the major breakthroughs we have seen in this past century and certainly will in the coming century.
I am excited by what I hope will be an education revolution. I am not encouraged at this point, I have to say, by the fact that the government has squibbed the issue of public school funding. There is a big report out today by an academic in relation to that, saying indeed that what we are getting for the next few years in public school funding is precisely the Howard government model and it is simply not good enough. That certainly does not suggest the education revolution is underway in the manner in which I understand revolution. Revolution to me means something exciting and something that throws over the old model; not something that maintains the old model until 2011 or 2012. So we will have plenty to say about the public education model. But in relation to this bill, as I indicated, under the previous government the workplace relations requirements included an obligation for universities to offer AWAs to university staff. In my view that was an unacceptable interference with university independence and a blatant attempt by the former government to impose its industrial relations ideology. We have never supported AWAs in any context and we are glad to see the back of them in this bill.
Similarly, the nexus between funding and governance has to be broken for all the reasons that I have given. I want to see a different culture. I want to see a collaborative, cooperative culture in which we go and talk to universities about how they might envisage the best way to manage their institutions given the changing requirements for how we deliver education in a carbon constrained economy and how we deliver education in the transition to an economy no longer totally dependent on resource extraction, to move into a much more sophisticated and complex economy where knowledge and service industries become much more prominent. So I am looking forward to that kind of collaborative, cooperative effort to encourage good governance and more diversity in our university sector. I am pleased that the opposition at least has given up on the workplace relations requirements. I do not think that it is wise to hang onto imposing the governance requirements through those threats to funding and I indicate now that the Australian Greens will not be supporting the opposition amendments to be moved by Senator Mason.
What I most look forward to is a positive agenda for higher education and a big investment in education in the public interest and in Australia’s best interests. I am aware that the Prime Minister today is making a headland speech. He no doubt will be trying to tell the story of how Australia will look under a Rudd government. I would hope that in telling the story of how Australia will look he will talk about a healthier, happier Australia, an Australia in which everyone has access to high-quality, well-funded public education and where everybody is encouraged to achieve to their highest potential through higher education, whether that is in vocational training or through the university sector. What we need is a country which is innovative, where lifelong learning is encouraged and where we do not have the notion that you leave school and it is all over. Instead, you have an idea that through your whole life you can access education and you can change careers. More than ever before people are going to need to change careers to adapt to a different way of living and a different way of delivering education.
I have posed myself the question: how are we going to deliver education in a carbon constrained world? How are we going to deliver education when the oil price is $150 or $200 a barrel? How are we going to completely transform education delivery through information technology so that wherever you are in a country, no matter how big or how small your community, you can access global learning opportunities. That is what I consider to be an education revolution. Putting computers in schools is a great start, but it is no use offering schools computers if you do not provide them with the funding to rewire and reconfigure their schools to actually make the best use of them. A lot of the costs associated with these things are going to be borne by fundraising efforts by councils and parents and friends bodies around the country. Anyway, what we are seeing with the computers is simply a substitution of the Howard government’s Investing in Our Schools Program, which was stopped. That money is being used for computers. So it is not actually an additional rollout of funding; it is a substitution. Again, it goes across all schools but it does not address that inequity in terms of the reduced share of Commonwealth funding that public schools are getting.
So let us hear the Prime Minister’s headland speech today. Let us hear the new narrative for the country. Let us hear that this country is going to be a kinder, more compassionate, more inspired nation, a country in which we encourage innovation and a massive investment in education from early childhood through to universities, where the old punitive ‘do as we say or we will take away your funding’ mentality is gone, where we have a government that goes out and says, ‘Yes, we want good governance. Yes, we want accountability. Yes, we want transparency. But we are coming to talk to you about it. We are going to collaborate with you about it. We are going to talk about how best to deliver education to the Australian community in this century and we are going to get rid of these awful AWAs and forget that we ever had to deal with them to the extent that is possible given the harm that they have done to the morale in universities and other workplaces around the country.’ I want to look forward and I am very supportive of this legislation. It just goes to show that a change of government can make a difference in some areas and that what was bad policy is now taken off the statutes. Thank you.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (REMOVAL OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE PROTOCOLS REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2008-08-27,"—I think that it is important that we focus our attention on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Removal of the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements and National Governance Protocols Requirements and Other Matters) Bill 2008 today because it represents a critical stage in Labor’s program to remove Work Choices. I am pleased today that Senator Mason has acknowledged the mandate that we achieved in the last election in relation to the Work Choices component of the higher education arrangements, but there are also elements, which I will cover in a moment in responding to Senator Milne’s comments, that apply much more broadly than to just the workplace relations requirements that need to be removed here.
These arrangements, the higher education workplace relations requirements and the national governance protocols, were a core example of the excesses of the Howard government, a core example of their highly interventionist approach in attempting to shift the balance of workplace relations away from workers’ rights and entitlements. In some ways it is quite contradictory to their ideology that choice and flexibility should apply, and I note that in his contribution this morning Senator Mason referred to looking at corporations and what they do. I would like to see where we are requiring a certain board size or other prescription similar to that in relation to our corporations’ arrangements. Here we had perhaps the strongest interventionist approach by the former government in their attempt to shift the balance in workplace relations. I am pleased that today at this stage of a Labor government we are able to deal with not only the workplace relations issues but also the less direct approach taken by the then government and their protocols to try to control the employment relations in higher education.
The bill will amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003, HESA, by repealing the section requiring that higher education providers meet any higher education workplace relations requirements and national governance protocols imposed under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme guidelines. Under section 33.17 a provider would have its basic CGS grant amount reduced by approximately 7.5 per cent if at 31 August each year it failed to satisfy the minister that it had complied with both the higher education workplace relations requirements and the national governance protocols in the previous year—highly interventionist and high level of monitoring of the behaviour of these institutions, in a very inflexible manner.
The higher education workplace relations requirements consist of the following five elements. There is the so-called choice in agreement making, including the requirement to offer Australian workplace agreements to all employees. The abolition of AWAs was a key promise of this government, as I have said; we received that mandate in the last election, and I am glad the opposition has seen that far in its approach today. The other elements are: direct relationships with staff, which prohibits automatic third-party representation; workplace flexibility; productivity and performance; and freedom of association provisions.
I will move on now to the national governance protocols, which are a set of standards primarily covering the size and composition of governing bodies and the duties of governing body members. Repealing the higher education workplace relations requirements and the governance protocols will remove only the conditions on CGS funding. Full funding will be retained by providers. While the national governance protocols will be removed as a condition of funding, the government will continue to encourage universities to adopt good governance practices. This will include pursuing options for a non-legislative focus on governance standards in response to the forthcoming report of the review of the national governance protocols by the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs. We are still serious about looking at outcomes from our educational institutions, and that review process will ensure that it is done in a healthy and constructive environment. We believe that the removal of the requirements as a condition of funding will be welcomed by the higher education sector. As Senator Milne said, we could all sit here today and quote various comments from the sector about the applications of these provisions, and I look forward to further elaboration on some of those points.
I will cover generally the culture of the higher education sector. Senator Carr and I recall the review that the Senate did called Universities in crisis, and I am sure there are many updates that I have not followed as closely in recent years. But I want to touch firstly on Australian workplace agreements. Remember, this was the Howard government’s approach to trying to force growth in the number of Australian workplace agreements. In the early stages they were not particularly popular; they were not the greatest way for employers to manage their day-to-day affairs on the ground. So what the Howard government did next was seek to impose AWAs artificially through its institutional arrangements, such as its funding arrangements for higher education. Through the Senate and through Senate estimates we spent much time trying to get details about the outcomes of AWAs, and the Office of the Employment Advocate had been constrained in the information that it would provide. There was very limited transparency. I recall Senator Mason saying how important he felt transparency should be.
At the end of the day, when we finally had access to the data about what AWAs were actually achieving on the ground, there were some outcomes that I will put before the Senate as a very tidy summary of the impact of AWAs, whether in higher education or across the board. Seventy per cent of them removed shiftwork loadings, 68 per cent of them removed annual leave loadings and 65 per cent removed penalty rates. With my occupational background, as someone who has worked in a sector where penalty rates often significantly supplement low rates of pay for part-time, predominantly female and young workers, I can say that 65 per cent losing penalty rates was an enormous impact on people’s take-home pay. This is why the Howard government was not re-elected.
—We supported their removal in July—why don’t you mention that?
—Let me continue on the impact of AWAs: 63 per cent removed incentive based payments and bonuses, 61 per cent removed days to be substituted for public holidays, 56 per cent removed monetary allowances, 50 per cent removed public holiday payments, 49 per cent removed overtime loadings and 31 per cent removed basic things such as rest breaks from people’s employment arrangements. Senator Mason knows this story and has accepted the mandate we have to remove prescriptive arrangements in the higher education sector that helped roll out Australian workplace agreements. Compared to a system based on individual contracts, collective bargaining offers both fairness, in that it evens up employers’ and employees’ relative bargaining power, and a framework in which employers and employees can effectively negotiate productivity gains. That is the core of our approach. That is the approach we will take not only to the workplace relations aspects of higher education but also to the governance aspects.
It is worth noting the context within which these requirements were imposed by the Howard government in the first instance. Let me paint a different picture from the one that Senator Mason painted in his second reading debate contribution. There was a general decline in the funding levels and morale in the university sector under the previous government. In its report Universities in crisis, released in September 2001, the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee noted some of the key changes in the workplace environment at Australian universities. Between 1990 and 1999, the total number of students increased by around 70 per cent. During this period the number of international students quadrupled and the number of higher degree students tripled. Yet during this period the total number of academic staff was effectively static: 34,184 in 1990 and 34,926 in 1999. And, while overall academic job numbers did not increase much at all, there was an increase in the number of part-time academic staff. As these figures suggest, this period saw a fall in staff-to-student ratios. Along with other changes in the workplace, such as increased reporting obligations and technological change, the increased workload resulted in low morale and high stress levels.
I wanted to stress these factors that have particularly impacted on the university sector in recent times, since they have made that sector particularly unsuitable to the introduction of highly individualistic, confrontational workplace relations models such as Work Choices. The requirements outlined also reflected the previous government’s relations with the university sector and were marked by distrust. Senator Mason said in his earlier contribution, ‘Trust us.’ What has occurred in this sector has been marked by a relationship of distrust.
One of the worst manifestations of this distrust and more general mismanagement of the university sector was the requirement that the universities abide by the requirements that this bill abolishes in relation to Australian workplace agreements. ‘Trust us,’ Senator Mason says, and yet it was the Howard government that introduced these arrangements involving Australian workplace agreements into the university sector. Why did they do it? I still believe they did it because they wanted to artificially pump up the number of Australian workplace agreements. It was nothing to do with good governance in the sector. These were requirements that forced universities to pursue the Howard government approach to workplace relations or suffer financial penalty.
The previous arrangements show that the Howard government thought it knew better than university leaders and staff how to run their institutions. The changes made by the bill will clear the way for the Rudd Labor government to develop healthy new relationships with our universities based on trust and mutual respect and the review I outlined earlier.

Senator Mason interjecting—

—Senator Mason says these comments about Australian workplace agreements are not relevant, but I say they set the culture that has carried over into the government’s requirements. Senator Mason earlier quipped about a socialist approach to matters. Yet what could be a more socialist approach than prescribing the size of university boards, for instance?
The governance arrangements here, as I am sure Senator Carr will outline in a bit more detail, are all about the processes. They are not about measuring outcomes or performance on an outcome basis. This is what our review will ensure will be the case in the future. The end of the workplace relations requirements removed by the bill will clear the way for us to establish healthier and more mutually respectful relations with the higher education sector. This is vital if we are to improve the performance of the university sector. Full Commonwealth grant funding will now flow to the universities if this bill proceeds as it stands rather than as the opposition seeks to amend it. In the future, relations between government and universities should be based around negotiated funding compacts reflecting the distinctive missions of each university. We need that flexibility and we need that diversity.
Senator Mason says, ‘Trust us.’ I think the very nature of these requirements and the arrangements for Australian workplace agreements set the field so that, no, that trust could not occur in the first instance. He suggests an analogy with corporations, yet this could not be more different from the arrangements that would apply to corporations. Senator Mason accuses us of a socialist approach, yet these very arrangements are so interventionist and so prescriptive that they make that comment laughable. Senator Mason, I conclude my comments in this debate on the second reading with an interest in hearing you justify why these governance arrangements should remain, because they seem very contrary even to the principles that you have raised in your comments. I look forward to hearing you discuss them further, but my general point at this stage in the debate is that the previous government, now the opposition, have no track record here. Your form is appalling. The form demonstrated by what was established in both these higher education workplace requirements and the governance requirements is appalling.

Senator Mason interjecting—

—This is not about accountability; this is about the Howard government seeking to impose on universities its view on how universities should be managed. This is all about the Howard government believing it knew better than any of the governance arrangements in the higher education sector—that somehow, sitting here in cabinet in Canberra, you knew what size a university board should be, and that is simply outrageous. I encourage other senators to look closely at the opposition’s proposed amendments, because I think, indirectly, they simply seek to keep alive the prescription and the intervention in the administrative arrangements of universities in a way which undermines trust and improvements in the productivity and outcomes of those institutions.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (REMOVAL OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE PROTOCOLS REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2008-08-27,"—I am really pleased to be able to take part in this debate today because it demonstrates a serious point about the difference between the way our government will approach the area of higher education and communication in this sector and the approach of the previous government. We have already heard a range of issues put forward today in terms of how this piece of legislation, the Higher Education Support Amendment (Removal of the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements and National Governance Protocols Requirements and Other Matters) Bill 2008, will be enacted to ensure that there will be a change to an ongoing process. What we must understand is that the issue of higher education in our community is an ongoing process. This is but one step, but it is a very important step, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President Trood, coming from that industry yourself.
We have heard that we are particularly looking at two elements: the issue of the protocols and the issue of the workplace relations requirements put in place by the previous government around 2005. This was after some discussion with the community and the industry, but all too little, because what we have heard is that, consistently over the last few years, there has been discussion about what the impact of this imposition of process would be on the operations of the universities and, perhaps more importantly than just the operations—and universities are businesses in some sense—on the expanse, the enthusiasm, the energy and the creative elements of universities as educational institutions. In her contribution Senator Milne touched on the importance in our community of having the freedom of academic expression, the freedom of creativity and the freedom to allow people to operate in their own way and work with their communities to come up with an education outcome which is best for all of us but allows individuals to express their own views and their own ways of operation.
When the then government were talking about introducing these limitations and imposing these processes in the 2005 period they talked a lot, as has Senator Mason today, about the issue of accountability. It is very clear that no-one is running away from the element of accountability, because we know that it is a strong responsibility of government to provide public funding for our higher education area. There will be further input during this debate about exactly how effectively funding is made to universities. We know that there is so much evidence on record about the role of public funding in universities and we know that the Howard government, who were insisting quite publicly and strenuously on the issues of accountability, proper processes and effective operations, did not fulfil their own responsibility to the real economic needs and funding processes for education. No matter how you trot out the figures, Senator Mason—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—no matter how you do the graphs and no matter what processes you put in place, there were cuts to the funding for public education in the higher education field in our community over the last few years. That is without question. I do take the point, though, that Senator Mason made earlier about the need for private investment as well as public investment. There is no argument about that.
What we are talking about, however, is the government’s responsibility for the funding program. There has to be an acceptance that the government of the day must take on the responsibility for effective funding of the higher education area—however, not alone. We are not saying that it is either/or. We need to encourage effective private investment in this area as well. All too often under the previous government when we were talking about this area of higher education, and in fact in other areas as well, it had been put forward that you had to have one model or another. There was no availability for flexibility and there was no availability for cooperation. If you did not follow a certain pattern you were flawed and wrong and, depending on the day, you could even be accused of being socialist in your view.
What we need to understand is that we have to engage our community effectively so that there is a wider engagement, ownership and excitement about how higher education can work. That means not just public investment, although the core responsibility of any government in this area must be public funding for universities; we also have to admit that we need to engage other parts of the community so that we can get private funding. We also need a sense that there is a flexibility in models so that people can experiment to an extent to see what best suits the needs of their own region, the needs of their own students and the needs of their own professional areas.
Coming from a regional part of Queensland, I know that it has been particularly difficult to look at the range of university campuses in Queensland, which vary greatly. There is no way that you can say that one model, one process or one set of rules can be applied to all the university programs in Queensland, let alone the whole of Australia. Working in the Darling Downs area with the University of Southern Queensland, I know there have been great difficulties—struggling with reduced funding, with varying campus responsibilities, and also with a focus on pushing students into a number of particular professional areas. Having the flexibility to offer and expand a range of programs and courses would be an incentive to get more people into the higher education area. The imposition of single models of restrictive funding and of particular philosophical approaches actually makes it more difficult for university governance bodies, who are trying to ensure that they can put in place models which best suit their needs locally and encourage more Australians into higher education. It surely must be one of the aims of any government to have more people benefit from the education process.
I will not go on with the term ‘education revolution’ because I think we have heard that on a number of occasions in this place. Nonetheless, the term ‘revolution’ does encourage people to have a certain excitement about the process. I am trying to get across the message that the process in the legislation imposed by the previous government tended to restrict that excitement and that engagement. It put more focus on universities meeting those rules than on their being able to respond to their communities with effective education programs.
There will be discussion today about the range of industrial relations programs that were imposed on the higher education area as a step by the previous government, bit by bit, to ensure that their industrial relations program was rolled out across the higher education community. The higher education area was an easy target to pick on. The higher education area, as we know, has great dependence on the public purse for funding. It was a stroke of brilliance in many ways to say at that time, ‘As a government we have the responsibility to provide funding to the university sector,’ which was accepted, but at the same time use a sector of our community as an experiment in some ways—perhaps by using a scientific approach—in industrial relations policy.
There can be no doubt that the reforms that were rolled out in the higher education workplace relations legislation represented a list of core elements of the previous government’s industrial relations programs. There were snippets of the Work Choices program put in place in this industry. You could tick them off. You could have the focus on AWAs, the lack of flexibility in process, the lack of security, the lack of what was called by the previous government ‘intrusion of third parties’, which we all saw as the involvement of staff associations or workplace associations in helping members. That intrusion policy limited the number of people allowed on university governance boards.
I disagree, Senator Mason, with your assessment of the qualities that you brought to your role as part of a university governing organisation. I am sure that you brought great skills to this area—as indeed so many people did in working on the university governance panels. I know how valuable it was for a range of university areas to have people from the local community, such as local political figures—and local and state politicians were always involved in the universities—and student union people, involved in working on the governance of their university. It was ownership of their workplace.
However, that was one of the core areas that had to be reduced in the changes that the previous government imposed in their one-size-fits-all model. They told universities across the country what the size, shape, role, background and experience of their university governing panels must be. The same process of governance, ownership and imposition went through to the way that the workers were involved in those universities. This included workplace relations, conditions, how they could interact with their employer, whom they could involve when talking with their employer and how they could interact when developing workplace agreements—all those things that are part of the daily operations of a workplace.
Once again, the government of the day did that without any shame and without trying to hide it—there was no element of the previous government that tried to hide what they were doing. What they were doing through their workplace relations policy in the university and higher education sector was putting in place exactly what they hoped to do in the rest of the Australian community. However, at no time did we on this side of the chamber, the Labor Party, accede to that. We did not support it. We asked questions about the link between the workplace relations situation in universities and their funding. We consistently asked questions from the time that these reforms were first rolled out.
There is no surprise in this debate, either. We are working through exactly the same issues that we worked through when the previous government imposed this legislation. What we are saying is that there is a key difference in the way that we believe that universities should be funded and how that is linked to their governance. There is a clear difference in the way we believe that workplace relations should operate on university campuses.
The time has come to put this clearly into our legislation. We have listened to all the issues, fears and complaints that were raised in the range of Senate committee inquiries that went on when this legislation was brought in. What is on the agenda today is to once and for all break the key linkage between funding and people imposing from outside what they think should occur in governance and in workplace relations. That is not running away in any sense from the core issue of accountability. There is not a single university governing body or community in this country that does not acknowledge their obligation to the government, to the student and to the community to have responsible practices.
Senator Mason pointed out that the protocols were put together by many of the universities. That is laudable. The kinds of things that they talked about will be, as Senator Collins pointed out, considered in the ministerial council response. However, that is not saying that the protocols should be linked to the funding. This is not an argument as to whether there should be protocols or special arrangements at individual campuses for how they interact with their communities. We do not say that that is not right. What we are saying is that linking the imposition of a set of rules on workplace relations with genuine funding that enables them to continue their job is wrong. That stifles the ability of the universities to be effective in their own way and has a punitive element to it.
We have heard already in the discussion today the word ‘trust’ mentioned many times. The previous legislation made a public statement that there was no trust between the government and the university governing bodies and communities around this country. The government basically said: ‘We felt that they could not be trusted to effectively implement their own arrangements on governance and on workplace relations. We felt that there had to be an intrusion from the government such that if you do not follow our model you will not be funded.’ And the government clearly understood that these universities—as they have told us many times—rely almost totally on the effective use of public funding to continue their operations.
If the people who are running the budget tell the universities—which are desperately trying to continue to operate—that unless they fulfil these rules they will not be funded, it is pretty easy to see that the response would have to be compliance. And that is what happened. Despite the concerns that were raised, despite the worries of the people who were working in the institutions and despite the concerns of people who had worked at different times in the area and came back and said that they did not like what was happening or the constraints that were being put on them or the fact that they were not able to make their own decisions—despite all that—the universities had to respond. Despite the public concern, despite the evidence that came to the Senate inquiries and despite the concern of people writing in the international press about how education could be maintained in a free and effective way, the universities and the vice-chancellors—to maintain their existence and to be able to continue operating—had to respond.
The opposition maintains that that is an argument in favour of keeping them—because all the universities worked to the protocols and used the higher education workplace relations system. Of course they did, or they would not have been able to operate. It is an odd argument to say that they did it and so therefore they must keep operating in the same way, when you know that their only way of keeping their funding and continuing was to meet the requirements.
In terms of where we go next I think it is particularly important, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, that we maintain the professional respect that we have for the university sector in this country, that we acknowledge that they are effective managers in many cases and that they do know what the professional needs of their community, their students and their workplace are. That does not mean that we do not expect that there are responsible business operations and that people are responsible to the government for ensuring that they run their business well.
What we hope to have and what we hope we will be able to work effectively towards in a whole-of-government way is a dynamic relationship between the higher education sector, the government and the community. This means that we will be open to and that we will be encouraging wider community financing and wider community involvement, but that we will also recognise that the ongoing response of strong government is to ensure that there is an effective higher education sector in our community. If we do not do that, we are actually not fulfilling our responsibility to our community and to our young people. It will be a particularly challenging time so that our research, our education process and our ability to be a higher education nation can be done together not only with a degree of trust but also with an understanding that we are working together in this process.
In terms of where we go next it is important that there is an understanding that there is knowledge in our university sector, that they are not some kind of irresponsible group that do not understand how they should operate to ensure that they are doing their job effectively. If we do not have that trust, we will immediately go back to a situation where we are just issuing demands and orders and there is some kind of automatic response. That is not what we expect from the area that should be responsible for creative thought, creative industry and a dynamic future for our whole country.
It is important that these higher education workplace relations requirements and national governance protocols are removed from law. That is not to say that there is not an understanding that there need to be high results in the sector. What it says is that this punitive and, I think, very outmoded process of linking behaviour to money automatically—this constraint of individual and flexible approaches—should not be part of the education future for our country.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (REMOVAL OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE PROTOCOLS REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2008-08-27,"—I rise today to provide a contribution to the debate relating to the Higher Education Support Amendment (Removal of the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements and National Governance Protocols Requirements and Other Matters) Bill 2008, which goes to the removal of the infamous HEWRRs—the higher education workplace relations requirements.
The main objective of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 by repealing section 33.17, although there are some other minor technical changes too. Under the previous government, this section imposed on all higher education providers various funding conditions, under both the HEWRRs and the national governance protocols. This section provided for the government being able to reduce the higher education providers grant for Commonwealth funded places under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme if that provider was found not to have meet the HEWRRs and the governance protocols by the compliance date specified in the CGS guidelines.
—They are gone. I don’t want to keep saying this. They are gone. Legally, they don’t exist.
—Senator Mason, I take your interjection. What we are actually talking about here is a future and a way forward under the Labor Party—under our government—now. I know it might pain you to have to talk about history and the past and the way in which you sacrificed higher education for the sake of your ideology in terms of workplace relations and education outcomes, but please at least give me the courtesy of providing my contribution in this debate.
—It is a legal question—not that I’m a good lawyer!
 (Senator Trood)—Order! Please continue, Senator Crossin.
—I will attempt to continue. I understand how painful it may be for people now on the opposition benches to have to trawl through the past and the way in which higher education was gutted, defunded and disregarded under their policies, but now that they are in opposition they are just going to have to sit there and listen to us. Even though it might contain a little bit of history, that is just the way it is while we continue to push forward with our agenda. Sometimes we have to review the way in which policies were treated in the past in order to move forward.
Under the strong arm of the Howard government’s requirements under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, failure to comply by the end of each August would see higher education provider funding reduced by, in some cases, nearly 7.5 per cent. The repeal of section 33.17 removes conditions that were compliant under the CGS funding. It in no way reduces the higher education provider funding. They will retain their full funding but regain their former freedom in how they operate in the areas of workplace relations and governance.
The higher education workplace relations requirements were imposed on providers purely to support the previous government’s ideological workplace relations policies. At a time when they were espousing flexibility in the workplace, at a time when they were trying to abolish pattern bargaining and at a time when they were trying to impose Australian workplace agreements on workers and businesses in this country, they also decided that they would restrict what was happening in the higher education sector.
It is a peculiar sort of ideology here, where under the former government you had the hypocrisy of wanting to ensure higher education workplaces and universities conformed and were restricted in the way in which they could operate, but, out there in the big wide world of industrial relations, flexibility and individuality was being promoted. Quite clearly, Australian voters found this approach to be grossly unfair and unbalanced when they so soundly rejected that party in the November election last year. This government, however, is replacing past policies with a much fairer set of rules and a balanced system and is doing so at the earliest opportunity and removing the previous, unfair Work Choices laws.
The HEWRRs included the requirement that providers offer AWAs to all staff—they had to offer AWAs to all staff; there was no choice at all. If they did not, their funding was restricted. The HEWRRs were implemented along with a whole other set of criteria that universities were forced to offer in their bargaining rounds. Universities had to deal with staff with no automatic third-party representation. As with all the former government’s workplace relations legislation, this simply made it harder for employees to negotiate and bargain their terms and conditions with their employers. It meant extra work for university management too, but the negotiating balance weighed against the workers.
There is another, underlying story to this. This was not just about universities being compelled to comply with the previous government’s ideology on workplace relations policies, and it was not only about trying to offer AWAs across the board. We know, as Senator Collins has said, AWAs had been a resounding failure, since at that stage only one per cent of the employing population had taken up offering AWAs. So this was an attempt by the former government to push their workplace relations policy by force onto the university sector, hoping that AWAs would be taken up by universities and by staff.
The underlying message is that that was an attack on the National Tertiary Education Union, who has repeatedly represented workers very successfully in this industry. It was the third union that had been in the gun sights of the previous government. They started with the MUA with the waterfront dispute, they moved on to the CFMEU with the building industry royal commission and then they decided to move on to the National Tertiary Education Union through the higher education sector. All three attempts of course have failed. Those unions are now stronger, better and richer for that attack by the previous government. There is no doubt that all three unions have continued to survive and will continue to survive, and the National Tertiary Education Union has in fact gone from strength to strength. So the former government’s subliminal attempts to deregulate the workplace and to cut out the trade union movement so successfully representing workers in this area failed.
The removal of the HEWWRs means that there will now no longer be any requirement that higher education providers offer AWAs as a condition of receiving their full funding. Of course, they will not be able to offer AWAs because thanks to our government they no longer exist under law in this country. The previous government thought that this intervention in our higher education institutions would improve their flexibility, productivity and performance—that is the excuse that they gave, not based on any evidence of fact. We know that most universities found it to be a gross interference in the way in which they operated, both as academics and as researchers. Organisations of excellence in this country when it comes to educational and intellectual outcomes, they saw it as yet another attempt by the previous government to have control without responsibility and to try to get more from universities already severely stressed by the ongoing real funding cuts by the Howard government. Let’s remember that in 1996, the very first year of the Howard government, $800 million was gutted from this sector. It has never recovered from those massive funding cuts.
The national governance protocols were a set of standards mainly covering the size, composition and duties of the universities’ governing bodies. It was a one-size-fits-all model. The protocols made it more difficult for certain groups of people to get representation on a university governing body, through size limits and through requiring certain other groups to have representation. So politicians, students and of course trade unions found it harder, if not impossible, to get representation on governing bodies. Even though quite a number of universities still wanted them to be there, they were forced to not be there through the legislation the previous government introduced.
Removal of the national governance protocol requirements in no way indicates that we do not support good, sound governance. But I actually believe universities do operate on a model of sound governance, had done prior to the previous federal government coming into existence and will continue to do so. We will most assuredly continue to encourage the adoption of good governance policies. I am sure our higher education institutes will welcome this change in the way in which they can operate.
The removal of these two elements from the field of higher education funding reflects our public election commitments in this area. Our commitment to remove AWAs from the workplace will be and has been welcomed across the board, not only by higher education providers. In 2005 the AVCC, now known as Universities Australia, opposed HEWRRs, claiming they would be inflexible and intrusive and would increase administrative workloads. This was evident in their submission to the Senate inquiry into the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005. Going back three years, even those who were in charge of universities—vice-chancellors around this country, through the Vice-Chancellors’ Committee—were not impressed and were not supportive of the moves of the previous government.
In the white paper of 2006 on higher education and research—you might remember the infamous Australia’s universities: building our future in the world—Labor promised to end government interference in the internal management of universities and reduce compliance and reporting burdens. So this has been on our statute for quite a number of years. The removal of the governance protocols was one such step towards implementing what was our policy from those years.
This bill reflects our belief that our providers of higher education know best how to operate their institutions and do not need and certainly do not appreciate heavy-handed interference from government in running them. Vice-chancellors are well-educated, very intellectually informed and are good and competent managers. The protocols’ removal will allow our universities to give their time and effort to where it is needed most, and that is in the delivery of good quality teaching and even better research. It is expected that removal of those requirements will also open the way for a more trusting, healthy and cooperative approach between government and higher education.
Let’s be honest; in the years under the Howard government that relationship had certainly not prospered, developed and come to fruition in the way that it would have if there had been a more genuine dialogue between the universities and the federal government. Clearly, we now see the demarcation of the extreme difference between this government’s policies and those of the last, which was increasingly prescriptive, with funding conditions being held over the providers like a big stick.
Our policies remove from our higher education providers the unwarranted and unfair Work Choices requirements and the bullying government interference. The policies remove the previous government’s ideologically driven workplace agenda, and adherence to an interfering, one-size-fits-all governance model.
As I said earlier, the Howard government had seemingly believed that their bullying intervention would squeeze more productivity out of our universities, which were already severely strained by funding cuts over many years. They believed that AWAs would enable university administrators to reduce the terms and conditions of staff. Let’s face it; that is what it was all about. It was not about better quality education or improving research outcomes; it was about reducing the terms and conditions of staff to employ more short-term or casual staff and to try and get more output for less input.
The previous government believed that universities were very inefficient administrators and wasted resources through poor management and governance. Unfortunately, while it was bullying our universities the previous government also presided over a huge decline in public funding for our universities. This is sufficiently well known. From 1996 to 2004, while most other OECD countries increased spending on tertiary education by up to 49 per cent, our government managed to buck the trend in an almighty way. It cut tertiary expenditure by four per cent, forcing universities to rely more and more on student fees for their income. We certainly saw the reduction in public funding in the university sector compensated for by an increase in student fees and a heavy reliance on third-party contributions from business and industry.
The minister pointed out in a speech to the Australian Financial Review Higher Education Conference in March of this year that world governments had been putting an increasing focus on all areas of education, particularly higher education—except here, in this country. Minister Gillard described higher education in Australia as having been ‘subjected to a seemingly random blend of neglect with occasional bursts of ideologically driven interference’, where overall public funding was cut. From my point of view that is a very able synopsis of the scenario over the last 10 years in the higher education industry in this country.
Our universities have had to struggle for the last decade to increase class sizes, cut tutorials and seminars, and cut out some courses altogether. Infrastructure maintenance has been neglected, leaving a huge backlog in this area. Financing has become chaotic and unsustainable, based on an ever-increasing fee burden and reliance on revenue from overseas students—a dangerous situation indeed as more countries invest in higher education and compete for these students.
Can I just say that my study tour to China some two years ago, where I investigated and researched the impact of the funding decline in higher education on Chinese students coming to this country, highlighted to me that the decisions that we have made in this country, to defund and neglect higher education, ripple around the world. I think it was a point that was lost on the previous, Howard government. Certainly Chinese public servants and credible representatives from their Ministry of Education were saying to me, ‘While ever you neglect higher education in your country it has an amazing impact on where our students choose to study.’ The students do not come to Australia because it is cheap. They want to come to Australia because the quality is good, and they will not come to Australia if they believe that they can get a better deal in other countries around the world. But the previous government failed to realise and appreciate that, of course.
The legacy of this is of course that our higher education system lags behind other OECD countries, and we are now faced with a massive skills shortage. We are falling behind our competitors in graduating numbers in science and agriculture, and even further behind them in engineering and manufacturing. Minister Gillard acknowledged—in her speech on 13 March to the AFR Higher Education Conference mentioned earlier—that, despite the Howard government, our universities have struggled through remarkably well, which is testament to the quality and commitment of our university leaders and the academic community as a whole.
Many of the problems, though, will ultimately require long-term solutions, and this bill before us today is not part of that long-term objective; rather, it is a quick solution to cutting the red tape and administrative work heaped on universities by the previous government. It will release staff for more time in teaching or research—the productive work—rather than in satisfying overly zealous government demands for more and more paperwork and proof of compliance with ever-increasing regulation. The Rudd Labor government will trust universities to manage their own industrial relations affairs within these laws. No longer will they have the threat of losing funds held over them—to the contrary, they will have funding certainty.
The other aspect I want to talk about very quickly is amending the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to make it easier for the approval of a provider to be revoked if or when they fail to meet the required criteria. While our universities are proven quality-program deliverers, this gives more assurance to the students that standards will be maintained by the multitude of other higher education providers which exist nationwide. The quality-auditing arrangements too are amended. The only audit body at present in this country is the Australian Universities Quality Agency. Amendments in this bill change that to allow the Commonwealth to designate additional audit bodies to carry out that role.
In conclusion, I say that the Northern Territory higher education institutions along with all the other higher education institutions in this country will have a major role to play in the long-term success of our education revolution package as we roll this out. In the meantime this bill, as I said, is a good start to representing an immediate improvement in the ability of our higher education providers to really run their affairs and concentrate on quality education. This bill represents a sound starting point for the Labor government to meet our higher education revolution commitments in this country and must be supported.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (REMOVAL OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE PROTOCOLS REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2008-08-27,"—Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President Trood. It is very appropriate that you are in the chair for this debate, because I understand you have a very distinguished academic record and are very concerned about the future wellbeing of Australia’s higher education sector. It gives me great pleasure to speak on this very significant piece of legislation today: the Higher Education Support Amendment (Removal of the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements and National Governance Protocols Requirements and Other Matters) Bill 2008. It is quite a mouthful but well worth saying.
The bill, if passed by the Senate, will remove the Howard government’s extreme workplace relations agenda from our universities. No longer will our tertiary education sector be subjected to legislation which allows for unwarranted government interference. Most importantly, this bill clearly differentiates between the current Labor government and the former Liberal-National coalition government in the area of higher education and our commitment to the higher education sector. I think it is also timely to note that this bill is in the parliament for debate at the same time that there are, I think, 24 collective enterprise agreements in the higher education sector due for nominal expiry at the end of this month. In my life before I was a senator, I had some little involvement in negotiation of enterprise agreements in the higher education sector because I worked for one of the unions that had workers in that sector. I well know how, often, that activity in itself is very resource intensive for the universities. The last thing they need is to have additional government legislation on top of enterprise bargaining negotiations that they have to deal with. I certainly wish the sector well in its negotiations for its next collective enterprise agreements.
Earlier this year, the Rudd government set in motion the rolling back of the former government’s draconian industrial relations laws. Throughout the rest of this year we anticipate further legislation that will continue that great initiative of the government. But now it is time to focus on assisting the university sector, which was very, very hard hit by much of the previous government’s legislation. In April 2005, the former government announced a set of higher education workplace relations requirements for all of Australia’s higher education institutions. These were unheard of requirements, never before having been imposed upon the sector. They were requirements that were not asked for by the Australian public, let alone by the higher education sector, and certainly not wanted by the Australian public or the Australian higher education sector. It was another example of the former government using its Senate majority as soon as it could to impose its will on a sector that was already struggling because of the massive budget cuts that the former government had imposed on the sector.
It was an appalling day. I well remember when the first legislation was put into this parliament to impose these requirements on the higher education sector. Those requirements were referred to as the HEWRRs, as Senator Crossin mentioned earlier. In short, the HEWRRs were strict workplace relations criteria that universities had to comply with in order to be eligible for $280 million worth of assistance funding under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. The first and key element of HEWRRs was that universities were required to offer Australian workplace agreements. As is now well known, AWAs allowed for the safety net to be stripped away from workers without a cent of compensation. Even after the belated introduction of the so-called fairness test by the former government, things like redundancy, long service leave, notice of change of shifts et cetera were not protected under the former government’s legislation.
I have cited these statistics in speeches in the chamber before but they are well worth repeating so I am going to repeat them. These are the statistics about AWAs and how they disadvantage working Australians, including workers in the higher education sector. As we know from the Workplace Authority’s own data, collected at a Senate estimates, 70 per cent of AWAs removed shift loadings, 68 per cent removed annual leave loadings, 65 per cent removed penalty rates; 63 per cent removed incentive based payments and bonuses, and 61 per cent removed days to be substituted for public holidays.
—That’s not relevant to this debate.
—Those statistics are of course relevant to this debate, because they affected workers in the higher education sector, they applied to the awards and the enterprise agreements, and they applied to the AWAs that were offered in the higher education sector which, I have to say, had a very bad take-up rate in the higher education system.
—But they’ve been removed.
 (Senator Trood)—Senator Mason, I am sure that you feel strongly tempted to intervene in this debate but I would be grateful if you would allow Senator McEwen to proceed.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I appreciate your assistance in enabling me to put my position forward on behalf of the government. The HEWRRs also required that university agreements, policies and practices must be consistent with the freedom of association principles contained in the Workplace Relations Act at the time. This in practice meant that agreements in the higher education sector had to be stripped of provisions which the former government interpreted as encouraging union membership. It meant there was no leave to attend workplace meetings or to invite a union representative to come into the workplace to represent you in an industrial situation.
The HEWRRs system gave the ministers for education under the former government unprecedented power. It gave them the power to involve themselves in management of workplaces in the sector. I think other senators who have spoken in this debate today made the point very well—and it is worth making again—that the higher education sector is there to educate people and teach them things. It is not there, and not funded by the government, to impose an industrial relations agenda that it neither wanted nor asked for—and nor did the Australian community want or ask for it to be imposed in the higher education sector. It was disturbing for those of us who had a background in the higher education sector to see the amount of effort, time and wasted resources that universities were forced to use up in implementing the former government’s industrial relations agenda, at the expense of educating our young people so that they could gather those degrees that are necessary for them to have the best possible opportunities in life.
—You should have come to my lectures; you would have enjoyed them.
—I have read your book, Senator Mason; that is as much as I can do with your intellectual activities. I am probably one of the few senators who did read your book.
—You’re the first person I’ve met who did.
—All decisions on the HEWRRs were made directly by the minister, leaving no opportunity to review those decisions. Additionally, the minister was able to unilaterally change the requirements at any time. What an unprecedented level of government interference in the higher education sector! I imagine that someone who did not know of the Howard government’s regressive agenda in this sector would find it very difficult to believe that legislation which allowed for such a huge level of government interference in micromanagement of staff in Australia’s higher education institutions was created—and, further than that, passed—in this chamber. What an abomination it was that the government could use its Senate majority to get into the nitty-gritty of daily management and hiring and firing of staff in universities! Honestly!
When the original legislation establishing the HEWRRs had been created, there was widespread criticism. Of course, that criticism from the sector was ignored by the then government, just as they ignored criticisms of their Work Choices legislation and criticism about VSU, voluntary student unionism—because the sector knew full well what implementation of VSU would mean for it. Of course, the then government ignored criticism of Work Choices to their peril and detriment, and we saw the result of that particular piece of ignorance on the part of the former government in November last year.
I would like to reflect that when the original legislation was introduced in the Senate it was referred to a Senate committee, and there was fierce opposition to the legislation evident through many of the submissions and hearings into that legislation. Some of the criticisms raised at those hearings, particularly by the National Tertiary Education Union, were that the HEWRRs failed to address the real workplace issues being faced within universities, that they lacked appropriate accountability and parliamentary scrutiny, that they created uncertainty and confusion and provoked industrial dissonance within universities, that they gave the federal government unprecedented and unwarranted capacity to interfere in the operation of higher education institutions and that they did not assist Australia’s higher education institutions with respect to the quality of learning, research and outcomes for students and employees. They were specifically focused industrial relations initiatives designed on the basis of placing conditions on access to funding to allow the government to force its industrial relations agenda on the sector.
The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, now known as Universities Australia—which, of course, is the body that essentially represents the management and administration of the universities—also opposed the introduction of the HEWRRs. In their submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education, that organisation said:
The HEWRRs are very intrusive in terms of universities’ capacity to manage their internal affairs. The HEWRRs proposal constitutes a ‘one size fits all’ approach, whereas the AVCC takes the view that the focus should be on desired outcomes, rather than specific industrial processes and particular industrial instruments.
But, as I noted previously, this criticism and many others were completely ignored by the former government. The coalition was determined to implement its ideological industrial relations agenda in as many sectors as possible, and it saw the higher education sector as one where it could possibly have some success. I was pleased to note the vehemence of the opposition from the sector to the government’s agenda, and of course it came to fruition in the low take-up of AWAs in the sector. HEWRRs required universities to implement the Howard government’s workplace relations agenda. Failure to meet the HEWRRs and the protocols resulted in a reduction of the provider’s Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding. This bill will finally remove that requirement from the legislation.
It was outrageous that the former government forced universities to run workforce management in their regressive way or face reduced funding. Somebody before me mentioned bullying. A lot of people have mentioned bullying in this context, and it was bullying at its worst. It is a great thing that Labor is now in government and is able to clearly say that we will not stand for that sort of bullying and interference in the workplace. The removal of the HEWRRs legislation will not only put an end to this bullying and improve workplace relations in the higher education sector but also, very importantly, give funding certainty to the higher education sector. When they were restricted by the harsh HEWRRs, universities were unable to plan into the future for fear that they would have their funding cut and therefore be in a budgetary situation where what they wanted to do to improve educational outcomes for their students could not be done—because who knew what else the former government were going to foist on the sector?
I note that one of the key standing orders in our parliament is to make certain that bills that appropriate money contain no other measures. The reason for that was in the practice of early governments—in earliest times, I am advised—to tack measures to appropriation bills so that if those measures were passed they would necessarily bring with them other more unpopular measures that would not otherwise command the assent of the parliament. So, in the development of our parliamentary democracy, it was decided very early on that a spending bill could not have tacked onto it other kinds of measures.
Yet, it was seen fit by the former minister for education and now Leader of the Opposition, Dr Brendan Nelson, to tack measures that the universities would have rejected onto their funding allocations so that the only choice they had was to accept a level of poverty in terms of the courses and arrangements they could offer or to accept the ideological agenda of the government of the time. The universities have suffered under those arrangements for a considerable time—I think, for about five years—and it is not something they have been able to ignore. On 13 May this year, Universities Australia issued a press release stating in part:
Universities Australia supports the Government’s action in this session of Parliament to remove the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements (HEWRRs) as a legislated condition of funding for universities.
“Universities Australia would welcome the removal of the HEWRRs as an indication from the Government that it is happy to loosen existing prescriptive requirements and allow universities to pursue their missions as self governing bodies” …
In addition to these significant changes that are supported by the sector, this bill also makes a number of technical changes. These include amending the act so that the approval of a provider that no longer meets certain criteria may be revoked. For example, if the provider no longer has its central management and control in Australia, this bill enables approval for that provider to be withdrawn.
The bill also includes the addition of a transitional mechanism so that existing funding commitments made to providers under the Collaboration and Structural Reform Fund can be honoured now that the new Diversity and Structural Adjustment Fund has been established. Arrangements for quality auditing of higher education providers will also be amended.
The bill amends the act to allow the Commonwealth to designate additional bodies to perform this role, such as state and territory government accreditation authorities. Further, the amendment will enable the Commonwealth to specify the higher education providers that those bodies can audit. The bill sets limits on the providers that can be audited. Currently, if a body were designated to conduct audits, it would be able to audit all higher education providers, including universities. By state and territory government accreditation authorities conducting audits at the same time as they currently conduct their normal registration and approval processes, the administrative burden on private providers will be reduced. This is a very practical initiative to enable the sector to manage itself much more efficiently.
Our approach has been subject to consultation with private providers and a trial process with two state accreditation agencies, those agencies being in Queensland and Victoria. That consultative approach, that suck-it-and-see approach, has been very well received in the sector and is indicative of the way the Rudd Labor government does business—that is, we like to make our policy based on evidence and we go out into the sectors to discover what they need and how best we can implement what they want to enable them to provide a better education system for our young people.
The Leader of the Opposition, Dr Brendan Nelson, was a disgrace as a minister for education. This bill is evidence of our attempt to redress the wrongs that the now Leader of the Opposition perpetrated on the higher education sector. He was part of the Howard government, who made it clear from the beginning that education would not be an area that would be prioritised. In his first federal budget in 1996, the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, cut university operating grants by a cumulative six per cent from 1997 to 2000. That funding cut resulted in a significant $850 million loss to the sector, a sector that should have been supported by the former government because it is absolutely integral to the social and economic wellbeing of our nation, our children and working families.
I conclude by saying that, while I am very pleased to support this bill, I know that it is just one part of the Rudd Labor government’s education revolution, which is a multifaceted revolution designed to ensure that Australia has the best possible education system from childhood to adulthood. Every child in Australia will benefit from the Rudd Labor government’s investment in education.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (REMOVAL OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE PROTOCOLS REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-08-27,"—I, too, rise to speak in support of the legislation before us this morning. We have had a long and informative debate about the features of this bill, and I hope that I can make a brief contribution to ensure that those who are interested in this area understand the import of the legislation that is before us.
The Higher Education Support Amendment (Removal of the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements and National Governance Protocols Requirements and Other Matters) Bill 2008 is one of several higher education bills that we have been debating in recent months, given the change of government and the change in direction that the Rudd government is providing in terms of, as Senator McEwen so rightly said, the education revolution that is going to change the face of Australian society in the next few years.
Much of the debate this morning has focused on the removal of those five elements of the higher education workplace relations requirements. We have had long discussions about the impact of those, and we have seen overwhelming support from the higher education sector for the removal of those features. We have had lots of discussion this morning about the impact that those conditions had placed on university funding.
Seriously thinking about this issue, though, and where the impact is going to be in the higher education sector, you can see that it really is going to enable universities to capture the innovation that is so important to the future of our economy and our society. We know that the Group of Eight universities have been incredibly supportive of this withdrawal and welcome the minister’s announcement that these conditions will be removed. The Commonwealth Grants Scheme guidelines are quite clear: we want our universities to be able to manage their own workplace relations and administration, we want to free them from the extraordinarily restrictive and directive requirements that we know exist. We have heard from the vice-chancellors how much time and effort was diverted from where we want them to focus their efforts, and that is on quality research and quality teaching. We want to make sure that our higher education providers are released from this nonsensical level of micromanagement and red tape that the previous government imposed upon them. In doing so we want to ensure that we free up the effort that is going into universities so they can deal with a new agenda, which is about a knowledge nation in the truest sense—a nation that is focused on innovation, lifelong learning and, as Senator McEwen so rightly said, a commitment to learning that goes almost from cradle to grave; certainly, from early childhood through to the University of the Third Age.
In my contribution to this debate today I want to focus on another important initiative of the higher education sector and why the removal of these conditions is so important. I want to focus my thoughts on the work that the higher education sector is doing in my very important portfolio area of social inclusion and the extent to which these changes are actually going to really free up some of the very innovative, creative and responsive thinking that is going on in the university sector around issues of social inclusion, philanthropy, social responsibility, social return on investment and these kinds of things, which were never really of great interest to the previous government but which we see as underpinning the quality of the society that we in the Rudd government want to ensure will be delivered for Australia.
In July I had the opportunity to speak at a forum at the University of Melbourne on this issue of higher education and social inclusion. The issue that has perplexed many of us, certainly on this side of the chamber, is that Australia’s actual equity performance in higher education has been pretty ordinary in the last few years—pretty mixed. Although we have had an increase in the number of tertiary students through the 1980s and 1990s, the actual socioeconomic mix of students has hardly changed in that time. So I was very pleased when I attended this forum to hear some of the innovative thinking that was going on about trying to raise the participation rate of tertiary students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Social inclusion is not just about low income families or families that might have serious disadvantage for various reasons; it is also about ensuring that quality of life changes for the whole-of-life perspective. So it is not just about early intervention with families to keep young people at school; it is also about ensuring that we are generating new opportunities for those young people who might not normally be participators in higher education to be there. We know that there are lots of reasons why we have had a fall-off in students from those backgrounds in higher education. Certainly, HECS is one of those reasons and cost-of-living and student accommodation pressures are extraordinary, to name just a few.
The changes we are making to higher education are now allowing universities to provide much greater flexibility in the way they respond to these new challenges. This is very important because the old tried and true methods of tackling the issues that prevent participation in higher education do not work and we need to understand why that is so. At the forum I attended, the Group of Eight were really trying to tackle this issue very seriously. I listened to some of the proposals that they had in place around the use of technology, and certainly around supportive financial and workplace mechanisms and learning environments for students. But I also saw that there was a lot of very new and creative thinking around the way in which universities are actually tackling this issue for themselves. For example, the University of New South Wales described their ASPIRE initiative, which targets students from disadvantaged public high schools who might have the potential to enter and succeed at university. That encourages students from year 8 to stay on. It is working with students right through from year 8 to year 11 to actually give them exposure to the kinds of opportunities that university can offer them. So we can see that the need for these changes to higher education is really about enabling this kind of flexibility.
The Victoria University has got a magnificent new approach to pathways and articulation, from TAFE to higher education. These are really important developments. We have got community engagement programs across the nation. The universities have actually reached back out into communities to engage them in this way, and the kinds of issues that we are addressing in our higher education reforms, as I say, allow this kind of flexibility.
We now have several universities, including the Macquarie University, the University of Sydney and the Australian Catholic University, actively encouraging volunteering within their undergraduate degrees, providing many exciting opportunities in partnership, for example, with Australian Volunteers International. We have the Australian Catholic University using the flexibility that they are now being encouraged to act upon to make early offers in many of their courses to year 12 students who can demonstrate that they have got a history of activism in their communities. These are the kinds of things that encourage universities to really draw on their strengths and their own populations to encourage social inclusion, and to that extent they are very important new initiatives.
Having said all of that, we need to invest in our higher education institutions. They have to lead on the issues of civic engagement, active citizenship, advocacy and debate. If we do not do that and we actually crush them with the kinds of arrangements that the previous government put in place, we are much poorer as a nation because of it. We need the intellectual powerhouses of our tertiary institutions to lead in this area and to facilitate change in our up-and-coming professionals. That is really where this government wants to invest. We want to harness the skills and expertise and commitment of our up-and-coming generations of professionals in these areas.
Getting back then to the issue of the reforms, the subject of this legislation, today I really did not want to go through the concerns about nepotism on committees or the issues that were raised by Senator Moore, for example, about pay inequity and unfair employment practices, which were part and parcel of the concerns about lower staff morale, the poor relationships between Australian universities and their staff and the diminished capacity for universities to attract high-calibre academic and general staff, and of course the fundamental issue of poorer outcomes for students. With this legislation today you can see that there is a very clear and purposeful intent in the way in which the Rudd government is reforming our relationship with the higher education sector by removing the workplace relations requirements and the national governance protocols. There has been a long debate on this legislation. It is very important. It is a significant piece of legislation before us that, despite the protestations of some, will generate a much more flexible, responsive and innovative higher education sector, and I will end my remarks there.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (REMOVAL OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE PROTOCOLS REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2008-08-27,"—I am grateful to Senator McEwen in this debate for pointing out that Senator Mason has written a book. That is something I did not know and I am very interested to look for it in the bookshops. I am sure that it has not reached the dizzying heights of The Latham Diaries or the soon-to-be released Costello diaries—
—I’m sure there is a second print run coming up!
—There is a second printing coming up? If I can be of any assistance to you, Senator Mason, let me just suggest to you that you should get the second print run and release it on the same day that Mr Costello releases his book and you might get some flow-on effects in sales and it might boost your credibility in respect of this. Often we find that just because someone has written a book about a subject it does not necessarily mean that it gives them any authority to speak on it. Nonetheless I am indebted to Senator McEwen and I will look for your book, Senator Mason, with some interest. There are plenty of opportunities in parliament when we need something to help us sleep and I suggest that maybe there will be an occasion, Senator Mason, when your book might be very useful.
We have seen Senator Mason open the debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Removal of the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements and National Governance Protocols Requirements and Other Matters) Bill 2008 with a defence of the opposition’s position in respect of this bill. I know that he has told us that, if the amendments they are suggesting are not passed, they will vote against the bill in its entirety. That is an unfortunate position. I cannot help but think, though, that it is a little bit of a try-on by Senator Mason to come and run that line, because there has not been a single opposition senator come into this chamber to support the position of Senator Mason—not a single senator!
—They think that I am enough!
—That may be one explanation that they trust you with. The other explanation is that maybe you are a little bit lonely these days. I am a bit concerned about the numbers that you may be able to call on to support you, Senator Mason. I am personally concerned about that. I do not want to go into too much detail about the Liberal and National parties’ merger in Queensland, but I am just wondering whether that may have put you on the outer somewhat and you cannot encourage anyone to come and be seen in the chamber with you that does not have to be here, as does the Whip behind you. Nonetheless, I am worried about you, but I am convinced that it is a bit of a try-on, because this is really about a rearguard action in respect of Work Choices, isn’t it?
—No, it is not!
—That is what it is about, Senator Mason, and that is unfortunate.
 (Senator Moore)—Senator Marshall, please speak through the chair.
—Through you, Acting Deputy President, that may of course be one of the other reasons why there are no opposition senators supporting Senator Mason in the chamber in this debate. It is about Work Choices, and the opposition does not know what their position is on Work Choices anymore. One day it is dead, one day it is up and running again; then there are different versions; then it has gone in name but it is there in substance. But it all comes back to the opposition not wanting to let go of forced AWAs. They just loved the concept of ‘take it or leave it’ and they wanted anything in place to suit that ideology.
It is a concern, not knowing what the opposition’s position really is with respect to these matters. Senator Mason says, ‘If we don’t retain these last elements of Work Choices we will oppose the whole of the bill.’ It comes from the problem the opposition have because of their ‘three stooges’ approach to their leadership—and it is very confusing for us all. We have got Mr Nelson, who cannot do the job as Leader of the Opposition; we have got Mr Turnbull, who cannot get the job as Leader of the Opposition; and we have got Mr Costello, who will not do the job as Leader of the Opposition. All of them have different positions with respect to Work Choices. In fact, Mr Nelson has three separate positions of his own. With all these positions, it is very unclear what position the opposition really has in relation to the very serious matters we are debating.
I want to go into some of these serious matters we are seeking to address with this amending legislation we have before the parliament today. This bill will amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 by repealing section 33-17 to remove a requirement that higher education providers meet any higher education workplace relations requirements and national governance protocols imposed under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme guidelines to avoid a reduction in their CGS funding for Commonwealth supported places. The dreaded HEWRR part of that—the higher education workplace relations requirements—was simply a way to impose the ideological Work Choices agenda on the higher education sector. It made it a condition that, for the sector to maintain all their funding, AWAs, individual contracts, had to be offered to all their employees.
We know that, under Work Choices, AWAs could be offered with a ‘take it or leave it’ approach. We know that one of the ways the previous federal government, now the opposition, implemented its Work Choices throughout the public sector and other bodies that relied on Commonwealth funding was by tying it to funding or by making policy decisions to forcibly implement its industrial relations agenda. For instance, DEWR, the then Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, as a matter of policy—as I saw over many years through the estimates processes—made it a condition of employment that you had to have an AWA. I remember many times asking the then head of the department: where is the choice in that? Where is the choice when you are offered an AWA on a ‘take it or leave it’ basis? The response was: ‘The choice is you either take the job or you don’t.’ That is the sort of choice that the Howard government put in place in this country. It was no choice; it was a fool’s choice.
They did the same thing by tying it to funding in the higher education sector: everyone had to be offered an AWA, whether they liked it or not—there was no choice in that. If they did not do it, universities would be penalised by, I think, up to 7.6 per cent—I may be wrong about that; I will get to some of the specific detail about that element a bit later. But they would be penalised substantial amounts of funding if they did not force the government’s ideological agenda on their employees, whether they wanted to or not. We know that there was a lot of resistance to that proposal. Nonetheless, it was a condition of funding. Faced with the penalty of losing substantial funding, universities were forced to implement government policy on AWAs whether they wanted to or not and whether that was the choice of their employees or not.
Universities were also forced to negotiate directly with their staff on industrial relations matters, prohibiting union involvement. Again, where is the choice in that? If the employees wished to have their union represent them and negotiate a collective agreement, or even an AWA, they were prohibited from doing so. Why? Because if they did so universities would lose substantial amounts of funding from the Commonwealth. What sort of way is that to introduce flexibility? How do you get flexibility and productivity when you have the management of a university being forced by the previous government to impose their ideological will on its employees? That is a confrontational approach. You do not get good productivity and good flexibility out of a confrontational approach. You do not get it out of a command and control approach. You get it through negotiation, cooperation and innovation, and all those things can be fostered when you allow genuine negotiations, and genuine involvement of third parties when it is required by the employees. We reject their philosophy; we have rejected it in the past and we reject it now. And now that we are in government we are going to act to take away those ridiculous elements of the previous government’s agenda. It was a direct attack upon unions and university staff, trying to eradicate union representation in this sector and to force all university staff onto individual contracts. Senator Mason, on behalf of the whole of the opposition, who were not there to support him, argued strongly that it is not about that.
—I am here representative of them all!
—I am now getting an indication from the opposition’s deputy whip that she is here to support him. Strangely enough, though, I do not see your name on the speakers list—and I know that as deputy whip you actually have to be in the chamber right now. So I am not quite sure that I am convinced, Senator, of your overwhelming support for Senator Mason in this regard. Nonetheless, I suppose as we go down the path we will find many more different and frequent variations of the opposition’s Work Choices policy.
We have consistently and publicly said that these conditional arrangements were wrong and went against the concept of good university governance. In abolishing the HEWRRs and the NGPs, the government is fulfilling some of our most important commitments to the higher education sector, which we indicated in our white paper on higher education, Australia’s universities: building our future in the world, in July 2006. We will be removing only the conditions on CGS funding while retaining the full funding. Of course, funding is something that is crucial to this sector. Universities rely, on the whole, on a substantial amount of Commonwealth funding. They do, and it is not good enough for the previous government to apply those conditions that I have already talked about. And it is not good enough for them to try to apply them from opposition. It is not good enough for them to try to maintain their Work Choices agenda from opposition.
The government has a clear mandate on all of these issues, yet this opposition, as they are trying to wreck the budget—and, if I get an opportunity, I might talk about that for a moment too—also want to try and govern from opposition and maintain policies which they took to the last election and were defeated upon. That is what they want to do.

Senator Mason interjecting—

—Senator Mason can dress it up all he likes, as he has, because we know he can. He is someone who can argue very convincingly on a case that has no merit, and we have seen that often in this place.
—Thank you, I think, Gavin!
—Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, it was a backhanded compliment in some respects, Senator Mason, so I am glad you have picked that up and I am glad you are listening very closely to my contribution.
—I always do!
—Thank you. I hope it is not only closely but intently and that you digest some of the advice that I have given you. If you do, I am sure your support amongst your own party will grow and swell, and I will sleep easier at night knowing that, Senator Mason!
Finally, after the Howard years, there will be an approach by this government that encourages and supports good governance practices rather than simply imposing upon a sector a set of ideological conditions. And it has been clear from the response from the higher education sector that the removal of the HEWRRs and the NGPs as a condition of funding will be welcomed. And why wouldn’t they welcome it? Of course they would. Why would they not want to get rid of this ideological position being forced down their throats when they actually want to get on with the business and talk about proper good governance, proper flexibility and proper productivity with their staff in a non-confrontational approach, which we know and as all the evidence suggests, is the approach that leads to better flexibility and higher productivity?
Through the period of the Howard government we saw an average six per cent cut to the sector, representing some $850 million. That alone says it all. That is what the previous government’s commitment was to the higher education sector—it was to cut it and impose its ideological agenda. We on this side have a very different approach. We had a different approach while we were in opposition, and now we are in government we are going to implement our approach and support the higher education sector to the extent that it needs that support. It is absolutely crucial for the future of our economy, the future of our community and the future of our children that we have a well-supported higher education sector. It is a basis for innovation; it is a basis for our economic prosperity.
History will show—and Senator Mason may write a book about this—that the last 11 years of neglect of the higher education sector has led to skills shortages and will continue to lead to very serious problems for this nation because, even though we will start to fix these things right now, the lag of the damage that has been done by the last 11 years will continue to haunt us for years to come. The challenge left to us, to repair the damage of the previous government, is enormous. It is worth remembering that over their 11 years the previous government undermined the higher education sector. Their first budget, in 1996, slashed university operating grants by a cumulative six per cent over the forward estimates from 1997 to 2000, resulting in a $850 million cut to the sector, as I mentioned earlier.
When the new Labor government came to office, the student-staff ratio was 20 to 4 compared to 14 to 6 in 1995 just prior to the Howard government coming into office. Those figures are worth emphasising—the student-staff ratio on us coming to office was 20 to 4 compared to 14 to 6 in 1995. That is a massive backtrack on quality education, all happening under the previous government. When we came to office, Australia’s education system relied more on private funding than all other OECD countries bar the United States, Japan and South Korea. More than half of the cost of tertiary education today is met from private sources, with dependence on private sources increasing to 52 per cent now from 35 per cent in 1995. That just demonstrates again the enormous neglect of the previous government.
We are changing this. We are committed as a Labor government to changing this. As I said earlier, there is now a new government which encourages and supports good governance practices through cooperation with their staff. It is a government which thinks higher education is worthy of support for the long-term future of Australia and is not a playground for ill-conceived and vexatious industrial relations experiments—an experiment that was roundly rejected by the Australian people at the last election. We have already announced several packages of funding, such as the Better Universities Renewal Fund and the $11 billion Education Investment Fund, to start to repair the damage done by the conservatives.
I recall when I started as a senator in 2002 I was shocked that in the so-called clever country there could be degrees that cost $100,000. It made a mockery of the merit based system and led to our top universities chasing dollars by charging as much as they thought they could get away with in a system where they were encouraged to do this by the previous Howard government. According to the 2008 Good Universities Guide, there are now more than 100 degrees offered by public universities that cost in excess of $100,000.
In another blow to the conservative agenda, I am pleased that the federal Labor government will also ensure that, from 2009, full-fee-paying undergraduate places will be phased out. Universities will be compensated for the phase-out with funding packages that I have already mentioned. It must hurt those opposite to know that you cannot just buy your way in anymore, which is the truest of all conservative traditions. We believe in merit and we believe in equality.
Putting higher education neglect aside, we all know that the conservatives lived and breathed for the sole purpose of implementing Work Choices and eradicating unions, and that the amendment to be proposed by Senator Mason is a last-ditch attempt by this opposition—I hope it is a last-ditch attempt—to hang onto that ideological agenda.

",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT AMENDMENT (REMOVAL OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION WORKPLACE RELATIONS REQUIREMENTS AND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE PROTOCOLS REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2008-08-27,"—I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those senators who have spoken on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Removal of the Higher Education Workplace Relations Requirements and National Governance Protocols Requirements and Other Matters) Bill 2008. I understand that the opposition is not dividing on the second reading amendment today, although there will be a full debate in the committee stages, so I will make a few remarks in summing up the legislation that we have before us.
This is a bill which is part of the Labor government’s new approach to dealing with the issues that confound this nation in regard to higher education. This is a new approach being reflected by a new government that believes deeply that Australian universities are actually critical to our nation’s future. The government’s view is that universities are essential to our social, economic, cultural and environmental well-being. That essentially is the starting point at which we enter this debate. That is why in our first nine months of government we have paid such particular attention to revitalising Australia’s higher education system. In our first budget we established and distributed the Better Universities Renewal Fund of some $500 million. We set up the new Education Investment Fund of $11 billion. The government moved in my portfolio to double the postgraduate award arrangements and to introduce a new future fellowship program. Minister Gillard moved to double the number of undergraduate scholarships. There was an additional $249 million, if I recall, allocated to fund 11,000 new Commonwealth places to replace the full-fee-paying places that the previous government had pushed so hard. There were new measures introduced to provide a fee remissions scheme and other incentives to increase enrolments in maths and science.
The Labor government has moved to protect academic freedom and to strengthen the Australian Research Council. We have sought to internationalise our research effort. We have of course moved very quickly to abolish the notorious RQF of the previous government. There was a restoration of public benefit as a criterion for funding the CRC program. There was a pattern quickly established by the new government, which was in sharp contrast to the way in which the previous government operated, that universities play a major part in ensuring the well-being of this nation. That is of course in part why we established the Bradley and Cutler reviews to actually look at these systems in some detail to see what other measures can be taken to advance these fundamental principles that are so important.
Senator Mason in his contribution said that this whole debate that we are engaged in here with this particular measure was about accountability. That was the main thrust of the proposition that he advanced. In fact, what we have before us is a bill to actually reduce the level of red tape, to reassert the importance of universities in their decision-making processes and to essentially extend to universities a sense of professionalism that was denied by the previous government.
The new government takes the view that universities can be trusted. The Liberal opposition takes the view that essentially universities are hostile places and that they are run by people that they do not like and do not trust. It is a difficult task for Senator Mason to prosecute this case because he is a former academic himself. He feels so lonely on this issue because he knows the fundamental fallacy of the Liberal Party philosophy, which takes the view that the universities are hostile places for the Liberal Party. Universities have to be punished, according to the Liberal Party, because Senator Abetz and a number of other prominent members of the Liberal Party had bad experiences when they were at university. They were defeated in university politics and they have never grown up from that proposition and they have never been able to cope with the fact that universities might throw up different ideas from those that they see as dominant.
What this particular bill does is remove from the Commonwealth Grant Scheme guidelines references to the draconian industrial relations legislation, which the previous government took to its heart because it wanted to impose its highly authoritarian view of the way in which universities should be maintained. The national governance protocols imposed governance conditions on higher education providers, and these too will be removed.
In essence, this is a measure to reduce red tape. You would have thought that the Liberals, with all their assertions about the importance of the values that they subscribe to, would support this measure. But we now find that that is not their position. They want to maintain an authoritarian and draconian view of higher education, because universities, in their mind, are not to be trusted.
The position that Senator Mason tries to present is that the Liberals really do want to see the universities advance. But look at their history; look at what they did in government. We saw the previous government try on many occasions—and I am disappointed that Senator Mason did not identify this—to gag scientists and researchers. They also treated researchers who criticised the previous government’s policies or who publicised research findings or opinions that the previous government found embarrassing in a punitive manner. I recall one report from a group of labour market economists from various universities in New South Wales on the Work Choices legislation. They were decried as terrorists. They were associated with something illegal because they had a different view to that of the previous government. What you saw was a series of processes undertaken by the previous government, ranging from tacit intimidation to downright threats and even to blatant suppression, if they were not able to silence their critics in the universities.
Senator Mason looks at me as if in some surprise about this. He finds this puzzling. He presents himself as a great small ‘l’ liberal in the Liberal Party. I know how lonely he must be.
—No, I don’t.
—You are not? I have misunderstood. You are even more lonely than that.
—I am all by myself, Kim.
—It would seem that way. Essentially, the problem is this: do you recall the interim Leader of the Opposition’s position—
 (Senator Marshall)—Through the chair, Senator Carr.
—Quite correct, Mr Acting Deputy President. I have no doubt that Senator Mason would recall the current interim Leader of the Opposition’s attitudes when he was the minister for education. It was Dr Nelson who vetoed 10 discovery grants that had gone through a whole independent peer review process through the Australian Research Council. When one particular PhD student, Sharon Andrews, made an FOI application to get the details of these vetoed projects, the former government fought right up to the High Court. And they lost. They want accountability. But in government the attitude of the Liberal Party was draconian and authoritarian. They attempted to suppress, through tacit intimidation or downright threats, academics who took a different view to that of the government.
If Senator Mason is having trouble with his memory on this point, the then chair of the ARC, Tim Beasley—who was the AWB chair, too—advised his close friend the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the public that the academics should not get their knickers in a knot about the level of repression that occurred under the previous government.

Senator Mason interjecting—

—You might think that this is humorous, but the fact is that Paddy McGuinness, along with three other lay members of the ARC quality and scrutiny committee—which included a retired judge, a newsreader and Paddy McGuinness—insisted on going through all the applications, which you could understand. There was a view taken by this lay committee that 27 grant applications should be vetoed. As it turned out, three of those identified were among the 10 that were vetoed by Dr Nelson. So we have the sorry and shameful record of the previous government in attempting to silence critics and interfere in the legitimate scholarly processes.
What were these 10 projects that Dr Nelson sought to suppress? Three were in gender studies. Two were in feminist studies, one of which was so bad according to the government that it had to be rejected twice. There were two in Asian studies. There was one in conservation studies. There was one in media studies. Their projects were so terrible that their titles were changed and then they were subsequently refunded. This is the level of micromanagement and authoritarianism that they wanted to bring in. This is the level of contempt that these politicians have for our academic institutions. This is the real motivation behind the amendments that this opposition is seeking to present to this Senate today.
We are told that it is about accountability. What it is about is their obsession with their enemies among the intellectual groups in this country. What is clear to me from their history is the obsession that the Liberal Party have with trying to deal with people they do not like. They cannot cope with intellectual debate. They cannot cope with dissent. They cannot cope with people in our universities who might have a different view to that of the Liberal Party. That is why we had under the Liberals a shocking record of neglect when it came to the funding of our university system.
Under the Liberals our capacity to maintain our position with our intellectual institutions and research agencies was seriously undermined by serial and systematic abuse of our university system. We saw the funding capacity of our universities stripped away. We saw it in terms of our position versus the OECD. We were the only country in the OECD that actually reduced funding to its universities. As I understand it, there was a 23 per cent reduction in support for research and development throughout the Howard period—a 23 per cent reduction, as measured by GDP, in our contribution to funding for our university system.
What did we see in terms of our PhD students? What did we see in terms of our capacity to meet the challenges of the future? We had a government that looked on universities as being hostile, as being the enemy. Under the previous government that group had to be punished. We have tried to fundamentally reverse that philosophical position. We have taken the view that it is very important that we treat our universities as places that are critical to the nation’s future. Instead of a reduction in public funding for tertiary education, which fell some four per cent between 1995 and 2004 compared to the average rise of 49 per cent across the OECD, we have seen a fundamental commitment by this government to reinvestment because we were the only OECD country to cut the total level of public funding for tertiary education during that time. Our ranking on research collaboration between industry and universities went backwards.
—Not overall funding.
—Senator Mason, you know the evidence. On the basis of collaboration between industry and universities we went backwards. We went backwards on the number of PhDs in the workforce. When we look at the measurement of our capacity to meet the challenges of the future, under the previous government our performance went backwards.
We are no longer just competing with advanced industrial countries. The explosion in research and development investment in China and in India has transformed the global innovation landscape. Are we ready to face that challenge? Because of the previous government’s legacy, we are not. Patent activity in China increased by 470 per cent in the decade from 1997 to 2006. Between 1999 and 2005 India’s total R&D expenditure rose by 73 per cent and its higher education R&D expenditure rose by 180 per cent. What have we done? We have gone backwards. There has been a four per cent reduction.
That is why it is so important to undertake an education revolution in this country. That is why it is so important to get a whole new approach to the way we deal with universities. That is why we are embarking upon a whole new approach, a cultural change, to the way in which we deal with university governance and engage the university leaderships on the basis of trust and on the basis of respect for their professional abilities to manage their own affairs. Of course, nothing could stand in sharper contrast to the position we take now than the position that was taken by the previous government.
The opposition will say that we are stripping away measures and that of course means that there cannot be any accountability in any new system. That is just not the case. It is not the case in fact. Senator Mason, as a person with some interest in education, would have read the Higher Education Support Act and would know what the provisions of that act are regarding universities being subject to regular quality audits by the Australian Universities Quality Agency. He would also be aware that sections 19 and 20 of the act require a higher education provider to comply with any requirement imposed on the provider by the minister to implement recommendations of the quality auditing body. He would also be aware that, under the research act provisions, universities are required to deal properly with proper requests from the government. That is a provision that cuts across both the teaching and the research programs of universities.
The position you are arguing—that, unless your amendments are carried, there will not be proper accountability measures—falls to the ground because it is in defiance of the facts; it is in defiance of the legislation. The AUQA’s submission to the recent review of the national governance protocols indicated that the AUQA’s audits had not revealed that there was any clear evidence of ongoing poor performance and failure to meet the minimum expected standards for effective governing body operations.
—So why oppose it then, Minister, given it is being complied with?
—Senator, you have this fundamental problem. It may be a question of self-loathing, given your comments about the Australian National University position. I do not share your contempt for yourself. My observation of your role in that body was that you were seeking to contribute in a constructive manner, unlike some of the other dills that you put on that committee over the years.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-08-27,"—I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical and Other Benefits—Cost Recovery) Bill 2008 and note that the process through which the government has taken this particular piece of legislation would have to give significant cause for concern. The government seemed to have taken the view that, because this is a piece of legislation or a proposal that was first announced by the previous government in 2005, all it had to do was to pick up what it saw as a proposal that was already on the table and, without any consultation with industry at all, announce it as a budget measure on budget night.
It is quite clear from the report of the committee that the level of consultation by this government with industry has not been satisfactory. The committee learnt during the committee inquiry that there were some significant groups that had not been consulted at all through that process. The committee also learnt that the industry’s understanding of what was being consulted on was quite different from what the government was presenting as consultation. In 2007 there were some proposals put forward on types of cost recovery measures that might be considered but not in the context of a measure specifically going forward. Those groups of industry who were consulted as a part of that process made their submissions but never heard anything back. They had no further comment from the department as a result of those consultations; they got no feedback. The next they heard was that there was a measure announced in the budget. With respect to the government’s policy on this particular matter, the only thing that the government or a spokesperson for Labor had put forward was a comment made by the then shadow minister—and now minister—during a debate in 2007, when the minister said that the opposition did not see it as an appropriate measure. In fact, the quote was:
The PBAC needs to be independent of government and of industry, and we cannot see the justification for this move to a cost-recovery model.
That is the only indication that industry had from the Labor Party of what their position might be. And yet, tucked away quietly in the budget on budget night was a measure that will raise $14 million and which was supposed to commence on 1 July this year. That was the budget proposal. No notice, no consultation and no warning for industry is of significant concern.
During the term of the inquiry it was quite interesting to hear from witnesses as to their perspectives on this process. The government relies very heavily on the evidence of Associate Professor Faunce, who, of the witnesses that we heard from at the inquiry, was effectively the only supporter of this measure in this legislation. But even Associate Professor Faunce had some concerns, particularly in the absence of the regulations which effectively are the measure in this piece of legislation. All that the legislation effectively does is to modify the act to say that there will be regulations. During the process of conducting the inquiry we were effectively flying blind and relying on some information that the industry had been given at some briefings since the budget was announced—we did not have all of the information and neither did they. I do note that, after the committee presented its report last Friday, the government released the regulations. I commend them for that because that gives industry, the opposition and the minor parties the opportunity to effectively scrutinise the regulations. It would have been of great assistance to all of us had the government been prepared to provide that information during the consultation process.
I find it very hard to believe that there would not have been some fairly well developed draft regulation given that the measure was supposed to start on 1 July 2008. Granted, it is not long between the budget which was brought down on 13 May 2008 and the proposed implementation date on 1 July 2008, but I find it hard to believe that there would not have been the information available so that industry could consult based on the full set of facts. Almost to a person, every witness said it was difficult to fully interrogate this particular measure without the regulations, which are effectively the measure because, as I have said, the legislation itself only says that there will be regulations.
Of significant concern to the committee, reflected in both the majority and the minority reports, was the issue of the impact on off-label products. I commend the PBAC on the work that they have done over the last three or four years in putting special advisory groups in place to look at the use of off-label medicines. That is a very commendable effort. In the circumstance where it has been operating for about four years now, I think, and that was in—

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2008-08-27,"—Today I want to talk about 27 August being Equal Pay Day, which has been so named by the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency, EOWA. EOWA is calling on all employers in our country today, 27 August, to conduct a pay audit in their workplace. They have provided a tool on their website which will help employers and their workers to see what is happening in their workplace today in terms of fair pay, equal pay.
We know that today in 2008 women earn about 84c for every dollar earned by men. Women have to work effectively longer—and I will not say harder because it would be unfair—to match their income rates. That is why 27 August has been picked, because this is the day when women’s average salary catches up with what men would have earned on 30 June 2008. We are making the statement and saying to employers, ‘Have a look at what is happening in your workplace.’
If all workers did that we would then, I think, put in place what we thought had been achieved through years and years of struggle in the 19th and 20th centuries over a number of wage cases, which effectively said that equal pay for equal work had been achieved in this country. But we know it has not happened. On the EOWA website there is the tool and the EOWA aim, which states:
With a vision to create an Australia where every woman can achieve her greatest potential in the workplace, EOWA inspires Australian employers to take action to improve outcomes for working women. It does so by delivering practical solutions to employers for advancing women, by building strategic partnerships with employer organisations and—
I emphasise ‘and’—
by leading public debate to increase the rate of change.
A well-known comment made by Justice Mary Gaudron many years ago was that women won equal pay, then we won it again and again and again. It is a great quote but I think it actually reflects a degree of sadness. By saying that, Justice Gaudron has reflected the real problem that, while the clear gap has been identified, stated and reviewed, not much has changed.
In Queensland in the 1890s there were reviews of workers’ conditions in Brisbane across a range of industries which looked at people working in shops and seamstress areas. They were able to identify in the 1890s that women’s labour was not effectively valued and that the same work done by someone who does not identify as a woman is better paid. This was 1890—further reviews by commissions in my own state of Queensland in the early 20th century reinforced this issue. We have a time line that shows a number of cases, a number of industrial relations processes, over the years which again identified the gap and showed that women’s work was not effectively valued. This is not just about dollars and cents; it is about more than just the money in the pocket. It includes discretionary pay—where employers can make decisions amongst workers in their workplace—and allowances. We consistently see that allowances for extra work or different processes are not equally shared with all workers in the workplace. It is about performance and performance assessment. We yearn for a time when sheer merit will be assessed effectively and rewarded. A core element of that is getting the performance processes identified.
It has almost come to the stage where the very word ‘merit’ has lost its meaning, because the question is: who determines the merit and on what basis? What we have seen is that women’s work, individual women’s labour in the workplace is undervalued—and we will not get into the very vexed subject of the double workload of women working at home. Today I am concentrating on women in the paid workforce. I will come back to you about women working at home. What we need to understand is that not just in one area but across the board there has been a genuine economic gap for women in the workforce, and that is a shame.
How we can stand here on 27 August 2008 and accept that that is a reality continues to astound me. The 1972 arbitration decision said that there would be equal pay for equal work in the workplace. We won equal pay in 1972. In 2008, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that, on average, there is not equity and that there is a 15.6 per cent gender wage gap, so we are under-evaluating women’s work. This is such a disappointment for so many women and men who support equity in our community. Over the years there has been clear evidence presented. Detailed cases have been made before a range of arbitration courts at the federal and state levels resulting in inches of evidence, which can be seen in libraries throughout this country, taken not just from industries but from employers and employees who have had the courage to come forward and explain their own situation. Consistently, at the end of this process it has been determined that, while there may have been some advances at different times, the end results mean that what we thought had been achieved in the early 1970s has not in fact been achieved.
We had a House of Representatives inquiry in the early 1990s which looked exclusively as this argument, and I do ask people who are interested in this topic, and I hope we all are, to have a look at that House of Representatives report to see the kind of information that came forward. One of the exciting things, if we can talk about excitement in a process where there is such genuine inequity, is that the House or Representatives is conducting a current inquiry—and, coincidentally, the submissions for that inquiry are due to close later today—that is looking specifically at what is happening now. The terms of reference of that inquiry look very clearly at the kinds of issues I am talking about. The inquiry will look at:
The adequacy of current data to reliably monitor employment changes that may impact on pay equity issues;
The need for education and information among employers, employees and trade unions—
and the community generally—
in relation to pay equity issues;
Current structural arrangements in the negotiation of wages that may impact disproportionately on women;
The adequacy—
Adequacy is such a sad word, isn’t it?—
of recent and current equal remuneration provisions in state and federal workplace relations legislation;
The adequacy of current arrangements to ensure fair access to training and promotion for women who have taken maternity leave and/or returned to work part time and/or sought flexible work hours; and
The need for further legislative reform to address pay equity in Australia.
Here in 2008 we are going to see whether there needs to be further consideration of laws to enforce what has already been achieved in a number of arbitration processes over many years. We have, on the law books, already achieved pay equity. What we have not done is all those things that the House of Representatives committee will be considering under its terms of reference. We have not achieved it in reality in the workplace and we have not ensured that the various work conditions and salary components are assessed quite clearly to then see how they operate on individual workers.
We have not won the argument with the wider community to make them aware of what I think many people seem to take for granted, because the issue of pay equity has, I think, been consigned to the history books. We value the work of women like Emma Miller in Queensland in the 1890s, of women like Meredith Bergman and others in New South Wales in the last century—as we can say now—and of various women and male activists across this country who have seen the inequity, have worked effectively to gain the evidence and have brought forward the information.
We have had it confirmed consistently by Bureau of Statistics figures that wages are not keeping pace on the gender gap. We have all this information but, in 2008, we still need to ask whether, for some failing in what has worked in the process and in the workplace, we need to implement new law. It seems to me that what we need to do is look at what is already there. We need to have a look at the range of processes that are in place now and take up the call from the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency and, workplace by workplace working cooperatively together, take the process through the tool. First of all, we need to define what pay equity is. Once again I think that people do not truly understand the concept. People are so caught up in the struggles of day-to-day existence—the various demands of budgeting and of survival, worthy as they are—that they have actually overlooked the issue of equity in the workplace, particularly when it comes to the male-female divide. So we need to work out together exactly what pay equity is. It actually defines work and defines the various allowances.
We then move on to a very necessary lesson in the history of the issue, because all too often struggles that have been taking place in our community over years on valuable social justice issues are forgotten. They are put away into the tomes of history and, unless there are people who are prepared to talk about it and to celebrate the struggles that have taken place, it is way too easy to forget the struggles of the many women and men. Many were involved in trade unions and many were strong employers. They are people who saw that injustices were occurring.
We need to look at the value of women’s work, at the remuneration for women’s work and also at the general area of work conditions so that they apply to the whole environment of the workplace. In that context, there have been struggles and we have had legal successes, but the end result is that we have not got what we all thought we had, which is pay equity.
But through using this tool and through working with your workplace, you can work through the process and do it locally so that it has much more meaning because, inevitably, when you can read about something that is in history or affects someone else, it is easy not to identify and to somehow conclude that it is somebody else’s struggle. To me, one of the very important things on the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency website is that they can give you effective links to other sites so you can get this information almost immediately and identify with what has happened in other places. It says—and I love this question—that after you have actually had the immediate discussion with your workers, the question is:
Is pay equity still a problem in Australia?
I am really encouraging workplaces to go through this process and come up with their own answers. But I am going to give them a little hint. The answer to that question is, yes, pay equity is still a problem in our country. When you see the Bureau of Statistics figures, no-one could actually look at the disparity and say that it is not a problem.
We also have a snapshot of what the current law is, because, again, unless you are caught up in the process yourself, normally at a time of crisis—because often when you actually discover inequity it is when you have been a victim in some way—you are not too certain about what law to seek out and from whom to gain assistance. That is one of the key elements of this agency in the government public sector. The Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency can provide forward information for where people can go to get the assistance they need.
You would expect that I would say something about the trade union movement. From the time that this issue became clear in the 1890s, when there was a struggle in Queensland about the formation of the first women’s trade union, there was some dynamic within the process about whether women coming into the workplace were going to take away some of the conditions and wages of their male counterparts. From that time, strong women trade unionists were at the forefront of this struggle, because it is not easily achieved. There needs to be a struggle. From that time, women like Emma Miller, May Jordan and all of us who have come after them have actually seen that true wage equity is a challenge for us and that the role of trade unions is to support all their members. It is not a contest. To achieve true pay equity for women does not mean that men must lose out in any way. Workers can—I hope as a result of working through the EOWA tool—together decide that pay equity is an issue for them and their workplaces.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Equal Pay Day</title>,Matters of Public Interest,7,1,speech

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-08-27,"—The hypocrisy in that question is breathtaking—from a senior minister in the Howard government who for 11 years did nothing to improve the lot of those pensioners. But it is an important issue and despite the tone of the question I will take it seriously. The government understands that many pensioners are doing it tough, that pressure on the cost of living with grocery bills increasing does mean that they are under pressure. We accept that food price rises, fuel costs and other pressures in the economy are resulting in inflation that particularly hits those who are on fixed incomes. Pensioners and carers are those who are most vulnerable because they have the least capacity to absorb those inflationary pressures. We are very much focused on tackling the inflation problem. We made it the No. 1 priority of the budget. As senators would know, our capacity to deliver on that fight against inflation is largely based on our ability to get our budget passed. We are deeply concerned that the Liberal Party have abandoned all sense of economic responsibility and have chosen to just oppose for the sake of opposing. In our first budget we did make a serious attempt to assist pensioners and carers. We did provide $1.4 billion of extra support to seniors. A $500 bonus was paid to 2.7 million senior Australians. That came on top of an increase in the utilities allowance from the $107 that the Howard government paid to $500 a year.
—Do you think that is enough, do you?
—It is a substantial $400 increase over the allowance paid by the previous government, Senator Coonan. I think it was a very serious attempt to try to take the pressure off them. As I said, we are very concerned about the pressure on pensioners. We understand that the quarterly indexation payments that they received recently are not easing that pressure alone. That is why we have made it a priority as part of the review of the tax system to make a serious attempt to tackle the structural issues that underpin the value of the pensions and to look at what we can do to assist pensioners in a more fundamental way rather than the piecemeal way that the previous government did.
—What about doing something?
—Senator Coonan, you want to keep chirping away. I welcome your contribution later today to explain why, after 11 long years, after a long period as a senior minister in the Howard government, you failed to do anything for pensioners. For you to turn around within eight months of going out of power and cry crocodile tears does not wash with pensioners—does not wash. If you were serious you would have done something. You did nothing. You stand on your record. You stand condemned. What this government did is make a huge down payment to assist pensioners and carers in its first budget. We inherited an economy with inflation at rampant levels, and that is putting enormous pressure on pensioners. We are trying to bring inflation under control, and if the Liberal Party—

—I am happy to complete my answer, if I am able to, which is to make the point that this government is very much focused on its assistance to pensioners and the best thing we can do for them in the short term is to fight inflation, and that means getting our budget passed. We urge the opposition to support us in that endeavour. (Time expired)

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-08-27,"—As I explained to Senator Coonan, this government made it a priority in the last budget and made a commitment of $5 billion over five years in direct support to pensioners in terms of utilities allowance, telephone allowance, et cetera. All those measures are designed to try to take some pressure off those pensioners. We accept that more needs to be done. We accept that they are under enormous pressure. But to be lectured by a former Howard government minister who did nothing in 11 years to resolve those pressures on pensioners quite frankly does not wash with me and does not wash with the pensioners affected. What we are doing is working hard at the issues that go to income for pensioners. As I said, it was a priority of the last budget and it remains a government priority. As we have indicated, the report on pension payments will be available to us by February next year. (Time expired)

Commonwealth Securities economist Craig James cast doubt on the government’s rhetoric by saying that the budget surplus was in such good shape that losing $6.1 billion in revenue over four years would have little impact on the wider economy.
In light of Mr James’s remarks, I ask the minister how the government can seriously claim that there is a major macroeconomic difference between a surplus of $21.5 billion and a surplus of $20 billion.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-08-27,"—That question again demonstrates how out of touch those on the other side are from the struggling families who are the victims of higher interest rates due to the irresponsible spending that ‘Doctor Yes’ over there, former Minister for Finance and Administration Senator Minchin, was incapable of dealing with. He could not stand up to the former Prime Minister. He could not say, ‘Look, Mr Prime Minister, do you think that when you took all of those suggested election promises, it was just to pick one, not to pick ten?’ Do you think that former minister for finance Senator Minchin was able to actually do a competent job?
The opposition can opportunistically pull apart the budget any way that they like. But the fact will always remain that the Rudd government is lowering taxes as a share of the economy. We are delivering $47 billion in personal income tax cuts. We are lowering the tax burden on the economy from the 24.7 per cent of GDP that we inherited to 23.8 per cent of GDP. Those figures are unarguable. That is lower than for any of the last six budgets. You can sit there and try to pretend that that is not the case, but the statistics are law. There is no arguing these issues.
When it comes to high-taxing governments, the Liberals take the crown, the cake and every other award you want to give them. Sitting over there are the members of the highest taxing governments. The former Minister for Finance in the highest taxing, highest spending government is sitting there right now asking questions and crying crocodile tears about the economy. The Liberals were the highest taxing government in our history. As I said, taxes as a share of GDP were 24.7 per cent. They imposed a higher tax burden on Australian families than any government in Australian history. Of course, that is in addition to the record inflation they gave Australian families—12 interest rate rises—and the Work Choices regime.
Now, the opposition’s irresponsible and reckless approach in the Senate is putting at risk the responsible economic policies introduced by the Rudd government. They are putting at risk the surplus that will buffer our economy from international forces and improve our ability to effectively fight inflation. It is something they gave up on and ran up the white flag over. Now they want to continue to undermine responsible economic management. They are putting at risk our ability to invest in the future productive capacity of the Australian economy for the benefit of all Australians. (Time expired)

So, Minister, on the basis that you have now told us that it will be suspended, how will the ANAO undertake its inquiry, given that it ‘will have regard to the outcomes of the review being undertaken by the government staffing committee’?

I can also inform the Senate that the government staffing committee, of which I am a member, commenced its review of this issue. But of course, before the committee could conclude its deliberations, we were informed that the Auditor-General would be undertaking a performance audit of the CMAX Communications contract.

I can absolutely assure Senator Ronaldson and the Senate that the government will be ensuring that the Auditor-General is able to complete his audit and any inquiries he cares to make without any political interference and I certainly hope without any political bluster from the opposition.
I can inform the Senate that the government staffing committee, when it received its advice in relation to the Auditor-General’s inquiry, did formally suspend its consideration pending the conclusion of the Auditor-General’s performance audit.

Prior to that time there had been a differential treatment of luxury vehicles—since 1979 under a coalition government—when a luxury car tax could not gain the full benefits of depreciation due to the cap on the depreciation amount. Under the Hawke-Keating government the differential treatment was via a wholesale sales tax rate. It was a differential rate in the wholesale sales tax that led to the introduction of the luxury car tax at the time of the GST’s introduction so that luxury cars did not fall more heavily in price than other vehicles.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-08-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Coonan today relating to the cost of living.
Francis Bacon said, ‘Trust not servants who mislead you,’ and it is very clear that the Australian public cannot trust Mr Rudd and the Labor government, because the public were misled at the last election. They were misled in a number of areas but principally they were misled that the Rudd government was going to do something about rising grocery prices, that the Rudd government was going to do something about rising fuel prices and that the Rudd government was going to do something about rising gas prices. They were not misled that the Rudd government was going to do something about rising house prices, because it has engineered an economic slowdown that has seen the price of houses fall for people, leaving many in a situation of negative mortgage equity.
This is a government that cannot be trusted. They have succeeded in failing all the tests put before them by the Australian people. What has Mr Rudd done about this? Mr Rudd has done a Pontius Pilate: he has washed his hands of any responsibility by saying, ‘We have done as much as we physically can to help the family budget.’ Ms Macklin, the minister for families, has acknowledged that people are doing it very tough. In a recent opinion piece, she said:
Pensioners are doing it tough. With the cost of food, electricity, gas and petrol going up it’s getting harder and harder for people on pensions to pay the bills. They tell me time and time again how difficult it is ...
My message to the government is this: the people of Australia have also been telling me about the hard heart that lies at the very core of this government. They say that the government do not care about the plight that many, who are doing it tough on fixed incomes, are dealing with and that the government have given up on trying to redress the imbalance that they suffer at a time when inflation is rising—and it is the highest it has been in 16 years. And what is the Rudd government’s solution to rising inflation? They put the prices of things up.
Anyone who knows a little bit about economics knows that inflation is measured by rising prices. Putting prices up does not solve any issues with inflation; it contributes to it. It is a disgraceful clutch, a grab, at money to put extra pressure on Australian families so that the Rudd government can put more money in its coffers for its own re-election at a later time. All the while that this government fiddles, the finances of the pensioners and carers of Australia are burning, let me tell you.
In nine months of the government, who have to take ownership of these problems because they have handed down their own budget, they initially sought to take away the one-off bonus payments to pensioners and carers, to the great shame of many. The only possible things that they have implemented are to put up the utilities allowance and the telephone allowance, both of which were copied from coalition policies of the last election. They have done nothing else; there is nothing new. They were elected on the basis of having a plan. They have no coherent plan. They have a plan to have a plan at some stage in the future. We know that pensioners are doing it tough and we know that carers are doing it tough, but nothing is being done by this very tough and careless government. They have promised that, once again, they will have a look at these things but they have not done it. They have no real strategy about dealing with it until 2010. They are having review after review. This is what the people of Australia tell me when they stop me in the street: ‘Will you please replace this uncaring government? Will you please get back into control of Treasury so you can help us out over the course of time?’ This government have not assisted anyone who is doing it really tough.
Whilst they have not made any meaningful impact on assisting people, they have managed to spend millions upon millions of dollars on telling people, through a website, what prices were 30 days ago. I guess this is so they can track inflation themselves, by calculating the cost of goods today versus the cost of goods 30 days ago. I read the other day that the much vaunted GroceryWatch website is now getting less than a few hundred thousand hits, mostly, I guess, to see if all the ridicule of it is quite appropriate. There are already calls for it to be shut down. They are a government who allegedly care. What they care about is spin, and they have no substance whatsoever.
What about their claim that fuel prices were going to drop under this government? Fuel prices reached record highs under this government, and what did the government promise to do? Nothing. It was up to the coalition to champion the cause and fight against high fuel prices for the men and women of Australia, including pensioners, who are doing it tough. What else have the government done to ease the cost of living for people? As perverse as it may sound, they are trumpeting today how many new jobs have been created in the manufacturing sector, and yet in their budget they were forecasting that over 100,000 jobs would be lost—they have budgeted for 100,000 jobs to be lost.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2008-08-27,"—It is very worrying that in this place we actually descend to the level that has just been done in that response. In terms of process, over the last nine months there has been constant attack by the opposition about lack of action from the government—not taking into account the years of lack of action, refusal to answer questions and refusal to respond to any of the issues about pensioners that we were raising during that process. I cannot believe that Senator Bernardi got up in this place and ran the argument that we refused to actually look at the one-off payments when we all know that it was a clear budget scare campaign, used in a very open way.
Before the budget was brought down, the opposition tried, through media scare campaigns, to terrify the community, elicit a response from the government—which was moving towards its first budget—and have leaks from the government. We assured the people of this country—in particular the pensioners of this country—that we were listening to their concerns. What was happening with this particular attack about the one-off payments was that the government were looking at the options they would take and were goaded by the opposition leading up to it. They were trying to create fear amongst the people we were trying to support. In the end, when the budget came down, there was a clear understanding that the utilities allowance, which Senator Bernardi mentioned, would continue. We actually came forward with the process of continuing to work with pensioners to ensure that there was going to be a response to their needs.
We did not pretend that there is a simple answer—at no time has there been any pretence from this government that it was going to be a simple answer—but what we said was that we were going to give the immediate payment through the budget process, not in response to the scare campaign from the opposition but rather to try and work effectively to respond to some of the issues that came out in the Senate inquiry into the cost of living for older Australians. We were listening to that. We were not listening to the attempts to bring down a government budget before it was produced. What we said was that we would take the immediate steps through the budget process and that then, through the establishment of the Henry review of the whole process of taxation and expenditure from the government, there would be a dedicated process, looking in particular at the issues of older Australians. Senator Bernardi knows this. This is what is most offensive in the process that is being used by the opposition. They know the process that is in place. They actually know how complex the social welfare system that is going through is; they know that. But still, to gain a cheap response and also to scare the people about whom we should be concerned, they consistently come forward with short media grabs to try and create a more negative process.
In the Henry campaign, the process is being put in place across the whole of the economy and also, most particularly, in response to what we have been hearing this afternoon about the attacks on pensioners and people who are doing it tough. That is being handled through the Harmer subcommittee of the Henry taxation review. On that subcommittee we have a number of people from across the whole process.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—We hear that reviews are not good enough. Yes, it was good enough for 12 years to come up with a bandaid response in budget after budget and one-off payment after one-off payment, with no attempt to look at the whole system, no attempt to plan for the future, no attempt to engage with the people about whom we are speaking—the very people who will actually need to be supported by the process. The process that has been put in place by this government, which Senator Evans referred to in his answers, is going forward using the people who have the need and actually working with them to see what the long-term solution is, not a short-term bandaid. We know that, the more you do not address the key problem and the more you take a short-term response, the harder the program and the problem are going to be. That is what we have lived with in this country for 12 years: we have not sought to find an overall solution to balance the needs and to actually engage the whole process to look at what can be done for the people who have the most need. We have tried to get the good news program, the good news headline, so that we can feel good for a couple of days while, at the same time, taking every opportunity to throw dust in the eyes of the people who are trying to do a longer term response.
No-one pretends that this is easy. Minister Macklin has been open about how she understands that people are suffering, and that has never been denied. But continuing to put the bandaid on it, as some people in the opposition think is the way to go, is not the best response. As long as we continue to scare, it will not— (Time expired)

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2008-08-27,"—I also seek to take note of the answers from Senator Evans. It has been heartrending to hear all these comments about the government listening to the concerns of pensioners and others on fixed wages. We even had Minister Evans tell us that pensioners are doing it tough. In that, he is completely agreeing with the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Minister Macklin, who on Sunday wrote a newspaper column to tell the world the revolutionary piece of information that pensioners are doing it tough. So we have all this wonderful listening and empathising going on. What we do not have is any action.
I was somewhat concerned when Minister Macklin told the 4½ million Australians whose lives are affected by the pension system that we need to think about what the system will look like in 20 years. That would be wonderful—let us find out what the system will look like in 20 years—but what does that do for the pensioners and others on a fixed income who are struggling right now? As Senator Moore pointed out when we did the Senate inquiry into cost of living pressures on older Australians—whose report we actually brought down in March this year—we knew then that pensioners were doing it tough; it was very obvious that pensioners were doing it tough. Five months later, the minister announces to the no doubt breathless media that pensioners are doing it tough and says: ‘But just wait. We’re in the middle of a process. It’ll all be all right. The Harmer review will’—

Senator Birmingham interjecting—

—There will be a lot more listening and empathising going on, no doubt, Senator Birmingham, whilst this process happens. The Harmer review, sometime next year, will produce a result from a process. They have not actually said it will—

Senator Birmingham interjecting—

—No, actions and results are different; we are talking about a process, listening and empathising—great stuff, but it is not washing and it will not wash with the pensioners and others on fixed incomes in Australia. They are saying, ‘We hurt right now. You knew in March this year that we hurt and you have done nothing about it and are continuing to do nothing about it.’ The crocodile tears from Senator Evans do not help—the righteous indignation, as though something is actually happening because you get sad and upset and let the world know that, ‘Gee, it’s tough out there.’ What does that do for the pensioners? Nothing has changed.
In the past two weeks I have received over 700 letters from pensioners in Queensland explaining the difficulties that they face right now. There is no reason whatsoever why something cannot be done to help couple pensioners and, in particular, single pensioners as the rents go up, as fuel prices go up, as grocery prices go up, whether you are watching them or not. It is particularly the single pensioners who hurt more, because you cannot rent half a house, no matter how high rents go; you cannot make that economy in your lifestyle.
—They’re lucky they have a process, then!
—They are. Perhaps we should develop a process for renting half houses—do you think so, Senator Birmingham? You cannot drive half a car no matter how high petrol prices go. So there is an argument and action is needed right now to help the single pensioners who rely on 56 per cent of a couple pension rate. By all means let us look to the future but let us not just look to the future. Everywhere I go I hear pensioners saying: ‘When will the Prime Minister act? He talks and he listens; he’s a dud. All he does is listen. There is no action. Please help us now.’",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Pensions and Benefits</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,14,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2008-08-27,"—Mr Deputy President, I congratulate you on your new position in the Senate. I rise on the same matter of pensions and benefits. Before I outline some of the details of the start that the Rudd government has already made, contrary to the suggestions of some of the senators who spoke earlier, can I first express my surprise at the sheer audacity of the content of the debate so far from opposition senators. Senator Bernardi suggests that there has been spin but no substance or action in this area. Let me address that point first.
While there is more to do and the government is concerned about the pressure of inflation on seniors, the government has made a start. We have provided $1.4 billion in extra support to seniors. A $500 bonus was paid to 2.7 million senior Australians. This came on top of our commitment of over $5 billion over five years to increases in a number of areas—to increase the utilities allowance and seniors concession allowance from $107.20 to $500 a year and to increase the telephone allowance for those with a home internet connection from $88 to $132 a year, beginning 20 March. The first quarterly instalments of these payments were made in March and in June. These increases are ongoing and locked in for the future, not like the past Howard government’s one-off payments. We are also examining indexation arrangements for the age pension.
But let us contrast that with what has been put forward by the alternative government to date. Senator Boyce gave me one extra policy idea in the debate today—let’s look at renting half a house. While I am sure she made that comment in part jest, as a quip in this debate, if you look at the other alternatives that have been canvassed by our alternative government you see there is an enormous void. We did originally have the shadow minister suggest that we look at the indexation issue, but within 24 hours we had the alternative Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, saying, ‘No, we’re not talking about doing that.’ That is the extent of the alternative government’s position in this area. Just look at that when you consider the audacity of this being the one issue that the opposition chose for debate today arising from question time.
Certainly we do have a range of issues under review, because we do have a longer-term concern with how we structure our welfare and social security system. We do want to put in long-term, economically manageable improvements for the wellbeing of our seniors and other social security recipients. We do want to keep in mind how that relates to the tax system. We do not want to follow the history and the pattern of the Howard government of one-off payments that were not costed or accounted for in following years, one-off payments that often were introduced in the period before an election and were not maintained for the period following an election. It was an ad hoc system.
Interestingly, ‘ad hoc’ relates to other issues that were canvassed in question time today on industry policy. I heard questions on the car industry coming from the opposition. Again, the audacity of the opposition in that area astounds me. If you look at the Howard government’s history of industry policy and all of the ad hoc measures particularly with respect to the car industry in South Australia—and Senator Minchin has come back into the chamber—the audacity of questions today in relation to the car industry was astounding. A long-term vision, a long-term plan, which is what the Rudd government is seeking to establish, is critical there as well.
But, going back to the pensions issue, let me stress that the government knows that many pensioners are doing it tough, with cost of living pressures resulting from the rising cost of groceries and other bills. Over the year to June 2008, food prices rose by 3.9 per cent. Fuel rose by 8.7 per cent in the last quarter and by 18.4 per cent over the year to June 2008. Some of this is the legacy of poor economic management by the former government. As responsible economic managers, we know that we must seriously address some of these issues. (Time expired)

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2008-08-27,"—Mr Deputy President, may I formally congratulate you on your new position. I rise today also to take note of answers given by Senator Evans. Senator Collins is very concerned about why we should choose such a topic as pensioners to discuss. I cannot believe that she thinks that we should have discussed something else. This is incredible. Australian pensioners are struggling to survive. With rising petrol and grocery prices and rising inflation rates and insurance premiums, most Australian pensioners are far worse off than they were a year ago.
As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which inquired into the cost of living pressures on older Australians, I attended all the committee hearings. We produced a report—as Senator Boyce said—and called it A decent quality of life. A lot of thought went into this title. We believe that our older Australians, pensioners and carers are very important. Today I want to speak especially about Aboriginal pensioners who live out in the desert, because they are really having a very hard time surviving. These people are very important Australians, and to think that one of our senators cannot understand why the opposition has decided to address this situation is rather astounding.
In the West Australian on Monday was the headline ‘Exorbitant food prices mean some Aboriginals go hungry’. Last week the Senate Select Committee on Regional and Remote Indigenous Communities visited Balgo, Fitzroy Crossing, Derby and Broome. I have some quotes here from a little community out in the Tanami Desert called Mulan. That is very close to the Northern Territory-Western Australian border. These people, 160 residents, are among the country’s poorest and many are going hungry a couple of days a week. The local Assembly of God pastor says that the extremely high prices at the Mulan Community Store were hurting everyone but particularly the elderly. He went on to say: ‘Everyone shares food. It is part of our culture. But the old people will give away their food to see the children eat.’ Several pensioners he knew were forced to survive the last few days before their next pension payment by eating homemade damper or they simply went hungry. Is this what we want for our pensioners, and especially those that live in remote areas?
The majority of Mulan’s residents on welfare benefits receive between $200 and $250 a week and it is virtually impossible for them to live in the community and eat a healthy diet. Diesel costs $2.80 a litre in this area and the nearest regional centre, Halls Creek, is an eight-hour round trip along the corrugated Tanami Track. People have little choice but to shop at the Mulan Community Store. Just to give you an example of how much things cost there, half a pumpkin is $14.42, 1.7 kilos of sausages is $16.42, 1.4 kilos of chops is $33.92 and 1.3 kilos of potatoes—6 potatoes—is $8.71. Bread is $3.50 a loaf and four ears of corn is $15.50. These are the issues that these people have to deal with. Coming from a rural area myself, I am fully aware of the cost of the groceries going up in our local community and in places further out. The cost at Balgo the other day was $15,000 for the truck to come to the community store with all the commodities that the community needed for a week—$15,000 to pay for the freight. Of course, the freight cost has to be passed on to those who consume the goods.
The other thing that is really worrying me at the moment for Western Australia is the tax that is going to be placed on condensate. That is going to raise the cost of gas. (Time expired)

I present the seventh report of 2008 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 7 of 2008, dated 27 August 2008.

That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to have my tabling statement incorporated in Hansard.

Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
In tabling the Committee’s Alert Digest No. 6 of 2008, I was highly critical of the quality of the explanatory memoranda for the package of four Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) bills. These bills included, among other things, confusing commencement provisions and numerous strict liability provisions, which were poorly explained, or not explained at all, in the accompanying explanatory memoranda.
The Committee’s Seventh Report of 2008, which I am tabling today, includes comments from the Minister for Resources and Energy in response to the issues raised by the Committee about these bills. I would like to congratulate the Minister on his comprehensive and informative response, which provides clear rationale for the strict liability provisions, and addresses other matters that had caused the Committee some concern.
It is unfortunate that this information was not included in the explanatory memoranda to these bills. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee places considerable reliance on explanatory memoranda in determining whether or not provisions in bills raise concerns within its terms of reference. If the explanatory memoranda are lacking, then the Committee must seek additional advice from Ministers, as it did in this case, creating additional work for all concerned.
On behalf of the Committee, I would also like to thank the Minister for his commitment to amend the commencement provisions for these bills. As they currently stand, the commencement provisions are confusing and commonly link commencement of provisions in these bills to the commencement of provisions in other Acts, which in turn were linked to commencement provisions in yet more Acts.
The Minister’s commitment to move amendments, simplifying the commencement provisions of these bills, is welcomed by the Committee. Such amendments will assist the reader to ascertain when it is intended for the various provisions to come into effect.
I commend the Committee’s Seventh Report of 2008 and Alert Digest No. 7 of 2008 to the Senate.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-08-27,"—I move:
That the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 be referred to the Environment, Communications and the Arts Committee for inquiry and report by 10 November 2008.
The reason Family First has put forward this motion to refer the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts for an inquiry and report is that there is concern about the changes in the definitions and direction of the management of the park and about the definition of the precautionary principle, which basically could end up stopping any recreational fishing in the marine park. Everybody is rightly concerned to make sure that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is looked after, but we need to make sure that we do not stop recreational fishers from legitimately fishing within those boundaries. There have been serious concerns raised by various groups that warrant and justify the Senate looking into this legislation and those concerns before making a decision. I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of any Senate inquiry, but quite clearly there are concerns from various groups. Given those concerns, I think it makes sense for the Senate to look into this bill because it proposes some significant changes to what is currently in place.
There is no need to rush this bill through. The reporting date of 10 November for the inquiry would allow the government to get the legislation through this year, so we are not wanting to frustrate the government. The reporting date gives plenty of time and scope for various interest groups to have their say and for the Senate to listen to both sides of the arguments and make sure there are no unintended consequences. The Senate is the house of review to look at legislation, so I think an inquiry makes sense. I appeal to all senators, not just to the government of the day, to support this motion. It is for an inquiry into a bill that various community groups have concerns with. I think we need to have an inquiry to hear those concerns, to hear both sides, and then the Senate can look at the committee’s report.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-08-27,"—The concerns that have been raised by Senator Fielding have been raised over a period of time by some of the peak body groups in Queensland and have also been well and truly addressed within the coalition. I note that a media release was circulated the other day from my office and I also note the strong attention that has been paid to this matter by Senator Macdonald and Senator Boswell. In particular, two sections of the bill come to mind. One of them—I think it is section 9—pertaining to the definition of fishing is ludicrous in its explanation. We get a definition of fishing where you can be in the process of a criminal activity if you even consider fishing rather than actually engage in it. This is an Orwellian type of oversight. I would say it is an extreme environmentalists’ oversight that has completely taken the place of people’s liberties in certain areas, and they are no longer given the benefit of the doubt. This is a serious issue that needs to be the subject of an inquiry. Likewise, the precautionary principle as a catch-all is an issue that also needs discussing.
I would also like to note the work that has been done within the coalition in bringing this matter to the fore. The coalition and others who wish to support this issue will determine the number of inquiries, where they will be held and the outcome that is obtained from them. It stands as a matter of course that the outcome of the vote and the inquiry will be determined by a majority in the Senate. It will be the weight of the Senate majority rather than any individual senator that will determine the outcome of this bill. It is important that the people who engage in commercial and recreational fishing, to whom this process is truly important, have the opportunity to clearly understand this issue. We must now engage in this debate in such a way as to garner a majority vote in this chamber.
This is one of the issues on which I hope we can shine a strong light. If people do not see it from the context of fishing, they will see it in the context of how a law can become unreasonable and oppressive when the definitions of certain terms that have worked their way into the legislation become so all encompassing that all manner of people will not be given the benefit of the doubt under this legislation that they would be given in any other facet of law and order and as they should. As I mentioned, particular attention should be paid to the definition of ‘fishing’. This definition will now include not only people who are caught in the act but also those who may intend to go fishing or look like they may go fishing. If I were driving down the coast near an excluded zone and were looking out the window considering fishing and someone truly knew that, would the act allow someone to convict me for it? So it is more than just a matter of a fishing issue; it is a matter that goes to the sentiment of the law. We must be ever vigilant in this chamber to ensure that laws do not become overarching, and remain reasonable. When we start putting forward unreasonable laws, we start to lose our validity and the respect that we hope this chamber would attract.
I know that others will wish to speak on this. In closing, it is very important that I note the work that people such as Senator Boswell and my LNP colleague Senator Ian Macdonald have done on this issue. This work will be ongoing throughout this inquiry. I look forward to the inquiry, which I hope will be conducted in various centres around Queensland in proximity to the fishing zone. I hope that those who are concerned about this issue will attend the inquiries so that they can discuss their concerns.
Finally, I suggest that, if this legislation goes forward in its current overarching form, it will become an onerous precedent to other legislation in similar fishing areas around our coast. What will start with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority will soon become legislation for Moreton Bay, Tasmania and Western Australia. When they see the precedent that this bill sets, they too would have good reason to be concerned about where this is going. It is not just about fishing; it is about the precedent set by a law that not only applies to those committing an act but includes the ridiculous principle of applying to those considering an act. How can anybody possibly determine whether someone is considering an act? It is onerous in the extreme. I believe the Greens may want to look at this as well because, if they believe in this principle for fishing, they must also believe that it should apply in terrorism and everywhere else.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-08-27,"—The coalition will be supporting this motion to refer the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 to a committee. I assume that, in accordance with past practice, the Greens will also be supporting it. And I suspect the Labor Party will not have any objection to it either. So, on behalf of the coalition, I indicate that we will be supporting the motion to refer the bill to a committee.
The bill arose from a widespread review of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act. The review took place last year and the year before. It was conducted by a very senior group of public servants, including the secretary and some independent people. They reviewed the whole act and came forward with recommendations. I think the bill was prepared by the previous government but it was not dealt with before the parliament rose for the election. The new government has brought the bill forward, basically in accordance with the recommendations of the review committee, although there have been some amendments to it by the new government. These will be debated and looked into by the committee that will be reviewing this and by the Senate itself.
I have already given notice that the coalition will be moving an amendment in relation to appointments to the board, requiring that one of the appointments to the board of GBRMPA be a person with experience in the tourism industry or another industry related to the Great Barrier Reef. We have also tabled today a further amendment raising the issue that I mentioned briefly earlier this afternoon of the fishermen who had been convicted under the original law and received fines—perhaps not great in a monetary sense—for offences under the act as it was then.
They were treated as serious criminal offences and the impact of that was that those who were convicted have a permanent criminal record, which can have an impact on them when they apply for international access arrangements, for example, visas to the United States. That of course was an unintended consequence of the original legislation. That is why the former government previously had amended the act to provide that, in future, for people breaching the no-go zones, the green zones, the offences would be dealt with by an on-the-spot ticket which carried a substantial fine but which did not have a criminal record attached to it. That is an amendment that we will be moving.
Senator Boswell, Senator Joyce, Senator Trood and others have done a lot of work on this over the last 12 to 18 months. I did mention earlier this afternoon, and will only briefly repeat it now, that I raised this in the May estimates session with the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Debus, whose department I understand deals with pardons and also with the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I received from public officials and the ministers—I will not verbal them by saying encouragement—certainly not discouragement from the process of applying for pardons, which I then took further and encouraged those convicted to apply for a pardon. I put a proforma application form on my website hoping that people would take it up and that the government would realise that this needed to be addressed and in fact then address it.
I again mention that before the last election some good work by Senator Boswell had then Prime Minister Howard giving an election commitment to have these convictions overturned should the then government win the election. As we know, that did not happen of course. At that time Senator Kerry O’Brien, who was then the opposition’s shadow minister for agriculture, fisheries and forestry, promised that a Labor government upon election would also overturn these convictions. That is recorded in the Townsville Bulletin and people went to the election accepting that both major parties would overturn those convictions. It has been somewhat of a disappointment to me that the Labor government have not honoured that commitment by introducing separate legislation. According to Senator Ludwig there were four people who applied for pardons and, as I understand it, they have been rejected by the government. I am disappointed about that. This amendment that we have already tabled will allow the Senate, the government and Senator O’Brien in particular to have those convictions treated as spent convictions under the Crimes Act. There are other issues involved in this bill that require investigation and Senator Joyce has mentioned some of them; there will be others. In supporting Senator Fielding’s motion for reference to a committee the coalition takes the view that it would be good to expose this to the widest range of people.
I conclude by saying that, whatever we do, it is essential that the government, legislation and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority do everything possible to protect what is one of the nine wonders of the world—that is, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. It is a magnificent and quite unique reef that is worth millions and millions of dollars to the tourism industry and worth uncountable dollars to our marine environment. It is very important that we do protect it. It is one of the best managed coral reefs in the world and all credit to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and, might I say, to Malcolm Fraser, who first introduced legislation in the federal parliament—
—It is good to hear you saying something nice about Malcolm.
—It was the Liberal Party and we Liberals have always been the party of the environment. It is good that Malcolm Fraser all those years ago took this initiative, as we took with the Greenhouse Office, Senator Evans. We are the party of the environment.
—A great success that.
—It was a great success. We actually started it. The Labor Party never did anything about those sorts of things, so these are environmental issues on which the Liberal Party is proud to be judged. It is a very important asset for Australia and whatever we do with this legislation, which is meant to protect the reef in the best possible administrative way, it is important that that underlying principle remains. As I mentioned on behalf of the opposition, we support the motion to refer the bill to the committee.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-08-27,"—The Greens will not be supporting this motion. There has been enormously extensive community consultation over this important legislation to modernise the antiquated legislation to protect the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage area, which is one of the great icons of the world. It is also to be noted here that this is legislation drawn up under the previous government. It essentially comes from that government, and now the opposition, having moved to the other side of the House, are saying that they want another inquiry into it. It is quite untoward and unnecessary. We want to see this legislation in place and working after the extensive consultation and stakeholder support for it. We will not be supporting this motion.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-08-27,"—The government will not be supporting this motion on the referral of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 to committee either. We are a bit confused by the opposition’s position on this. They seem to have had another change of heart. I do not know whether there has been another party room meeting and a revision of their policy position. When this was before the Selection of Bills Committee earlier this year and when the report was adopted by the Senate on 25 June 2008, the opposition then supported the recommendation that the bill not be referred to a committee. So, as late as 25 June, the opposition were quite happy for the bill to be brought on for debate and did not require it to be referred to a committee. It seems that today they have another position. I am not quite sure what has changed. If you look at when this bill was debated in the House, you see opposition members supported it quite enthusiastically, as I understand it. I am getting used to the situation where the opposition seem to flip-flop on issues but this seems to be a bit remarkable.
Senator Macdonald quite rightly made the point that there has been a very long and effective process, and coalition senators played a very important role, as did other senators, in that consultation process. The outcome, as I understand it, has been largely supported by stakeholders. The first of the bills arising out of that review was passed through the parliament in June 2007 on the initiation of the previous government. This bill is the second, which I understand was contemplated by the previous government and which seeks to implement the review that they supported. So it is of some surprise to us today that the opposition have again reversed their position and now seek to refer the bill to a committee. As late as June, senators from the opposition were prepared to support its passage and it being brought on for debate.
Now we have a motion by Senator Fielding that this bill be referred not only to a committee—and I understand that Senator Macdonald may have some concerns now which he might not have been aware of before, even though the position of his party was clear—but to a committee that will report on 10 November 2008. A process has been extensively carried out by this parliament over a number of years, with a lot of stakeholder consultation, a report endorsed by the parliament and the first stage of the legislation passed. At the eleventh hour, Senator Fielding comes in here and wants it to be delayed to November with, to be honest, not much rationale for such a long delay. It is not like he is asking for it to be deferred until next week or for a Friday committee. Despite that extensive consultation, which Senator Macdonald and the opposition have lauded, we are going to do it all over again. I am not sure why we are going to do it all over again and, quite frankly, no cogent case has been made.
I understand that, if there is support for this from the opposition and Senator Fielding, it may well be carried. But, quite frankly, we do not understand the opposition’s about-face on this issue. We do not understand what seems to be a rejection of all the work that they put into it. We do not understand the rejection of the stakeholder consultation and the extensive processes that occurred. We do not understand what changed between 25 June 2008, when they supported the proposition from the Selection of Bills Committee that it not be subject to inquiry and now. We are confused by the opposition’s position. We do not think that there has been a cogent argument made, given the extensive process and the wide support that it enjoyed from the then government and now opposition and the support that it enjoyed weeks ago in the House of Representatives. I am a bit bemused.
I do not know whether Senator Fielding has had a long interest in this, but he has to explain why this legislation—which we think is important—will be delayed again for months and why, if there are particular concerns, they could not be addressed in the committee stage of the bill.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-08-27,"—I heard what Senator Evans had to say, and I can tell you that it was not that convincing. He talked about the eleventh hour and Friday committees. It sounded as though he wanted to just rush this bill through without a decent hearing. There are legitimate concerns about this issue. You can talk about what others have done, but there are serious concerns that warrant an inquiry. I can assure you that there is no rush to this legislation.

That the motion (Senator Fielding’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-08-27,"—I rise in continuance of the debate on Senator Brown’s motion. Last night, in beginning my remarks, I was commenting on the fact that when I was teaching on the north-west coast of Tasmania many years ago I had a very bright and capable young woman in my class who was not allowed to go on to further education because the Exclusive Brethren prohibited it. They prohibit their young people from being able to go to university at all. As a former Meadowbank school principal, David Stewart, an Exclusive Brethren principal said:
We do not go in for higher learning. We gave up universities in the 1960s as the hotbed of atheism. They prove that everything is nothing to their own satisfaction. We have suffered no loss to our knowledge. We particularly recoil from novels and cinemas.
That is why those young people cannot go to university: because the brethren say so. They also make sure that they have arranged marriages and that once women are married they cannot work. It is the most repressive culture. But even if you were to accept that, by far and away the worst they do is break up families. If anybody tries to leave the Exclusive Brethren, that is the point at which they are cut off. They are cut off from children, parents, families, whatever. A person leaves and it is as if they have died from that point on. No matter how much the person on the outside tries to make contact with their family, they are cut off and denied. How is it that we are allowing this in Australia? We have already had evidence, and we have seen, that they have tried to interfere, for example, in matters before the Family Court.
But I want to concentrate for a minute on schools, because the Exclusive Brethren gets Commonwealth government funding for its private schools. Why is taxpayers’ money going to fund schools which actively prohibit people from going on to further education? My understanding is that you get federal funding if you meet the curriculum requirements of the states. How can these schools meet the curriculum requirements of the states when the Brethren have said that they are not allowed to have computers? Until recently they could not even have fax machines. We understand that some computers have been bought and left in boxes in the foyer of the school. However, we have also heard recently that the Elect Vessel has decided that Exclusive Brethren can now have access to some computers but that they will be ordered through him and through his businesses. He will provide whatever is needed under these arrangements, and we do not even know whether that is in Australia or New Zealand.
I have seen a report from the Exclusive Brethren today arguing that they are being vilified. In fact they say they obey the law scrupulously. That is not so. We have had before the parliament in the last few years the discrepancies under the Electoral Act, where they did not obey the law scrupulously, and they set up front companies in order to fund the Howard government’s election campaign. To this day we still do not know who gave the donations to Willmac so that Willmac could then make a single donation to the Liberal Party during the 2004 election—and that is ongoing. Another way in which they do not obey the law scrupulously was demonstrated on a current affairs program. An Exclusive Brethren woman said that she had transferred money, large sums of cash, in and out of Australia. In Ngaire Thomas’s book she said that it is quite common for them to bring bound paper parcels of cash in and out of the country. There are all sorts of things that we need to look at in terms of these tax arrangements in the transporting money arrangements and the deductions that are granted for being members of a so-called religion when the businesses are being run on a for-profit basis.
I want to go to the schools argument for a moment. In his contribution Senator Brown talked about letters that he had had from people who have left the Exclusive Brethren. They told absolutely heart-wrenching stories of what it has meant to them to lose their families, and they are actually supporting and wanting an inquiry into the behaviour of this cult. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that it is a cult and yet we understand that the government is not going to support this inquiry. I simply do not understand why the government is not going to support an inquiry into this sect, and I give notice now that I will be seeking to have incorporated into the Hansard these particular letters. I will quote from one of them in relation to schools, and this is of particular interest to me because I understand how the Exclusive Brethren get around the current funding arrangements. In order to qualify for federal government funding for non-government schools you have to have a certain number of students, so what they do is register one school and declare that it has up to 20 campuses all around the state, sometimes as far away as 600 kilometres or whatever from the school. So they set up a whole range of small schools and then claim it to be one school for the purposes of federal government funding.
I would like to know how the Howard government justified a 36 per cent increase in federal government funding for Brethren schools during the Howard years. It went from $10 million over three years to an estimated $50 million over four years for a national student population in total of about 2,000. How is that possible? Earlier today the coalition was talking about wanting transparency and openness in government processes. I want transparency and openness as to how it is that taxpayers’ money is being used to fund the schools of a cult which do not allow the same access to information technology that, under the curriculum, other students are required to have. I want to know how it is that we are using federal government taxpayers’ funding in schools which actively prevent kids from going on to further education and which actively prevent girls from doing subjects in the manual arts. I find that quite interesting.
Also quite interesting is the relationship between Brethren schools and Brethren businesses and politics. We know that the Liberal Party used the names and addresses of Brethren schools to authorise political advertisements during the 2004 election campaign. For example, there have been reports that when government funds are received at the Victorian Glenvale School the money is channelled into the Brethren marketing company, ProVision, putting at risk funds needed to pay for teachers. That is an allegation that I would like to see investigated in the course of an inquiry.
There are so many issues in relation to the Exclusive Brethren. One that is really of concern is about a website that was set up—peebs.net. It was set up by people who have left the Brethren and it is their main support network. These people have been in effectively closed societies for a long time and when they come out into the broader society it is the equivalent of coming out of jail because they have not had to interact with the broader society in their whole lives. This website has been particularly important in supporting them. If you go and have a look at the website you will see all their stories. They also have a suicide support watch on that website for people who are not coping with losing access to their families: children, parents and siblings. That website is critical and yet we now know that the Brethren in the USA are trying to force the closure of that website in spite of the fact that it has saved the lives of desperate people who have used it for emergency contact. We now know that there is litigation, as I said, in the United States to try to shut down this website.
That is the kind of power these people have. They have enough power to gain entry to the Prime Minister’s office. In spite of the fact that they do not vote, they feel comfortable intervening in elections in extremely dubious ways and, as I said, not transparent ways—particularly in relation to that Willmac incident in the 2004 election, because you cannot get behind the front company that they used to channel their donations to the Liberal Party. Of course, we will never forget the Tasmanian election where the same strategy was used and where advertisements—

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—I am very glad that Senator Abetz is here to answer this because I have always wanted to know how it was that the Liberal Party wrote the ad, placed the ad and paid for the ad from the Exclusive Brethren during that campaign.
—We didn’t.
—That came out in the Anti-Discrimination Tribunal in Tasmania when Damien Mantach was forced to admit that that was the case. He then argued that some kind of mix-up occurred as to why the Liberal Party’s cheques were paying for ads that were placed as part of the Exclusive Brethren campaign in the Tasmanian 2006 election.
—That’s just wrong.
—I would like to hear from Senator Abetz whether Damien Mantach was not telling the truth in the tribunal, whether the tribunal had false information or what was going on. There is a very clear and close relationship between the coalition and the Exclusive Brethren and there is a paper trail through that Anti-Discrimination Tribunal which demonstrates it.
It is no coincidence, in my view, that Damien Mantach worked in Prime Minister Howard’s office at the time that the Liberal Party ran the campaign with the Brethren against the Greens in the 2004 federal election and then moved to Tasmania to run the Liberal Party campaign in the 2006 state election where—surprise, surprise—exactly the same tactics were used. We were then able to prove through the Anti-Discrimination Tribunal that those ads were written, placed and paid for—
—We proved—
 (Senator Carol Brown)—Senator Abetz!
—as I indicated, by the Liberal Party. When I say ‘we’ I am referring to the people who took action in the Anti-Discrimination Tribunal. It was proved there. I do not mean ‘we’ in terms of the Greens.
—A quick recovery now!
—It is on the record that the Greens did not appear in the tribunal, so I am not alleging that I was in the tribunal.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Senator Abetz!
—However, I am not going to be distracted by this because the fact of the matter is that the Liberal Party and the Exclusive Brethren were as one in the community campaigning and it was not until the matter became very hot in the lead-up to the last federal election that the Prime Minister gave a directive to the Liberal Party not to associate as closely with the Exclusive Brethren.
I find it extraordinary that the Labor Party are not interested in actually examining the relationship between the Exclusive Brethren and the coalition. They ought to be interested in how Commonwealth money is spent. I think that, at the very least, we deserve to have an inquiry into the funding of Brethren schools and the basis on which that funding occurs and whether Brethren schools actually fulfil the state curriculum guidelines as required by state governments in order to qualify for federal government funding.
I also want to quote from another letter from an ex-Brethren member in Tasmania which says:
Since we made our decision to leave the cult, which was based on what was the best for our family, including our children, we believed it was in their best interests for us to give them the freedom of choice as they matured. This freedom of choice is to be able to partake in the activities of our community which the cult totally and absolutely forbids. Our daughter went to the Melbourne conservatory of music and is now doing a doctorate, our elder son was in the Air Force as a pilot officer and has a degree in aeronautical engineering, and our younger son is now a plasterer. He is also in the process of going to Uganda to work with the orphans there. I give you this background because, if we had stayed with the cult, our children would not have had these opportunities. Since we have left, which would be about 20 years ago now, my wife’s parents have not contacted her—not once. They have not even contacted their grandchildren. They did not advise her on the deaths of her grandparents. They disowned her and she may as well have been dead and buried simply because she chose to pursue a different lifestyle. When we made our decision the cult offered to look after our children whilst we reconsidered our decision. If we had allowed this, we would never have seen them again.
How can this be going on in Australia in 2008? How can we be allowing this cult to lead to the break-up of families and to this misery? And then they try to close down the only capacity those people have to contact each other and to talk to each other. How is that possible and how is it that the Senate could possibly deny an inquiry into the way this cult operates? I urge senators to reconsider this particular motion. We are asking for an inquiry into the industrial relations exemptions that they have had, their public funding, tax and other arrangements, and the activities which threaten families and the best interests of children. What is wrong with having an inquiry into this cult? Perhaps somebody can enlighten me as to what is wrong with inquiring into those activities when it is clear they are not in the best interests of our community.
We have the coalition prepared to go with interventions all over the country for whatever else it likes but apparently a parliament not interested in intervening in the best interests of a transparent, open, compassionate, decent Australian society. I do not believe that the activities of this cult contribute to that when they do not allow parents to contact their children and vice versa, and when they keep people from their parents, grandparents and the like. It is cruel, it is harmful and it should not be tolerated in our society today. Before I conclude I seek leave to incorporate into the Hansard the letter to the Prime Minister circulated yesterday by Senator Brown.
Leave not granted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,40,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-08-27,—I note that it was Senator Abetz who did not give leave.,SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,40,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-08-27,"—Here we go again—a third attempt by Senator Bob Brown to get an inquiry into the Exclusive Brethren. An attempt was made by Senator Brown two years and 12 days ago on 15 August 2006. Nothing has changed except that Senator Brown is two years older but, unfortunately, none the wiser. The same hyperbole and vilification of yesterday’s speech by Senator Brown is contained in the Hansard of 15 August 2006. Many words, but no evidence. Senator Brown makes the same old points with a now decidedly worn out record playing the same old tune.
The coalition’s position on this is straightforward and principled. If there are allegations of wrongdoing, report them to the appropriate authorities. Other than that, within the laws of this country people are entitled to live their lives as they deem appropriate. And they are entitled to do so even if we disagree with them. As I have said before in this place, I doubt if anyone in this chamber would subscribe to the Exclusive Brethren approach to life. But no-one has shown any illegality by them and, if there is, report it to the authorities. Other than that, let them be.
It is instructive to learn that allegations have been made to the authorities and the Australian Federal Police, and dismissed. There is still one allegation being considered although no allegation of wrongdoing so far has been determined. My view is, and the coalition’s view is, let the cards fall where they will. If wrongdoing is found, let the law deal with those involved. But to suggest that the behaviour of one or two members of a group requires a full inquiry into the whole group is, I must say, stretching credulity.
But we do have a bizarre conspiracy theory in Senator Brown’s speech yesterday. He told the Senate:
I think the Senate has every right to ask why ... the Australian Federal Police have not completed that inquiry and reported publicly.
Hello? Are the Australian Federal Police now involved in this huge conspiracy as well? You know what? The Senate does not have to ask that question. Senator Brown of his own volition can ask that question by—and this might be a unique experience for him—turning up to Senate estimates and asking the Australian Federal Police about this inquiry, how it is going, et cetera. That is open to every single individual senator in this place if they have a concern that the Australian Federal Police are being tardy. I would invite Senator Brown to take that course of action if he actually believes that the Australian Federal Police are somehow conspiring on the side of the Exclusive Brethren. But Senators Brown and Milne provide no evidence for their assertions that would support an inquiry.
One of their interesting allegations is that the Exclusive Brethren do not allow computers in their schools and actively discourage children from learning how to use computers. I do not know if that is the case but if that is the case I would say, as would the coalition, that is a matter of great regret. But ultimately the standards, curriculum and other requirements for all schools, and their registration, which of course is the precursor to funding, are vetted and administered by the eight state and territory Labor governments and their education departments. So now we have the eight Labor states and territories also involved in this conspiracy in providing funding to the Exclusive Brethren—no longer just Mr Howard’s former office, no longer the Australian Federal Police; now the eight Labor state and territory governments are apparently involved as well.
From the coalition point of view there are simply standards that apply to every single school and, if any Exclusive Brethren school falls within the categories, if they qualify for funding, then they should get funding. If they do not qualify according to the standards then they should not get funding. At the end of the day this is an issue of whether the standards are appropriate for the various schools but there is no specific category that says that only Exclusive Brethren schools will get this sort of funding. They are not mentioned by name. There is a broader category in each of the states and territories which determines whether or not a school is to receive funding.
But back to the computers, because Senator Brown relied on that in his speech yesterday—and, very interestingly, I note that Mr Rudd seems to have relied on it when just before the election he tried to jump on the bandwagon. Senator Brown quoted:
The Exclusive Brethren ... actively discourages children from using information technology, from learning how to use computers—
As I said before, if that is the case that is to be regretted and I do not think that they do their children any favours by such a policy.
I think that a number of senators would have received a copy of this letter today. It is by the federal member for Griffith who also happens to rejoice in the title of Prime Minister of this country. It is a letter dated 31 May 2007 addressed to a Mr Greg Thomas, principal of Agnew School, which I understand is in fact an Exclusive Brethren school. In it—and his familiarity with the principal is quite clear because it starts ‘Dear Greg’; it does not say ‘Dear Principal’ or ‘Dear Mr Thomas’—he says:
I am pleased to inform you that—
under the Investing in our Schools program—
the application tendered by Agnew School ... has been successful.
And guess what it was for: the provision of wordex machines and computers. Mr Rudd goes on:
I would like to extend my warmest congratulations ...
So here we have proof positive that Exclusive Brethren schools do seem to take computers on board. If this is all fictitious, then could I suggest that Senator Brown go to the education Senate estimates and asks the department whether there is verification that those computers have been delivered et cetera.
Some of these allegations on closer examination clearly do not stand up to scrutiny. Indeed the federal minister for education, Julia Gillard, has written to the Independent member for New England, Mr Tony Windsor—and undoubtedly he is now part of the conspiracy as well, as is Ms Gillard of course by this. She says in a letter to Mr Windsor, dated 16 April 2008:
I can confirm that the Meadowbank Education Trust School—
which I understand is an Exclusive Brethren school—
and its subsidiary campuses are being funded in accordance with the Act and that it continues to meet the conditions associated with the current funding agreement and its legal obligations.
If the Greens senators have information that can contradict that which Ms Gillard has written to the Independent member for New England, let them bring it forward, let them mention it at Senate estimates, and let us have a proper analysis of these matters.
I move on to the other matters that have been raised, and that is Senator Brown’s request for a 15-page document to be put into Hansard. I say to Senator Brown and the Greens: if the information in that document is to be incorporated into Hansard, there is nothing stopping the Australian Greens from actually reading the information contained in that document and putting that onto the Hansard. But by giving leave, every individual senator in this place would be vouching for that information and allowing it to have privilege. There is nothing stopping Senator Brown from reading it into the Hansard and, if he so wants, he can do so. But the coalition does not want to be part of a process which would say, and allow Senator Brown to say, ‘I tried to put it into Hansard and, guess what: nobody objected so therefore it has the imprimatur of the totality of the Senate.’ In relation to that 15-page document, there was a letter written to the Prime Minister—
—Madam Acting Deputy President Hurley, I rise on a point of order. I seek a ruling from the President whether giving leave for incorporation indeed puts the imprimatur of all senators on a document.
—I will take that question on notice and refer it to the President.
—That of course would be the claim that would be made by the Australian Greens. But in relation to this letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, quite rightly said that all the allegations should be referred to the appropriate authorities. Nobody has suggested to us that all those allegations have in fact been brought to the appropriate authorities and that somehow the great conspiracy has gone further to ensure that those allegations have not been investigated. Until people follow the proper course of action of referring these matters to the appropriate authorities, I on this rare occasion happen to agree with the Prime Minister that these matters should be aired with the appropriate authority.
Can I say in response to Senator Milne’s contribution that it is disappointing when a former teacher refers to a pupil and quite clearly—because, although the name was not mentioned, Devonport in Tasmania is a small community—identifies an Exclusive Brethren girl student. There ain’t that many of them! So anybody who would have been at the school at the time would know and be able to identify who that girl is. I think it is a matter of regret that Senator Milne has stooped to that.
Having said that, I will say that the Exclusive Brethren have some beliefs—I suppose a lot of beliefs—that we on the coalition side clearly do not agree with. But the test is: are they illegal? Encouraging young people not to continue with education I think is a matter of great regret, if that is what they do. But, in this society, by the time people turn 18 they actually have a choice: they can decide whether or not they want to go on with education.
—They can’t; they will be thrown out.
—Senator Milne says they will be thrown out—and, chances are, that may well be right. But in a free society people will continue to join the Exclusive Brethren. They will also continue to leave the Exclusive Brethren—we had a story, through Senator Milne, of a family that left the Exclusive Brethren and did all sorts of wonderful things, including pursuing careers. And, whether we like it or not, some people will stop talking to each other in this society. Exclusive Brethren have a particular view with which I, respectfully, very strongly disagree. But how on earth can a Senate inquiry force somebody to talk to somebody else if their religious belief, for whatever reason, is that they will not talk to such a person? People actually do have free will, and if that is the decision they make, regrettable though it is, then that is unfortunately the way it will turn out.
I simply say in conclusion: what is all this about? Very simply, what all this is about was shown and exposed by Senator Brown’s own words in the Sunday Tasmanian of 13 August 2006. He said:
... my beef with the Exclusive Brethren is not about religious belief.
So all this talk about cult and religious belief is not Senator Brown’s concern; he has admitted that himself. He went on to say:
“It’s about them venturing into politics ...
That is the beef that Senator Brown has. It is not their religious beliefs, that they do not allow people to talk to each other or allegedly allow computers to be used. That is not his concern. If they had not have ventured into politics, as he alleges, he would have been happy for them to continue with all the practices that he now claims he abhors. That shows the double standard with which Senator Brown comes to this debate. Even more so, under a heading of ‘Exclusive Brethren payback’ Senator Brown called for a public register of all Exclusive Brethren business premises. Can I say: that is very distasteful. Why would you have a public register of Exclusive Brethren businesses? Why not green businesses or Roman Catholic businesses or Protestant businesses or Muslim businesses? Very, very distasteful, might I suggest. And when the leader and deputy leader of an Australian political party start descending into this sort of behaviour on a personal vendetta because people dared to venture into politics, then I think we have come to a very, very sad state of affairs in this country.
In relation to the Exclusive Brethren not voting, I think it is an unfortunate decision, a regrettable decision. I encourage everybody to vote. But the Commonwealth Electoral Act has an exclusion based on religious belief. It applies to everybody. I do not know how many Exclusive Brethren there are in this country. I would think 10,000 would be tops—by a long, long way.
—You’re wrong again.
—Oh, Senator Brown says ‘wrong again’. Well, I would be interested to know what his figure is. Can I tell you this: it would not be 62,000—and that is how many people claimed the religious exemption, under the legislation Senator Milne complains about, at the 2004 election. Why have an inquiry only into the Exclusive Brethren exercising that right and not into the 52,000 other Australians who exercised that same exclusion for religious beliefs? That is why we as a coalition oppose this proposal.

—as I indicated, by the Liberal Party. When I say ‘we’ I am referring to the people who took action in the Anti-Discrimination Tribunal. It was proved there. I do not mean ‘we’ in terms of the Greens.
—A quick recovery now!
—It is on the record that the Greens did not appear in the tribunal, so I am not alleging that I was in the tribunal.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Senator Abetz!
—However, I am not going to be distracted by this because the fact of the matter is that the Liberal Party and the Exclusive Brethren were as one in the community campaigning and it was not until the matter became very hot in the lead-up to the last federal election that the Prime Minister gave a directive to the Liberal Party not to associate as closely with the Exclusive Brethren.
I find it extraordinary that the Labor Party are not interested in actually examining the relationship between the Exclusive Brethren and the coalition. They ought to be interested in how Commonwealth money is spent. I think that, at the very least, we deserve to have an inquiry into the funding of Brethren schools and the basis on which that funding occurs and whether Brethren schools actually fulfil the state curriculum guidelines as required by state governments in order to qualify for federal government funding.
I also want to quote from another letter from an ex-Brethren member in Tasmania which says:
Since we made our decision to leave the cult, which was based on what was the best for our family, including our children, we believed it was in their best interests for us to give them the freedom of choice as they matured. This freedom of choice is to be able to partake in the activities of our community which the cult totally and absolutely forbids. Our daughter went to the Melbourne conservatory of music and is now doing a doctorate, our elder son was in the Air Force as a pilot officer and has a degree in aeronautical engineering, and our younger son is now a plasterer. He is also in the process of going to Uganda to work with the orphans there. I give you this background because, if we had stayed with the cult, our children would not have had these opportunities. Since we have left, which would be about 20 years ago now, my wife’s parents have not contacted her—not once. They have not even contacted their grandchildren. They did not advise her on the deaths of her grandparents. They disowned her and she may as well have been dead and buried simply because she chose to pursue a different lifestyle. When we made our decision the cult offered to look after our children whilst we reconsidered our decision. If we had allowed this, we would never have seen them again.
How can this be going on in Australia in 2008? How can we be allowing this cult to lead to the break-up of families and to this misery? And then they try to close down the only capacity those people have to contact each other and to talk to each other. How is that possible and how is it that the Senate could possibly deny an inquiry into the way this cult operates? I urge senators to reconsider this particular motion. We are asking for an inquiry into the industrial relations exemptions that they have had, their public funding, tax and other arrangements, and the activities which threaten families and the best interests of children. What is wrong with having an inquiry into this cult? Perhaps somebody can enlighten me as to what is wrong with inquiring into those activities when it is clear they are not in the best interests of our community.
We have the coalition prepared to go with interventions all over the country for whatever else it likes but apparently a parliament not interested in intervening in the best interests of a transparent, open, compassionate, decent Australian society. I do not believe that the activities of this cult contribute to that when they do not allow parents to contact their children and vice versa, and when they keep people from their parents, grandparents and the like. It is cruel, it is harmful and it should not be tolerated in our society today. Before I conclude I seek leave to incorporate into the Hansard the letter to the Prime Minister circulated yesterday by Senator Brown.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-08-27,"—Here we go again—a third attempt by Senator Bob Brown to get an inquiry into the Exclusive Brethren. An attempt was made by Senator Brown two years and 12 days ago on 15 August 2006. Nothing has changed except that Senator Brown is two years older but, unfortunately, none the wiser. The same hyperbole and vilification of yesterday’s speech by Senator Brown is contained in the Hansard of 15 August 2006. Many words, but no evidence. Senator Brown makes the same old points with a now decidedly worn out record playing the same old tune.
The coalition’s position on this is straightforward and principled. If there are allegations of wrongdoing, report them to the appropriate authorities. Other than that, within the laws of this country people are entitled to live their lives as they deem appropriate. And they are entitled to do so even if we disagree with them. As I have said before in this place, I doubt if anyone in this chamber would subscribe to the Exclusive Brethren approach to life. But no-one has shown any illegality by them and, if there is, report it to the authorities. Other than that, let them be.
It is instructive to learn that allegations have been made to the authorities and the Australian Federal Police, and dismissed. There is still one allegation being considered although no allegation of wrongdoing so far has been determined. My view is, and the coalition’s view is, let the cards fall where they will. If wrongdoing is found, let the law deal with those involved. But to suggest that the behaviour of one or two members of a group requires a full inquiry into the whole group is, I must say, stretching credulity.
But we do have a bizarre conspiracy theory in Senator Brown’s speech yesterday. He told the Senate:
I think the Senate has every right to ask why ... the Australian Federal Police have not completed that inquiry and reported publicly.
Hello? Are the Australian Federal Police now involved in this huge conspiracy as well? You know what? The Senate does not have to ask that question. Senator Brown of his own volition can ask that question by—and this might be a unique experience for him—turning up to Senate estimates and asking the Australian Federal Police about this inquiry, how it is going, et cetera. That is open to every single individual senator in this place if they have a concern that the Australian Federal Police are being tardy. I would invite Senator Brown to take that course of action if he actually believes that the Australian Federal Police are somehow conspiring on the side of the Exclusive Brethren. But Senators Brown and Milne provide no evidence for their assertions that would support an inquiry.
One of their interesting allegations is that the Exclusive Brethren do not allow computers in their schools and actively discourage children from learning how to use computers. I do not know if that is the case but if that is the case I would say, as would the coalition, that is a matter of great regret. But ultimately the standards, curriculum and other requirements for all schools, and their registration, which of course is the precursor to funding, are vetted and administered by the eight state and territory Labor governments and their education departments. So now we have the eight Labor states and territories also involved in this conspiracy in providing funding to the Exclusive Brethren—no longer just Mr Howard’s former office, no longer the Australian Federal Police; now the eight Labor state and territory governments are apparently involved as well.
From the coalition point of view there are simply standards that apply to every single school and, if any Exclusive Brethren school falls within the categories, if they qualify for funding, then they should get funding. If they do not qualify according to the standards then they should not get funding. At the end of the day this is an issue of whether the standards are appropriate for the various schools but there is no specific category that says that only Exclusive Brethren schools will get this sort of funding. They are not mentioned by name. There is a broader category in each of the states and territories which determines whether or not a school is to receive funding.
But back to the computers, because Senator Brown relied on that in his speech yesterday—and, very interestingly, I note that Mr Rudd seems to have relied on it when just before the election he tried to jump on the bandwagon. Senator Brown quoted:
The Exclusive Brethren ... actively discourages children from using information technology, from learning how to use computers—
As I said before, if that is the case that is to be regretted and I do not think that they do their children any favours by such a policy.
I think that a number of senators would have received a copy of this letter today. It is by the federal member for Griffith who also happens to rejoice in the title of Prime Minister of this country. It is a letter dated 31 May 2007 addressed to a Mr Greg Thomas, principal of Agnew School, which I understand is in fact an Exclusive Brethren school. In it—and his familiarity with the principal is quite clear because it starts ‘Dear Greg’; it does not say ‘Dear Principal’ or ‘Dear Mr Thomas’—he says:
I am pleased to inform you that—
under the Investing in our Schools program—
the application tendered by Agnew School ... has been successful.
And guess what it was for: the provision of wordex machines and computers. Mr Rudd goes on:
I would like to extend my warmest congratulations ...
So here we have proof positive that Exclusive Brethren schools do seem to take computers on board. If this is all fictitious, then could I suggest that Senator Brown go to the education Senate estimates and asks the department whether there is verification that those computers have been delivered et cetera.
Some of these allegations on closer examination clearly do not stand up to scrutiny. Indeed the federal minister for education, Julia Gillard, has written to the Independent member for New England, Mr Tony Windsor—and undoubtedly he is now part of the conspiracy as well, as is Ms Gillard of course by this. She says in a letter to Mr Windsor, dated 16 April 2008:
I can confirm that the Meadowbank Education Trust School—
which I understand is an Exclusive Brethren school—
and its subsidiary campuses are being funded in accordance with the Act and that it continues to meet the conditions associated with the current funding agreement and its legal obligations.
If the Greens senators have information that can contradict that which Ms Gillard has written to the Independent member for New England, let them bring it forward, let them mention it at Senate estimates, and let us have a proper analysis of these matters.
I move on to the other matters that have been raised, and that is Senator Brown’s request for a 15-page document to be put into Hansard. I say to Senator Brown and the Greens: if the information in that document is to be incorporated into Hansard, there is nothing stopping the Australian Greens from actually reading the information contained in that document and putting that onto the Hansard. But by giving leave, every individual senator in this place would be vouching for that information and allowing it to have privilege. There is nothing stopping Senator Brown from reading it into the Hansard and, if he so wants, he can do so. But the coalition does not want to be part of a process which would say, and allow Senator Brown to say, ‘I tried to put it into Hansard and, guess what: nobody objected so therefore it has the imprimatur of the totality of the Senate.’ In relation to that 15-page document, there was a letter written to the Prime Minister—
—Madam Acting Deputy President Hurley, I rise on a point of order. I seek a ruling from the President whether giving leave for incorporation indeed puts the imprimatur of all senators on a document.
—I will take that question on notice and refer it to the President.
—That of course would be the claim that would be made by the Australian Greens. But in relation to this letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, quite rightly said that all the allegations should be referred to the appropriate authorities. Nobody has suggested to us that all those allegations have in fact been brought to the appropriate authorities and that somehow the great conspiracy has gone further to ensure that those allegations have not been investigated. Until people follow the proper course of action of referring these matters to the appropriate authorities, I on this rare occasion happen to agree with the Prime Minister that these matters should be aired with the appropriate authority.
Can I say in response to Senator Milne’s contribution that it is disappointing when a former teacher refers to a pupil and quite clearly—because, although the name was not mentioned, Devonport in Tasmania is a small community—identifies an Exclusive Brethren girl student. There ain’t that many of them! So anybody who would have been at the school at the time would know and be able to identify who that girl is. I think it is a matter of regret that Senator Milne has stooped to that.
Having said that, I will say that the Exclusive Brethren have some beliefs—I suppose a lot of beliefs—that we on the coalition side clearly do not agree with. But the test is: are they illegal? Encouraging young people not to continue with education I think is a matter of great regret, if that is what they do. But, in this society, by the time people turn 18 they actually have a choice: they can decide whether or not they want to go on with education.
—They can’t; they will be thrown out.
—Senator Milne says they will be thrown out—and, chances are, that may well be right. But in a free society people will continue to join the Exclusive Brethren. They will also continue to leave the Exclusive Brethren—we had a story, through Senator Milne, of a family that left the Exclusive Brethren and did all sorts of wonderful things, including pursuing careers. And, whether we like it or not, some people will stop talking to each other in this society. Exclusive Brethren have a particular view with which I, respectfully, very strongly disagree. But how on earth can a Senate inquiry force somebody to talk to somebody else if their religious belief, for whatever reason, is that they will not talk to such a person? People actually do have free will, and if that is the decision they make, regrettable though it is, then that is unfortunately the way it will turn out.
I simply say in conclusion: what is all this about? Very simply, what all this is about was shown and exposed by Senator Brown’s own words in the Sunday Tasmanian of 13 August 2006. He said:
... my beef with the Exclusive Brethren is not about religious belief.
So all this talk about cult and religious belief is not Senator Brown’s concern; he has admitted that himself. He went on to say:
“It’s about them venturing into politics ...
That is the beef that Senator Brown has. It is not their religious beliefs, that they do not allow people to talk to each other or allegedly allow computers to be used. That is not his concern. If they had not have ventured into politics, as he alleges, he would have been happy for them to continue with all the practices that he now claims he abhors. That shows the double standard with which Senator Brown comes to this debate. Even more so, under a heading of ‘Exclusive Brethren payback’ Senator Brown called for a public register of all Exclusive Brethren business premises. Can I say: that is very distasteful. Why would you have a public register of Exclusive Brethren businesses? Why not green businesses or Roman Catholic businesses or Protestant businesses or Muslim businesses? Very, very distasteful, might I suggest. And when the leader and deputy leader of an Australian political party start descending into this sort of behaviour on a personal vendetta because people dared to venture into politics, then I think we have come to a very, very sad state of affairs in this country.
In relation to the Exclusive Brethren not voting, I think it is an unfortunate decision, a regrettable decision. I encourage everybody to vote. But the Commonwealth Electoral Act has an exclusion based on religious belief. It applies to everybody. I do not know how many Exclusive Brethren there are in this country. I would think 10,000 would be tops—by a long, long way.
—You’re wrong again.
—Oh, Senator Brown says ‘wrong again’. Well, I would be interested to know what his figure is. Can I tell you this: it would not be 62,000—and that is how many people claimed the religious exemption, under the legislation Senator Milne complains about, at the 2004 election. Why have an inquiry only into the Exclusive Brethren exercising that right and not into the 52,000 other Australians who exercised that same exclusion for religious beliefs? That is why we as a coalition oppose this proposal.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2008-08-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I stand tonight to speak on the Australian Landcare Council annual report 2006-07 and to share some observations on the recent actions of the Rudd Labor government with respect to Landcare in Tasmania which have been very damaging indeed. The government’s budget cuts have slashed Landcare funding in Tasmania and across the country, but I will focus on what is happening in Tasmania, where the funding for Landcare projects has been slashed by 60 per cent across the state. It is very bad news for Tasmanian farmers and graziers, with a negative impact for rural and regional parts of Tasmania in particular. Federal Labor is providing funding of $119,910 to Landcare projects in the north for this financial year compared to an average of more than $300,000 under the Howard government.
This financial year, the north-west has received about $140,000 and the south has received $223,000. This represents a cut of 60 per cent from their previous funding. It is a body blow to the rural communities in my state of Tasmania, and especially to the volunteers in these different Landcare associations, who have worked so hard to make a difference. Of the 13 submissions received in the north, 11 projects were rejected. This is unusually high. Only two were accepted—Southern Farming Systems and Roberts Wool Link—and I would like to congratulate them on their successful submissions.
In another blow to those working to restore and protect natural resources, the Rudd Labor government has announced a mere $28 million in funding for Landcare projects across the country, which is well down on that planned to be spent by the coalition. So it affects all of the country, but I am focusing particularly on Tasmania. It is not good news.
In the 2007 budget, the coalition committed $112 million to Landcare over the next three years. That is an average of $37 million per year. But the budget papers showed a cut in funding in that respect of 20 per cent. To add insult to injury, those Landcare groups that were successful in this funding round have been told to get their applications in for Open Grants funding. How good is that? What will that be like for those entities? It will pit small, community based landcare groups up against the giants like CSIRO and other federal and state government agencies for the small funding pool available. I put it to the federal Labor government that this is not a good strategy.
The answer to climate change is not just in Mr Rudd’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme but also in tackling the effects of the drought and climate change on the ground. This is the best way to deal with the global food security crisis.
I want to refer to the views of the different Landcare association representatives in Tasmania and also the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association. One of the headings in the Mercury on 26 July stated:
Funding for Tasmanian Landcare projects and jobs has been slashed.
The article continued:
Tasmanian Landcare Association president Lyndley Chopping said yesterday the cutbacks would be extremely disappointing for the state’s community-based Landcare groups.
Mr Chopping said nine Landcare jobs were being made redundant.
Nine jobs have been made redundant as a result of this government’s handiwork. The article continued:
Mr Chopping said projects were already being rejected and future ones were in doubt.
“We are not happy about it,” Mr Chopping said.
Of course they are not happy about it. They have been gutted. These projects have been slashed. The article then quoted Mr Chopping as saying:
“The name Landcare has been built up over a period of years now—and it’s a well respected name—”
We all know that. Everyone in the Senate chamber knows that it is a well respected name. But now they have been gutted. It is bad news. The article went on:
“—and it should not be lost out of the equation,” Mr Chopping said.
…                …              …
Mr Chopping said it would be difficult to keep momentum going for Landcare work, much of which is undertaken by volunteers without adequate funding.
Those are his views. Then you have the views of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association. Chris Oldfield from the association is worried about it because of the inadequate effort to address the drought problems in Tasmania. He made his views clear in TasCountry and also in the Tasmanian newspapers. He also quizzed Tony Burke, the responsible federal minister. It was said that Tony Burke faced a barrage of questions about his government’s slashing of Landcare funding in Tasmania. Well, of course he did. I am particularly concerned for Don Defenderfer, who has lost his job in Launceston. (Time expired)

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2008-08-27,"—Last Thursday, 21 August, I was proud to assist in the ACT launch of the Big Steps in Childcare campaign. For many years now we have worked to support parents, children and childcare workers so that access to quality child care can be the right of every child. Senators will remember many of our campaigns and demonstrations in front of Parliament House over the last decade. Now, at last, the Australian federal government has made childcare reform a priority, and has committed to a national workforce strategy.
After 11 years of neglect and systematic downgrading of this sector by the Howard government, we now have a Labor government that recognises how important to Australia’s future quality early childhood education and care are. One of the Rudd government’s early steps in its recognition of the importance of creating the best early childhood education and care system for children, families and the Australian economy was to appoint a Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood and Childcare, Ms Maxine McKew.
The government will consult with childcare experts and with state ministers with the aim of standardising the level of care and lifting the qualifications of carers. We need partnerships between all groups—managers, workers, the federal government, state and territory governments and local governments—to achieve our goals.
Recognising the problems that face the childcare sector, the parliamentary secretary has said that at present we have a very fragmented system that cannot guarantee quality. It is time that we had a national set of standards linking licensing with accreditation. At present we have different licensing systems in every state and territory. This means there is no Australia-wide standard ratio of workers to children, and it means different requirements in regard to qualifications. For babies up to the age of two years, for example, a staff-infant ratio of one to three is desirable, but the norm in most states is one to five. As was highlighted on The 7.30 Report on 6 August, an often unqualified young person who is responsible for the care of five babies cannot provide quality care for them all, yet this is legal in most states.
A big problem is that almost 40 per cent of the early childhood workforce in long day care centres has no formal childcare qualifications. I am not criticising these individuals as I know they do the best they can do, yet research clearly shows that staff qualifications and expertise are important and do make a difference. Without an adequate well-trained and well-paid staff it is impossible to give children the best quality care and education. Surveys tell us that what parents and children value most in a childcare centre is the quality or caring nature of the staff.
We know that there is a skills crisis in child care caused by low pay and poor career paths for workers. Teachers in child care earn, generally, 25 per cent less than primary school teachers. As a result we have poor retention rates in the early childhood sector of the workforce. I am sorry to say that here in the Australian Capital Territory we have one of the highest job turnover rates at 47 per cent and a high percentage of vacant positions, but all of the states and territories have unacceptably high rates. There is an acute shortage of trained childcare workers. Thousands of experienced childcare professionals leave the sector every year. They leave because of the heavy workload, poor wages, lack of recognition and high stress levels, yet bonding with the carer and continuity of staff are critically important for a child’s wellbeing. What we do know is that by 2013 a shortage of some 7,320 childcare professionals nationally is predicted. This is a dire situation.
The Rudd government has recognised the importance of early childhood education and care and the need to provide the best experience we can for our children. Our emphasis will now be on quality and ongoing professional development for childcare workers. In committing to reform of Australia’s early childhood sector the government has already announced funding of $10 million in 2007 and 2008 for projects to improve access to early childhood education programs; an allocation of $533 million to provide 15 hours of government funded, teacher led early education in the year before school by 2013; a national early years workforce strategy, which will include additional early childhood education university places each year from 2009, increasing to 1,500 places by 2011; removal of TAFE fees for diplomas and advanced diplomas of children’s services and the creation of 8,000 new vocational education and training places; and a 50 per cent HECS-HELP remission for early childhood education teachers willing to work in rural and regional areas, Indigenous communities and areas of socioeconomic disadvantage. Further, there will be national collaboration in the development of a national Early Years Learning Framework which emphasises play based learning, early literacy and numeracy skills and social development. This framework will be linked to new national quality standards for child care and preschool.
And now the LHMU, the childcare union, has given us a blueprint for the steps needed to provide what is every Australian child’s fundamental right—the right to quality care and education. The LHMU Big Steps campaign is being undertaken in partnership with Early Childhood Australia, the National Association of Community Based Children’s Services, the Children’s Services Taskforce, the Community Services and Health Industry Skills Council and Sydney University’s Workplace Research Centre. Big Steps is about thinking in new ways to create the best early childhood education and care system for children, families and the Australian economy. This national campaign was launched in Sydney last month and builds on the exemplary initiatives taken by the Rudd Labor government to date.
A major aim of the Big Steps in Childcare campaign is to provide opportunities for existing staff to upskill to a certificate III, diploma or degree and to formally recognise workers’ skills and prior learning. Workers already in the system should be able to access the new training funding and improved status. In fact the first big step is workforce reform. The national workforce strategy developed by the LHMU will include recognition of prior learning and upskilling existing diploma holders in the workforce. This strategy is consistent with the government’s Skilling Australia initiative. We know that these reforms will come at a price but we realise that the benefits to Australia in years to come will more than recoup our outlays.
As Professor Frank Oberklaid, Director of the Centre for Community Child Health at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne has explained: ‘There’s no doubt it costs money, but we either pay now or pay later.’ Many problems of adults and older children, which cost the country huge amounts for remedial, rehabilitative or punitive programs, can be traced back to disadvantaged early learning environments where the nurturing, care and learning opportunities for which we now aim were not available. According to the professor, research demonstrates that what we spend on the first five years of life makes an even larger difference than does the school system. This is quite an extraordinary finding.
I am proud of this government’s commitment and its investment in Australia’s children. Together with our expenditure on preschools, this government is making an unprecedented investment in families and our youngest children—$3.2 billion in this year alone. I commend the government’s commitment to workers and families through the provision of programs for the ongoing professional development of childcare staff and through its commitment to improve staff-child ratios and programs for children. I also look forward to continuing to work for this important campaign, Big Steps in Childcare, in partnership with the childcare union and I urge all senators to support it.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Adjournment,42,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-08-27," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 February 2008:
Does the Government stand by its commitment to support a nuclear weapons convention, made on 14 August 2007 by the then Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr Robert McClelland in a speech to the United Nations Association.
Does the Government still consider the idea of a nuclear weapons convention as ‘responsible and timely’; if so, to what extent and in what manner.
Will the Government support moves to implement a nuclear weapons convention in the terms suggested by the Middle Powers Initiative and the updated model nuclear weapons convention, adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly as a discussion document in December 2007.
In detail, what is the Government’s response to the updated model nuclear weapons convention, tabled by Malaysia and Costa Rica in the UN General Assembly Plenary in December 2007.
Will the Government proceed with the creation of a new Canberra Commission, as promised by the Prime Minister (Mr Rudd) prior to the 2007 election; if so, when.
Is the Minister aware that a key recommendation of the original Canberra Commission was the lowering of the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems; and (b) how has the Government decided to respond to that recommendation and to recommendation 17 of the final report of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Committee, chaired by Dr Hans Blix and tabled on 1 June 2006, to the same effect.
Does the Government consider the UN resolution ‘Renewed determination toward the total elimination of nuclear weapons’ (the renewed determination) to be an appropriate response.
In regard to the more recent resolution L.29 on decreasing the operational readiness of nuclear weapons system, co-sponsored by New Zealand, Chile, Nigeria, Sweden and Switzerland: (a) in what way does it differ from the renewed determination; (b) why did Japan, a co-sponsor of the renewed determination, vote in favour of L.29; (c) were there any reasons, other than the exigencies of time, for the incoming Government not to have voted in support of resolution L.29 on operating status as Japan, Germany, Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and New Zealand did; (d) what is the reaction of the Government to the passage of that text by the UN General Assembly in a vote of 136 to 3; (e) why did the three nations, with whom Australia so frequently votes, vote for this resolution while Australia abstained; (f) why was this abstention maintained in the UN General Assembly Plenary; (g) from which non-government organisations did the Government receive correspondence suggesting that it ought to change its vote in the Plenary; and (h) is there anything in the text of resolution L.29 that is, or could be interpreted as being, in any way destabilising; if so, what constructive changes might be made to the resolution.
Will the Government try to advance the issue of nuclear weapons operating status: (a) at the 2008 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory Committee (NPT PrepCom); (b) at the next UN General Assembly First Committee; and/or (c) in its discussions with the United States of America and/or Russia.
Will the Government consider working together with: (a) New Zealand, Chile, Nigeria, Sweden and Switzerland at the NPT PrepCom to write a working paper on nuclear weapons operational status; (b) the New Agenda group, both on this issue and more widely on nuclear disarmament issues at the NPT PrepCom; and (c) the New Agenda and the Non-Aligned Movement groups, as well as the western groups and the nuclear weapons states, to promote ongoing progress in nuclear disarmament and strategic stability both via the measures set out in the final report of the Year 2000 NPT review and in the renewed determination, and via a lowering in nuclear weapons operational readiness.
What further steps will the Government take towards: (a) lowering nuclear weapons operational readiness; and (b) bringing the world closer to the creation and implementation of a nuclear weapons convention, along the lines of the updated model convention submitted to the UN General Assembly Plenary.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Nuclear Weapons</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,44,1,question
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-08-27,"—The following answer has been provided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the honourable senator’s question:
The Government supports exploration of possible legal frameworks for the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons, including at an appropriate time the possibility of negotiation of a nuclear weapons convention. The Government sees the negotiation of a possible nuclear weapons convention as a longer-term goal.
It is timely and responsible to explore possible legal frameworks for the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons, including negotiation of a nuclear weapons convention.  This process will require extensive consultation and planning
The Government is supportive of exploring possible legal frameworks for the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons, including the possibility of negotiation of a nuclear weapons convention.  In the short term, the Government has prioritised immediate disarmament initiatives such as achieving entry into force of the CTBT, commencement of negotiations on an FMCT, and resumption of work in the Conference of Disarmament.
See (3).
On 9 June, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of an International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament.   The Commission will report to a major international conference of experts that will be sponsored by Australia.   The objective of the Commission and the conference will be to reinvigorate the global effort against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to shape a global consensus in the lead up to the NPT Review Conference in 2010.
