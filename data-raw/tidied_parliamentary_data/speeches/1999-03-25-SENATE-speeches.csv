Ordered that the report be printed.

Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I wish to express my joy at being able to present this report to the chamber today. It has been a long time in gestation, the reference being given to the committee in May 1998 and public hearings being held in July and August last year, with an anticipated reporting date in August. However, Madam Acting Deputy President, you would be aware 
 that the sitting pattern was somewhat changed last year with the calling of an early election and that the parliament did not meet again until November last year, when new committees and committee chairs were put in place.
The chairman's draft report was given to the committee on 7 December last year, shortly before the Senate adjourned for the Christmas break. There has been what could be seen as a response to the report, even before the report was brought down. The Attorney-General, in a major statement in January this year, brought down a revised version of the National Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal Information. I am very pleased that the Attorney did so but, had he done so earlier, perhaps in July last year, it would have saved the committee quite a deal of work. But at least it does prove that the Attorney and the Attorney-General's Department are listening to what the community is saying. We do await the hard copy of what the Attorney said the government is going to do in that statement delivered in January this year.
Before I speak briefly on the body of the report, I also pay tribute to the secretariat that assisted the committee in the development of the report. Dr Pauline Moore, as the secretary of the committee, was ably assisted by Mr Jonathan Curtis, Mr Gavin Denton and Ms Alison Carson. I thank them for their assistance and advice in the development of the report. I also have to thank my colleagues, in particular the former deputy chair of the committee who ably assisted me during the inquiry, Senator Abetz, and, of course, a previous member of the committee, Senator George Campbell. I must also thank my friend and colleague the learned Senator Cooney from Victoria, who was a constant source of advice and counsel during the inquiry. He also assisted immeasurably during the construction of the report which is now presented to the Senate.
The terms of reference of the inquiry asked the committee to consider measures contained in the Privacy Amendment Bill 1998, which proposed to extend the operation of the Privacy Act 1998 to business performing work outsourced by the Commonwealth, 
 together with existing privacy protection in Australia's private sector, taking into account Australia's international obligations and the need for legislative backing for privacy protection. The report addresses those needs in the private sector, the extent to which the current protection is offered and the effectiveness of a self-regulatory system. Although the 1998 bill is not yet back on the Notice Paper, the inquiry is broader than what was proposed within that legislation.
Since the inquiry commenced, the Stockdale bill has been introduced in Victoria, prompting the federal government to change its policy and accept the need for at least some legislative protection of privacy in the private sector. The committee has not considered the developments since December last year. To do so would have meant that we would have restarted the inquiry, and of course we have not yet seen the colour of the content of what the Attorney-General is proposing. He has stated what they are going to do, but what is going to be proposed is not yet public. We await that with bated breath.
The international and national debates over privacy protection have resulted in an emergence of an expanding body of law and standards. A privacy protection scheme covering the private sector must include core information protection principles and an enforcement system. These must create enforceable rights and obligations that provide minimum standards of an individual's privacy right. The privacy protection principles should reflect international best practice, such as the European Union Directive on Data Protection. A failure to ensure high standards could damage Australia's trade interests in two ways: by inhibiting the ability of trade partners to exchange information and by limiting the confidence of the Australian public in emerging technologies.
The committee concludes that existing protection is inadequate. Australia's existing legal frameworks are partial in their coverage and vary across jurisdictions. Access to remedies and enforcement is uncertain. Inadequacy of federal law is prompting legislative responses at a state and territory level, making a fragmented national approach increasingly 
 likely. Self-regulation by itself does not provide an adequate system for privacy protection. Without an adequate enforcement mechanism, the national principles for the fair handling of privacy information lack force and cannot provide the basis for an effective national privacy scheme.
The national principles do not meet the requirements of the European Union Directive on Data Protection. In comparison, they provide a weak and piecemeal approach to the collection and protection of data. The Privacy Amendment Bill 1998 is an inadequate response to the need for privacy legislation. The desire to minimise the application of the bill would have had the effect of increasing the complexity of Australia's privacy laws. This is ironic, considering industry's pleas for simplified, uniform and consistent privacy laws.
The committee recommends the creation of uniform national legislation covering both the public and the private sectors. The preferred solution is a coregulatory system based on a model developed by the Attorney-General's Department. This comprises flexible industry codes developed in cooperation with the Privacy Commissioner and backed by a legislative scheme. Responses received to the 1996 discussion paper Privacy Protection in the Private Sector reveal an overwhelming support within industry for the proposed coregulatory model. Minimising the regulatory burden and compliance costs to industry is important. However, costs depend upon the exact nature of the scheme in question. It cannot be assumed that a legislative system will necessarily entail high compliance costs. The coregulatory model adopted in New Zealand has cost very little.
There is a wide constitutional basis for the Commonwealth parliament to enact comprehensive privacy legislation, although there may be some doubt as to the complete coverage of such legislation across all areas. However, this  problem could be solved by the enactment of uniform model legislation in all jurisdictions by Commonwealth, state and territory governments. I commend the report to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,12,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-03-25,"—This is a vital report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee in the discussion about what privacy laws we ought to have in this country and, indeed, what we ought to have around the world. I say `around the world' because a lot of the impetus for this report came from the European directive of which Senator McKiernan has spoken. Senator McKiernan chaired this committee and, in his usual able way, has led the committee to make a very significant contribution to the area that we are discussing.
The whole issue of privacy is one that is going to trouble us for some time because it goes to the issue of what information should be made available to the public generally and what should not. Of course, in this era of technology it is very hard for people to keep secure to themselves what they might wish to. The answer to this problem of how information is to be controlled might end up being resolved by making information more available. That is a very interesting concept. Instead of trying to shut off the access that other people have to information about ourselves, if we made that information available to everybody on the basis that everybody made information about themselves available to the world, then an interesting situation would arise. That would mean that we would no longer have problems with the concept of commercial-in-confidence, for example. If a company did not want compulsory regulation of privacy matters but left it up to the goodwill of others and information that would tell us how that company was acting became available, then so be it.
That sort of approach might indicate that if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear. What I have been talking about might indicate that that phrase is not as easily applied as it might first appear because if that were the case it would mean that these commercial-in-confidence issues and other similar issues would become available to the public. We have instances in this chamber which arise—one arose yesterday—as to what documents should be made available in the Senate. What proper role does the executive have and what proper role does the parliament have in 
 this question of what information should be made available?
In the area of policing, what documents should be kept away from the police and what documents should the police be able to preserve when they have them? In matters of national security there are great issues. What information should be made available about Pine Gap and what should not be made available? There is a whole area in which privacy has yet to be discussed, but the fundamental issue is the same: what should we, as a matter of right, be able to keep to ourselves, whether we are a government, a party, a military organisation, a police force or whether we are a company trading in commodities or anything else? That is what this issue goes to. Therefore, it is a very important issue.
As we see things, if people find out supposed information about us then the issue arises as to what sort of interpretation they are going to put upon that information. Let me explain further. People say that if you have nothing to fear you have nothing to hide. But that presumes that what is revealed about us or about our company, our country or our party will be interpreted by others in a fair way. One of the great problems in this area is the interpretation that is given to information that becomes available about anything or anybody. That information is often very badly interpreted. So you get information put out to the public which is incorrect, which is given a twist or a spin, as they say, and then comes back in a very unfair way on the person about whom the information has been made available.
I would like to have heard many people in this chamber discuss this document because it is, as I say, a very central issue in our society. It is a matter that affects all of us because there are all sorts of things which we do not want people to know about our own lives—our medical records, for instance. Even in dealings within one political party some people might say, `We will keep those sorts of deals secret.' That does not happen on our side of politics because whatever we do we reveal and it is plain for all to see. But in other places, people do deals which they want 
 to keep secret. It would be a terrible shock to our side to think that that sort of thing happened.
The issue of privacy comes in at every level and in all areas. I am glad that Senator McKiernan had the perspicacity to see that it ought to be developed. I should mention the rest of the committee—Senator Payne, who has recently come to this committee and is quite outstanding, Senator Coonan, Senator Hutchins and  Senator Stott-Despoja. In closing, I thank the staff in the secretariat who did the work. Senator McKiernan has already thanked them, but I would also like to mention Dr Pauline Moore, Mr Jonathan Curtis, Mr Gavin Denton and Ms Alison Carson.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I move:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
(1)	 Page 14 (after line 28), after Schedule 1, insert:
Schedule 1A—Amendment of the Health Insurance Act 1973 relating to the Medicare rebate for certain procedures rendered in approved procedures facilities
1  Subsection 10(2)
	 Omit ""A benefit"", substitute ""Subject to subsection (2A), a benefit"".
2  After subsection 10(2)
	 Insert:
	 (2A)	 Subject to subsection (3) and section 14, the level of benefit that is payable in respect of the performance, in an approved procedures facility, of an out-of-hospital procedure determined by the Minister under subsection 73BA(2C) of the National Health Act 1953 is an amount at least equal to the sum of 85% of the Schedule fee and the facility benefit determined by the Minister under that subsection in respect of that service.
This opposition request seeks to insert a new schedule 1A to provide for the Medicare rebate to apply for these approved facilities. The creation of the new class of approved facilities has been done in a way that benefits only privately insured patients. Public patients sent by hospitals to an approved facility would incur a potentially large gap payment. However, the justification is that the procedures and approved facilities are more economic because the overheads for office based procedures are much less than doing the same thing at a hospital. If this is true, the benefit should be equally great for the public system as for the private. Thus, if procedures are relocated from a public hospital to an approved facility, there should be savings to the public purse because the facilities fee is much lower than the cost of a public hospital stay.
To solve this problem, it is proposed that a Medicare rebate be required for any procedure for which there is a facilities fee set which can be covered by private health insurance. The government's argument, as I understand it, is that this would amount to a cost shifting, as the states would save on hospital spending 
 and increase costs to Medicare. However, if there is a long-term trend towards approved facilities, the imbalance could be corrected in the next hospital funding agreement. To not offer this option would exclude public patients and impose large gap payments for them to use what would be essentially private facilities.
This is obviously a request to the House of Representatives, but the opposition thinks it is an important addition to the policy contained in this bill because it provides that the measures that the government thinks are beneficial in the private sector ought to apply equally to the public sector and that, if we are talking about the development of a trend and an advance in the way we handle procedures, it ought to be equally true for the public system. The opposition thinks this request should be supported because it is an important part of adding balance to the government's proposal, and that the measures contained in the bill regarding approved facilities should also apply in the public sector.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-25,"—Effectively, if we do not support this amendment we will generally see only private patients using these new facilities. Those who are public patients will be staying in hospitals—continuing, I presume, to use day surgery facilities as they have made those choices—but I think it is most unfair that the minister should again look at the whole issue of cost shifting and blame it back on federal-state relations, saying, `We have to do this because the states might push some more people out of the hospital system.' It is an unfortunate fact that in this country we have a major problem with the way our health system is structured and funded and that there is so much buck-passing and cost-shifting between state and federal governments, but I do not think we can let it get in the way of this.
If necessary, in the future there may need to be some renegotiation between state and federal governments if these new facilities are so overwhelmingly successful that there is a financial cost to the Commonwealth because the states are pushing people out of hospitals, 
 but let us do the right thing in the first place and make sure that public and private patients get fair treatment, and then if we need to get back into the state and federal battles we can do that at a later time.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-25,"—The Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  maintains the 75 per cent coverage for public patients receiving procedures out of hospital that they would normally receive in hospital, and this is in contrast with the normal situation where patients attending a general practitioner are reimbursed 85 per cent of the MBS for medical costs. This does concern me considerably. I know the government's argument is that raising the MBS to 85 per cent will only encourage state governments to push some hospital procedures into approved facilities that the Commonwealth, rather than the state, pays for—that sort of cost shifting. The parliament should be concerned about that, too, if there will be no net increase in the amount of money that will go to health in this country.
I would certainly like to hear the government's response to this issue. It seems to me that raising the MBS to 85 per cent further increases the Commonwealth's expenditure on private health services without necessarily adding any substantial funding. I can understand the point that the government makes on this but, as Senator Lees just said, we do get into this bind so frequently in this overlapping area of state and Commonwealth responsibilities. I must say that I am concerned that leaving the Medicare Benefits Schedule at 75 per cent may set a precedent for other areas of out-of-hospital care to be reduced to 75 per cent from the current 85 per cent.
I would like to get some guarantee from the government that the 75 per cent rebate will apply only to certain procedures, and that the Commonwealth will guarantee that it will not apply more broadly in the future. In other words, are we really setting a precedent? I ask the government, through the parliamentary secretary, to give some guarantees and assurances on that particular issue.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-25,"—In order to understand what the government is trying to achieve in relation to approved procedures facilities, it is important to understand the current situation. Currently, when a person is admitted as a private patient to a hospital or day hospital, the Commonwealth, through Medicare, pays 75 per cent of the Medicare Benefits Schedule fee. However, if the patient is insured, any accommodation fees charged by the hospital are the responsibility of the fund. Where a patient is not insured, accommodation charges are the patient's responsibility. Thus, as the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  currently stands, because the services that will be provided in an approved procedures facility are only those services that would have been provided in a hospital or day hospital, the government has maintained the level of Medicare rebate at 75 per cent of the Medicare Benefits Schedule fee.
However, in recognition of the costs required to establish and run an approved procedures facility—and such costs could broadly be equated with the overheads of a hospital or a day hospital—the government will allow funds to pay a facility benefit to doctors in recognition of such costs. Furthermore, under the Australian health care agreements, state governments are already able to provide treatment outside of a hospital in a doctor's rooms. Given the additional funding that has been provided under these agreements to the states by the Commonwealth, there is every reason to think that many public patients will have access to similar services in the public sector.
Thus, in this context, it is apparent that the opposition's proposed amendment is misguided in two ways. Firstly, the opposition amendment misses the key point on the approved procedures facility provisions. The procedures undertaken in approved procedures facilities are those that would otherwise have taken place in a hospital or day hospital facility. As such, the rebate a patient would have expected to receive in a hospital or a day hospital facility is 75 per cent—exactly 
 what they will receive in an approved procedures facility. Furthermore, by increasing the Medicare rebate to 85 per cent of the schedule fee for such services, one could speculate that there is an increased incentive for states and territories to cost shift some services that would otherwise have been provided in the public sector to the Commonwealth via Medicare.
Secondly, the opposition appears to be insisting that the Commonwealth pay a minimum facility benefit, determined by the minister under these provisions. This would be a radical departure from the status quo. In effect, the opposition is asking the Commonwealth to pay a private patients accommodation charge, and the government strongly opposes any such move. For these reasons, the government is unwilling to support the amendment moved by the opposition.
Senator Harradine raises an important question with regard to precedent and whether or not this is intended in any way to create a further precedent in that area. I can certainly advise Senator Harradine that there is no intention to create a precedent by this legislation.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-25,"—I thank the parliamentary secretary for that information, but there is something further that I want to clarify. If the principle upon which the government is operating is that it does not wish to see a different procedure covered in a different way, depending on whether it is in a hospital or a non-hospital facility, can you clarify what the rebate is for a doctor's consultation in a hospital while a person is undergoing some hospital procedures compared with a consultation in a doctor's surgery? Is it the same?",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-25,"—So that means there are already differential rebates, depending on whether you are in a hospital or in a doctor's surgery. So if the government is arguing that it wants to 
 maintain a principle that the location of the service should not make a difference, I guess it has already disproved its own argument that there are already differential rebates—whether or not it was done by Labor or anyone else—depending on whether that consultation occurs in a hospital when a person is undergoing some treatment or in a doctor's surgery.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I want to try to concentrate on the perspective of the patient. What we have here is a government argument that the provision of approved facilities will be helpful in providing more efficient and cost-effective health care by taking some procedures which currently occur in hospitals and day hospitals out of that environment and doing them, effectively, in doctor's surgeries, in what are called approved procedures facilities.
What we are arguing about here is how one attempts to provide equal treatment for people. The government has concentrated its efforts on those with private health insurance—the 30 per cent, or maybe less now, who are in private health insurance. The Labor opposition is saying that, if this is good policy, it is good policy for everybody, not just the 30 per cent who have private health insurance. What we are seeking to achieve by this request is to make the government address what it says is good policy to those in public health as well.
The government's proposition, as I understand it, means that if a person chooses to go—for reasons of convenience, trust in their local GP or, perhaps, quicker service rather than waiting to get into a day or public hospital—to the doctor's surgery, the approved procedures facility, and they are a private patient, they will be insured and the 75 per cent treatment will apply. But the public patient, in accessing this alternative, will be faced with the cost of the 25 per cent left over from the Medicare subsidy. They will be paying the full facilities fee and they 
 will be paying any gap in the doctor's fee that exists above the schedule fee. So it will be a very expensive proposition for those persons.
If we are saying that it is good public policy for us to encourage people to use these approved procedures facilities, surely it is good public policy for the 70 per cent of Australians who are not in private health insurance. What we are seeking to do is to say that if these approved facilities offer some cost benefits, surely we must seek to protect the interests of the public patients as well by making those benefits at least relatively accessible to them. We believe that by this procedure we will make them relatively accessible. They will still have a gap payment to make; it will still not be available to all Australians because the cost will prevent that, but it seems reasonable that we provide this level of support to those who seek to use approved facilities but who do not enjoy private health insurance.
I think it is a question of providing a proper balance between the needs of those with private health insurance and the 70 per cent of Australians who do not. As I say, if it is good public policy to have this system of approved facilities, and to have these procedures taken out of hospitals and moved into this arena, surely it is good for those without private health insurance as well. So we think it is an important question of balance, and we think the request ought to be supported.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-25,"—I have listened, and I am still listening, to what the government is saying on this. I realise that these are complex issues and, if anything, it basically just proves what we have been saying, and what many people during the various inquiries have been saying: that making these kinds of changes on a piecemeal basis is really very difficult. We may or may not make the right decision in terms of total health outcomes here, but it seems to me that we should be doing this in the context of having had a proper inquiry into health funding—into what is the most effective way of providing health services and getting our community as healthy as possible within the budget that we have.
We really have not done that. We are moving further along, if you like, a policy position—let's call it the `Richo position'—of concentrating on benefiting or encouraging private health funding, and not necessarily looking at it in the context of the overall benefits. I am in two minds about this issue—it is a very difficult one—but, if push comes to shove, I may have to think about what is going to bring the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people. At this stage, those numbers of people are really on the side of the people not in health insurance.
I am getting advice showing me different ways of looking at this but, until we have done that inquiry, we are still left in the situation of having to take some kind of ethical or moral judgment on the impacts on people and the impacts on health. It is very difficult for us to make decisions as to whether or not this will bring the greatest benefit to the private insurers when, if anything, the evidence that came through from the various inquiries is that we have no guarantee that specifically benefiting the private health insurers is going to bring the greatest outcomes in Australia's health and in Australia's hospital systems. So until we do that I am afraid that, on this issue, I may have to look at what will be of the greatest benefit for the greatest number of patients in Australia.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-25,"—It is important in considering the issues raised by Senator Evans to ask the question: is the opposition saying that the medical profession discriminates against patients getting the best care in the best setting because of their insurance status? The cheaper overheads should mean less gap for all patients. It is important to state that the procedures that will be available are available to all Australians through the provision of this legislation. It is about the most appropriate care for a patient in the most appropriate facilities. The Australian health care agreements cover public patients and allow for greater use of out-of-hospital care, and that is the intent of this legislation. 
The amendment that is being proposed by Senator Evans provides an incentive for an inappropriate shift of services from hospital or day hospital. Changing the fee to 85 per cent will provide a perverse incentive to shift inappropriate procedures to office based surgeries, despite the setting of rigorous standards and guidelines by the Commonwealth. The setting of the fee at 85 per cent will create divisions within the medical community as to the most appropriate location for the delivery of specific services. This will be in direct contrast to the setting of procedure lists for day surgeries, which was accomplished with the broad medical consensus under the auspices of the Day Surgery Council.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-25,"—What we are seeking to achieve is the most appropriate care in the most appropriate facility, and that may well be within the hospital or it may well be within the approved facility arrangement.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-25,"—Minister, unless I was mistaken, you were actually suggesting there would now be some inappropriate movement towards these facilities if we look at the rebate that is normally available for doctors in doctors' surgeries. We are, after all, talking about an intermediate facility, a facility not as expensive and not, I guess—as far as equipment and resources available—staffed and serviced as well as a day hospital or a hospital, but a step up from 
 an ordinary consulting room in a doctor's surgery.
I suspect that many of these facilities are, in fact, almost already available in those multipractice facilities—nine-, 10-, 15-doctor facilities—that we have in our capital cities, where they are already doing minor operations. They are already doing extensive procedures that could also be done in casualty in hospitals. Indeed, in Adelaide casualty services often send people even with broken limbs back to some of these clinics. These facilities will be upgraded to the sort of service that you are looking at.
Our concern is that some people may actually not be able to use these new facilities because of the additional cost. It may be that, rather than go to a public hospital, it would be much better for this procedure to be done in this facility, but when they are faced with a 25 per cent gap they are going to say, `No, I'll wait and I will use the public hospital,' which is by far, for the community purse, the most expensive option. The problem is whether the actual purse that is opened is the public section belonging to the state government or the part belonging to the federal government. This is where I can see the minister's concerns—he does not want to see cost shifting happening.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-25,"—Let me give the assurance that patients will be treated under the public health system, but it is, as I have said previously, a matter of making sure—whether it is in hospital or in the approved facility—it is the most appropriate that is available.
I did say earlier that we are concerned that changing the fee to 85 per cent could provide a perverse incentive to shift inappropriately. It was more the financial dynamic of it rather than where—and I am not questioning it—the proper and appropriate health care should take place. We all accept that.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-25,"—I seek further clarification, and this adds to the concerns expressed by Senator Lees. Given that you were expecting that people who are privately insured would be more likely to be attracted to the option of using these intermediate facilities, are you saying that it will not be a problem if there is a greater number of privately insured people using those interim facilities but it will be a problem if there is a greater number of public patients using these facilities? I share some of the concern that this might be used by the Commonwealth, or by Commonwealth funding mechanisms, that more people who ought to be in hospital get shoved out into the intermediate facilities. If that is not a problem for people with private health insurance, and that seems to be the direction in which you would be going in providing this option within the legislation, why is it therefore a problem for public health patients?",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-25,"—The issue is essentially one of aligning the private sector arrangement and the public sector arrangement to give equity between them.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-25,—Is the problem the differential? Is it not perhaps best that both groups should be treated the same at the 85 per cent rate?,SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I think perhaps we are getting a bit off track. I understand there is some concern about cost shifting, but I want to address it from the point of view of the patient and providing some equity. It is still the case that it will be far more expensive for a public patient to go to an approved facility, 
 from the patient's point of view. Our proposition suggests we will pick up 85 per cent of the doctor's fee and the facility's fee, but there will still be an extra cost in terms of the facility's fee and the gap for the patient going to an approved facility.
We are trying to provide some equality of treatment to allow public patients to access what is considered by the government to be potentially a more efficient and cost-effective method of treating some procedures. It is the case that the government will still approve what procedures are performed in these approved facilities. They will still have control over that sort of thing. So I think the minister's argument about people being pushed out of public hospitals is not the case. It will still not be attractive for a person who cannot afford it to go to an approved facility as a public patient. This at least will provide some assistance for those who want to do that. It might well alleviate some of the pressure on public hospitals and their waiting lists. We think it will at least provide some equity of treatment and that the government ought to be encouraging both public and private patients to utilise and access measures which it thinks are beneficial. So this is the balancing measure.
I do not want to labour the point, but we do want to note that the minister will retain control over approving which procedures occur. I do not think people will be forced out of hospitals, as the minister suggests. The question for a lot of patients will be that they will not be able to afford to take advantage of procedures at approved facilities, but it will at least provide some support for those who want to take advantage of that option and who remain public patients.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-25,"—I am a little more inclined, after this debate, to be supporting Senator Chris Evans. If you have a situation where somebody wants to have a mole removed and they go to a GP who suggests that the person can wait and go into a public hospital to have the job done, then, being uninsured, that person would not be up for any costs at the public hospital. But if the doctor says it can be done quicker in 
 the community approved facility, that person, being uninsured, would be up for a cost. Is that correct? If that is correct—I think that is the point which other honourable senators have been talking about—does it mean that sort of practice will become more widespread and doctors and others will be encouraging patients to use the community facilities more and more?
On the other hand, as I see it, those who would have the procedure done in an approved facility will be at no disadvantage than had they gone to a private hospital. It does not seem to me that there will be any difference. The gap might be more in a private hospital, but there does not seem to me to be a disadvantage there to those people. There does seem to be a disadvantage for an uninsured person to, say, have the mole removed in the approved facility in the community as against having it done in the public hospital. That is the question that I am asking the minister.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-25,"—Senator Chris Evans and Senator Harradine have raised some important issues that go to the importance of understanding that there is a crucial tie to the agreement with the states that the states can pay under the Commonwealth-state agreements. The state has the ability to pay for a range of treatments in a range of settings, including the new facilities, unlike the previous Labor Party Medicare arrangements.
In the example used by Senator Harradine with regard to the mole and the appropriate service, yes, if the treatment is undertaken in a public hospital there is no cost—in effect, it is picked up by the state. But should that then be referred, as in the second instance that you quote, to a facility, then it needs to be recognised that the states should still pay for the service in that particular area. I hope that clarifies the position.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-25,"—Could we perhaps revisit the amendments of mine that we were discussing yesterday. They were amendments (1) and (2) on waiting periods on sheet 1283. I think that 
 might clarify the situation a little before we get to the item that you have just called.

—I am prepared to accept the amendment to my amendment that has been foreshadowed by the parliamentary secretary. The parliamentary secretary—indeed, the minister—has sent around a letter to all senators in respect of this matter. I have considered that thoroughly. All other senators involved in the debate will have that. In the letter the parliamentary secretary said:
This morning many Senators appeared frustrated with the Governments concern to ensure that the amendment moved by Senator Harradine did not provide an avenue for people with a pre-existing need for psychiatric care, palliative care and rehabilitation.
It is not necessary for me to read all of it, because all other—
—It was sent to our offices, was it? I did not get a copy.
—It is addressed `TO ALL SENATORS' and is titled `Pre-Existing Ailment Provisions'. Apparently our colleagues from the Australian Democrats and the Greens do not have a copy of this, although it is addressed to all senators.
—A copy of it has been circulated as an amendment.
—The document goes on:
Currently, the National Health Act 1953  . . . provides a waiting period for all fund members of 2 months for all conditions. The Act also provides for a waiting period of 12 months for obstetrics and 12 months for pre-existing ailments as defined . . . 
The Government agrees with the intent of Senator Harradine's amendments but are keen to ensure the continuation of the status quo and avoid incentive for increased `hit-and-run' behaviour in relation to psychiatric care, palliative care and rehabilitation by unscrupulous health fund members.
In response to Senator Harradine's concerns, the Government is proposing to support Senator Harradine's original amendment with one important addition . . .  

And that is the one they are providing. Perhaps I should allow the parliamentary secretary to explain to the committee what that means. Having regard to this explanation, I am inclined to support the amendment, as it would simply continue the status quo.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-25,"—I appreciate that this is an important issue. The memo to which Senator Harradine referred was distributed to the interested senators' and members' offices yesterday, and I am happy to table a copy of it. I am pleased to respond to the comments by Senator Harradine that indicate that he would be amenable to what I will move as an amendment to his.
I advise that the minister has agreed to an inquiry into the pre-existing ailments in the National Health Act, with particular attention to psychiatric care, palliative care and rehabilitation. There will be three eminent people selected by the minister to undertake this inquiry. The minister has listened to the concerns raised, particularly those by senators yesterday, in regard to this issue, and believes that further discussion is needed. The minister does not believe that this matter can be resolved on the floor of the Senate today. This inquiry will be able to look carefully at the issues raised by senators and others, including discrimination, community rating, hit-and-run behaviour, patient history, and similar issues. We acknowledge that we will take issues in response to the inquiry seriously. To ensure the status quo, I move the amendment to Senator Harradine's amendment that has been circulated in my name this morning:
(1)	 Schedule 1, page 10 (after line 7), after item 9, insert:
9A  After paragraph (j) of Schedule 1
	 Insert:
	 (ja)	 subject to paragraph (kc), where the rules of the organization provide for a waiting period with respect to contributors for benefits in accordance with an applicable benefits arrangement of the organization and the benefits are in relation to psychiatric care, palliative care or rehabilitation, that waiting period will not exceed 2 months.

It is a particular issue, as we mentioned before, for those people who may well have a mental illness which they are not aware of; and there needs to be some means of dealing with that.
The clear intention of the majority of the Senate is, as I hear it, that there ought to be some move in government to improve the coverage of palliative care and such things as mental health problems, and that this might be some way of finding out what the problems are. Obviously, if the three eminent people are suitable, we will look forward to their report to see what positive steps we can take to improve the coverage of illnesses which may end up costing the community a great deal more in lots of other ways—in social and even financial and other ways—if we do not deal with them in a proper manner.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1

It is identical to Senator Harradine's amendment No. 3, as I understand it. Item 9 of schedule 2 will be opposed because it creates a precedent in that policies may be offered for approved facilities procedures which exclude coverage of palliative care, psychiatric care and rehabilitation. It would be against the interests of older persons if this provision were to be rolled back into hospital tables. We have a concern that this might well represent the thin end of the wedge and we believe that the full range of services ought to be offered. Therefore, we commend that proposal to the Senate and indicate that we will be opposing that schedule.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-25,"—I too am opposing that schedule, because it creates a precedent when health policies being offered in approved facilities exclude coverage for palliative care, psychiat 
 ric care and rehabilitation. As I have said previously, this does not work in the best interests of the elderly, the chronically ill and the vulnerable in our society. Given the spirit of my other amendments, it is essential that this part of this schedule be opposed because the potential for discrimination is too high and the cost to our community is too great.
One of the difficulties I have foreseen with this bill is in the area of precedent. Whilst moving health insurance into out of hospital services seems, in principle, quite sensible, there are undercurrents in this bill which seek to serve the commercial interests of health funds before the health needs of the community.

"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-25,"—The savings would be considerable, even if we are looking at rehabilitation. I know that, generally, in the longer-term that may be a worry for the funds because it may end up being quite an expensive course of treatment. But if we are concerned about older Australians, as Senator Harradine has been saying, surely it would be more practical, rather than having to ambulance them out and into a facility, to have these on site in the larger centres. I cannot understand why the funds would not want that option so that instead of taking people out to a private hospital or a day facility, procedures could be done on site, even if it is rehabilitative rather than anything else. In supporting this amendment, I cannot understand why the government has done this in the first place and why the funds want it. We are going to be dealing with some regulations later on where we will be looking at specific procedures. Why was this ever put in in the first place? What is the worry?",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-25,"—The point is well taken. I can sympathise and identify with the very issue that Senator Lees has raised. My mother is 90 years of age this year and has recently gone through a number of tortuous situations with broken bones where she has had to be evacuated from the nursing home for what are often minor issues and procedures. I would have thought they would have been more appropriately conducted in the nursing home in which she currently lives. I can certainly see the circumstances and the issues and, as I said, we will be responsive to the issue. It certainly needs to be addressed, and it is one that we should be discussing in further detail with the medical fraternity.
We do understand and empathise with Senator Harradine's concern that older people and people with chronic illnesses are able to obtain access to health insurance. Whilst we do not believe the amendments proposed by Senator Harradine and the opposition are strictly necessary, we are prepared to support them.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-03-25,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 7 and 8:
(7)	 Schedule 3, item 4, page 19 (lines 28 to 30), omit paragraph (d).
[section 78—minister's decision-making criteria]
(8)	 Schedule 3, item 5, page 21 (lines 16 to 18), omit paragraph (d).
[section 78A—minister's decision-making criteria]
These amendments remove the respective sections of the proposed power of the minister to approve rule changes and premium increases on the basis that it might `adversely affect the interests of the private health insurance industry'. This puts the interests of the industry in front of the interests of the consumers and creates the possibility that the minister could refuse approval for rules that would benefit consumers generally. The government has been unable to give an example of the rule changes that would be approved on this ground and would not manifestly be to the disadvantage of the consumer.
It could be argued that this ground gives scope for anticompetitive behaviour by the funds which has the sanction of the minister, and raises serious trade practice questions. The overriding principle should be the interests of the consumer and it should be the prime determining factor, in the opinion of the opposition. The fact that this amendment is being put is an indication of the lack of commercial consumer focus among the health funds.
—Senator Carr, I advise that schedule 3 was removed earlier, so we do not need to proceed with these amendments.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I rise to speak on the Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 . The opposition does support this legislation. This bill amends the referendum machinery provisions of 1984 to provide for the funding and distribution of material for the purposes of the referenda on the republic and on the preamble. The bill permits expenditure on matters otherwise inconsistent with subsection 11(4) of the act for the duration of 1999 for the purposes of those referenda only. The effect of this amendment is to allow the provision of $7.5 million to each of the yes and no campaign committees appointed by the Prime Minister for the promotion of their respective cases. The explanatory memorandum to the bill explains that the government will also spend $4.5 million on a neutral education campaign.
More substantively, the bill amends subsection 11(4) of the act to allow the Australian Electoral Commission to spend money on a wider distribution of the yes and no campaign material than is currently provided for. The amendment will allow the distribution of this material by post or other means, for instance over the counter, to persons other than electors, and also via the Internet.
The bill also amends subsection 25(3) of the act and, in doing so, provides for multiple ballot papers of different colours where two or more referenda are held on the same day, as will be the case for the referenda on both the republic and the preamble. Finally, the bill corrects a reference in paragraph 36A(3)(b) of the act to appropriately protect the secrecy of a voter's ballot.
It is interesting to note in this context that the government does intend to retain subsection 11(1) of the act, which provides for the writing of the formal yes and no cases. The government has indicated that selected members and senators from within its ranks will be permitted to vote no to the republic bill so that an official no case can be prepared in accordance with that subsection. It is not clear whether a no vote will occur on the preamble bill, but I think it is becoming a bit more evident that there will probably be a body of opinion in this community that will be campaigning and voting no in respect of that preamble.
One cannot talk about this legislation without talking about some of the objects of the legislation and some of the subjects of the referenda. One comes directly to the question of the preamble. In that context, it has probably been a disappointing 48 hours or so for this nation to have seen its Prime Minister sitting down with a coterie of very selective and selected mates and putting together a form of words which have basically been thrust upon this country as the only option for a preamble for a constitution that may embody and reflect the independent status that Australia has achieved over the last 97 years, since we adopted the initial constitution.
It is somewhat of an authoritarian and arrogant position to have been taken by the Prime Minister. There was much to be gained by him in coming up with a preamble which would embody and reflect the spirit of the country and do everything that preambles should do. At the same time, opportunities lost in politics can quite often lead to very negative impacts on those who lose those opportunities. I think the Prime Minister has turned an opportunity to create a broad and 
 inspirational preamble into a loss for himself personally and for his government as well.
In the last 24 hours we have seen the preamble—the Prime Minister's personal preamble—described as an inspirational blancmange or a shambles. In fact, there has hardly been a commentator in the country who has not had fundamental problems with the preamble, apart from the usual suspects who are always there to back up the Prime Minister: Geoff Blainey and Paddy McGuinness. Apart from those very isolated and sectional characters, the broader community has basically said that the Prime Minister has dropped the ball.
What the Prime Minister should have done in framing a preamble was to adopt a broader approach. He should have looked at some of the precedents of nations of the world—nations which, in their preambles, quite often espouse the aspirations of liberty, equality, truth and justice. They are preambles which reflect the essence of a country's history; preambles which reflect not just where countries have been, but their present and their future. He got it wrong in terms of substance and he got it wrong in terms of style. One only has to read the press over the last 48 hours to see how fundamentally wrong he got it.
We have a preamble that is now being forced on the Australian public by a Prime Minister who says, `I worked it out and you have to cop it. If you do not like it, you are not going to get an alternative.' For me and for most Australians, that is the height of political arrogance.
The starting point should have been the Constitutional Convention of some 12 to 15 months ago. The Prime Minister promised to adopt the recommendations of that convention. The convention came up with 10 core ideas on what should be reflected in a preamble. That convention began with the fundamental starting point that the proper function of a preamble was to offer the context through which the actual legislation should be read, interpreted and seen, not just by the courts but by the people of the country.
That convention also said that, if we are going to go down the road to becoming a 
 republic, then we need a preamble to reflect that direction. The Prime Minister chooses to disconnect the preamble from the republic and the propositions for a republic. He thinks we can do one without the other. But it is the view of many in this country that, if Australia is to become a republic, then there should be a preamble which fits the bill. I think that was almost the unanimous view of the Constitutional Convention last year. They said that we should have a preamble which offers context for the bill and offers context for a republic in Australia.
The Constitutional Convention also said that there should be at least 10 core ideas reflected in the preamble. They included rule of law, representative democracy, recognition of original occupiers and custodians, and cultural diversity. A preamble should reflect not just our starting point of history as a post-Federation nation of 1901 but also how we have developed and how we aspire to develop.
Those developments—the composition of our people and the development of Australia into an independent sovereign nation; probably the most fundamental of those developments over the last 97 years—should have been given a much more substantive recognition in the words of the Prime Minister. Reference to God is something I have no problem with. It is already in the constitution. I regret that to a certain extent the reference to God has been politicised over recent weeks by a Prime Minister who has chosen to do so. One can look at other constitutions and see all the things that have been important to mankind and womankind—the Prime Minister has chosen to take another course. Instead of noble words and aspirations, we have reflected in our proposed constitutional preamble the concerns and prejudices of one man over some 30 years.
That is obviously a problem for us and it is going to be a problem for the nation. It is a problem not just because it reflects the concerns of John Howard but because it reflects the concerns of a very small group of people. In doing so, what does it do? Take, for instance, the Aboriginal issue and Aboriginal 
 occupation or custodianship. We have a Prime Minister who wants us just to refer to occupation. But in doing so does he not attempt to wind back the development of the common law in this country? Does he not attempt to wind back the cases of Mabo and Wik, but particularly Mabo? That is a court judgment which he himself is on record as saying he supports. The common law of this country recognises more than just occupation. Why is it not appropriate to recognise that in the constitutional preamble?
It is no wonder that leading journalists like Paul Kelly have described this preamble as a shambles. It is also no wonder, given the other factors in the suggested preamble, that people like Paul Kelly reflect on the fact that the Prime Minister's preamble seems to `wander about like a tipsy journalist' and to delve into `issues of prejudice, fashion, ideology . . . and mateship.'
His preamble is also legally flawed. He talks about equal sovereignty of all citizens. One has got to try and work out what it means and one has got to try and work out why we put in the preamble the concept of citizenship when we do not have it in the Constitution. But, as Jack Waterford in the editorial in the Canberra Times said quite elegantly the other day, what we have got to recognise is that our Constitution basically rests sovereignty in the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives. He says:
In this Westminster model the Queen and the Parliament are sovereign, not the people.
The Prime Minister has a proposed preamble which is inconsistent with the rest of the body of the Constitution.
As I say, there is concern about the content of what has been proposed, but I think there should be another concern as well. That concern should be the small number of people who have been involved in drafting this particular preamble. They were a select few. There is the Prime Minister. There is Les Murray, who was chosen essentially, I suppose, because of his long-stated antagonism to political correctness. Let me say that Les Murray was chosen to draft a citizenship oath by the previous Labor government. He was 
 chosen by Senator Michael Tate, but it was my view when I took over the portfolio and the view of the Senate that the citizenship oath that he had recommended to government and to the parliament was inappropriate, and the Senate chose to change it. He has had one outing in this area and he was rejected.
The other person who was chosen was the Prime Minister's soul mate in matters of culture and race. That is, of course, Professor Geoffrey Blainey. You could probably not get two less inclusive people, two people less representative of the way Australia has developed over the last 50 years at least, if not the last 90, than Professor Blainey and Les Murray. When you toss in the Prime Minister as well, it is no wonder that we have a preamble which really has been laughed at across the country. We have the voices and the souls of darkness drafting the preamble for the Australian people.
When one looks at Professor Blainey's performance in the public debate over the last 15 years or so, one cannot ignore the fact that it was Blainey who in 1984 first ignited the so-called race debate. It was he who loudly agitated against Australia becoming, as he called it, Asianised. He railed against the so-called Asianisation of Australia and he argued for a racially discriminatory immigration policy. Not content with that odious contribution to our public life, Blainey kept on agitating against multiculturalism, claiming that such a policy led to a tribalisation of Australia, a cluster of tribes. It was again Blainey in 1993 who railed against the Mabo judgment, denigrating the High Court and warning of two half-nations.
Blainey has never recanted on these views. On the contrary, he continues to affirm his thinking about Asian migration and continues to contend his belief that the Native Title Act is racist legislation. It is no surprise that Blainey is the hero of the extreme right-wing fringe in Australian politics. Unfortunately for Australia, he is also the hero of this Prime Minister. That is Blainey's contribution to the debate. That, for me, rules him out as someone who is best suited to advise the government as to what an appropriate preamble 
 should be for a diverse, multicultural society like ours.
The other person is Les Murray. With respect to Murray, it is probably best to put him in the bundle that Dr Mark McKenna of the ANU put him in this morning in the Sydney Morning Herald. McKenna refers to Les Murray's published Subhuman Redneck Poems and cites a poem titled `A Brief History' where Murray rails against fashionable ideology and expresses concern about those who want to declare Australia Asian. McKenna says:
For Murray, Howard and Blainey, the real victim of the historical revisionism and political realignment of the '80s and '90s was the mythology of traditional white Australia. Howard's preamble is the ultimate article of faith for the Right of Australian politics angered by the identity politics of the Hawke-Keating era. Cast in this light, the wording of the preamble makes more sense. The days of black armband history are over—we are now ""free"" to be proud of our heritage.
That is what the Prime Minister says. That is what his mates say. That is what the people who drafted this preamble say. As I say, the dark voices of public debate in Australia find their channel through this Prime Minister.
What are we supposed to do? The Prime Minister said:
We refer to Aboriginals and indigenous Australians in our preamble, and we honour them for their ancient and continuing cultures.
This, he says, is what really happened; it is an historical fact that we have honoured them `for their ancient and continuing cultures'. Forget about what we have done to them in terms of stolen generations. Forget about dispossession. Forget about all the other atrocities that have been committed and continue to be committed by way of racist legislation from this government in respect of indigenous Australians. The Prime Minister says, `What we have to believe in the future is that white Australians have actually honoured indigenous Australians for their ancient and continuing culture.' Isn't that the black armband view of history? Doesn't this Prime Minister now want to entrench that black armband view of history, espoused by Professor Blainey, in our Constitution?
We have a Prime Minister who rails against political correctness. He is a Prime Minister who rails against those who believe that people should be treated with dignity and be protected against racial vilification, racial discrimination and the language and other actions of sexual discrimination. The Prime Minister rails against people who believe in political correctness as a concept to deliver a fair go and to respect decency and the dignity of individuals. This is a Prime Minister who rejects all those concepts of a fair go, dignity and decency when it comes to protecting the victims of discrimination, but it is a Prime Minister who wants to entrench his own political correctness in the Australian Constitution and arrogantly says to the rest of us, `You've got no say in it.' That is not on.
I think the Australian people, in increasing numbers, will reject this degree of arrogance by the Prime Minister. It is important for us in this place and for those in the House of Representatives to think about how we can play ourselves into the production—into the game to produce a new preamble. One concept that probably would be appropriate for us to look at in the next few weeks would be the idea of a parliamentary committee—be it a Senate committee or a joint committee—setting up and commissioning a panel of people more broadly representative than the one selected by the Prime Minister and with more inspirational views of Australia and the aspirations of Australians.
Perhaps a parliamentary committee could commission a group of people to come up with an alternative preamble. It is a much more democratic way to go and, at the end of the day, I am sure it would come up with a much better product than that of the dark minds and souls that produced this preamble. I said at the start that we support this legislation but, at the same time, we have enormous problems with the proposal that has been put up by the Prime Minister in respect of the preamble.",SENATE,<title>REFERENDUM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-25,"—If it had gotten any closer to 12.45 p.m. I would have asked whether it was worthwhile starting. However, as there are five minutes before we start on our lunchtime 
 legislation, I guess it does give me time to work up a head of steam—and I have a head of steam in relation to this legislation. The very fact that it was meant to be coughed through or asked to be considered as cough-through legislation—as non-controversial—I think is quite extraordinary. Senator Bolkus has indicated that some elements of the legislation and some elements of the move towards the referendum are obviously controversial, but I would like to add a few more.
The Greens (WA) have been concerned about the process that has led up to this  Referendum Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 . I would reiterate that the whole element of the election of delegates to the Constitutional Convention was problematical because only half of those people were elected; the other half were appointed. It was, to a large extent, a set-up job by the government, which was hoping to get as tightly controlled a constitutional convention as possible. The system of voluntary voting was of concern to many people and was of concern to the Greens (WA). In this process, although there were many different opinions, the funding for only two very narrow lines—the no case and the minimal change case—meant that, right from the beginning, a whole range of people in the community were cut out of the process. As I said, the nomination of a proportion of the delegates was very indicative of the role the government wanted to play in trying to keep a lid on whatever outcomes there were as a result of this Constitutional Convention.
There was a lack of proper community consultation—whether it was for the preamble, whether it was for the Constitutional Convention—about how we should put it together and the process by which we should continue. The government has never thought it necessary—and, unfortunately, it is not getting a lot of gingering from the opposition—that it should at some stage go to the people of Australia, not just in a referendum, and ask, `We are actually interested in what you have to say. Why don't you write submissions?'
I have mentioned before that in Western Australia, in relation to the Commission on Government, the government went to the 
 people of Western Australia and asked, `Are you interested in issues of the Constitution?' They said yes. They held a number of different fora throughout Western Australia which were well attended. There was a lot of interest, and there were lots and lots of submissions. It was a very important process. It is still ongoing, and these kinds of things cannot happen overnight. Writing a Constitutional preamble is a nonsense—because the government insists that the preamble has no legal standing—without any concept of what the people of Australia think is important and without any concept of any changes that may happen to the Constitution itself or to what it might be in the future.
There does, in my opinion, need to be broader constitutional reform, and I refer to the work of the only elected Greens representative on the Constitutional Convention, Cath Moore. Christine Milne was also one of the selected representatives on the Constitutional Convention, and they were the two Greens representatives. At the Constitutional Convention, they both mentioned that there did need to be broader constitutional change. This was in response to a motion by the Reverend Tim Costello—and I will get to that in a moment—who wanted to look at the process for further constitutional consultation.
Christine Milne said:
I have great pleasure in seconding this motion. When I came to the Convention I expressed my disappointment that the agenda was so narrow—
as I did too when we looked at the bill in the first place. She goes on:
When you talk to people in the community—in saleyards, in church halls or wherever people are—and start asking them what becoming a republic means to them they talk about far more than just the head of state. They talk about the fact that this is a very special moment of redefinition for Australia, that it coincides, by historical convenience, if you like, with the beginning of a new millennium. It is a sign of hope for ordinary Australians that Australia's coming to a republic might also address wider issues of the Constitution, broader issues of reform, that it would address seriously the issue of granting constitutional recognition and rights to indigenous people and to all Australians. They want to talk about how people can get more involved in the political process.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-03-25,—I indicate that the opposition will be supporting the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1999.,SENATE,<title>BOUNTY (SHIPS) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I would like to say a few words about the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1999 because of its importance. Whilst my colleague Senator Conroy was very brief and has indicated our support, I think it is important to put on the record a little about the bounty itself so that people realise the importance of it to the industry. It is a fast-growing industry indeed, and it is one that supports a lot of Australians in jobs.
The bounty was originally introduced back in the 1940s. In 1947 it went to 25 per cent of the construction costs of vessels; in 1975 it was on the selling price and was there to encourage the construction of vessels of less than 6,000 tonnes; in 1980 it went to a percentage of the construction costs for vessels greater than 150 tonnes and for fishing vessels greater than 21 metres. In 1988 the bounty went to two rates: 20 per cent for prescribed vessels—that is, tugs, bulk carriers and the like—and 15 per cent for others. In 1989 there was a rejigging of the bounty to 15 per cent, phasing it down to five per cent over a period of time. It was changed again in 1993, when it was extended to nine per cent for 1993-94. It was decreased to seven per cent for 1995-96 and to five per cent for 1996-97. In their first budget in August 1996, the government terminated the bounty and, of course, this brought a great deal of reaction—so much so that the government were forced to reinstate it in December 1996 at a level of five per cent. In 1997, again under further pressure, it was extended to 1999.
The reason for traversing that very quickly is the fact that it does show the importance of the bounty, and it does show that the bounty has been rejigged over a period of time to support an industry that is important to Australia and to our export earning capacity. Undoubtedly, the industry over that period of time has had its highs and lows. The bounty, though, has been essential because it has provided our industry with the capacity to have a level playing field, and of course this was the very reason for its reinstatement at the end of 1996—after pressure was exerted by the shipbuilding industry to have it continue because of the inability of the OECD to put its shipbuilding agreement in place.
Whilst we support the bill, we say that it really does not go far enough. That can be seen when you look at the industry in places like Western Australia and Tasmania. I am told that in Western Australia last year the bounty amounted to nearly $9.4 million and in Tasmania almost $9 million. In Queensland the bounty was $6.3 million and in South Australia $0.38 million. In those states and my own state of Queensland it is not as significant an amount but it is, nonetheless, very important to the industries in those states. The industry itself provides a substantial number of jobs, and I have been told that in the order of 7,000 people are currently employed in the industry alone.
The bounty has allowed innovative design and building techniques to be developed to enable us to compete on the world stage. Of course, the only problem with the removal of the bounty is the fact that the OECD shipbuilding agreement cannot be put in place. That agreement covers 80 per cent of the shipbuilding capacity throughout the world. The reason it cannot be put in place is that the US will not ratify it, hence the need for the bounty to be kept in place for Australian industry—to protect it.
The Australian shipbuilding industry needs the guarantee of a level playing field. It is interesting to note that 80 per cent to 90 per cent of bountiable ships are exported from this nation. They cover vessels such as fast ferries, luxury cruisers and yachts, many of which show the cutting edge of technology 
 and design that has been developed successfully by Australian manufacturers. They have been able to do this with the certainty and support of the bounty.
Turning to my own state of Queensland, and this is why I wanted to speak to this bill for a few moments, an announcement was made last year of a major shipbuilding precinct in the Gold Coast area, on the Coomera River. One company alone will establish its building industry there, creating 300 jobs and $20 million worth of investment and, for the totality of the precinct, it is thought there will be something in the order of 3,000 jobs. If the level playing field is not there, the fledgling industry in this area will, of course, suffer in the longer term. It may be that there is a need for the continuation of the bounty long beyond the expectations of this government to protect Australian jobs and Australian industry when we cannot secure the agreement of the OECD shipbuilding agreement on a worldwide basis.
There are currently two companies that attract the bounty in Queensland. Brisbane Ship Constructions at Bulimba benefited to the tune of $349,000 last year. They have 400 employees, and I understand they recently won a contract to make the patrol boats for Vietnam. NQEA at Cairns, whilst they are registered under the act, received no bounty last year but undoubtedly have benefited from the bounty over a period of time. The industry itself has gone from a turnover of $5 million in 1983 to a current turnover of $926 million. So one can see that it is a very important industry in terms of employment and in terms of export growth and export earnings. Whilst the government is pitching the bounty at three per cent, we believe the bounty would be better pitched at five per cent for the remaining period and beyond until the certainty has been given to the industry that the level playing field is there.
In essence, the bill is supported, as indicated by my colleague Senator Conroy. It is to be commended, and one would undoubtedly believe that, if the level playing field cannot be achieved over a longer period of time, the Australian Shipbuilders Association will continue to press for support for an industry that is successful and will provide meaningful 
 export income to this nation and meaningful jobs to people in the Australian community. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>BOUNTY (SHIPS) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-25,"—I want to begin my remarks on the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1999  by quoting from the Department of the Parliamentary Library Information and Research Services Bills Digest  No. 128. On page 2, they say:
In the 1996-97 Budget, the Government announced that the bounty would be removed from 20 August 1996 and that transitional provisions would apply where contracts had been exchanged before this date or where work would be completed before this date but the bounty not claimed. Following representations from shipbuilders, the Australian Shipbuilders Association, and the Governments of Western Australia and Tasmania in particular, the former Minister for Industry, Hon John Moore announced that the bounty would be extended until 31 December 1997. He stated that while the 1996/97 Budget had sought to scrap the bounty as a cost-cutting measure, it had since become clear to the Government that the world shipbuilding industry was not a `level playing field' and that the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement was stalling. On 7 May 1997 it was announced that the Government was extending the bounty to 30 June 1999 for commitments entered into by 31 December 1997. To be eligible, vessels must be at least 50 per cent complete by 30 June 1999. Pro rata payments will apply for vessels between 50 and 100% complete. In September 1998 the Prime Minister announced that the bounty would be further extended until 31 December 2000 at a rate of 3%.
The Labor Party has stated that the shipbuilding bounty should be extended at 5 per cent indefinitely, until the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement, or a similar agreement, is ratified. They estimate that this would cost $86 million over three years to 2001-02.
That is the quote from the library. It is fine as far as it goes but, although this bill is described here as non-controversial, this issue has been one of the most controversial the Senate has faced in the time of this government. When the coalition government came into power in 1996, it embarked on some astonishingly stupid policies in the field of industry development and assistance, and this was one of them—when it sought to get rid of the bounty. I think the Library sometimes misses the point. They say:
Following representations from shipbuilders, the Australian Shipbuilders Association, and the Governments of Western Australia and Tasmania in particular, the former Minister for Industry, Hon John Moore announced that the bounty would be extended . . .
In fact, this was one of the great victories of the Senate. It was the Senate which insisted that this matter be properly reviewed. It was the Senate which held up the legislation. It was the Labor Party—in particular, Senator Cook—who did an outstanding job in terms of aggravating and activating on this issue. It was the Australian Democrats who vigorously supported the Labor Party in that activity and raised merry hell about this issue. Whilst I would not seek to underplay the contributions of those others mentioned in the Library's Bills Digest , the Library, frankly, missed the passion and intensity of that very controversial political debate.
Underpinning this entire issue is hopefully a turnaround from the government from a policy where it sought to ideologically withdraw industry assistance from industries which are unable to compete on the world market unless they have appropriate strategic and financial assistance. This is not about protection. This is actually about being able to compete. It is about marketing and about getting our industries and our jobs up and running. Senator Hogg has just outlined some of the figures. This industry is valued at nearly $1 billion. If the government had had its way when it was in its period of stupidity in 1996, this industry would have been crushed by the economic consequences of that policy.
Yes, I do welcome the continuation; yes, the Australian Democrats do support this bill. But the Labor Party is right: the bounty should be higher and the certainty and presence of that bounty should be guaranteed for as long as the United States and the countries in Europe continue to put our shipbuilding industry at a disadvantage.
We must put this into perspective: the Senate was the victor in this issue. The Labor Party, in particular, deserves great credit for holding its ground against an ideological push by the government. The government deserves credit for eventually accepting not only the 
 reality but also the good sense of the arguments that were being put to it. And it is the Australian Democrats who continue to argue for the proper retention of tariffs, bounties or subsidies where they are appropriate for the industry concerned, where they in fact preserve Australian jobs and the competitiveness of Australian industry versus other countries who in turn are subsidising, assisting or providing bounties to their industry in that manner. You have to fight fire with fire. There is no virtue in bounties or tariffs or subsidies on their own, but there is virtue when the whole purpose and intention is to keep us competitive and keep this nation able to sell its goods and to perform appropriately on the world trade stage. Accordingly, I record not only the Australian Democrats' gratitude that the bounty continue but also our view that it should be improved further.",SENATE,<title>BOUNTY (SHIPS) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I just want to say a few words. I do not want to go over many of the points that have been made with regard to application of the bounty and when it was introduced. It is a very important bounty in terms of my state and a shipbuilder known as Incat in Tasmania. With the greatest respect to Senator Murray and the Western Australian shipbuilders, through Incat we are leading the way in terms of fast ferry technology. Incat has just delivered its 27th fast ferry to Europe. Indeed, it has built almost 50 per cent of the high-speed passenger ferries operating around the world. It employs almost 1,000 Tasmanians. Its export value last year was around $212 million. It is very important to us; it is the state's largest employer. That is why we, as Labor senators and as opposition members, have fought very hard for the retention of this bounty.
As Senator Murray said, it was always the intention—and the intention of Labor in government as well—that the bounty continue until the OECD agreement was ratified. That is the very important point. I think it is worth noting that since the coalition won government there has actually been a decline in the number of developments in terms of shipbuilding. The government now have a proposal not only to phase out the bounty but also 
 to link it to research and development, which will lead to a significant decline in the amount of money the shipbuilders will actually get. That is having an impact.
I agree with Senator Murray that we should be endeavouring to improve this bounty while supporting the maintenance of it. In the face of the types of assistance that are being paid to European shipbuilders, we should not be proposing a further decline in the bounty. We must maintain this very important industry. I know that a lot of it is in my state, but it is important. We should ensure that we maintain a shipbuilding industry in this country by making sure that there is, to at least some degree, a level playing field.
As I said, there has been some decline in shipbuilding but the money that was earned for this country in export dollars was almost $1 billion—it was $926 million—in the last financial year. This bill proposes to introduce what is known as the SIS which will see the bounty being paid on eligible research and development expenditure at a rate of 50 per cent for innovation expenditure, up to a total of two per cent of the eligible construction costs of a bountiable vessel. That is a significant decline compared with where we were with regard to five per cent—or, indeed, I think it is only going to be three per cent through to June 1999.
I was able to obtain some information from the Australian Shipbuilders Association that shows the investment decline that has occurred since 1996 under the coalition government. That is a very sad thing, and it is something we should look at very seriously with a view to turning it around. Like other senators, I do welcome the fact that we at least have got some half-hearted attempt to continue this bounty. I just wish that the government could see its way clear to actually improving it and enhancing the opportunities, or at least making sure that some degree of level playing field continues, for Australian shipbuilders in this country.",SENATE,<title>BOUNTY (SHIPS) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-25,"—Like my colleagues from the Labor Party and Senator Murray, we rise to support the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1999 , though we do not think it goes any 
 where near far enough in having any vision for the future of shipbuilding in this country. As my other colleagues and Senator Murray have said, if it was not for the very active campaign the Labor Party and the Democrats carried out in 1996 there would be no ship bounty. The ship industry—especially fast ships—as we know it in Australia would have probably been destroyed or reduced to an inconsequential level by a bumbling, incompetent government in 1996 who did not understand the needs of the shipbuilding industry. At the time, the Australian Shipbuilders Association expressed their horror at the way they were being treated by a government that did not have any understanding.
In government—and I was the minister responsible for shipbuilding for two years in the Keating government—we made it clear that we would agree to phase out the bounty once everybody else in the OECD had signed off on getting rid of all their subsidies so that there would be a so-called level playing field. This government wanted to get rid of the ship bounty without the commitment from other countries. We would have been shooting off one leg—not just a foot but a whole leg and half of the body—of the Australian shipbuilding industry by that naive attitude taken by the then minister, Mr Moore. What we have to understand is not just the bounties and tariffs that other countries have to assist their shipbuilding; it is the non-tariff support mechanisms they put in place.
I led a shipbuilding delegation to Japan in 1995 and discovered it was not an issue of bounties or tariffs that was making it difficult for our shipbuilders to sell fast ferries into Japan—even though they were better quality, cheaper and technologically more advanced than anything built in Japan—but that the Japanese bureaucracy were going to make it absolutely impossible to have any proper penetration of the Japanese market. That was made clear to us. Under licences and so-called safety regulations and design regulations, it was going to be impossible for us to sell into a market that potentially has the need for 3,000 ferries operating around the coast of Japan and the inland sea. It was clear to me that you would never remove our assistance 
 until a market like Japan demonstrably and genuinely opened up its passenger ferry business to genuine competition.
They told us, `You can actually, as a foreigner, apply to get concessional funding for a ferry that is going to be built overseas but purchased by a Japanese ferry operator.' It turned out that, no matter how many applications were put in, no-one ever got access to that money. Informally we were told that the bureaucrats made it clear: they saw it as their duty never to grant an overseas ferry builder access to those concessional funds. This was although it was said under the rules internationally, `This is open; this is transparent.' But the bureaucrat made sure you never got it.
It was the same on design. I give this example: Austral Ships did crack one ferry sale in 1994-95 from Western Australia into Japan. They had to pay to have a Japanese safety expert from their marine department on the site in Western Australia, from the very first bolt or weld that was done until when the ship was delivered, so that all the so-called safety and design rules for Japan could be met under the so-called guarantee to consumers and ferry users in Japan that they were getting a safe ferry. It had already been demonstrated around the world that our ferries were the best, the safest, the most technologically advanced and the most comfortable for passengers. So that condition was met at considerable extra expense.
When the ferry was about to be delivered to Japan, guess what happened? It had to be completely resurveyed before it went to Japan and when it got to Japan. This was an additional cost. After it was built there was a risk that a Japanese official could then say, `We find this unsafe. You can't deliver it to Japan.' This makes trying to get into the Japanese market a very risky business. These are the non-tariff measures that you have to beat in the shipbuilding industry worldwide. This is something that we understood. We were not going to remove the bounty until these things were opened up. When it was explained to the then Minister Moore, it was beyond his comprehension. I was very disappointed that a minister—
—Most things were beyond his comprehension.
—He found out in industry policy that most things were always beyond his comprehension, unless you bought a share in a company that he was investing in or he had an interest in. Maybe if he had had shares in the Australian shipbuilding industry he might have shown more interest, Senator Campbell. That is the only interest Mr Moore ever had in industry policy.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. That is an imputation on a very fine Australian, a member of parliament and a member of this government. It must be withdrawn. Your suggestion that he would only favour things in which he had—
—Order! Address your remarks to the chair, Senator Macdonald.
—I am helping you as well, Mr Acting Deputy President, because you were doing other things.
—Sit down.
—Order, Senator Conroy.
—On the point of order—
—Can I at least finish? Senator Schacht made the comment that Mr Moore would only fund things in which he had shares. That is an outrageous imputation on Mr Moore.
—The only way I can think of that maybe we could interest Mr Moore in being involved in industry policy is through companies that he had his own share investments in.
—Order! Senator Schacht, resume your seat. I think that that does indicate an imputation on a member and I would ask you to withdraw.
—Under your guidance, Mr Acting Deputy President, I withdraw. But I am certainly not going to withdraw the suggestion that the minister was incompetent about developing appropriate industry policy for Australian shipbuilding. 
 You have only to ask the Australian Shipbuilders Association of the time, in 1996, and they would publicly express that view. They did express that view. They were appalled at the minister's lack of knowledge of and support for their industry.
I come to the point, as I conclude, that on the matter of the shipbuilding industry it is stupid for any government to say unilaterally, `We will withdraw bounties and support for the shipbuilding industry of Australia as an example to the rest of the world,' because the rest of the world will not follow. They will clean us up. In the example I gave, as a minister leading a shipbuilding delegation to Japan, it was clear to me that there are 50 other devices countries will use to stop us getting into their markets and to protect their own. Until all of those non-tariff, non-bounty issues are dealt with, Australia must continue to support industry through bounties and to have an active interventionist government willing to do its bit to support this industry that employs several thousand people and earns, as Senator Hogg said, close to $1 billion a year in export earnings.
Unfortunately, this government has never woken up to the fact that if you want to get the current account deficit down in this country on the trade side, you have to support high value added industry such as our shipbuilding industry. You do so by having appropriate bounties and active support. Though we support this bill, it is a sorry state of affairs that this industry was nearly put through the floor by the stupidity of Mr Moore and his government only two or three years ago.",SENATE,<title>BOUNTY (SHIPS) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-25,"—I was not intending to speak, but I will speak very briefly. I would just like to indicate that I am surprised that Senator Schacht did not choke on the hypocrisy of what he just said in relation to what they did as a government in setting up Australia's response to the Uruguay Round of GATT. I cannot remember the number of times I came into this chamber and said, `It's a bit dumb and a bit naive for Australia to assume that we can just get rid of tariffs and bounties and assume that the rest of the world will follow.' 
 I said it again and again, and I was asked if I believed in free trade.
The reality is that the previous Labor government set up Australia's response to the Uruguay Round of GATT and set up the Button plan in relation to car industries. Even worse was the Button plan in relation to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries whereby the Labor government assumed it could fling off tariffs at a much greater rate before they even knew what was required under the Uruguay Round of GATT on the assumption that everyone else would be so impressed by Australia, they would all follow.

—It was a nonsense then and, I agree with Senator Schacht, it is a nonsense now.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I rise to make a number of comments in relation to the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1998  and to indicate that the Labor Party supports the bill. The bill arose out of a number of issues raised by Labor Party senators in Senate estimates over the past 12 to 18 months. They drew attention to the fact that a number of companies had been serious 
 ly disadvantaged by the rigid application of the then terms of the bill to a number of companies. One stark example that we had before us was a particular company which had sent its application for a tax concession to the tax office and that application laid in the tax office for four or five months before it was discovered and passed on to the Department of Industry, Science and Technology, as it then was. These types of absurdities, at the end of the day, prevented six companies from being considered for the tax concession by the Industrial Research and Development Board. I welcome this bill and the fact that these companies will now be able to have their applications considered by the board. I just hope that the proposals from these companies are still around and that they warrant consideration and the granting by the board of their concessions.
I also draw attention to the comments in the explanatory memorandum. In the first paragraph it says that the bill is aimed at reducing the compliance cost for companies. When I was travelling around the country over the past six months or so for a Senate inquiry, the question of the R&D START program was raised on a number of occasions by representatives of some companies who gave evidence to the inquiry. They said that they had not bothered applying for R&D under the current program because of the rigid, restrictive and very complex administrative provisions that are applied to that program. So, hopefully, the reduction of the compliance cost for companies will open up the opportunity, particularly for small companies, to get access to R&D, because R&D is a critical issue in terms of the development of our industrial base.
We have been trying to promote innovation amongst Australian companies for a considerable time. Over the years, there have been a variety of programs put in place by various successive governments to try to encourage investment in R&D by Australian companies. The reality is that, in the last financial year, we have seen our expenditure on the R&D START program underspent by $50 million. We have also seen that, in terms of the ABS statistics for the year 1996-97, business 
 expenditure on research and development fell by five per cent on the previous year.
Whilst we advocate and praise and encourage innovation, what we are seeing is a fall off in the overall expenditure in R&D by companies in this country. It was argued at the last Senate estimates committee hearing that this was partly because of the huge blow-out that occurred under the scheme introduced by the previous government. This indicates a change in the level of out-take was taking place. I suppose we will have to wait and see at the outcome of the budget whether or not that is factual or whether there is a continuing trend in the reduction of expenditure on R&D in this country. There is certainly a lot of anecdotal evidence around to suggest that companies are not spending anywhere near what they were previously on R&D programs within their corporations. It is a continuing concern to ensure that we are continuously monitoring what is occurring in that area and have the continuous ability to finetune government programs to ensure that R&D expenditure is maximised on behalf of companies in this country and, more importantly, to ensure that we get the sorts of innovations and developments that will allow our industries to grow and to be competitive and successful in the international marketplace.
The second issue I want to briefly address is R&D funds themselves. As a result of the Ralph review of business taxation, there has been a lot of speculation in the media in the past two or three weeks that R&D expenditure could be traded off against a 30 per cent company tax. It has been mentioned in a number of articles in newspapers in recent weeks. One in particular was in the Australian Financial Review of 22 March 1999 and it said:
Mr Ralph said the R&D incentive, which allows companies to claim 125 per cent of their R&D expenditure as a tax deduction, could be sacrificed along with accelerated depreciation.
""It's certainly part of the tax incentives and it could go either way,"" Mr Ralph said at a public seminar in Sydney on Friday.
I want to raise that issue, because I attended the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association dinner last night at which the minister for industry was the guest speaker. I understood him to say that that was off the 
 agenda and that there would be no trade-off of R&D expenditure in respect of anything that comes out of the Ralph review of business taxation. I wanted to put that on the record because, if that is not what the minister said, if that is the wrong interpretation of what he said, I invite him to come into this chamber and tell the Australian people that that is the case.
—Or tell Mr Costello.
—Or tell Mr Costello. I certainly understood him to say and to make it clear that that was not on the agenda, that there would be no trade-off of funds available for R&D investment expenditure against a lower company tax rate. If that is the case, I think we have to welcome that statement.
As I said in my initial remarks, this bill that we have before us is supported by the Australian Labor Party. It does address what were very blatant administrative restrictions in the bill that worked to the disadvantage of a number of companies. Hopefully, the bill will now institute provisions that will allow those companies applications to be properly addressed by the IR&D board. As I said, hopefully those companies are still around and will be able to take advantage of the new provisions that will be provided for by this amendment bill.",SENATE,<title>INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-25,"—The Democrats will support the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1998  but we, too, wish to use this opportunity to briefly make some remarks about research and development. As I have already mentioned, 1996 was a very stupid year for industry policy, and research and development was particularly targeted in that era of stupidity. I recall in an estimates session asking the secretary concerned whether they had done a cost-benefit analysis as to what the effect of their changes to research and development would be. The answer was that no, they had not. So I asked, `When would you expect to see what the effects of those changes would be?' and the answer was, `In about three years time.'
Here we are, three years later, and the effect of that stupid policy decision is that our 
 research and development has declined. Our world ranking position within the OECD has dropped. It never was all that high, I might say, but under the policies that were prevailing at the time it was being lifted and it was improving, and we were going up the rankings, which is where we should be as a country.
What they have done is reverse a progressive direction which was in the interest of Australia and I, for one, regret that enormously. One of the major issues at that time was reducing a general industry facilitator, which was the R&D tax concession, from 150 per cent to 125 per cent, and they took that action without regard to the consequences. I asked the question, `Have you done a cost benefit analysis?' They said, `No, we just know how much it costs us, and this is how much we are going to take out of the budget.' But they had absolutely no idea about how much it actually gives back to the community, to industry, to the economy, to the wealth of Australia and to jobs. We had an idea, and we were right because three years later we can see the figures.	There is a clear lesson that when you combine ideology with inexperience and rank obstinate stupidity, the consequences for people are the loss of jobs, the loss of competitiveness and the loss of a market position for the manufacturing industry, in particular, which is to be greatly regretted.
Having got that off my chest, let me return to the bill at hand. The people who write to parliamentarians play a great role in provoking thought on issues to which we might not otherwise be alerted. All senators know that the number of representations you get can encourage you to decide whether a bill is non-controversial or not. We were undecided on this bill. We did, in fact, get only one communication that I can recall, and in the end we were undecided about that communication. But I want to put it on record—I notice that the advisers to the minister are present, and they should pay heed to it—because, if this person was right, it needs to be corrected; if they were not right, then it does not need to be corrected, but we will keep an eye on it.
I will give you a summary of what was said. They said that the apparently innocent provision—which is actually item 22—of the Industry Research and Development Board in relation to the exploitation of the results of R&D projects could have serious ramifications. They state:
Previously, the Board had the power to issue certificates stating that the results of R&D activities had been exploited `otherwise than in a manner that is for the benefit of the Australian economy'. As would be expected, the effect of such a certificate is to disallow all claims for the R&D activities, whether undertaken before or after the certificate is issued. Clause 22 of the bill will add to this power by allowing the Board to issue the certificate if:
""It would have been reasonable to expect that there has been some exploitation, after the commencement of this paragraph, of the results of those research and development activities but no such exploitation has occurred.""
They go on:
There are two major problems with this.
1. It is effectively retrospective because it applies to R&D projects which may have started a number of years ago under a different set of rules. The only time limit is that the reasonable expectation must arise after the Bill is passed—the power is not restricted to activities which commence after the Bill is passed.
It is very clear that this provision is aimed squarely at R&D syndicates. Whatever your view may be on syndicate investors, they should be entitled to have their R&D projects reviewed under the provisions that were in effect when the syndicate transactions were entered into.
2. The second problem is that the provision is not restricted to syndicates. It is a broadly stated, discretionary power that strikes at the market driven nature of the concession. The IR&D Board will have the power to second-guess companies about whether particular results should be exploited, and how and when they should be exploited. It will be the board that determines if the R&D is successful, when it is reasonable to expect exploitation, and to some extent what form of exploitation is sufficient.
Many companies conduct a range of R&D activities with the same basic aim, and choose to exploit the one (if there is the one) which is the most successful and the most economically advantageous. This is something we should be encouraging, not discouraging.
The proposed new provision can only add further uncertainty to the R&D tax concession. The existing power to disallow claims if the results 
 have been exploited in a manner that is not to the benefit of the Australian economy is more than adequate and should not be extended in a manner that gives the Board power to dictate to companies what they should do with R&D results.
I have deliberately read that to you as they presented it to me, because it appeared to be a fairly cogent expression of their opinion. I will say, particularly to the advisers to the minister, that, frankly, the Australian Democrats were undecided about this and whether there was a real issue to hand, and I would appreciate it from our side if you could keep an eye on it and advise us in due course if in fact these kinds of problems emerge—and you would obviously do that through your representative minister. Accordingly, the Australian Democrats will support the bill in full.",SENATE,<title>INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-25,"—The opposition, as Senator George Campbell has already indicated, will support the Industry Research and Development Amendment Bill 1998 , and we note that the Democrats are supporting it. The Senate should note the remarks of Senator Campbell and Senator Murray that, although we agree with this bill, we want to make comments on the very sorry saga that this government has put itself and Australian industry through over R&D since, as Senator Murray said, that terrible 1996 budget which slashed the R&D tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent.
I remember John Button, the industry minister in the 1980s who introduced the policy of the Labor government to increase the tax concession for R&D to 150 per cent, telling me that he had to fight the bureaucratic opposition of Treasury and the Department of Finance and their acolytes spread throughout the bureaucracy—including the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet—who were utterly opposed to any increase in a special tax deduction for R&D.
He also said that, for every budget after he got it in, the 150 per cent tax deduction was the number one savings option on the hit list from Treasury and the Department of Finance. He said that, for every budget, he had to fight in cabinet against the Treasury bureaucracy's view that this had to be defeated, because 
 Treasury hated it—they hated it with a passion.
I notice that our bumbling Prime Minister in his preamble—or whatever you want to call it—actually mentioned that we should be free of ideology. I wish he would tell the Department of the Treasury to get rid of their ideological obsessions, where they want to impose their view about how the finances and the economy in Australia should run. They are as ideologically obsessed as any group of people in Australia.
Of course, when the new government came in, bingo, they had a new inexperienced Treasurer and a new inexperienced industry minister. It was a case of, `Minister, we have got to make savings.' They said, `We have to get rid of this rort'—as they called it—`this tax deduction of 150 per cent. It is being rorted. There are people out there who are abusing it, and it is not creating any impetus for Australian industry.' Mr Costello and the industry minister fell for the three-card trick and dropped it to 125 per cent. I understand that at one stage it was probably going to be knocked off completely, but someone had enough sense to say that that might be bit much. Industry complained bitterly when they got whiff of it, so it went to 125 per cent.
I have no doubt that, in the budget coming up in a month's time—in the first year of a new government after it has been re-elected—Treasury will put up as a savings option to the government knocking off the remaining 125 per cent of the tax deduction. It will be on their hit list and I trust the new industry minister, Mr Minchin, is already defending the minimum of 125 per cent.
—Senator Minchin.
—Senator Minchin. I trust that he is using his influence with the Prime Minister to make sure that there is no further reduction.
Why do we need a concession to encourage R&D? It is very simple. We have a trade deficit running into, on average, between $20 billion and $30 billion a year because we do not export enough high value added manufactures and services from Australia. We manufacture low value added commodities.
All the countries of the Western world of any consequence in the OECD have trade surplus because they export high value added manufactures and services. That is the lesson. And how do they develop high value added manufactures and services? They have an absolute commitment to put R&D up front, both in the public and the private sector. They realise that, out of that R&D, you get the innovation, the ideas and the new products that the rest of the world is willing to buy at a very high price because they are the best products available.
But, no, not our Treasury; they never accept this view—not our Treasury officials and not our finance department officials. If they get the ear of their minister, they all call it a rort. They do not call it a rort in Japan. They do not call it a rort in West Germany, in France, in Great Britain or even in the United States of America. They see this as a legitimate approach to encourage innovative R&D in their countries. We would hope that in this coming battle—as I suspect it will be—the Treasury again hopefully will be defeated. We encourage Senator Minchin and other ministers to look at actually increasing the R&D tax concession back to the 150 per cent to reverse the trend that Senator Murray has outlined.
We support this bill as an improvement in administration. We think it is quite reasonable. But the real issue we want to talk about is why we need to have decent R&D policy in Australia for the long-term future of this country.",SENATE,<title>INDUSTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-03-25,"—The Airports Amendment Bill 1999  makes five changes to the Airports Act 1996. The opposition is relaxed about four of the changes proposed. However, we have an amendment to the fifth change that we understand the government will not oppose. There are some matters that do need to be put on the record, and I will be as brief as possible.
The first change I wish to mention extends the regulatory mechanism for activities around airports to include non-structural activities that may intrude into airport operations. The existing mechanism is designed to ensure that developments around airports do not affect safety, efficiency or the regularity of aviation operations.
The amendment provided by this bill will broaden the definition of controlled activities to include non-structural activities such as operating lights that are capable of interfering with aviation or operating equipment, or a facility which reflects light that may interfere with aviation; any activity resulting in air turbulence that could affect normal flight; and any activity emitting smoke, dust or gas that affects the ability of an aircraft operating under visual flight rules. The bill does not interfere with ordinary or domestic activities. It also gives the Commonwealth the power to make regulations setting out the standards for activities covered by the broadened definition.
The second change I will cover, and which the Labor Party supports, clarifies the situation regarding the excision of land from an 
 airport site. If excision takes place there will be no requirement to surrender the entire airport lease. Airport owners, we understand, have requested this amendment in order to allow the acquisition of minor parcels of land or the disposal of land on the boundaries of airports.
The third change clarifies the act to make it clear that it does not apply to military air operations at airports that are jointly used by civil and military operators. The fourth change that Labor supports makes it clear that the granting of rights to use land on a leased property, such as an easement, does not constitute an acquisition of an airport lease. Thus, the first amendment is a sensible broadening of the scope of the application of the act to ensure the maintenance of safety in aviation, and the next three are designed to clarify issues in the principal act.
The fifth change relates to an extension of time for phase 2 airport owners to have access undertakings to airport services approved by the ACCC. The current act gives airport owners 12 months to negotiate access arrangements with airport users. The following services are covered: firstly, services that are necessary for the purposes of operating and/or maintaining civil aviation services at the airport; secondly, services provided by means of significant facilities at the airport, being facilities that cannot be economically duplicated.
The ACCC has identified the following groups of services that meet both these criteria. They are: airport facilities, including aircraft movement, areas such as runways, taxiways, aircraft parking areas, safety devices, lighting and vehicle access to these facilities; passenger processing areas, including departure and holding lounges, immigration and customs service areas, check-in desks and baggage handling; sites for providing refuelling facilities; ground service and freight equipment storage sites; light and emergency maintenance facilities; and land side vehicle access but not car rental facilities or car parks. The ACCC said it was unlikely the following services met both criteria: administrative office space; flight catering facilities; commercial and retail facilities; cargo terminal 
 facilities; waste disposal facilities; and heavy and planned maintenance facilities.
Airport operators can submit access undertakings for qualifying services to the ACCC. This must specify the terms on which airport services will be made available to airlines and other users of airport services, or the undertaking must establish a process for negotiation of terms and conditions to access including dispute resolution procedures. The ACCC is required to conduct public consultation before the undertakings for access are approved.
The aim of this mechanism is apparently to:
provide a means by which the owner or operator of a facility can obtain certainty about access arrangements before a third party seeks access.
That is from the second reading speech accompanying the Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995. If the ACCC has not approved an undertaking within the time period of 12 months, a ministerial determination is made that subsection 192(2) of the Airports Act applies at the airport. When the act is declared to apply, any airport service for which an access undertaking has not been approved by the ACCC will be declared for the purposes of part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The latter act provides a comprehensive access regime.
Under the Trade Practices Act, current airport users and potential airport users have the right to negotiate terms and conditions of access with the airport operator first and, if negotiations prove to be unsuccessful, there is the opportunity for the matter to be arbitrated by the ACCC. Aircraft owners prefer access undertakings to declared services because undertakings set out the `generic' basis for provision of services, whereas declared services give airport users the right to request and negotiate specific terms and conditions of access and have disputes arbitrated by the ACCC. As I indicated, the current act gives airport owners the time period of 12 months. In the bill we have before us, it is proposed that this time be extended to 24 months.
The opposition does not agree to the government's original proposal to grant all airport owners a 12-month extension. Therefore, we oppose schedule 1, item 1, page 3, 
 lines 5 and 6, and schedule 1, item 17, page 7, lines 6 and 7. We also propose that at schedule 1, item 18, lines 8 and 9 be omitted and the words as circulated in the chamber be substituted. The effect of this amendment will be that airport owners can seek a one-off 12-month extension of the period during which an access undertaking may be lodged with the ACCC by applying to the ACCC for such an extension. This is a more satisfactory method, in our view, of dealing with the issues before us. We believe that airport owners should apply and justify their application rather than simply benefit from a blanket extension. The amendment is a reasonable compromise for the interests of both owners and users.
I would like to thank the government and the other parties for their support of this amendment and for recognising that the blanket extension was not the best path to go down. I commend the amendments to the Senate and, given my understanding that they will be passed, I commend the amended bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AIRPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-25,"—On behalf of the opposition I wish to indicate our support for the Assistance for Carers Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 . We welcome the bill and the many beneficial measures that are contained in it. Carers provide an unstinting and highly valuable role in our society, often at great personal and economic cost. It is important that the parliament and Australia generally recognises their contribution and provides as much assistance as we can to their efforts. It has been estimated that up to $16 billion is saved per year by the unfunded efforts of carers.
Madam Acting Deputy President, I am not keen to hold up this bill. I am very keen for it to be passed today. But I do want to put on record our concern that the adult disability assessment tool that is at the centre of a lot of the measures contained in the bill is not yet available. The opposition is concerned that we have not been able to see that assessment tool. As Mr Swan, the member for Lilley, made the point in the House of Representatives the other day, we are quite nervous about agreeing to this bill without the ability to assess that assessment tool.
We do, however, understand it is a disallowable instrument but, of course, that is a very blunt measure for the Senate to use to respond to concerns about an issue such as this. We would urge the government to ensure that there is proper consultation and negotiation with interested parties before that adult disability assessment tool is finalised, so that we are not faced with a disallowance type debate in the Senate, but rather we have a tool that, I think, everyone can agree to support.
Our concern about this is based on the growing concern about the child disability assessment tool, particularly in its treatment of cystic fibrosis sufferers. I do not want to delay the Senate but I congratulate Mr Sid Sidebottom, the member for Braddon, for his 
 advocacy on behalf of these groups and note that the opposition will continue to advocate their concerns with that particular assessment tool.
I would like to have had more time today, but I think it is important that we carry the bill. So I will conclude my remarks and indicate that we will be supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>ASSISTANCE FOR CARERS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-25,"—Likewise I will attempt to keep my comments brief and the brevity of them in no way reflects on the importance of this matter. The Democrats believe that the role of carers is an essential one in the Australian community, both in a social sense, of course, and in an economic sense.
As Senator Evans indicated, carers save the taxpayer an enormous amount of money in performing a role that would otherwise have to be performed by organisations in a more commercial sense—whether that is government organisations or private organisations—and almost inevitably involving significant extra government expense as opposed to the cost of caring for people usually in the home. For that, as well, of course, for the social role that they play, carers need to be acknowledged in very positive terms.
The Democrats also share similar concerns to those expressed by the previous speaker in terms of the non-finalisation of the adult disability assessment tool. It is a problem that unfortunately does arise not infrequently. Legislation which has a delegated instrument hanging off it that is not available at the time the legislation is passed, in effect means that the parliament is, to a degree, passing legislation that it is not able to ascertain the full impact of. That obviously is not an ideal situation. Delegated legislation and disallowable instruments are fairly blunt instruments in terms of parliamentary scrutiny and amendment and are, of course, becoming far more frequent these days than they used to be. Nonetheless, we do recognise that overall the bill will be introducing a number of positive measures and obviously we will be looking at the disability assessment tool closely when it does become available.
I would like to mention another issue briefly. My understanding is that one of the 
 other amendments that this act makes will impact on a small number of parenting payment recipients and prevent a sole parent from qualifying for a parenting payment on the basis that they are receiving a child disability allowance for a child who is over 16 years of age.
That will obviously impact on some people who will have to apply for a different payment such as the Newstart allowance, which is paid at a lower rate and has a tighter income and assets test. Whilst we would not want to hold up the bill solely because of that measure, I do express the Democrats' concern about the impact that that will have. I think it is an example of the growing problem of the increasing gap between the level of payment for allowances and the level of payment available to pensions—not just the payment level but also the various conditions, income tests, et cetera, that attach to it.
The gap is there and it is potentially getting worse. The old rationale for the differentiation between pensions and allowances—or what used to be called benefits—that one was a permanent payment and the other was a temporary one we would all acknowledge has become much less clear in recent times, with long-term employment rates being much higher than any of us would like as well as people being on other allowances potentially for longer periods of time. That gap between pension levels and allowance levels is one that the Democrats believe does need closer attention, not just at payment levels but perhaps even more importantly in terms of income test changes, taper rates, et cetera.
I do express our concern about that. I am not sure precisely how many people will be affected by that measure, but obviously any measure that does potentially impact on people's basic level of income support is one that the Democrats are concerned about. Nonetheless, as I said, it is broadly a positive bill and it would be desirable to ensure that the positive measures contained within it are put through. I shall cease my remarks there.",SENATE,<title>ASSISTANCE FOR CARERS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-03-25,"—The Assistance for Carers Legislation 
 Amendment Bill 1999  gives effect to a number of measures aimed at improving assistance to carers, including the measures announced in the government's April 1998 staying at home package. Senator Evans raised the issue of the adult disability tool, and I have been advised that the development of that tool has been discussed very broadly with the shadow minister and other senators who have been interested. But I have also been advised that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel will not accept orders for the drafting of the tool until the passage of this bill. I have been advised that Senator Newman has made a commitment that after a year of operation that tool will be reviewed.
Regarding the other issue that Senator Bartlett raised, there is a small group of single parents who can qualify for parenting payment on the basis of having a student CDA child. This is a very small group, and it is expected that most of them will be transferred to more appropriate payments by 1 July 1999. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to questions without notice asked by Senators Bishop and O'Brien today relating to the proposed new tax system.
The answers relate to the goods and services tax and the issue of the black economy—certainly not to the superannuation surcharge. Senator Kemp's total failure in that area is obvious to everyone in the industry and the media and there is no need to address that issue, but Senator Kemp totally failed to adequately answer the questions relating to the black economy.
One of the constantly touted themes of the Liberal government in respect of a goods and services tax is that it will crack down on the black economy. Senator Kemp said, `One of the ways to tackle the cash economy is to tackle tax reform.' Of course, we all know what that means: the introduction of a goods and services tax.
The question from my colleague Senator Bishop went specifically to the problems in the housing construction industry in New Zealand and Canada, where after the introduction of their goods and services taxes there was  significant evasion—in fact, a significant increase in the black economy as a result of the equivalent of a goods and services tax.
Why does this happen? The great problem in the housing industry and other industries as well is that the goods and services tax is a tax primarily on the labour content of that service provision. In the housing industry, the considerable majority of the price that is charged relates to the cost of labour, and this is the area where all the evidence internationally points to the most significant level of evasion of a goods and services tax.
Mr Damien Walshe, who is a partner of Arthur Andersen, referred to `evasion with a GST VAT, especially in a labour-intensive job'. He said:
When you have relatively low levels of goods being inputed to a service provision, the opportunity for the service provider not to declare income is where the real problem lies.
And this is one of the problems with a GST, and in particular with the housing industry. A study in Canada by the Ontario state government found that their GST led to `widespread participation in the underground economy', causing lost revenue of $Can2.3 billion. So the central argument advanced by this government, that a GST will crack down and reduce the black economy, is false. There is no evidence that that is the case, and in fact there is evidence to the contrary from Canada, New Zealand, Europe and the United Kingdom that the black market, as it is known, will increase.
There was an interesting article in the Sunday Times of August 1998. The Henley Centre, a consumer consultancy which interviewed 1,000 adults, carried out what is called a sensitivity sample, and they found that Britain's black economy is booming. This was also confirmed by European Union economists, who estimated that the black economy in Europe—bearing in mind that every country in Europe has a VAT or a GST of varying levels—was expanding and could 
 now account for 16 per cent of the European Union's gross domestic product.
In respect of question 6, there are some effective ways at present under the Tax Administration Act of 1953 to identify people who are engaged in the black economy, and this section will be used in respect of the implementation of a goods and services tax. Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, said very firmly:
The answer is yes. They will be used appropriately. We have section 8U of the Tax Act of 1953 to crack down on the black economy.
Then, what do we hear from the Treasurer, Mr Costello, on Triple J radio last Thursday? He advised a young person who rang in and who was working cash-in-hand to effectively ignore that section of the tax act. The Treasurer is telling the nation, `We are going to crack down on the black economy,' but he effectively advised the person who rang in not to worry about it—not to worry about section 8U of the tax act. So what hope have we got, if a GST comes in, of effectively cracking down on the black economy?

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1999-03-25,"—Senator Sherry gives the game away when he commences his answer and says, `Tax reform means the introduction of a GST.' Senator Schacht in his question referred to a submission to the GST inquiry, and that is where the Labor Party has got it totally wrong. What we are talking about is the introduction of a new tax system, and Senator Sherry ought to have been around this place long enough to know that, when you introduce a new tax system, there is far more to it than just the introduction of a GST.
He selectively quoted comments that are made overseas in relation to the black economy, but in fact this government is totally committed to measures that combat tax avoidance and minimisation. The black economy is one of those areas where this government is totally committed. So the sooner the Labor Party, in all their discussions about what is happening in relation to tax reform, of which one part is the introduction of a GST, come to their senses and realise that what we are introducing is a total overhaul of the taxation system for the benefit of 
 the nation, perhaps the arguments they are trying to put forward might appear to be more sound to those people who are trying to promote them.
We have done an enormous amount in the last three years in making sure that people who are cheating the system, who are avoiding the system, are in fact being caught. The social security system is just one area. Something like $40 million a week, I think, is being saved from social security fraud alone. So do not say that this government is soft on tax minimisation and tax avoidance because it has done all it can in those three years to make sure that people who are not paying their proper dues by way of taxation will have to in the future.
Some of the actions that have already been implemented are, for instance, the closing of the abuse of the research and development tax concession. We got tremendous opposition from the Labor Party when we were trying to make changes in the area of R&D, but in fact we closed the research and development tax concession syndication arrangement because they had been focused on tax minimisation rather than on genuine research and development, and so the definition of a concession was also tightened.
So do not talk about this government going soft on tax minimisation or tax avoidance. We have stopped the abuse of luxury car leasing. You had 13 years to try to stop that, and what did you do? Nothing at all.
—That is not true.
—You had 13 years to stop that abuse, Senator Cook, and you know it. We closed the infrastructure borrowing scheme for new applications because the tax concession was being exploited increasingly for tax minimisation by financiers and high income investors. Without this action, if pending applications had been certified, the revenue cost could have been over $4 billion over a period of three years. So don't you talk about this government being soft on tax minimisation or other measures of tax avoidance.
There are a number of measures that are currently in place, including things like 
 extending the general anti-avoidance provisions of the taxation system to combat withholding tax avoidance, to prevent the trafficking in trust losses. There was no mention or any credit from the opposition about the measures this government has taken in order to try to catch people who are not paying their fair share of taxation. All we have is people like Senator Sherry coming in here and saying, `We have some reports of the black economy in other countries of the world increasing with the introduction of a goods and services tax.' Let me tell you: goods and services taxes has been in place in many of those countries for in excess of 30 years, and many in excess of 25 years.
If you would like to go through the list of all of those countries, you will find that there are very few countries that will complain that the black economy is greater after you have a goods and services tax. There is a whole range of other measures and a whole range of other reasons as to why people will try to avoid tax through the black economy. But, as I said, do not let the Labor Party talk about this government being soft on tax avoidance because, ever since we came to government, we have tried to close some of those loopholes which the Labor Party left in place for a period of 13 years without trying to do anything to close them.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I heard that they had missed out presenting one of the awards at the academy awards process earlier this week. It was for best imitation of a B grade Hollywood movie, and it was to go Senator Kemp. We all asked what the movie was and were told that it was for the movie Clueless . After his performance today, I can believe that. There is no reason to suspect that he had any idea of the sort of answer he was giving to the question I asked, which was essentially about the administration of a law of the parliament—a law which the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer are responsible for administering.
What Senator Sherry referred to from the question that I asked was in fact a statement by the principal minister, the Treasurer, on radio, encouraging young people, effectively, to ignore the tax laws. We then had the 
 spectacle today of Senator Kemp obviously not understanding the gravity of the actions of the Treasurer when he effectively tried to ignore the question, and particularly the supplementary question, that I asked.
Frankly, if this government were serious about dealing with the black economy, the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer would take seriously the words of a young person who was saying that he had to take a cash-in-hand job arising out of other policies of this government. But, no, there was no seriousness. There was no response from the Treasurer on the radio on the one hand which would indicate there is any seriousness about the issue, and there is no way that you could interpret Senator Kemp's non-answer as the answer of a minister who takes seriously the question of dealing with the black economy.
Frankly, what you would have to say about this government, and the Prime Minister in particular, is that over the years there has been no consistent pursuit of an enforcement of the tax system. This Prime Minister, in fact, was responsible in his previous period as Treasurer under the Fraser government for leaving massive tax avoidance schemes in place for years—hundreds of millions of dollars of tax revenue was being lost—and now we have seen him dragged kicking and screaming into the tax reform process. But what does he say is the solution? A GST.
We heard Senator Ferguson today say that the GST is somehow the solution to the black economy. He talked about the countries, particularly in Europe, that have a goods and services type tax and how that was somehow going to be the solution to the black economy. Professor Friedrich Schneider, a professor at Austria's Linz University, is reported in the May 1997 edition of The Economist as saying that he:
. . . calculates that the shadow economy may—
and he is talking about 1997—
account for more than one-fifth of GDP in Belgium, Italy and Spain.
Certainly Belgium and Italy have a goods and services tax, but think about what he says about Germany. He says:
Even in famously law-abiding Germany, perhaps one D-mark in seven goes unreported to the authorities.
That is, it is in the black economy. He also says Italy's shadow economy is around 25 per cent of GDP.
So much for goods and services type taxes being the panacea for dealing with the black economy.
Frankly, this is a joke. Today we saw Senator Kemp completely disregard comments from organisations like the Housing Industry Association of Australia—who I think have some reputation in relation to their public policy statements—who are saying that the GST will in fact increase the black economy in the home construction industry. I suggest that the Australian public—judging on the performance of this minister today—are much more likely to believe reputable organisations such as the Housing Industry Association of Australia on the question of what this GST is going to do to the black economy than they are this minister, Senator Kemp, or certainly the Treasurer, Mr Costello, who show a total disregard for the application of the laws of this parliament.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Cash Economy</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,1999-03-25,"—I rise on this matter of taxation and the questions that were asked in the Senate here today. I agree with my colleague Senator Ferguson that the Labor Party is obsessed with the GST and is avoiding the fact that we have put a total package before the Australian community—our new tax system. Why is the Labor Party avoiding everything else? Because it wants to avoid talking about the fact that people are going to get substantial income tax cuts—$13 billion of income tax cuts.
Why is the government doing this? The government is doing this because it identified—in fact I chaired a committee that looked at this last year and part of the year before—that one of the key impediments in the Australian economy for ordinary folk was that the marginal tax rates were too high. This applies to lots of people and lots of small businesses. Marginal tax rates were just too high and people would not do the overtime, they would not work at weekends and they 
 did not want to do the extra yards. Hence our proposal to reduce the marginal tax rates so that, with our new tax scales, 80 per cent of taxpayers will face a marginal tax rate of 30 cents in the dollar—a huge difference from the 43c and 34c which currently applies in those rates.
But again I return to the Labor Party. What has it been on about? The Labor Party is in favour of staying with the current mess of indirect taxes. The Labor Party is in favour of staying with the wholesale sales tax.
—Yes.
—Of course you are; that is quite right. As the budget documents make plain, the federal indirect tax take of the economy is coming down. Estimates prepared by Access Economics clearly show that the average for federal indirect taxes for the last 10 years has been 5.64 per cent, coming down from about 6½ per cent about 10 years ago. Access Economics have done projections of the economy for the next 10 years. Their estimate is that, with those existing tax rates, the federal income tax take of indirect taxes will drop to 4.8 per cent—so 5.64 per cent down to 4.8 per cent—which leaves a deficiency in dollar terms of over $5 billion. That $5 billion is one-third of the wholesale sales tax of about $15 billion. So the Labor Party, by implication, is in favour of increasing wholesale sales taxes by 30 per cent—by one-third. We all remember what happened in the 1993-94 budget when the Labor Party put up taxes—both excise and indirect taxes with the wholesale sales tax—and increased the tax take from the Australian community by 30 per cent over those Keating years.
We are in favour of tax reform which gives incentive to people to work, to save and to invest. The tax system we have proposed will favour exports. The tax system that we have proposed will favour all businesses. The tax system we have proposed will make costs lower for all business, but one I want to particularly single out is the transport industry. The Treasury estimate is that costs will go down by 6.7 per cent for all road transport.
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. We have been pretty patient with Senator Gibson, but the point 
 goes to relevance. The two questions that I moved that we take note of—Nos 4 and 6—relate to a goods and services tax and the black economy, not the other issues that Senator Gibson has been talking about. I think he has had fairly reasonable go but, in terms of relevance, I think he should be drawn to the issues of a GST and the black economy. They were the issues.
—Only questions four and six related to the black economy. Senator Gibson, I am sure that you can be relevant when you address those issues.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. They were part of questions about the application of GST, which is part of the government's ANTS package, a new tax system. That is why it is relevant. Just one final point about transport: the Australian Road Transport Forum, when appearing before our Senate committee a few weeks ago in Sydney, stressed that they expected road transport costs for heavy transport to go down by between 15 and 19 per cent.
With regard to evasion, we all know that there is a cash economy in this economy right now. What did the Labor Party do about that over the past 13 years? Yesterday, we had a visitor here in this parliament, Professor Cnossen, who is a world expert on VAT and GST. His estimate was that in fact the evasion in Europe is nowhere near the numbers that have been quoted by the Labor Party. He said, `Please use your commonsense. The VAT in Europe is about eight per cent of the economy, eight per cent of GDP. As it is effective and is growing, how can it possibly be that evasion is serious in Europe?' He is quite correct.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-03-25,"—To pick up on one of the points raised by Senator Gibson, we know that the economy is growing strongly—somewhere in the order of three to four per cent in recent years. Logically flowing from that, the take on wholesale sales tax has been increasing. It is not a declining or dead tax; it is working effectively as there is growth in the economy. Indeed, the latest figures show that as at December 1998 the increase in 
 revenue from the wholesale sales tax was something in the order of 9.1 per cent.
Having addressed that point, what do we know about the black economy in Australia? We know it is variously estimated at being around $15 billion, $18 billion, or indeed up to $20 billion. We know the tax take of a GST on a revenue flow of figures of that type would be something around $1.5 to $2 billion. We know that because various officials from the Australian Taxation Office have advised the Senate committee of that in recent weeks.
We also know that any government take from the GST on the black economy is at best speculative. The government has suggested somewhere between $1½ billion and $2 billion, but that is at best problematic. It may be higher, but in all probability it may be significantly lower. What do we know about current changes that are working their way through the Australian economy? We know that there is an orgy of privatisation going on—outsourcing and deregulation. We know that there is a shift in the employment base of this nation from direct employment to contractors and self-employed persons. We know that a whole lot of industry sectors are moving, or have moved, to contract employment and in particular, self-employment. Examples of those are the home building industry, construction and subconstruction, personal service industries, taxi driving, chauffeur hire, limousine driving and a range of professional employment practices—lawyers, accountants, consultants and architects, to name a few.
We know that in all of those industries the tax at the moment on labour is currently optional and increasingly regarded as more and more optional by a range of persons working within those industries. Indeed, Dr Silberberg, from the Housing Industry Association, told the Senate committee:
We attribute the incidence of the black economy in the building area to the so-called owner-builder sector, where there are less than scrupulous players who seek to circumvent particularly the requirements of state legislation, such as builder registration and compulsory home warranty, and who flirt with householders for householders to take out a building permit. That is not to say that there is not a segment of the population which genuinely is owner building. 

He went on to say:
It is going to be exceptionally difficult for anyone to avoid a GST on building materials. They are readily visible . . . Our contention is that there is a significant incentive for people to operate outside of the GST by having no GST on their own labour or labour services.
Another industry talks about incentives to avoid the GST. I refer here to the Australian Taxi Industry Association. During questioning from Senator Bartlett, Mr Gunning from that organisation talked about the nature of the taxi industry—how it is organised, how the remittance process has been put in place, how there are 70,000 people employed in driving taxis around Australia. He addressed the necessity to license each individual cab driver, not just the owner. He said:
We, obviously, as a national association, have worried about our standing in the community, essentially, partly because of the experience that you referred to earlier with tax compliance. We know that at least late last year some problems started to emerge in New Zealand in a way that was not expected by the authorities. To summarise it, some taxidrivers managed to position themselves so that they could opt out. So we have potentially a situation in New Zealand at the moment where customers are paying GST but definitionally that GST is not being past on to the tax office. We think that would be a fairly debilitating thing to happen in our industry, not the sort of image we would like to project and not the sort of image that really encourages the kind of professionalism we are looking for.
There you have the Taxi Industry Association—employing something in the order of 70,000 drivers around Australia—saying that they have been to New Zealand and their observations are that even if the GST is charged in that country, the taxidrivers are not remitting that on to the New Zealand government. So the submissions and the evidence specifically addressed the black economy.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,1999-03-25,"—This week the opposition really is becoming a cracked record. For the fourth day in a row we have heard them focusing questions on the GST. They have not laid one blow on the government or on the Assistant Treasurer in their attempts to do so. Today what have we heard them raise? The issue of the black or the cash economy. Again, by 
 focusing on the GST they are ignoring, as Senator Ferguson said, the fact that we are for total tax reform. We are introducing a new tax system, not just changing one tax.
Senator O'Brien quoted an Austrian professor regarding the extent of the cash economy in some European countries. Well, come in spinner! Certainly those countries have a GST as part of their tax system but they do not have a world's best practice tax system and they do not have a world's best practice GST as will be part of the new tax system that this government is introducing. We are introducing a world's best practice tax system. In particular, those European countries applied differential rates and exemptions to food items. That is, of course, what some people and groups in Australia—drawing succour from the Labor Party's opposition to tax reform—want to have as part of our tax system. They want food exempted from the GST.
I remind the Senate that only yesterday none other than Mr Carmody, the Australian Commissioner for Taxation, emphasised the folly of eliminating food from the GST—of zero rating food. Mr Carmody is an expert in tax collection. He is an expert in dealing with compliance and with tax avoidance. He said only yesterday that not having a GST on food would be an absolute disaster; indeed, that eliminating a GST on food would result in widespread tax avoidance. That is why the black economy remains significant in those European countries that Senator O'Brien talked about—because they have a different rate for food, and they have zero rating for other items of food. As I said, that will not be part of this government's new tax system. The GST component of our new tax system will include food as an essential part of the GST package. So let us have none of this nonsense of quoting what happens in European countries as far as the cash economy is concerned.
The significant part of the new tax system is that businesses with turnovers in excess of $50,000 per year will have to register to obtain refund of the goods and services tax on their inputs, on those goods that they use as part of the process of their business.
—What about New Zealand?
—Senator Sherry quoted New Zealand in his remarks earlier. The fact is that when New Zealand introduced what currently would rate as the world's best tax system as far as a GST is concerned, many more firms registered than was ever expected, Senator Sherry. That removed the activities of those firms from the cash economy and brought them into the legitimate economy and into the tax net.
—It did not eliminate it.
—This government has never claimed that the new tax system would eliminate the cash economy. What we have said is that it would make substantial inroads into the cash economy. And that is exactly what it will do—it will bring into the legitimate economy those businesses that are currently in the cash economy, because they will have to register. Even those few business operators that choose to remain outside the legitimate economy will be paying tax on their consumption. When they earn dollars, when they earn their income, when they consume, they will be paying tax on that consumption which they are currently avoiding. That is a second area where the cash economy will be eliminated. Those opposite ignore that as well. So there are two areas: firstly, those businesses that will be drawn into the legitimate economy that are currently in the cash economy and, secondly, even those that stay outside the legitimate economy will be taxed on their consumption.
The government has taken many initiatives already to deal with those who cheat on taxation. Apart from the overall package of tax reform, further initiatives against tax cheats are an important part of the reform process. An anti-avoidance measure will be introduced to apply pending the introduction of the entity tax regime. We will be modernising and broadening the general anti-avoidance measures to deal with existing and emerging risks, and reviewing specific anti-avoidance provisions. So there will be specific tax avoidance measures as part of this new tax system.
—Order! The time for the debate has expired.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Cash Economy</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-03-25,"—The opposition will not be opposing this amendment or the substantive motion behind it when they come on for voting in due course. I just want to place on the record a few comments about the process that has occurred to date. This morning the motion was discussed at length for about an hour and a half, and a range of problems were identified by senators Faulkner and Ray, among others. Consequently, the government withdrew the substantive motion for discussion, and the government's motion is now before us. 
It is normal practice for notices of motion creating Senate committees to be circulated for many days beforehand for there to be discussion amongst the parties—and, indeed, often discussion at the relevant Senate committee—to identify the importance, if any, of the suggested draft, to discuss likely consequences and to pick up amendments from other interested parties. That has not, that I am aware of, occurred in this case, and we ask ourselves why, because the issues behind the Select Committee on Information Technology are not unimportant matters. There has been a lot of discussion in the press lately relating to Internet pornography and the effect of this on children and families. We in the Labor Party regard those as serious issues for discussion and review. Hopefully, some policy guidance will come out of the committee as it addresses those matters in due course.
We think they are worthwhile subjects for discussion in isolation, and we are somewhat concerned that somehow a nexus has been created with other bills and legislation in this place. Not three weeks ago there was a lengthy debate in this chamber when the government was heavily critical of ALP senators' alleged deliberate delays and alleged obstructionism in the processes of review in the Senate committee on the Telstra bills. They said it was an absolute matter of urgency, that we were holding up the program, and delaying for the sake of delay. And yet, in respect of the Telstra bills dealing with a company worth somewhere between $50 billion and $100 billion—depending on how much is privatised, if any—the speeches on the second reading concluded on Monday evening and there has been no further development of the committee stage.
I think it is likely that the committee stage will take in the order of four to seven hours, but the government for its own reasons has chosen not to bring on the Telstra bills. And we squarely ask the question: what is the connection, what is the relationship, what is the nexus between this Select Committee on Information Technologies and the passage of the Telstra bills? It seems to the opposition that the Telstra bills are being sullied by 
 trade-offs in other areas; that a certain amount of sleaze is starting to develop.
We say that the Telstra bills are important matters. They address matters of national significance and there is a range of issues that need to be resolved quickly. We have been ready all of this week to discuss the worth or otherwise of the government's proposals on the Telstra bills; yet we see that somehow or other they are becoming secondary and being involved in trade-offs or giveaways or concessions made concerning the appointment or creation of this Select Committee on Information Technologies.
As I said at the outset, the terms of reference of the Select Committee on Information Technologies are worthwhile matters. We do not have any problem with going through reviews of bills that address those matters; we think there is serious difference of opinion in the community on the matters raised in those terms of reference, and we are happy to participate in those debates. But we see them as separate matters, not related to the passage of the Telstra bills, and we are concerned that the Telstra bills are being delayed and that a degree of sleaze or sulliedness or dirtiness—however you describe it—is starting to enter into the government and its deliberations on these matters. So it is only proper to express our concerns and to put those on the record.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Information Technologies Committee</title>,Committees,25,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I rise also to make comment on this very interesting proposition before the Senate. As you have heard, Labor intends to support the amendment and the proposition. We do so on the basis that, as my senatorial colleagues have stated, the issue of information technology is one that is quite central to a whole range of social, economic and indeed personal considerations of Australian citizens. However, like my colleagues, I am gravely concerned that this issue has been brought forward at a time that actually compromises the stated intent of this committee. We are in the midst of a Telstra debate that has now being delayed. Surprisingly, the reference of this committee has cropped up at quite a critical time.
The previous expansion of the environment, recreation, communications and the arts Senate committee to the environment, communications, information technology and the arts committee reflected a change in the way that the government chose to manage their portfolio structures following the last election and the formation of the new parliament. There is certainly plenty of scope within the new ECITA committee to explore the critical issues that the Senate finds now forming part of the terms of reference of this select committee. My colleagues have previously traversed at some length the plethora of quite inordinate discrepancies in this proposition facing the Senate this morning which led to its adjournment and its subsequent revisiting this afternoon.
I would like to turn briefly to the issue that appears to be at the core of the provocation of the motion from the government—and that is the current issue relating to Internet content. We have seen over the last week or so a range of comments from the minister and from interested parties in relation to the management of Internet content, particularly with respect to pornography and the ability of citizens to protect themselves from material that they consider offensive to themselves. Senator Alston's announcement last Friday—that it was the government's intent to regulate this issue and take forward some of the concepts that had been developed by an industry code of practice proposal into a more formal legislative process—caught the sector by surprise. The fact that Minister Alston did this, having followed a process of what the industry presumed to be sincere consultation in preparation for a workable and realistic framework to take on the very difficult challenge of providing security and protection for Australian citizens with respect to offensive material on the Internet, was quite devastating for the parties involved. It became very clear that the manoeuvre that Senator Alston engaged himself in on Friday had motivations outside the process that he was locked into at that time.
I believe that this shows the Australian community two things. First of all—and I look forward to the minister's assurances 
 otherwise—it has perhaps compromised what was a number of years work, in fact dating back to 1995, in preparation of an industry code of practice, an Internet code of practice, that put forward the best and most achievable framework in which Australians could move forward with some confidence of protection from offensive material. I believe that if this has been put at risk by the minister's action he must in some way retrieve that position to allow those negotiations and that progress to proceed. He must do this without further tainting the process by allowing the reference to this committee to undermine the progress that has been made in those areas.
The other issue is one of substance of the minister's proposals. I do not believe this is the appropriate time to engage in debate about the substance of the proposals. Suffice it to say that they were certainly outside of what is considered—very broadly within the community—as realistic and achievable outcomes. It is no surprise that this specific issue arises under point (c) of the amendment. The part of the terms of reference referring to this issue is:
(c)	 examine the Government's decision to establish a regulatory framework relating to illegal or offensive material published and transmitted through online services such as the Internet;
It is my hope that the Select Committee on Information Technologies has ample and broad opportunity to explore this issue at some length, that all of the interested parties have the opportunity to express their views and that the parliament emerges from that process far better informed to make sensible decisions about how best to approach this issue on behalf of the Australian community.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Information Technologies Committee</title>,Committees,25,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-25,"—I thank other senators who have contributed to this debate. Clearly the opposition senators would be expected to criticise the government on this matter and try and draw a connection between this and the Telstra debate. But there were a number of key issues that were raised by opposition senators. Senator Faulkner and some others have raised the problem, 
 perceived in their minds, of the committee being created without a specific reference. In the intervening period since this debate was adjourned we have sought, with the cooperation of all honourable senators, to see those references placed by way of the amendment which I have just moved by leave.
I might just say, even though I am probably defending the motion in its original form, that the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies is a committee that was formed originally back in 1991 and re-formed in 1997. In that respect it is not that different from other select committees that have been reappointed since the new parliament has commenced. Indeed, only a few Senate sitting days ago we re-established the Select Committee on the Socio-Economic Consequences of the National Competition Policy. No-one from this side got up and said, `This is some sort of conspiracy between the left of Australian politics'—that it is Labor and the Greens desperately getting together to create some international conspiracy to bring down competition as we know it.
—Capitalists. Don't just stick to competition.
—And indeed, Senator Carr, that it was some sort of conspiracy that was linked to the Telstra debate. I am not a conspiracy theorist. I have lived on this planet for only a short time. My view—having been out of government, in government, in business and having various experiences—is that, if you have got the choice between a conspiracy and a stuff-up in parliament, in government, in opposition or in business, stuff-ups are usually the way of human endeavour in many areas. When we start with good intentions and we achieve those good outcomes it is usually the result of a bit of good luck along the way.
So I would not dare suggest that Senator Margetts's motion to establish a select committee was part of some left-wing conspiracy to undo the Telstra debate. It is very unkind of senators opposite to suggest it about the establishment of a select committee on an area of the Australian economy—and indeed the world economy—that is so dynamic and so critical to our future. I think 
 the latest figures showed it was a $69 billion industry and there are something like 7,500 companies in IT—probably rising at the rate of 10 or even 50 a day. It is a massively dynamic industry.
It was probably not sensible to try and tie down the references that such an important select committee should be able to receive. What you should do is allow for some flexibility. The amendment that I have moved and the original motion allow flexibility for issues such as convergence and such as Senator Bob Brown made in relation to access to equity. I note that in terms of equity of access to things like the Internet—
—Equity: that is a share market concept.
—I mean equity in terms of being fair to all of our citizens, ensuring that all of our citizens across the country, regardless of their income or their means or their place in society, have access to the benefits of the information revolution—which is probably the biggest revolution which has affected the citizens of this globe. This government can show that through the tax reform process the cost of the hardware required to get onto the Internet, for example, will be massively reduced. The cost of PCs, computers, peripherals, modems and all of the other hardware that you need to have easy access to the Internet will be significantly reduced by a new tax system.
Labor, to their ultimate detriment, are supporting an old tax system that puts a 22 per cent tax on computers. On the smallest computer that a young person in lower to middle income suburbs in Australia would need to go out and buy to get access to the Internet, Labor say, `No, you can pay a 22 per cent tax before you start.' We are saying, `Let's make sure that that tax is lowered to a simple, once-off, single 10 per cent GST which, if you are a small business, will be rebated.'
Similarly, with the Telstra debate—which the opposition have brought into this debate—the opposition are saying to the government, `No, we don't want you to spend $700 million on improving rural telecommunications infrastructure'—which will massively 
 increase the number of people in Australia who can get access to the Internet—through the proceeds of the sale of the balance of Telstra. They are saying, `No, you can't have that.'
In terms of access to equity, I agree with my colleague on the other side Senator Bob Brown that these are important issues. The government takes them very seriously—indeed, it is making a bigger commitment to them than any government in the history of our great nation. Senator Bob Brown and some senators in the opposition suggested that the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts—a committee that I served on for some years—should do it. I found Senator Brown's argument a little unconvincing in that, if you were to load all of these matters on to that standing committee—a committee that deals with the environment, which is another crucial area of public policy and an area that this government has made an incredible commitment to in terms of the quality of policy and the money we are spending on it through the Natural Heritage Trust Fund—it would be to the detriment of good public policy in the environment area. It is important that the work of that committee in the environment area not be frozen out or squeezed out by this massive load that we hope will involve consideration of public policy and information technology.
There are a couple of other matters that I wish to discuss here, one of them raised by Senator Faulkner. He quite correctly said that the opposition had identified that there was no report date for this committee. We sought to correct that by negotiating with senators from the opposition who were interested in this matter to find a mechanism to have a reporting date. There is also the fact that the motion setting up the select committee did not include any specific references, and particularly did not include the matter of wrapping up the report that the opposition had generated in the previous parliament. The lack of a reporting date was clearly an oversight. I should have looked more closely at that. We thank the opposition for raising it. We fixed it as quickly as we could. The other matter 
 that Senator Faulkner raised in his speech which was, I thought, being a bit naughty—
—Not Senator Faulkner!
—It is not like Senator Faulkner to be a bit naughty; he is usually extremely naughty. He suggested that all of the select committees in this parliament had come as initiatives of the Greens or the Democrats, anybody except Labor. The facts, indeed the Hansard , one of the most accurate recordings—probably not of the facts but certainly of the words of senators—shows that Senator Faulkner, as recently as 24 November, was claiming credit for the idea of having a Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System. Ultimately, another party moved that—
—We did not move it.
—No, you did not move it, but it was Senator Faulkner's initiative. I do not think Senator Faulkner should do himself out of the praise for the historic importance that should be placed on the formation of that important select committee. It was his idea; it was the opposition's idea. He says, `We suggested originally that this should be conducted by a Senate select committee.' I do not think Senator Faulkner should back away from this. Maybe it was not his idea, but I think he should be proud of the fact that it came from the Australian Labor Party. It is one of the few ideas the Labor Party has had since the election—even before the election. It was a good idea and he convinced other honourable senators to support the idea. I do not think he should say it was someone else's idea. Clearly, when Senator Margetts's committee was set up, we were happy to support it. I know that Senator John Quirke was. He is the chairman of that and he tells me that he has already held two meetings and is getting on with the jobs of that committee.
In conclusion, Senator Mark Bishop, my colleague from Western Australia on the other side of the chamber, talked a few moments ago about the second reading stage of Telstra being delayed. I have a page here, generated by the statistics section of the Senate Table Office, that shows that in the last half a dozen 
 years at least a dozen bills have had their passage delayed towards the end of the second reading stage. In fact, this very week is probably a very good example. The first bill to be debated in this place relating to a new tax system, the fringe benefits reporting bill, has been concluded at the end of the second reading stage because the opposition wants to pursue some issues relating to that bill. The government would have preferred to have proceeded and have that bill pass through all stages but, because one or two members in the opposition wanted to discuss some issues relating to that bill, we agreed to halt it at the end of the second reading stage and hold those discussions.
There are a range of other bills that the opposition, when they were in government, pulled—to use the vernacular—towards the end of the second reading stage or at the second reading stage when it suited them. The government has made it quite clear that we are having discussions with any senators who retain an open mind in relation to any of the Telstra bills, with a view to successfully concluding their passage at the second reading stage and through the committee stages, as we are doing with the opposition in relation to a new tax system. I do not hear the opposition saying that we are being slack, or tricky, or sleazy, to quote Senator Bishop, when we pull a bill when the opposition wants us to pull it. If the government decides to pull the three Telstra sale bills, in their different guises, after 37 weeks of consideration in Senate committees—that must be some sort of a record; I will have to do some more research for the fourth edition of the Road Block newsletter, which will be going to press later this evening—and some 70 hours plus of debate in this chamber, it is somewhat cute for the opposition to say, `How dare you delay this legislation.' We have had more repetitive speeches on the Telstra sale bills than we did, I would suggest, even on the native title bills—which you endured, Madam Deputy President. The government appreciates the constructive contributions made to the debate about this select committee. I look forward to this select committee doing some good work in this crucial area of the Australian and world economy.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Information Technologies Committee</title>,Committees,25,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-03-25,"—by leave—I apologise for my late arrival to the chamber, but I think this new amendment cannot go unremarked upon. This morning I spoke in strong support of the re-establishment of the Select Committee on Information Technologies. I did so, on behalf of my party, on the understanding that we would be re-establishing the terms of reference that operated for the last Senate select committee on this matter. Not only that, one of the strongest reasons put forward in this chamber—not just by the Democrats but by others, including Senator Harradine—was that there was an outstanding report, a report that is currently before the chair, in that we have the chairperson's draft of a report that needs to be finalised and acted upon. So those were the grounds and there was also the fact that we support very strongly and believe that a committee that looks specifically at IT related matters in their own right is warranted and appropriate.
This morning I mentioned the broad range of areas and issues that we would like to see that committee examine. In fact I mooted the idea of an amendment very similar to the one before us and I was under the impression that the minister was drafting an amendment. The last informal looking amendment I saw drafted took into account the concerns of those in the chamber who supported the select committee and who sought to replicate the old terms of reference. However, I have just walked into the chamber and seen a very new set of terms of reference—granted that three out of four ain't bad. Three out of four essentially do what it was intended the committee would do; that is, monitor the personal, social and economic impacts of continuing technological change, look at outstanding reports and, lastly, give the committee the purview to look into related IT matters. I now refer to term of reference (c):
examine the Government's decision to establish a regulatory framework relating to illegal or offensive material published and transmitted through online services such as the Internet;
This seems to be a new one. It was certainly not part of the discussions this morning. In 
 fact I thought the government were suggesting this morning that there was not necessarily an inquiry mooted, that they had a particular inquiry in mind when they were seeking the re-establishment or the continuation of this committee.
This morning people talked a lot about process and the fact that the process was deemed inadequate—that we were dealing with the establishment of a select committee without appropriate terms of reference before us. The Democrats echoed those concerns. We thought those concerns would be resolved swiftly through the drafting of an amendment that sought to maintain the terms of reference that were previously in place. So we are rather concerned and pretty angry that the new terms of reference include what is essentially a new inquiry, an inquiry that—as far as I am concerned—has not been discussed with any players that I am aware of in relation to this committee.
It is not that I am suggesting that (c) is inappropriate because we should not be looking into regulatory frameworks that look at illegal or offensive materials on the net. I suggest that, if you do look into the history of not only this committee but also its precursor—the community standards committee—you will find that some of this work has been done. I am not going to draw to the Senate's attention today the conclusions or recommendations that have arisen out of various inquiries that touch on online services but they are there if you want to have a look—the difficulties in relation to regulation, the need for regulation in some circumstances and the types of material that are on the net.
I am not suggesting this is not an important issue—because it is. But why can't this issue be put up as the first inquiry once this committee is re-established and has time to meet and then determine its legislative or reference or policy priorities? In my mind this is not a priority. I suspect it is a priority for government, and I suspect I know the reasons why it is a priority for government. And before anyone suggests that I am a conspiracy theorist, this morning I put on record very clearly some of the issues we should be examining  in  relation  to  information 
 technology. I talked about e-commerce. I talked about some of the issues to which Senator Campbell has just referred in the Senate.
Access, equity, justice, use of the Internet, intellectual property laws, the issue of vilification and defamation—I do not see those in this motion, and they relate very closely to the idea of a regulatory framework. Maybe we should be expanding this, given that it sounds very much like the first inquiry for this committee. Maybe we should be talking about not just the illegal or offensive stuff but also about the examination of stuff that may be deemed to be vilification and the impact on our intellectual property laws. I know why it is not in there. I know why it is not deemed a priority by the mover of this motion or the government.
So either we put a list of preferred or prioritised inquiries that this committee will look at over the next months, or year, or whatever the time line may be, and that includes a whole range of proposals—proposals that I suspect all parties in this chamber should be given a say in—or else we go with what I thought was the original intention of this morning's motion. That was to re-establish this committee with the express intention of finishing a report that is currently before the chair and looking at the terms of reference that are currently in operation, allowing the committee to decide what its next area of priority or research or inquiry may be. It was not to present the Senate with amended, rather dodgy looking terms of reference that have clearly decided the first reference for this committee, the first area of inquiry and one that is obviously deemed a priority for whatever reason by this government.
The Democrats started from a position of very strong support this morning—probably more so than just about anyone else in this chamber, given that we have fought so long and so hard to have some kind of committee reference on technology issues—because we were instrumental in August 1997 in drafting the terms of reference that operated under the last committee, albeit with amendment and 
 compromise—and that is appropriate; the will of the chamber is something we respect.
As I said this morning, we have been very keen to get a broad range of IT and IT related issues onto the agenda—not just community standards in relation to IT and the media in general. That is what this committee seemed to examine in the last parliament. It defined IT as the `media', which I thought was an extraordinary definition. Nevertheless, it was a definition supported by Labor, Liberal and Independents so I went with the will of the committee on that one even though I felt that that committee looked into issues better examined by, say, a legal and constitutional affairs type committee. Especially in relation to privacy I felt that duplication was taking place.
—Why didn't you turn up to any of the hearings last year?
—Senator Calvert knows that my views are on the record in relation to the committee. Senator Calvert also knows that the committee meetings to which he is referring were on at the same time as the Constitutional Convention. I am not suggesting that the chair or any other member is not a hard working member of the committee. I certainly paid tribute to Senator Jeannie Ferris as chair this morning because she is hard working, as Senator Harradine pointed out. That is not the issue. People's level of commitment is not the issue here; the issue is whether we establish a committee to look into information technology issues per se—not use it for any other purpose or pretend we are looking into IT issues but have a very different agenda in mind.
The other issue we are debating right now is the issue of process. It is something that was touched on this morning, with good reason. Again, I thought we had reached a compromise, that we had found a solution to this problem. But I walked into this chamber to see not the amendment I anticipated, not the amendment I expected, not the amendment I thought came out of this morning's debate and discussion but something that is amended—and I believe radically amended—to include words like `illegal or offensive material published and transmitted through 
 online services such as the Internet'. This could very well serve as a reference for this committee during its lifetime, but that is something, I thought, for the Senate or the committee members to decide at a later stage.
I put on record my concerns about this process and my grave disappointment because I can just see what is going to happen to this committee and why it has been established in the first place. I hope that at some point in the future this Senate starts to take issues related to information technology seriously—not just those little sensationalist, sexy issues that people seem to focus on, but the real broader economic, social, personal and democratic issues related to IT in our society. This committee has the potential to do that—that was the exciting thing about the re-establishment of this committee and the discussion this morning. We were going to go a bit broader for a change, not just back over the work we had done—although some of it is worthy of re-evaluation or re-examination; not keep harping on the same issues but actually expand the work of the committee and expand our minds and start looking at IT and IT related issues in a little more detail.
That is what parliaments across the world are doing. That is what the United States Congress is doing and that is what we should be doing. We are far behind. We are lagging behind on a lot of IT issues. That is not necessarily a reflection on individuals in this place; it is just a reflection on our parliament, perhaps our priorities, perhaps our opportunities, perhaps our level of knowledge on these issues. Let's start getting excited about these issues; let's start exploring them in a broad way—not just looking at the same tired old issues that get the newspaper headlines.
If it is the will of the committee and the will of the chamber to pursue (c) of this amendment in relation to regulatory frameworks and particular material on the net, so be it, but I think we will have lost another opportunity to have broad ranging terms of reference that would allow us to look at other issues. I reiterate, I am not suggesting that that is not an important issue in itself. The Democrats have produced a lot of work and done a lot of research on this. Anyone who 
 has read our reports and contributions to the work of this select committee and its precursor will know how much work we have done in these areas, how much written research, how many meetings we have had and how many opportunities we have had to put on record the complexities of these issues. The difficulty associated with labelling people and their views in relation to access to materials on the net or anywhere for that matter was touched on this morning by Senator Ray. There are civil libertarian considerations, issues of censorship and other issues of regulation—whether we need codes of conduct that are enforceable, whether we need regulation. More importantly—and this is something the Democrats have put on record many times before—if you want regulation, how do you do it? It is so complex. People know how difficult the Internet is to regulate.
—I raise a point of order. The honourable senator sought leave to speak briefly. It has now been 12 minutes.
—I sought leave to speak; I did not qualify that by suggesting I would be brief. Clearly, Senator Campbell wishes it were so. It is amazing: a week is a long time in politics, but a couple of hours has been a long time today. This morning when the Democrats were onside there was no problem with Senator Stott Despoja or anyone else speaking, but as soon as we have a conflict of interest—that's it. You do not need to gag me, Senator Campbell, because I will go off to my Senate committee on the GST and examine that because—
—Everyone else could come and discuss the motion—you had to grandstand.
—I have addressed these terms of reference. Not only that, I am aware of terms of reference dating back not only to August 1997 but to before that. It is perfectly legitimate for me to refer to those terms of reference. I like the way we are pretending now that there is some kind of technical or mechanical motion of the Senate when we know full well not only the motivations behind this but what—
—We have been discussing this for four hours outside the chamber and you want to come in here and discuss it.
—Excuse me, who with?
—Everybody who was interested.
—Oh, come off it. Did you come to us?
—Yes.
—No, you did not.
—Order! Senator Campbell, would you please desist from interjecting.
—Again I will take that interjection because I want to put on record that I have not been contacted by Senator Ian Campbell—
—So we've got to call you?
—I have not had any contact with Senator Ian Campbell since this morning's debate. Given that Senator Campbell is moving this motion, it would have been appropriate and courteous for Senator Campbell to raise it with the other interested parties in the Senate. I wonder why he did not.
If he suggests that it was last minute and the process was rushed, I accept that. I accept how this place works. But it is interesting, given that I drafted the first amendment today in relation to the terms of reference for this debate, and then said, `Okay, I won't move that because the amendment that Senator Campbell showed me in passing—flashed in front of me—seems adequate.' It was my understanding that that amendment would be moved this afternoon.
I did not move to adjourn this debate this morning. I would have been happy to proceed with the debate. I would have been happy to support an amendment along the lines that Senator Ian Campbell moved or even the amendment that I was suggesting this morning. I was happy to resolve that issue. But to suggest now that I should have been knocking on Senator Ian Campbell's door to find out 
 whether the wording of his amendment had changed is outrageous.
No wonder the Democrats are angry about this. As I suggested before, when we were onside this morning we were not receiving this wrath and this level of interjection. We have every good cause to complain. The process that has been pursued this afternoon is offensive. An amendment was suggested this morning but what we have been presented with is an addition that is quite meaningful and complex.
We are suggesting essentially a new and first reference for this committee, a reference that will deal specifically with illegal and offensive material on the net. I have every reason to speak to that. I have every reason, on behalf of my party and my whip in particular, to complain about the fact that we were not consulted.
I would like very much to support this motion if (c) were deleted. I anticipate that that will be moved. I record again our concern. Perhaps Senator Ian Campbell, who has just compounded my anger, would like to stand up and explain why he cannot move this motion without section (c). Since he is very good at changing amendments at the drop of a hat, perhaps he could suggest an amendment to this motion so that (c) is deleted from the amendment and we can proceed as anticipated this morning.
—I seek leave, if that is required, to make a brief contribution.
Leave not granted.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order No. 90, which says that the mover of a motion or a senator who has spoken in the debate may not move an amendment. I would ask you to look at that, particularly in view of the fact that I was flagging an amendment to that amendment and, due to Senator Ian Campbell's refusal to give me the opportunity to speak, will be denied that opportunity.
—It is the chair's belief, on advice from the clerks, that Senator Ian Campbell sought leave, the matter was debated and that was it.
—I would like to raise another point of order. Senator Ian Campbell sought leave to move an amendment which circumvented a restriction in the standing orders. I sought leave to move an amendment to that amendment, but was refused leave by Senator Ian Campbell. He was given leave by me, but I was not given leave by him.
—That is one of the forms of the Senate. If you were not given leave, you were not given leave.
—Do you think that is fair? Do you think I should give leave to Senator Ian Campbell further in the day when he seeks leave of me?
—Senator Brown, it is not a question of being fair; there is no point of order.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-03-25,"—The opposition will not be opposing this amendment or the substantive motion behind it when they come on for voting in due course. I just want to place on the record a few comments about the process that has occurred to date. This morning the motion was discussed at length for about an hour and a half, and a range of problems were identified by senators Faulkner and Ray, among others. Consequently, the government withdrew the substantive motion for discussion, and the government's motion is now before us. 
It is normal practice for notices of motion creating Senate committees to be circulated for many days beforehand for there to be discussion amongst the parties—and, indeed, often discussion at the relevant Senate committee—to identify the importance, if any, of the suggested draft, to discuss likely consequences and to pick up amendments from other interested parties. That has not, that I am aware of, occurred in this case, and we ask ourselves why, because the issues behind the Select Committee on Information Technology are not unimportant matters. There has been a lot of discussion in the press lately relating to Internet pornography and the effect of this on children and families. We in the Labor Party regard those as serious issues for discussion and review. Hopefully, some policy guidance will come out of the committee as it addresses those matters in due course.
We think they are worthwhile subjects for discussion in isolation, and we are somewhat concerned that somehow a nexus has been created with other bills and legislation in this place. Not three weeks ago there was a lengthy debate in this chamber when the government was heavily critical of ALP senators' alleged deliberate delays and alleged obstructionism in the processes of review in the Senate committee on the Telstra bills. They said it was an absolute matter of urgency, that we were holding up the program, and delaying for the sake of delay. And yet, in respect of the Telstra bills dealing with a company worth somewhere between $50 billion and $100 billion—depending on how much is privatised, if any—the speeches on the second reading concluded on Monday evening and there has been no further development of the committee stage.
I think it is likely that the committee stage will take in the order of four to seven hours, but the government for its own reasons has chosen not to bring on the Telstra bills. And we squarely ask the question: what is the connection, what is the relationship, what is the nexus between this Select Committee on Information Technologies and the passage of the Telstra bills? It seems to the opposition that the Telstra bills are being sullied by 
 trade-offs in other areas; that a certain amount of sleaze is starting to develop.
We say that the Telstra bills are important matters. They address matters of national significance and there is a range of issues that need to be resolved quickly. We have been ready all of this week to discuss the worth or otherwise of the government's proposals on the Telstra bills; yet we see that somehow or other they are becoming secondary and being involved in trade-offs or giveaways or concessions made concerning the appointment or creation of this Select Committee on Information Technologies.
As I said at the outset, the terms of reference of the Select Committee on Information Technologies are worthwhile matters. We do not have any problem with going through reviews of bills that address those matters; we think there is serious difference of opinion in the community on the matters raised in those terms of reference, and we are happy to participate in those debates. But we see them as separate matters, not related to the passage of the Telstra bills, and we are concerned that the Telstra bills are being delayed and that a degree of sleaze or sulliedness or dirtiness—however you describe it—is starting to enter into the government and its deliberations on these matters. So it is only proper to express our concerns and to put those on the record.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Appointment</title>,Committees,25,2
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I rise also to make comment on this very interesting proposition before the Senate. As you have heard, Labor intends to support the amendment and the proposition. We do so on the basis that, as my senatorial colleagues have stated, the issue of information technology is one that is quite central to a whole range of social, economic and indeed personal considerations of Australian citizens. However, like my colleagues, I am gravely concerned that this issue has been brought forward at a time that actually compromises the stated intent of this committee. We are in the midst of a Telstra debate that has now being delayed. Surprisingly, the reference of this committee has cropped up at quite a critical time.
The previous expansion of the environment, recreation, communications and the arts Senate committee to the environment, communications, information technology and the arts committee reflected a change in the way that the government chose to manage their portfolio structures following the last election and the formation of the new parliament. There is certainly plenty of scope within the new ECITA committee to explore the critical issues that the Senate finds now forming part of the terms of reference of this select committee. My colleagues have previously traversed at some length the plethora of quite inordinate discrepancies in this proposition facing the Senate this morning which led to its adjournment and its subsequent revisiting this afternoon.
I would like to turn briefly to the issue that appears to be at the core of the provocation of the motion from the government—and that is the current issue relating to Internet content. We have seen over the last week or so a range of comments from the minister and from interested parties in relation to the management of Internet content, particularly with respect to pornography and the ability of citizens to protect themselves from material that they consider offensive to themselves. Senator Alston's announcement last Friday—that it was the government's intent to regulate this issue and take forward some of the concepts that had been developed by an industry code of practice proposal into a more formal legislative process—caught the sector by surprise. The fact that Minister Alston did this, having followed a process of what the industry presumed to be sincere consultation in preparation for a workable and realistic framework to take on the very difficult challenge of providing security and protection for Australian citizens with respect to offensive material on the Internet, was quite devastating for the parties involved. It became very clear that the manoeuvre that Senator Alston engaged himself in on Friday had motivations outside the process that he was locked into at that time.
I believe that this shows the Australian community two things. First of all—and I look forward to the minister's assurances 
 otherwise—it has perhaps compromised what was a number of years work, in fact dating back to 1995, in preparation of an industry code of practice, an Internet code of practice, that put forward the best and most achievable framework in which Australians could move forward with some confidence of protection from offensive material. I believe that if this has been put at risk by the minister's action he must in some way retrieve that position to allow those negotiations and that progress to proceed. He must do this without further tainting the process by allowing the reference to this committee to undermine the progress that has been made in those areas.
The other issue is one of substance of the minister's proposals. I do not believe this is the appropriate time to engage in debate about the substance of the proposals. Suffice it to say that they were certainly outside of what is considered—very broadly within the community—as realistic and achievable outcomes. It is no surprise that this specific issue arises under point (c) of the amendment. The part of the terms of reference referring to this issue is:
(c)	 examine the Government's decision to establish a regulatory framework relating to illegal or offensive material published and transmitted through online services such as the Internet;
It is my hope that the Select Committee on Information Technologies has ample and broad opportunity to explore this issue at some length, that all of the interested parties have the opportunity to express their views and that the parliament emerges from that process far better informed to make sensible decisions about how best to approach this issue on behalf of the Australian community.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Appointment</title>,Committees,25,2
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-25,"—I thank other senators who have contributed to this debate. Clearly the opposition senators would be expected to criticise the government on this matter and try and draw a connection between this and the Telstra debate. But there were a number of key issues that were raised by opposition senators. Senator Faulkner and some others have raised the problem, 
 perceived in their minds, of the committee being created without a specific reference. In the intervening period since this debate was adjourned we have sought, with the cooperation of all honourable senators, to see those references placed by way of the amendment which I have just moved by leave.
I might just say, even though I am probably defending the motion in its original form, that the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies is a committee that was formed originally back in 1991 and re-formed in 1997. In that respect it is not that different from other select committees that have been reappointed since the new parliament has commenced. Indeed, only a few Senate sitting days ago we re-established the Select Committee on the Socio-Economic Consequences of the National Competition Policy. No-one from this side got up and said, `This is some sort of conspiracy between the left of Australian politics'—that it is Labor and the Greens desperately getting together to create some international conspiracy to bring down competition as we know it.
—Capitalists. Don't just stick to competition.
—And indeed, Senator Carr, that it was some sort of conspiracy that was linked to the Telstra debate. I am not a conspiracy theorist. I have lived on this planet for only a short time. My view—having been out of government, in government, in business and having various experiences—is that, if you have got the choice between a conspiracy and a stuff-up in parliament, in government, in opposition or in business, stuff-ups are usually the way of human endeavour in many areas. When we start with good intentions and we achieve those good outcomes it is usually the result of a bit of good luck along the way.
So I would not dare suggest that Senator Margetts's motion to establish a select committee was part of some left-wing conspiracy to undo the Telstra debate. It is very unkind of senators opposite to suggest it about the establishment of a select committee on an area of the Australian economy—and indeed the world economy—that is so dynamic and so critical to our future. I think 
 the latest figures showed it was a $69 billion industry and there are something like 7,500 companies in IT—probably rising at the rate of 10 or even 50 a day. It is a massively dynamic industry.
It was probably not sensible to try and tie down the references that such an important select committee should be able to receive. What you should do is allow for some flexibility. The amendment that I have moved and the original motion allow flexibility for issues such as convergence and such as Senator Bob Brown made in relation to access to equity. I note that in terms of equity of access to things like the Internet—
—Equity: that is a share market concept.
—I mean equity in terms of being fair to all of our citizens, ensuring that all of our citizens across the country, regardless of their income or their means or their place in society, have access to the benefits of the information revolution—which is probably the biggest revolution which has affected the citizens of this globe. This government can show that through the tax reform process the cost of the hardware required to get onto the Internet, for example, will be massively reduced. The cost of PCs, computers, peripherals, modems and all of the other hardware that you need to have easy access to the Internet will be significantly reduced by a new tax system.
Labor, to their ultimate detriment, are supporting an old tax system that puts a 22 per cent tax on computers. On the smallest computer that a young person in lower to middle income suburbs in Australia would need to go out and buy to get access to the Internet, Labor say, `No, you can pay a 22 per cent tax before you start.' We are saying, `Let's make sure that that tax is lowered to a simple, once-off, single 10 per cent GST which, if you are a small business, will be rebated.'
Similarly, with the Telstra debate—which the opposition have brought into this debate—the opposition are saying to the government, `No, we don't want you to spend $700 million on improving rural telecommunications infrastructure'—which will massively 
 increase the number of people in Australia who can get access to the Internet—through the proceeds of the sale of the balance of Telstra. They are saying, `No, you can't have that.'
In terms of access to equity, I agree with my colleague on the other side Senator Bob Brown that these are important issues. The government takes them very seriously—indeed, it is making a bigger commitment to them than any government in the history of our great nation. Senator Bob Brown and some senators in the opposition suggested that the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts—a committee that I served on for some years—should do it. I found Senator Brown's argument a little unconvincing in that, if you were to load all of these matters on to that standing committee—a committee that deals with the environment, which is another crucial area of public policy and an area that this government has made an incredible commitment to in terms of the quality of policy and the money we are spending on it through the Natural Heritage Trust Fund—it would be to the detriment of good public policy in the environment area. It is important that the work of that committee in the environment area not be frozen out or squeezed out by this massive load that we hope will involve consideration of public policy and information technology.
There are a couple of other matters that I wish to discuss here, one of them raised by Senator Faulkner. He quite correctly said that the opposition had identified that there was no report date for this committee. We sought to correct that by negotiating with senators from the opposition who were interested in this matter to find a mechanism to have a reporting date. There is also the fact that the motion setting up the select committee did not include any specific references, and particularly did not include the matter of wrapping up the report that the opposition had generated in the previous parliament. The lack of a reporting date was clearly an oversight. I should have looked more closely at that. We thank the opposition for raising it. We fixed it as quickly as we could. The other matter 
 that Senator Faulkner raised in his speech which was, I thought, being a bit naughty—
—Not Senator Faulkner!
—It is not like Senator Faulkner to be a bit naughty; he is usually extremely naughty. He suggested that all of the select committees in this parliament had come as initiatives of the Greens or the Democrats, anybody except Labor. The facts, indeed the Hansard , one of the most accurate recordings—probably not of the facts but certainly of the words of senators—shows that Senator Faulkner, as recently as 24 November, was claiming credit for the idea of having a Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System. Ultimately, another party moved that—
—We did not move it.
—No, you did not move it, but it was Senator Faulkner's initiative. I do not think Senator Faulkner should do himself out of the praise for the historic importance that should be placed on the formation of that important select committee. It was his idea; it was the opposition's idea. He says, `We suggested originally that this should be conducted by a Senate select committee.' I do not think Senator Faulkner should back away from this. Maybe it was not his idea, but I think he should be proud of the fact that it came from the Australian Labor Party. It is one of the few ideas the Labor Party has had since the election—even before the election. It was a good idea and he convinced other honourable senators to support the idea. I do not think he should say it was someone else's idea. Clearly, when Senator Margetts's committee was set up, we were happy to support it. I know that Senator John Quirke was. He is the chairman of that and he tells me that he has already held two meetings and is getting on with the jobs of that committee.
In conclusion, Senator Mark Bishop, my colleague from Western Australia on the other side of the chamber, talked a few moments ago about the second reading stage of Telstra being delayed. I have a page here, generated by the statistics section of the Senate Table Office, that shows that in the last half a dozen 
 years at least a dozen bills have had their passage delayed towards the end of the second reading stage. In fact, this very week is probably a very good example. The first bill to be debated in this place relating to a new tax system, the fringe benefits reporting bill, has been concluded at the end of the second reading stage because the opposition wants to pursue some issues relating to that bill. The government would have preferred to have proceeded and have that bill pass through all stages but, because one or two members in the opposition wanted to discuss some issues relating to that bill, we agreed to halt it at the end of the second reading stage and hold those discussions.
There are a range of other bills that the opposition, when they were in government, pulled—to use the vernacular—towards the end of the second reading stage or at the second reading stage when it suited them. The government has made it quite clear that we are having discussions with any senators who retain an open mind in relation to any of the Telstra bills, with a view to successfully concluding their passage at the second reading stage and through the committee stages, as we are doing with the opposition in relation to a new tax system. I do not hear the opposition saying that we are being slack, or tricky, or sleazy, to quote Senator Bishop, when we pull a bill when the opposition wants us to pull it. If the government decides to pull the three Telstra sale bills, in their different guises, after 37 weeks of consideration in Senate committees—that must be some sort of a record; I will have to do some more research for the fourth edition of the Road Block newsletter, which will be going to press later this evening—and some 70 hours plus of debate in this chamber, it is somewhat cute for the opposition to say, `How dare you delay this legislation.' We have had more repetitive speeches on the Telstra sale bills than we did, I would suggest, even on the native title bills—which you endured, Madam Deputy President. The government appreciates the constructive contributions made to the debate about this select committee. I look forward to this select committee doing some good work in this crucial area of the Australian and world economy.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Appointment</title>,Committees,25,2
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-03-25,"—by leave—I apologise for my late arrival to the chamber, but I think this new amendment cannot go unremarked upon. This morning I spoke in strong support of the re-establishment of the Select Committee on Information Technologies. I did so, on behalf of my party, on the understanding that we would be re-establishing the terms of reference that operated for the last Senate select committee on this matter. Not only that, one of the strongest reasons put forward in this chamber—not just by the Democrats but by others, including Senator Harradine—was that there was an outstanding report, a report that is currently before the chair, in that we have the chairperson's draft of a report that needs to be finalised and acted upon. So those were the grounds and there was also the fact that we support very strongly and believe that a committee that looks specifically at IT related matters in their own right is warranted and appropriate.
This morning I mentioned the broad range of areas and issues that we would like to see that committee examine. In fact I mooted the idea of an amendment very similar to the one before us and I was under the impression that the minister was drafting an amendment. The last informal looking amendment I saw drafted took into account the concerns of those in the chamber who supported the select committee and who sought to replicate the old terms of reference. However, I have just walked into the chamber and seen a very new set of terms of reference—granted that three out of four ain't bad. Three out of four essentially do what it was intended the committee would do; that is, monitor the personal, social and economic impacts of continuing technological change, look at outstanding reports and, lastly, give the committee the purview to look into related IT matters. I now refer to term of reference (c):
examine the Government's decision to establish a regulatory framework relating to illegal or offensive material published and transmitted through online services such as the Internet;
This seems to be a new one. It was certainly not part of the discussions this morning. In 
 fact I thought the government were suggesting this morning that there was not necessarily an inquiry mooted, that they had a particular inquiry in mind when they were seeking the re-establishment or the continuation of this committee.
This morning people talked a lot about process and the fact that the process was deemed inadequate—that we were dealing with the establishment of a select committee without appropriate terms of reference before us. The Democrats echoed those concerns. We thought those concerns would be resolved swiftly through the drafting of an amendment that sought to maintain the terms of reference that were previously in place. So we are rather concerned and pretty angry that the new terms of reference include what is essentially a new inquiry, an inquiry that—as far as I am concerned—has not been discussed with any players that I am aware of in relation to this committee.
It is not that I am suggesting that (c) is inappropriate because we should not be looking into regulatory frameworks that look at illegal or offensive materials on the net. I suggest that, if you do look into the history of not only this committee but also its precursor—the community standards committee—you will find that some of this work has been done. I am not going to draw to the Senate's attention today the conclusions or recommendations that have arisen out of various inquiries that touch on online services but they are there if you want to have a look—the difficulties in relation to regulation, the need for regulation in some circumstances and the types of material that are on the net.
I am not suggesting this is not an important issue—because it is. But why can't this issue be put up as the first inquiry once this committee is re-established and has time to meet and then determine its legislative or reference or policy priorities? In my mind this is not a priority. I suspect it is a priority for government, and I suspect I know the reasons why it is a priority for government. And before anyone suggests that I am a conspiracy theorist, this morning I put on record very clearly some of the issues we should be examining  in  relation  to  information 
 technology. I talked about e-commerce. I talked about some of the issues to which Senator Campbell has just referred in the Senate.
Access, equity, justice, use of the Internet, intellectual property laws, the issue of vilification and defamation—I do not see those in this motion, and they relate very closely to the idea of a regulatory framework. Maybe we should be expanding this, given that it sounds very much like the first inquiry for this committee. Maybe we should be talking about not just the illegal or offensive stuff but also about the examination of stuff that may be deemed to be vilification and the impact on our intellectual property laws. I know why it is not in there. I know why it is not deemed a priority by the mover of this motion or the government.
So either we put a list of preferred or prioritised inquiries that this committee will look at over the next months, or year, or whatever the time line may be, and that includes a whole range of proposals—proposals that I suspect all parties in this chamber should be given a say in—or else we go with what I thought was the original intention of this morning's motion. That was to re-establish this committee with the express intention of finishing a report that is currently before the chair and looking at the terms of reference that are currently in operation, allowing the committee to decide what its next area of priority or research or inquiry may be. It was not to present the Senate with amended, rather dodgy looking terms of reference that have clearly decided the first reference for this committee, the first area of inquiry and one that is obviously deemed a priority for whatever reason by this government.
The Democrats started from a position of very strong support this morning—probably more so than just about anyone else in this chamber, given that we have fought so long and so hard to have some kind of committee reference on technology issues—because we were instrumental in August 1997 in drafting the terms of reference that operated under the last committee, albeit with amendment and 
 compromise—and that is appropriate; the will of the chamber is something we respect.
As I said this morning, we have been very keen to get a broad range of IT and IT related issues onto the agenda—not just community standards in relation to IT and the media in general. That is what this committee seemed to examine in the last parliament. It defined IT as the `media', which I thought was an extraordinary definition. Nevertheless, it was a definition supported by Labor, Liberal and Independents so I went with the will of the committee on that one even though I felt that that committee looked into issues better examined by, say, a legal and constitutional affairs type committee. Especially in relation to privacy I felt that duplication was taking place.
—Why didn't you turn up to any of the hearings last year?
—Senator Calvert knows that my views are on the record in relation to the committee. Senator Calvert also knows that the committee meetings to which he is referring were on at the same time as the Constitutional Convention. I am not suggesting that the chair or any other member is not a hard working member of the committee. I certainly paid tribute to Senator Jeannie Ferris as chair this morning because she is hard working, as Senator Harradine pointed out. That is not the issue. People's level of commitment is not the issue here; the issue is whether we establish a committee to look into information technology issues per se—not use it for any other purpose or pretend we are looking into IT issues but have a very different agenda in mind.
The other issue we are debating right now is the issue of process. It is something that was touched on this morning, with good reason. Again, I thought we had reached a compromise, that we had found a solution to this problem. But I walked into this chamber to see not the amendment I anticipated, not the amendment I expected, not the amendment I thought came out of this morning's debate and discussion but something that is amended—and I believe radically amended—to include words like `illegal or offensive material published and transmitted through 
 online services such as the Internet'. This could very well serve as a reference for this committee during its lifetime, but that is something, I thought, for the Senate or the committee members to decide at a later stage.
I put on record my concerns about this process and my grave disappointment because I can just see what is going to happen to this committee and why it has been established in the first place. I hope that at some point in the future this Senate starts to take issues related to information technology seriously—not just those little sensationalist, sexy issues that people seem to focus on, but the real broader economic, social, personal and democratic issues related to IT in our society. This committee has the potential to do that—that was the exciting thing about the re-establishment of this committee and the discussion this morning. We were going to go a bit broader for a change, not just back over the work we had done—although some of it is worthy of re-evaluation or re-examination; not keep harping on the same issues but actually expand the work of the committee and expand our minds and start looking at IT and IT related issues in a little more detail.
That is what parliaments across the world are doing. That is what the United States Congress is doing and that is what we should be doing. We are far behind. We are lagging behind on a lot of IT issues. That is not necessarily a reflection on individuals in this place; it is just a reflection on our parliament, perhaps our priorities, perhaps our opportunities, perhaps our level of knowledge on these issues. Let's start getting excited about these issues; let's start exploring them in a broad way—not just looking at the same tired old issues that get the newspaper headlines.
If it is the will of the committee and the will of the chamber to pursue (c) of this amendment in relation to regulatory frameworks and particular material on the net, so be it, but I think we will have lost another opportunity to have broad ranging terms of reference that would allow us to look at other issues. I reiterate, I am not suggesting that that is not an important issue in itself. The Democrats have produced a lot of work and done a lot of research on this. Anyone who 
 has read our reports and contributions to the work of this select committee and its precursor will know how much work we have done in these areas, how much written research, how many meetings we have had and how many opportunities we have had to put on record the complexities of these issues. The difficulty associated with labelling people and their views in relation to access to materials on the net or anywhere for that matter was touched on this morning by Senator Ray. There are civil libertarian considerations, issues of censorship and other issues of regulation—whether we need codes of conduct that are enforceable, whether we need regulation. More importantly—and this is something the Democrats have put on record many times before—if you want regulation, how do you do it? It is so complex. People know how difficult the Internet is to regulate.
—I raise a point of order. The honourable senator sought leave to speak briefly. It has now been 12 minutes.
—I sought leave to speak; I did not qualify that by suggesting I would be brief. Clearly, Senator Campbell wishes it were so. It is amazing: a week is a long time in politics, but a couple of hours has been a long time today. This morning when the Democrats were onside there was no problem with Senator Stott Despoja or anyone else speaking, but as soon as we have a conflict of interest—that's it. You do not need to gag me, Senator Campbell, because I will go off to my Senate committee on the GST and examine that because—
—Everyone else could come and discuss the motion—you had to grandstand.
—I have addressed these terms of reference. Not only that, I am aware of terms of reference dating back not only to August 1997 but to before that. It is perfectly legitimate for me to refer to those terms of reference. I like the way we are pretending now that there is some kind of technical or mechanical motion of the Senate when we know full well not only the motivations behind this but what—
—We have been discussing this for four hours outside the chamber and you want to come in here and discuss it.
—Excuse me, who with?
—Everybody who was interested.
—Oh, come off it. Did you come to us?
—Yes.
—No, you did not.
—Order! Senator Campbell, would you please desist from interjecting.
—Again I will take that interjection because I want to put on record that I have not been contacted by Senator Ian Campbell—
—So we've got to call you?
—I have not had any contact with Senator Ian Campbell since this morning's debate. Given that Senator Campbell is moving this motion, it would have been appropriate and courteous for Senator Campbell to raise it with the other interested parties in the Senate. I wonder why he did not.
If he suggests that it was last minute and the process was rushed, I accept that. I accept how this place works. But it is interesting, given that I drafted the first amendment today in relation to the terms of reference for this debate, and then said, `Okay, I won't move that because the amendment that Senator Campbell showed me in passing—flashed in front of me—seems adequate.' It was my understanding that that amendment would be moved this afternoon.
I did not move to adjourn this debate this morning. I would have been happy to proceed with the debate. I would have been happy to support an amendment along the lines that Senator Ian Campbell moved or even the amendment that I was suggesting this morning. I was happy to resolve that issue. But to suggest now that I should have been knocking on Senator Ian Campbell's door to find out 
 whether the wording of his amendment had changed is outrageous.
No wonder the Democrats are angry about this. As I suggested before, when we were onside this morning we were not receiving this wrath and this level of interjection. We have every good cause to complain. The process that has been pursued this afternoon is offensive. An amendment was suggested this morning but what we have been presented with is an addition that is quite meaningful and complex.
We are suggesting essentially a new and first reference for this committee, a reference that will deal specifically with illegal and offensive material on the net. I have every reason to speak to that. I have every reason, on behalf of my party and my whip in particular, to complain about the fact that we were not consulted.
I would like very much to support this motion if (c) were deleted. I anticipate that that will be moved. I record again our concern. Perhaps Senator Ian Campbell, who has just compounded my anger, would like to stand up and explain why he cannot move this motion without section (c). Since he is very good at changing amendments at the drop of a hat, perhaps he could suggest an amendment to this motion so that (c) is deleted from the amendment and we can proceed as anticipated this morning.
—I seek leave, if that is required, to make a brief contribution.
Leave not granted.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order No. 90, which says that the mover of a motion or a senator who has spoken in the debate may not move an amendment. I would ask you to look at that, particularly in view of the fact that I was flagging an amendment to that amendment and, due to Senator Ian Campbell's refusal to give me the opportunity to speak, will be denied that opportunity.
—It is the chair's belief, on advice from the clerks, that Senator Ian Campbell sought leave, the matter was debated and that was it.
—I would like to raise another point of order. Senator Ian Campbell sought leave to move an amendment which circumvented a restriction in the standing orders. I sought leave to move an amendment to that amendment, but was refused leave by Senator Ian Campbell. He was given leave by me, but I was not given leave by him.
—That is one of the forms of the Senate. If you were not given leave, you were not given leave.
—Do you think that is fair? Do you think I should give leave to Senator Ian Campbell further in the day when he seeks leave of me?
—Senator Brown, it is not a question of being fair; there is no point of order.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I rise to speak briefly on this particular document. My colleague Senator Cook spoke about this yesterday and drew the attention of the Senate to the fact that our relations with India were strained as a result of the tests that occurred earlier last year in India and also in Pakistan. One has to look at the work of the Australia-India Council as being important in the sense that it is a bridge building organisation in the relations between Australia and India. There are other such councils as well for Japan and similar places. This report is indeed welcome because it highlights the work of that particular council over the 1997-98 period.
There are a number of things I want to look at in terms of the report. The first is the matter of education. The report says that the objective of the council's education program is to raise the level of knowledge of India, including Australia's relations with India, at the primary and secondary levels in Australian schools. Of course, this also works the other way within India. One of the problems in many of our relationships with other nations is that we do not understand their social, cultural, economic or political systems. Organisations such as this go a long way to overcoming some of those problems. It is interesting to see the program outlined in the report where the council funded a tour of India by Australian primary and secondary teachers during January of 1998 and, according to the report, promoted effective use of India curriculum packages throughout Australia. That is an important element of these types of councils, and it seems from this report that the function is being well performed.
The other issue raised is international relations. My colleague Senator Cook, when he spoke to this report yesterday, referred to the strained relations as a result of the nuclear testing. Senator Cook also referred to the fact that the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee has conducted an inquiry into those tests and pointed out to the Senate that there was a totally bipartisan attitude in this country to the tests that had been conducted in India and Pakistan, and that was one of condemnation. The issue that 
 was raised during the inquiry conducted by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee was how long our protest would remain and how we would go about repairing any damage that was done to the relationship during that period of time. The curious part is that during that period, when our political relations were strained, our sporting relations were certainly not strained, because we had a tour going on in that particular country.
It is important that Australia look at repairing its relations with India, and with Pakistan for that matter. That is something that has not been given any real focus. India will be important to Australia in the future in terms of trade. Last year India was  ranked 12th on the list of countries that we export to. We have seen our exports to India grow by 17 per cent, which is a fairly strong trend growth coming off a very low base.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-03-25,"—I was a member of the committee that produced the very important report Island to islands: Communications with Australia's external territories , which is the result of an undertaking to look at the communications needs of our external territories, particularly Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I was unable to make the trip to Norfolk Island, but I made the trip to Christmas and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. There are a number of issues that need to be looked at very carefully because, although they are part of Australia, in terms of communication they are quite remote. The islands are not entitled to any funding, under the infrastructure funding programs, from the sale of the first tranche of Telstra, and their access to lines for the Internet are impossibly slow—they are basically non-existent. This is a major problem for people, particularly in the education area when schools need to talk to the department in Perth via the Internet. As are most states, Western Australia is moving more and more to the use of technology for the provision of in-service training, for sending out forms and things like that, and their Internet service is not adequate enough to be able to undertake this. It is a big problem and it is one that we have to recognise, although they do have Intranet within the schools and that provides a very good service for them,
There are problems also with the air services to the area. They now have some additional flights coming in through Indonesia into Christmas Island but not to Cocos (Keel 
 ing). All of the three islands—Norfolk, Christmas and Cocos (Keeling)—have problems with the lack of freight capacity and the off-loading of freight, particularly in relation to health and medical supplies. These sometimes require a cold chain—they are time sensitive. Certainly we had evidence of specimens being taken from Norfolk Island, sent to Sydney, not being collected properly by the couriers in Sydney and coming back to the island maybe a week later.
The diagnoses of some diseases and complaints—and also changes in medication, if that is required—and the tests that have to be done in Sydney or Brisbane can be time critical. This can delay people's treatment and cause a problem. It lowers their quality of life and it may even endanger their lives. So that is a major problem.
The other crazy thing concerns airmail sent from overseas to Australia to go to Norfolk Island. Let us say it is coming from the US: it travels from the US to Sydney via airmail and it might then be put on slow mail to get to Norfolk. So that anomaly needs to be addressed. One of the recommendations is that, if something is airmailed into Australia, we should not just consider that the airmail component applies only until it reaches the continent of Australia. Certainly a lot of mail gets sent around Australia by air that is not airmail. I think we need to make sure that people are in fact able to obtain this material.
There is also a problem in that many things get off-loaded. It is a bigger problem, I think, on Christmas and Cocos islands—and I think they have fewer shipping connections than Norfolk as well. We certainly had evidence from a number of people in the Indian Ocean territories that they would know when their telephone bill was due because the telephone would be cut off because they had not paid it. The bill would have been in the mail but would have been off-loaded because the flight was over capacity in weight. The aircraft have to run with additional fuel because it is a long distance to fly out there, and on some occasions that requires them taking less cargo than if the aircraft were doing a run within the country. So it is certainly a concern.
On occasions it also impacts on the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables that might have to come across on those flights. The health people also advised that they had had occasions when urgently needed medications and drugs had been off-loaded because of weight problems. Getting a seat on the aircraft out of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands going to Perth at peak times can be a problem because the flights can be fully booked for four or five months in advance. That is a major problem if somebody suddenly needs to go to Perth for medical reasons. It means that somebody who would have had their seat booked for some considerable time gets pulled off the flight. This is not good for those who need to travel and it is not particularly good for those who need to be evacuated.
We also heard how telemedicine would be able to improve diagnoses and specialist medical treatment and care, and maybe reduce the need for medical evacuations on some occasions. Medical evacuations are horrifically expensive—we are talking big, five-figure sums of money as well as considerable time. If they had sufficient line capacity and electronic capacity, they would be able to look quite realistically at the use of telemedicine and also at being able to send down the line things like X-rays and ECGs so that diagnoses could be made by a specialist, or a consultation could be had with a specialist, in Perth. This may result in, perhaps, not requiring an evacuation or maybe requiring an evacuation earlier than would have been undertaken. It would certainly allow the doctors on the islands to instigate more refined forms of treatment at an earlier stage. So it is a major issue for people in the area.
The change of footprint for some of the television stations was also of concern to them. Digital versus analog is an issue, and even the communications between the two main islands in the Cocos (Keeling) group are very difficult. The reception often does not work. Trying to ring from West Island to Home Island can be difficult. Also, the telephone service does not work on part of Christmas Island. Their television and radio reception is also very much subject to the 
 vagaries of the weather; if there is a lot of cloud cover, this can impact quite seriously upon the ability to receive clear signals.
These are things of concern. We need to remember that Australia is not just this continent and Tasmania; it does include Macquarie Island, territories in the Antarctic, Norfolk Island and the Indian Ocean territories. Whilst there may not be a great number of people living there, we need to make sure that their needs are recognised. Those outlying territories are certainly of strategic importance to this country. We are a multicultural country and we need to recognise that it is important for our islands that are more remote from the mainland to have access to the same programs that we have here on the mainland so that they do not feel isolated and so that they can see and understand what people on the mainland are doing, perhaps why they are doing it and what is going on here. Those islands are of strategic importance to Australia, and I think this report certainly highlights some of the things that need to be done to improve the communications. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-03-25,"—For AFL football fans, this day, Thursday 25 March, is an auspicious one, marking the start of an eagerly awaited 1999 home and away AFL footy season. At the outset, I should declare some personal interest in tonight's debate—I have to admit to being an avid Essendon fan. It is not as bad as being a Carlton fan, I guess. It just so happens that the mighty Bombers are playing their first game of the season tonight against Carlton. Many residents of my electorate of the Northern Territory are fanatical followers of Australian football. AFL plays a very important part in their lives, as indeed it does for a lot of Australians, especially Victorians.
As you may know, over the years the Territory has produced some outstanding AFL footballers, people like Maurice Rioli—now a Territory Labor MLA, Michael Long, Andrew McLeod, Robbie AhMat and Mark West, just to name a few. However, the issue that I want to speak about tonight is that the residents of the majority of remote Territory communities—whose residents, I should add, are predominantly Aboriginal—will be missing out on watching broadcasts of the AFL games. They have already missed out on watching the excitement of the preseason Ansett Cup competition. Football is big in the Territory's Aboriginal communities. Young Aboriginal kids love to play and love to watch.
Football is a big community event. If you visit any of the Territory's remote communities, you will always see young Aboriginal kids playing football, emulating their AFL heroes, wearing their jumpers. I am thinking of such Top End communities as Barunga, Daguragu, Pine Creek, Milingimbi, Yirrkala and Mataranka; and Central Australian communities such as Areyonga, Yuendumu, Santa Teresa, Willowra, Nyirrpi, Hermannsburg, Wallace Rockhole, Mutitjulu and Docker River—and the list goes on. These are remote communities, mad keen on AFL football and now unable to watch the Channel 7 footy broadcasts. I should also point out that many communities in the area of South Australia stretching from Moomba to Ceduna, which also receive Imparja broadcasts, may miss out on AFL broadcasts.
Next week I intend to table a petition signed by over 400 Territorians living in remote locations, who are upset that they cannot access AFL broadcasts in their communities. How did this happen, and why am I on my feet in the Senate to talk about this? On 23 December last year, the Australian Broadcasting Authority extended the broadcast areas of the Aboriginal owned Imparja Television, which broadcasts out of Alice Springs, and the Telecasters owned television station, then a Channel 10 affiliate, which broadcasts out of Townsville. The extension of their broadcasting licences allows Channel 7 Central and Imparja to broadcast into each 
 other's broadcast areas. This move gave viewers access, theoretically anyway, to two commercial channels.
At the same time, Telecasters decided to become an affiliate of Channel 7 Network from 1 February this year, giving them full access to Seven Network programming, including the AFL. As a result, Imparja, which had broadcast AFL games to remote communities via satellite for the past 10 or so years, lost the right to show AFL games—meaning that those communities that only get Imparja can no longer automatically watch the AFL broadcasts.
As a result of all this, these remote communities have three alternatives. They can keep Imparja, and go without Channel 7 Central and the football; they can choose to give up Imparja—with its local news, Aboriginal programs and other programming—and switch over to Channel 7 Central; or they can purchase the additional decoder and apply to the Australian Broadcasting Authority for a licence that would allow them to access and retransmit the additional commercial channel. However, if they decide to proceed with the latter—which is the most preferable because it gives them access to all TV channels—and buy the equipment, they need to find anywhere between $8,000 and $30,000, depending on whether they are a self-help or BRACS community, and depending on what transponders and transmission equipment they need.
For many remote communities, many of which are impoverished and barely managing with the local government funding they receive, that sort of money is simply out of the reach of most of them. Channel 7 Central has said it will install the necessary retransmission equipment, but only in communities larger than 2,000 people. However, this excludes the Territory's remote communities, which vary in size from about 400 to 1,000 people. I believe that the Territory's remote communities are entitled to access the AFL on the same terms as other Australians do. I firmly believe that a universal service obligation should be introduced for Australia's broadcasting services to ensure that all Australians have access to a range of broadcasting 
 services—including broadcasts of what is, after all, Australia's national game, AFL. As was pointed out in the report on Communications with Australia's External Territories, which was tabled in the Senate this week:
Broadcasting services are not just a commercial matter. They influence both cultural identity and the Australian people's sense of national integration. For this reason it is in Australia's long term interest to ensure that all Australians receive a variety of Australian broadcast services through clear and reliable signals.
Last week, in what can only be described as a very cynical move aimed at softening up the Senate for the debate on the further sale of Telstra, the federal government announced it would allocate funds to improve broadcasting services to remote and regional communities.
The government said this move would give BRACS, the Broadcasting in Remote Aboriginal Communities Scheme, and `self-help' communities in remote areas of Australia access to a second commercial channel and hence access to AFL football broadcasts. Self-help communities are those communities which decided not to install individual decoder dishes but instead bought a community transmitter. The funding would help them buy additional transmitters and a satellite decoder by providing for 75 per cent of the cost of the purchase. But, and here's the catch, these funds would come from the further sale of Telstra, which the government had hoped the Senate would pass this week.
However, we saw what happened with the government's Telstra bill this week. At the last moment, after a few hours of debate, the government pulled the bill from the Senate for an `indefinite' period of time. I am glad the bill has been pulled because I do not believe the sale of Telstra will benefit my constituents in the Northern Territory. It would simply lead to a reduction in the quality of telecommunication services. I also do not believe that the provision of adequate broadcasting services to Australians living in remote communities should be dependent on the further sale of Telstra. Instead, the federal government should ensure access to broadcasting services is provided to all Australians as a right, independent of Telstra's future.
The federal government has made a mess of the aggregation process involving Imparja and Channel 7 Central. It should have ensured that viewers would be able to maintain the existing viewing, especially programs such as AFL broadcasts, or rugby league, in the case of Northern Queensland viewers. The least the federal government can do now, in the short term, is immediately ensure that Imparja is given the right to broadcast AFL games for the 1999 year or until all remote communities are able to access the additional commercial channel.
Senator Alston should immediately call the AFL, Channel 7 Central and Imparja together to find a short-term solution so that those residents of remote communities can access those AFL broadcasts. The most obvious solution to the problem in the short term is for Channel 7 Central to allow a program swap, which would meet the needs of both stations' viewers in the short term. I also point out that Senator Ian Macdonald, the minister for territories, speaking on ABC radio last week misled Territorians by saying that Channel 7 and Imparja had agreed to a temporary program swap. When the stations were asked about this program swap, they knew nothing about it. It makes you wonder if this government knows what is actually happening in remote and regional Australia. Imagine the outcry if Australians living in Melbourne or Sydney suddenly found they couldn't access the AFL or the cricket.
It is simply not good enough for the federal government to ignore the problem or to promise that all the problems will be solved by the privatisation of Telstra. The government is being irresponsible in getting the hopes up of those residents of remote communities and using them as political footballs in this outrageous debate. I call on the government to act immediately to ensure that residents of remote communities have adequate broadcasting services and that all Territorians can access their footy.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Remote Communities: Australian Rules Broadcasts</title>,Adjournment,29,1
