Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (12:32):  The government is fast tracking the full implementation of the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program, building on the successes it has achieved to date, thereby providing access for all Australians aged 50 to 74 years to biennial screening by 2020 and continuing to enhance our broader preventive health efforts by supporting the establishment of 10 new headspace sites, which will provide community based services for young people aged 12 to 25 years who have or are at risk of mental illness. We need to make sure that our investment in the health system, wherever it can, encourages Australians to develop and maintain healthy behaviours. This is one reason we are developing a national diabetes strategy, supported by an advisory group which will draw on the expertise of clinicians and researchers who focus on this disease.


Diabetes and its complications places an incredible demand on the health system, particularly type 2 diabetes, a disease which can be prevented and managed through physical exercise and diet. The experts are reviewing current practices and will develop advice to ensure that all parts of the health system are able to respond effectively to those who are diagnosed, as well as increasing our efforts to prevent the disease. The government will also continue working with the primary care and other sectors to promote health behaviours and to support better health outcomes. We are establishing primary health networks, which will seek to embed preventive behaviours in the community. It is important that our general practitioners are seen as a critical part of the preventive health picture.


If we can achieve better outcomes in the health of high-risk and high-need complex chronic disease patients, we will help prevent increased demand on specialists and hospitals. As well as the role for the Australian government, the states and territories have responsibility for providing services and they need to ensure these services include preventive approaches.


Cross-government action on preventive health will not be jeopardised as a result of abolishing ANPHA. There are established and transparent mechanisms available to progress national prevention issues. Similarly, closing ANPHA does not preclude the Commonwealth from working with stakeholders, seeking expert advice or forming productive working relationships with other bodies. Such collaboration is not dependent on having a separately established and funded Commonwealth agency.


Through our continuing programs, this government recognises an ongoing role for the Commonwealth in promoting healthier lifestyles in the context of individuals taking responsibility for their lives. These efforts need to be integrated across the health system with a focus on those who are most at risk and those who can gain most from changing behaviours that lead to poor health outcomes. That said, Australian life expectancy continues to rise, supported by our health system and by quality research and evidence-based interventions. We do not need a separate agency looking at only part of the prevention picture. There is no evidence to show that this is the most effective way to promote responsibility for healthy lifestyles among Australians and address population health priorities.


This government will continue to focus on activities where there is evidence that the government can act to make a difference. This government will continue to work to ensure that preventive health underlines all our health efforts, that preventive health becomes embedded in the health system and in the attitudes and behaviours of all Australians.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the Australian National Preventive Health Agency (Abolition) Bill 2014 be agreed to.

I also refer to Senator William's confirmation that the Prime Minister promised before the election 'there would not be any cuts to the ABC and it was spot on that the Prime Minister should admit it'.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (14:00):  The situation in relation to the ABC is a matter for ABC management and its board. So to suggest that it is the government's responsibility in some form is to miss the point. Indeed, what I would say to ABC management is that it is called the Australian Broadcasting Commission true reason. It is supposed to represent all of Australia. Under current management, you could be forgiven for thinking it is called 'the UBC, the Ultimo Broadcasting Corporation'. That is the problem here.




Senator Wong:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order as to relevance. I would ask you to refer the minister to the question. He was asked about his answer yesterday when he said, 'Nobody has lost their job, and was asked to correct the record.



The PRESIDENT:  The minister still has one minute and 11 seconds left to answer the question. I remind the minister of the question.




Senator ABETZ:
  Some of the savings the ABC could make without job losses were highlighted for us yesterday in a Fairfax paper, the Sydney Morning Herald, where a former manager of Radio National said:


They didn't have a 9-5 mentality. They had a 10-3 mentality. They planned their work day around their afternoon yoga class.


That does not happen in Hobart, it does not happen in Adelaide, it does not happen in Gladstone but it does happen in Ultimo and that is where the ABC management need to come to grips with its charter and the aspirations of the Australian people.



Senator Wong interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my left!




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order as to direct relevance. I again ask you to draw the attention of the minister to the question which is about whether the minister is aware of the lost jobs and whether he would correct the record of yesterday.




Senator Wong:
  He is misleading the Senate. 



The PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Wong! Thank you, Senator Moore. I remind the minister he has 26 seconds left to answer the question and I remind him of the question.




Senator ABETZ:
  Another problem with their workplace relations is that: 


They were like free-range chickens, wandering around at will, pecking at this and that, content that laying one egg constituted a hard day's work.


At the time I gave the answer yesterday, nobody had lost their jobs, today nobody had lost their job, and I understand redundancy notices might be given out later this week.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (14:04):  It is interesting how the Australian Labor Party are so exercised about cuts to the ABC because when the ALP are asked, when Mr Shorten is asked about what cuts he would make, his answer is, 'We haven't finalised our proposition for government.' When he was asked further, 'We don't think the cuts need to be as deep as they are. In other words, he understands that cuts need to be made to the ABC. Then he went on to say, 'We wouldn't be making the same extent of cuts to the ABC.' What mean and tricky language is that—'not to the same extent'? So tell us, to what extent, Senator Lundy, would the Australian Labor Party cut the ABC?




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order as to direct relevance to the question that was asked. The question was about the Prime Minister's promise and the minister has gone nowhere near any comment about the Prime Minister.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Moore. I remind the minister of the question. He has 10 seconds left.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (14:06):  This is a government which seeks to preserve every possible job and that is why this government reversed the broken promise of the ALP 'no carbon tax'. The ALP made a promise that there would be no carbon tax, a tax which destroyed thousands of jobs throughout the Australian economy and especially in the manufacturing sector. That is why we got rid of that tax—to preserve jobs. Senator Lundy, I can say to you and your colleagues that that is what motivates us as a government, to get the economy back on track. In circumstances at the time the Prime Minister made his statement about the ABC, Mr Bowen said the deficit would be $18 billion.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women) (14:08):  I thank Senator O'Sullivan for the question. It is indeed White Ribbon Day today, and it is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. I believe all in the Senate would agree with me when I say, in Australia and internationally, violence against women is wrong, violence against women and children should not be tolerated, and violence against women and children must be stopped.



Honourable senators:  Hear, hear!




Senator CASH:
  In terms of action that the government is taking, on 27 June this year the Prime Minister, Minister Andrews and I launched the Second Action Plan under the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. We are focusing this time on experiences of all women but, in particular, Indigenous women, women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and women with disability. The Second Action Plan contains 26 practical action items that all governments across Australia—Commonwealth, state and territory governments—believe are critical to improving women's safety. Over $100 million has been allocated over the next four years to support the Second Action Plan. The new initiatives that the Australian government is funding under the Second Action Plan include: $3.3 million for CrimTrac to develop and test a prototype for a national domestic violence order scheme; $1.7 million to take the next steps in developing a national data collection and reporting framework; and more than $1 million to expand 1800RESPECT—Australia's first national professional telephone and online counselling service.


There is no doubt that the Second Action Plan is a plan for everyone—for all women, for all men, for all children, for the business sector, for communities, for community leaders and for governments. Violence against women and children is unacceptable, it is a crime and it requires all of us working together to tackle the issue.

This was only the second time in Australia's history that the police commissioners of Australia and New Zealand had united to make a stand on an issue of community-wide importance. As first responders in the community, the police have an unvarnished insight into the devastating effects of domestic and family violence. They have a unique comprehension of what is an exceptionally complex issue. Their stance yesterday was without a doubt a powerful addition to the tsunami of community momentum and support that has been steadily growing. It takes unanimous support from all sides of parliament, from the police, from the media, from communities and from civil society organisations to eradicate the scourge of family violence.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) and the Assistant Minister for Health (Senator Nash) to questions without notice asked by Senators Lundy and Peris today relating to funding for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.


I move this motion with some incredulity because what is going on here is that the government is now saying that the ABC is responsible for the distribution and impact of their cuts. That is like cutting off Aunty ABC's arms and then getting cranky at her for bleeding all over the floor. You cannot do it like that. You cannot make a cut and then blame the organisation that you are applying the cuts to for the damage that is caused. And yet that is exactly what we saw across the chamber today from senators Nash and Abetz in their answers to questions from Senator Peris and me.


The hypocrisy is quite galling. I do not think it is lost on anybody listening to today's question time. They would be shocked and appalled by what they heard coming from the mouths of government ministers today. We know that there have been unprecedented cuts made to our national broadcaster. We know that we were promised, prior to the election, that these cuts would not be occurring. So this is, formally, a broken promise by the Abbott government. It is, formally, a betrayal of the trust placed in the Abbott government by the people of Australia when they cast their votes in the days following that statement. And what we have seen around the country in the last few days is, I believe, just the beginning of the outrage being expressed by Australians to this decision.


I want to take the ministers to task on a number of issues, but particularly one that is dear to my heart—and I know that Senator Peris will follow up on this—and that is the broadcasting of Australian women's sport. Now, most people in this chamber, if they have not been living under a rock, would know that this is a challenging topic. We know that there is a profound inequity in the way that women's sport is presented in the Australian media, and we know that the commercial television broadcasting statistics show that it is still in single percentage figures—despite us being half of the population. 


Various interventions, including a consensus report during the Howard government era on what we needed to do to support the coverage of women's sport, involved creating a program that allowed sports and broadcasters to work together. 


Now—surprise, surprise!—many Australian sportswomen found themselves working very closely with the Australian national broadcaster, the ABC, to put women's sport to air. What we have now, after years and years of partnership—and, frankly, a battle against some of what I think are the poorer decisions of our commercial broadcasters in choosing not to broadcast women's sport in this country—is that women's sports find themselves now being cut. We find the WNBA, the Women's National Basketball League, being cut; we find the W-League, the women's football league, being cut. We know that netball, which screened on the ABC, was able to develop an audience following—so much so that they now show their product, if you like, their national league on Foxtel. Obviously, their final is on free-to-air. We know that their success would not have happened without the relationship they have had the ABC. I like to think that the W-League and the WNBL would be able to find a place on a commercial television station, but the evidence to date is that is not occurring. So to cut them off at the knees like this, through these cuts, is a greater travesty than perhaps what first meets the eye.


These things cannot be fixed overnight. These things have been shaped in our community over a long period of time, and they have culminated with the coverage we had during campaign after campaign by many people in this place—men and women alike—over many, many years. So to undo it at this point does far more damage than the mere fact of the cut as it is being applied.


Sport in this country is part of a continuum, a circle. If we do not have our role models on our national television broadcasters, if we do not see women excelling in their sports, then we do not have that continuum that inspires the next generation of young girls and women to keep playing. You start to break what is great about Australian sport when you unpick the ABC's ability to provide that coverage, when you break that continuum of what is great about Australian sport. And you do it in a way that targets women, because it is only the ABC that has shown a willingness to provide that coverage. How dare this government break that continuum for women and their sports in this country? As Lauren Jackson said, this is the passive disenfranchisement of women in yet another way from this government, and it is completely unacceptable. (Time expired)

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2014-11-25,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (15:09):  I rise to speak in response to Senator Lundy's motion to take note of answers. I want to be very categorical: our position was not that the ABC and the SBS—the public broadcasters—should be immune from savings, but that those savings should be undertaken in an informed manner. That was the reason why the minister established, back in January, the efficiency study, the Lewis review, to assist the public broadcasters to manage their businesses more efficiently and effectively, and to examine specifically back-of-house costs of operation and to identify savings through increased efficiencies and to reduce expenses without impacting on the quality of the extent of programing.


The efficiency study did find that these savings were definitely achievable if the ABC was willing to tackle the inefficiencies in its back office operations and, effectively, get more bang for their buck—or get more bang for fewer taxpayer dollars. Of course the easiest way for the ABC would be to cut costs to programing rather than tackle their outdated business and administrative practices. The efficiency study was designed to make the public broadcasters look at their back-of-office operations and to find those efficiencies, so it is totally disingenuous for those opposite to now come forward and to basically go on about cuts to programing when this efficiency was about back office operations.


It is clear that since the draft of that study was announced in May the public broadcasters, especially the ABC, have been busily looking for efficiencies. I have a copy of a document, which is dated 24 November; it is a very detailed document which is headed 'ABC News proposal for change'. It says:


The Managing Director, Mark Scott, has announced proposals for wide-ranging changes designed to secure ABC's future in the digital media era. As part of that process, News management has been reviewing every aspect of the news operation to find savings and to ensure that we are strongly positioned to deliver our world-class journalism to audiences when, where and how they want it. We are proposing measures aimed at improving ABC's news and current affairs service to audiences across all platforms and enhancing our reporting from across the nation and around the world.


And then this document goes on, in quite a lot of detail, to specifically identify those areas. It says:


To ensure we have the right mix of skills to address the future needs of a multiplatform operation, in many cases we propose pooling staff with similar skill sets for selection for redundancy, not only those affected by the discontinuation.


The point that I am making is that the ABC has already gone through this process. The document talks about changes to current affairs. It talks about proposing initiatives in current affairs that would 'better showcase our agenda setting reporting'. It talks about 'investigations and analysis across 24-hour news platforms and making them more accessible to audiences'. And it goes into detailed key proposals that they have already identified. On the international front, it says:


We want our international operations to be more responsive, with greater flexibility to be on the ground when and where major news breaks in any corner of the globe.


Then it goes on to identify about 10 key proposals in relation to international operations. I move to state and territory newsrooms. It says:


We want to offer state and territory audiences more responsive approaches to coverage of local news, more on-the-spot coverage—


and, again, gives detailed key proposals as to how they are going to effect that. News operations is another area that they have looked at. It says:


We are proposing changes designed to make the news operations management and support structures more efficient, consistent and effective.


Again, they detail changes there. They have also looked at management and support teams. It says:


News management has reviewed how we can most efficiently resource structure and utilise management.


This is what the review and the efficiency review was about, and the ABC have identified the areas already.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (13:52):  The government is going to rue the day it broke the election promise it made to the Australian people of 'no cuts to the ABC or SBS'. The Prime Minister made that election promise but is now making $252 million worth of cuts to the ABC—half a billion dollars of cuts in total when added to the cuts to SBS. The government will rue this day. Amongst the plethora of lies this government has told the Australian people, I believe this will be one of the ones the government will most regret. 


The Australian people are not stupid. They can see a lie for what it is. They trust the ABC, but this government is attacking it and gutting it. It is destroying its capacity to remain the national broadcaster that Australians love and trust. It is not just an attack on the national broadcaster; it is an attack on the Australian stories, past and present, that the ABC tells in Australian homes. It is an attack on our Australian democracy.


Senator Abetz lectured the Senate about what the ABC ought to be, but it is the government that is gutting it so much that it will be prevented from being what it ought to be. It is forcing the ABC to make shocking cuts to deal with this loss of $252 million over five years. What is the result? It is resulting in the loss of 400 jobs, in the closure of the South Australian TV production unit, in the cancellation of five radio programs—and on and on it goes. Of course the government knew it would result in staff cuts. Of course the government knew it would impact on programming. How else would the ABC deal with such a devastating cut to its bottom line? That is the dishonesty being displayed by Senator Abetz. He knew very well that the ABC would not be able to continue to be what it ought to be—because of the government's savage ideological cuts.


That is exactly what this is all about. The coalition has an ideological bent against the ABC. They do not like the ABC. They do not want a national broadcaster. They do not want Australian stories being told. They do not want regional stories being told. Not even the National Party will stand up to fight these cuts. Not even Senator Nash is speaking out against the cuts to coverage of women's sport that will result. The ABC's coverage of local events and issues is vital to community life in Australia. This $252 million cut is going to rip the heart out of local communities.


There are two levels of hypocrisy in what the government has done. Most obviously, the government has simply lied to the Australian people. Prime Minister Abbott, on the eve of the election, said very clearly—and we can all watch it over and over on YouTube—that there would be 'no cuts to the ABC or SBS'. That was a lie. Now, on top of that, he has lied about the lie! It simply will not wash with Australian voters. Backbenchers within his own government now want him to come out and admit that he has lied. Today Fairfax reported that Liberal MP Craig Laundy spoke out at a party meeting, urging the Prime Minister to call a spade a spade and to stop denying that the government had broken its election promise. Australians want the government to stop its ideological attack on the ABC—it is coming from within its own ranks, it is coming from the hundreds of people who rallied outside the front of Parliament House. Leave our ABC alone—stop these cuts to the ABC.

Given the cuts that have been visited on other public sector institutions, it's only reasonable the ABC should be asked to bear its share of the burden, and to do so in such a way that preserves programming as much as possible.


I think that is a very reasonable point and I think it is something most people would agree with—that savings should be able to be found in the ABC. 


We know in fact that there are many savings to be found. Senator Abetz quoted a little bit from a Fairfax article by Louise Evans, a former manager of Radio National, that appeared yesterday. She was talking about some of the waste at Radio National. She says that she was:


… shocked by the culture, waste, duplication and lax work place practices exercised in some pockets of Radio National. I was even more shocked by the failure of the executive to want to do anything about it.


She goes on to say:


One problem … was the so-called lifers, a pocket of predominantly middle-aged, Anglo-Saxon staff who had never worked anywhere other than the ABC, who were impervious to change, unaccountable, untouchable and who harboured a deep sense of entitlement.


They didn't have a 9-5 mentality. They had a 10-3 mentality. They planned their work day around their afternoon yoga class. They wore thongs and shorts to work, occasionally had a snooze on the couch after lunch and popped out to Paddy's Market to buy fresh produce for dinner before going home.


There is waste to be found.


We saw recent examples. We have two public broadcasters getting, between them, billions of dollars over the next few years. In fact, even under the changes, the ABC will still be receiving $5.2 billion over the next five years. So let's not pretend that for $5.2 billion over the next five years they cannot fund women's sport. Let's not pretend that they cannot do that if they really want to. They are refusing to make the savings in other areas. One example is outbidding SBS for Asian Cup rights. We have SBS—publicly funded but able to actually get advertising revenue when they bid for the football—being outbid by another public broadcaster, upping the price to taxpayers. Do taxpayers really care whether it is going to be on SBS or ABC? I would argue that SBS is well-placed to deliver very good football coverage as it is something that they have been doing for a long time. So that is the kind of waste that we see. 


Let's be clear on this as well. We have seen it said today—



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator SESELJA:
  Senator Conroy can interject all he likes.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Ignore the interjections.




Senator SESELJA:
  I will ignore the interjections as I highlight this. ABC board member Dr Stanley today, on Radio National, I think, this morning defended the cuts despite being anguished about them, saying that the regional newsrooms were 'probably going to be cut anyway'. So the ABC was already planning on making these kinds of cuts, and they are now using these savings as an excuse to make the kinds of cuts that they wanted to make anyway. Instead of looking internally, instead of looking at Ultimo, they have gone out to the regions and made the cuts, because presumably they judge that somehow they will therefore be able to blame the government for the cuts that they wanted to make any way. The room is there to cut in other areas. Mark Scott has made these decisions. I believe that many of them are unreasonable decisions, but they are for him to take responsibility for. (Time expired)

"Peris, Sen Nova",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (15:25):  I too rise in relation to answers provided in question time today about the cuts that the Abbott government are making to the ABC. The answers provided today simply state that this government do not care about the impact of the cuts that they are making to the ABC. Senator Nash, the Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, said today that they take no responsibility for the ABC and that it should be the responsibility of the ABC, not this government. This is a complete cop-out. It is like a government cutting funding to a school and then directing all the complaints to the principal. It is like a government cutting funding to a hospital and then blaming doctors when the cuts take effect and beds are closed. But that is the nature of this government. They do not care; they do not take responsibility for their broken promises and their funding cuts. This is a government that promised no cuts to the ABC. Their denials are ridiculous and everybody knows it.


As my colleague Senator Kate Lundy said today, we are concerned gravely about the coverage of women's sports. It would be fair to say that when the Abbott government cabinet sat down they did not realise the impact that they would have on female sport. Perhaps Minister Julie Bishop was away that day or she simply did not care. It is clear that the Prime Minister, who is the Minister for Women, did not care. Outside of the ABC and SBS, there is very little televised free-to-air coverage of women's sport in this country. This year the ABC televised the Basketball World Championships for the first time on free-to-air television. They also televised the Women's National Basketball League and the women's soccer league. Both of these have been cut as a result of this broken promise. I have been told that the women's basketball league has been covered for of 34 years—but not anymore. The Australian Opals star, Lauren Jackson, as I mentioned today in question time, said that women's sport is the 'sacrificial lamb' of the government's cuts. She described the Abbott government's cuts to women's basketball as 'a very dark day for women's sport'—and it is; she is 100 per cent correct. She also said:


The Liberal government doesn't really put sport ahead of anything else, especially women's sport, and that's why I thought it would be one of the things to go.


She is one of the greatest sporting stars in Australian history, and this is what she thinks of the Abbott government.


I know that the ABC has been a strong supporter of both men's hockey and women's hockey over the decades. In fact, the ABC is televising the Champions Trophy later this month and in early December. Perhaps this will be the last time that we have coverage of world-class hockey in this country. Maybe we will be left to watch hockey once every four years during the Olympic Games. When we look at sport in this country, we all know that there is so much coverage and saturation on television of football and cricket for young men. That is enough incentive for young boys to get out of bed every day, dare to dream and have aspirations of becoming a champion. It lets them look at role models who go out there and provide a positive influence on the youth of today. What will there be for women? What will there be for the young girls of this country who will wake up every day and not see any more women playing basketball and women playing soccer? These are world champions. Clearly some of the greatest young women who have dared to dream in this country will have their dreams now broken because of the cuts. There will be a lack of positive role models for the generation of young girls in this country.


What we are making is a clear statement that it is good enough to have men's basketball and men's soccer televised, but women's basketball and women's soccer is no longer going to be televised in this country. We cannot put it on the ABC and make them call the shots as to what we should be shown in this country. The cuts will have a profound effect on the future sporting success of this country, particularly young women.

  The decisions to cease manufacturing in Australia by 2016 at Ford and by 2017 at Holden and Toyota were made entirely by the motor vehicle producers themselves. Both the Mitsubishi and the Ford decisions to close manufacturing operations in Australia were made under the previous Labor government. All three remaining producers have indicated that the level of government support was not the reason for their decision to cease manufacturing cars in Australia. The federal government has continuously worked with industry to make the transition for workers across the sector as pain-free as possible. The Productivity Commission estimates that the automotive industry received $30 billion in government support from 1997 to 2012. There were five million vehicles manufactured in Australia; that equates to over $5,000 per vehicle of government support during this period. Despite this substantial assistance, the industry has been unable to survive in a highly competitive global environment. Australia's manufacturing industry is moving towards new opportunities in new industries.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (15:53):  It is timely that on the eve of a state election in Victoria we are having a discussion about the need for strong environmental policies to address climate change and to protect our precious biodiversity. We have a situation where in Victoria neither the Victorian Labor Party nor the coalition is prepared to commit to strong action to tackle climate change or to grasp the opportunity to save the remaining habitat of the Leadbeater's possum—through the creation of the Great Forest National Park, for example. In that context, we are reliant on our federal government for leadership.


But we have seen a federal government that, instead of demonstrating leadership, has a vendetta to decimate the dean energy industry. Tony Abbott has been on a personal crusade trying to destroy renewables and to prop up coal. As a result, a number of Victorian renewable energy projects are under threat. The Mildura solar farm has been shelved. That would have been a great boom for the city of Mildura. We have seen dozens of new wind projects being put on hold. The manufacturer Keppel Prince in Portland recently announced that it will have to shed 150 jobs as a consequence of the renewable energy laws in this country going backwards. I visited Keppel Prince only a few weeks ago. What an inspiration. Here we have an entrepreneur recognising the opportunity to create the towers that support wind turbines. We have people who were previously stacking shelves at Woolies and Coles now being trained in welding techniques and in fact becoming experts in their field, becoming very highly specialised and highly trained. Victoria has moved from being one of the leaders in the country to being a laggard on renewable energy. According to the Climate Council report, the government's anti-wind-farm agenda has cost Victoria an estimated $4 billion in lost investment, as well as 3,000 jobs. We have seen new renewable projects basically seize up. The pipeline is now dry because of the uncertainty over the future of the RET. And investment in the sector has plummeted by around 70 per cent over the past year.


We have a solution. I know my colleagues in the Victorian state parliament, as well as the Greens candidates right across the state of Victoria, are advocating forcefully for that solution. We can salvage the clean energy industry in Australia. We can make progress in tackling climate change. And how do we do it? We do it by phasing out dirty coal fired power stations. We do it by banning onshore fracking and gas drilling. We do it by reinstating the Renewable Energy Target in Victoria. And we do it by paying solar panel owners a fair share for generating clean power. That is how we do it. But to do it we have to move beyond this obsession that this government has with fossil fuels. It was only today that Todd Stern, Obama's climate change adviser, said that it is just obvious that fossil fuels have to stay in the ground; if we are to combat climate change, that is where fossil fuels belong.


If Victoria were a country, we would be the world's fifth biggest producer of brown coal. The average age of Victoria's power plants is a staggering 40 years. And that is the average age; we have plants that are older than that. In Victoria we produce the dirtiest energy in Australia. And we produce more of it than we can use. But it is not just coal that is the problem. In Gippsland and parts of the Otways and south-west Victoria we have seen an explosion in the number of exploration and development licences for onshore gas. In Gippsland there are 22 exploration licences for unconventional gas. Lakes Oil, the company now known as Ignite Energy, conducted 23 fracking operations in Gippsland before the 2012 moratorium. In the south-west of Victoria we have 10 exploration licences for gas, mostly tight gas and shale gas. And I have to declare an interest here: some of them are not far away from where I live.


In Bacchus Marsh we see a community threatened by a huge open-cut brown-coal mine. High-impact exploration has now included a number of test drills right next to people's homes. For those who are not familiar with these areas, these are the breadbasket of Victoria. They are highly productive, fertile communities—places like Gippsland, the Otways and Bacchus Marsh—that produce some of the best food anywhere in the country, and they are now under threat from coal and from unconventional gas, including from fracking. At risk is one of the most precious resources of all, and that is water, which stands to be poisoned by coalmining, by drilling and by fracking.


So, what do we need to do about it? Well, the first thing is that we need a ban on new coalmines. We just have to stop this idea—this last-century fixation—of digging big holes in the ground as the solution to our problems. We have to stop this fixation with onshore gas, and particularly with fracking, so that we can make the transition towards a clean energy future. What the Greens are advocating is that we implement a Victorian—a state based—renewable energy target, which will bring renewable sources of power online. Importantly, if we do that we can phase out these dirty brown-coal fired power stations. Hazelwood, Anglesea and one of Yallourn's four units are to be phased out in in 2015 under the Greens' policy. We would retire Loy Yang B and the other three units of Yallourn in 2023.


Anglesea is a coal fired power station on my back doorstep situated in some of the most important heathland anywhere in the world. The opportunity to turn that back to what was one of the most important biodiversity resources in the state just cannot be missed. What would it result in? It would result in 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from Victoria every year from 2023 being removed. It would reduce the pollution intensity of Victoria's power system by almost a third. A third of the pollution coming from Victoria's brown coal fired power resources would be gone.


Under the plan, we would see decommissioned power plants and mines replaced by solar farms and a range of other renewable energy projects. It would create hundreds of jobs. There is also huge potential in the rehabilitation of these mine sites. There are jobs that will last for decades. This economic transformation is jobs rich, is good for the economy and it can occur without one cent of taxpayer funding going to the coal generators.


Over recent years we have seen the Napthine and Baillieu governments hand out $1.8 billion in public money to our brown coal power stations. They do not need another cent. We are going to get more people employed in putting solar panels on than in the entire coal mining industry. In fact, that is the situation at the moment. Clean energy is not a threat to employment; it is an opportunity. It is a jobs-rich industry and it is ordinary trades people who are employed in the installation of solar panels on people's roofs from places like Western Victoria right across to the La Trobe Valley.


We have got one million Australian homes and businesses already generating clean power, but they are not being given a fair go from the power companies. So what else do we need to do? We need to make rooftop solar much simpler and more affordable for everyone. We have to allow people to install panels with no upfront cost. Let's get rid of the administrative regulatory barriers that we put in front of people. This is genuine red tape reduction. If the government was serious about reducing red tape, this is exactly where it would start. The Greens would make sure they were being paid a fair share for generating clean power. That is why the Greens propose introducing a minimum one-for-one feed in tariff, so the owners will be paid at least the same amount for the electricity they put into the grid as it costs to get out of it—it is common sense. This will boost the income for many solar panel owners and will protect the over 50 per cent of solar home owners, who would otherwise be left with no guaranteed price of solar when existing schemes close in 2016. Of course nothing would change in those few households who are paid already above the minimum one-for-one feed in tariff.


This is a good story. Cutting pollution means cleaner air, it means cleaner water, it means better health, it means more jobs, it means tackling climate change and it means exporting our brains—rather than the current 'dig it up and ship it out' mentality which belongs in the last century.


We have an election in a few days' time. This is firmly on the national agenda.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) (16:03):  I rise to speak on this motion moved by Senator Siewert. I would like to address a couple of the things raised by Senator Di Natale in the course of my contribution. I note the motion today refers to the alleged lack of strong environmental policies to address climate change or safeguard natural resources in Victoria. I find myself in a bit of a quandary because over the last 30 years, no-one has done more to undermine the role of states in environmental management supervision and authority than the Greens, usually accompanied by the Labor Party. They will bring local issues into this chamber because they constantly claim that they are issues of national significance. But what this motion betrays, through its timing and through the hypocrisy posed by the Green's history, talking about state environmental management in this place, is that this is nothing less than an election stunt.


What I also found myself in a quandary about is that it refers to natural resources yet through my 6½ short years in this place and my time involved in state politics prior to that I saw no-one as hostile to the use of our natural resources as the Greens, whether that be our mineral resources such as coal, whether that be actually using the natural resources in farmland and exporting food and fibre or whether it be exporting protein to the world through programs like live exports—I am sure Senator McKenzie will talk about those some more—or whether, in particular, it be the Green's campaign to lock up one of our great renewable resources, forests.


The Greens have been hostile to the use of Victoria's natural resources and, indeed, hostile to their protection through their mismanagement of the national estate. Anyone on the border of a national park or a state reserve in a stroke in Victoria will tell you that the worst landlord is the government. Because the Greens, through a campaign of misleading people from schools right through the community, have done everything they can to create this false notion that we should not be trying to manage this natural resource. Tragically, we see that when we have the risk of fire as we do so often in south-eastern Australia.


I look forward to a Greens speaker commending the Victorian state government for increasing the burn-off ratios over the last four years to reduce the risk for so many people that live on the border or amongst our national forests and our state forests in Victoria.


As is usual for the Greens, this motion is phrased in a way that does not understand the limits of our own actions. When it comes to the first issue they raise, that of climate change, Victoria can no more dramatically impact the level of global emissions than can Australia. Yet what this motion does is it demands of Victorians to pay higher cost than the rest of the nation. What the states and the Commonwealth—and I might say with the agreement of the other state governments, including a signature of the then Greens environment minister from Tasmania—have agreed is that the states are responsible for adoption. But no, in an effort to increase the number of bumper stickers on bicycle helmets in Fitzroy, to turn this into a state political issue, the Greens somehow think that Victoria can lead the world.


The Greens come in here knowing that what they are saying is false, knowing that what they are saying will impose a greater burden on Victorian business and Victorian households and demand that Victorians pay higher costs than not only everybody else in the world but everybody else in Australia too.


Come Saturday at our state election, the Greens will see the results, as they saw at the last federal election, where people have started to realise the shallowness of their claims, the hypocrisy of their stance and the constant hyperbole: the Chicken Little, the Senator Henny Pennys, who come in here and say: 'The world is about to end.' When people do not believe them or the tides do not rise quite high enough, they will double down and say: 'The tides are going to rise higher' or that 'The cities are going to run out of water.' When that does not come true, they will then try and obfuscate and turn the debate to new issues, as we heard Senator Di Natale do, on so-called renewable energy targets. 


I make this point: Senator Di Natale proposed that someone who has a solar panel on their roof be paid the same rate as they might pay for electricity. The one piece of credit I will give the former Premier of Victoria, Mr John Brumby, I think he was Treasurer at the time, is that in the insanity of pursuit of Green preferences that occurred right around Australia at the state level when Labor was in office, where outrageous gross feed-in tariffs were granted to a limited number of people that could get solar panels on their roofs before everyone realised what a racket it was—there is research printed in today's newspapers that point out that in South-east Queensland, they equate to a subsidy of $200 from every household that does not have them. This was to benefit a select few who got in before the gate was shut when the community demanded their power prices not be forced up so that the pensioner who could not afford solar panels was paying for the person driving the Land Cruiser next door, because they could afford the upfront cost. I do not know of any other part of this country where someone gets a legislated, regulated guaranteed market in the way that the Greens demand that every Australian subsidise their neighbours who can afford the upfront cost of solar panels. 


When we go to the Greens war on coal and cheap energy, particularly in Victoria, there is an acute problem with this. Our brown coalfields that were first put to use by Sir John Monash after returning from World War I with some innovative acquiring of German technology at the request of the then Victorian Premier to develop the Latrobe Valley have been the basis of our middle-class growth for decades. They were the basis—I am sure Senator Carr will agree—of manufacturing for many years—




Senator Kim Carr:
  On the basis of public ownership, if I remember rightly!




Senator RYAN:
  Senator Carr, I will take that interjection, because I recall the public ownership principle was first breached by Premier Joan Kirner when she sold off 49 per cent of Loy Yang B. The Kennett government might have sold the rest of it, but the sales first started under Premier Joan Kirner, Senator Carr—I note the smile—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Address your comments through the chair. 




Senator RYAN:
  If brown coal is taken away from Victorians, their power prices will dramatically spike. There is no resource in Victoria that can supply baseload power at that price nor can we import the power that we need to keep Victoria going. To say that solar panels on roofs and windmills on our landscape can power the entire state of Victoria is profoundly and utterly misleading. But the Greens do this in order to try and drive their vote higher in the inner northern suburbs of Melbourne, between the CBD and the lycra belt. These facts need to be known because the policies of the Greens hidden behind a veil of alleged respectability pose a real threat to most Victorians.


Over the last few months, we have seen the largest ever decrease in power prices in the records of the ABS in this country, because the carbon tax, which the Greens say was too small, was removed. Because brown coal has higher emissions than black coal, that had a greater impact in Victoria—just as the carbon tax had a greater risk for Victoria—because it is more emissions intensive. But, also, the war of the Greens on trying to prevent the expansion of the use of natural gas goes against their stated objective, because the single-greatest decrease in the emissions intensity over the last decade has been in the American economy due to the dramatic expansion of the use of natural gas.


Victoria potentially has very rich natural gasfields, yet because their favoured suppliers, donors and campaign workers all think we can run round with solar panels on our bike helmets, the Greens refuse to consider the expansion of responsible fossil fuels. There is no alternative to the use of fossil fuels to provide the majority of power not only in Australia but around the world. The facts about increasing access to energy and making energy cheaper in the developing world are all about expanding the use, responsibly, of fossil fuels, and that will not change with the current technology mix. This motion should be treated with the contempt that the empty slogans and the hypocritical statements of the Greens constantly illustrate to this chamber.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:13):  I first must express some concern that the Greens would move such a misleading a motion as we have seen here today. Of course I would be concerned that the Greens who are only too happy to tell us that they have a monopoly on environmental concerns have really failed to address some basic questions about the importance not so much of state policy issues but of national policy questions. 


In fact, I would take the motion much more seriously if Senator Di Natale was able to tell us why in 2009 the Greens torpedoed the establishment of an ETS in this country. When they had the chance to develop an effective ETS arrangement, they chose to side with the knuckle-draggers from the Liberal Party in opposing concrete measures that could be taken to seriously affect our carbon emissions in this country.


But let me talk about national policies in more contemporary terms. The renewable energy target under the Abbott government has been quite strongly attacked. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources we understand is very importantly associated with the RET. The requirement that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity be generated from renewable sources by 2020 is a very worthwhile policy objective and, of course, it is an important policy instrument through the RET. The Abbott government's appointment of a review, chaired by a well-known climate change sceptic, none other than Dick Warburton, undermined the somewhat broadly accepted scientific consensus on the values and the importance of climate change and produced recommendations which would effectively render the RET policies pointless.


Labor refused to go along with that agenda. While we are open to negotiations on adjustments of the target, we do not support undermining it. We have tried to discuss these matters with the government but it has become perfectly clear that the real intent of the government is to undermine the RET and, as a consequence, Labor has had no choice but to withdraw from those discussions. We will not repudiate the target and we will not betray the renewable energy industry and all those who work in it.


Daniel Andrews, the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria, has made it clear that that is the position the Victorian Labor Party pursues as well and that any Victorian government led by the Labor Party and Daniel Andrews would promote renewable energy sources, but of course that will depend upon the national policy positions which have been adopted. In that respect, the buck stops with Mr Abbott. While Mr Warburton's committee was conducting its deliberations, I must say I visited towns in western Victoria where the fate of the RET and the renewable energy industry is a matter of deep, immediate concern to those communities. 


In the Western District and in many parts of rural Victoria, the RET is all about jobs and jobs that sustain communities. It is the uncertainty about the RET, created in the first place by the Warburton review and now by the government's insistence on substantially cutting the target that is putting those jobs at risk. In Ararat, a $450 million wind farm project had been stalled by the government's announcement of the Warburton review. RES Australia, the wind farm developer, said that the project would not go ahead if the target is changed. The same doubts have also been put out about wind farms in the Pyrenees, the North Grampians and neighbouring shires of Ararat. 


Uncertainty continues around Victoria where 17 wind farms are considered unlikely to proceed if the RET is cut, at the cost of 6,400 jobs. The Abbott government has never concealed its contempt for the renewable energy industry. The Treasurer notoriously described wind farms as 'a blot on the landscape'. I heard similar sentiments expressed by Senator Ryan here a few minutes ago. When the people of Ararat and other Victorian towns affected by the government's hostility to renewables look at the wind turbines on hillsides, they do not see a blot. They see a source of jobs, of construction, of drought-proofing incomes for farmers who own the land, of cash flows to small businesses and of revenue to local councils which are able to build community services. This has been done at a time of great environmental crisis. That is what we ought be discussing here. 


The Prime Minister and the government apparently think there is not a lot to like about the position that has been taken by many world leaders. We saw President Obama just recently making some observations about the importance of climate change to this country and to so many others. The government do not want to argue the case because there is no credible answer to put to the people of Ararat, the Pyrenees or the Grampians, to the people who know that their jobs can depend upon the development of renewable energy, who will, of course, understand the importance of the development of new industries. There is no credible answer to be given to people who ask why they no longer have a place in an industry that is crucial to the building of a sustainable future for the people of Victoria.


While the Abbott government goes about persisting on cutting the RET, we know that that position will be fiercely contested by Labor and will be fiercely contested by Daniel Andrews if he is elected Premier on Saturday. Strong indications suggest that the people of Victoria are tired of the fact that the coalition government has failed to stand up for their interests and has failed to defend them against the onslaught by the conservative government in Canberra. Tony Abbott knows that. That is why his Liberal colleagues have made it very clear that they do not want him anywhere near the Victorian election campaign because ordinary Victorians are onto him. They know what happened before the last election and about all the promises that were made, and the betrayals which have occurred since. We know the promises in health and we know the promises in education. We also understand that the government in Canberra does not want to see the development of new renewable energy industries in Ararat or in towns just like it.


The other great controversy which has emerged concerns the timber industry in Gippsland. I know some would like to see this as a very emotive issue. It affects the livelihoods of 600 people at the Maryvale mill, a $2 billion investment. It is the largest privately owned pulp mill facility in Australia. I know that the CFMEU and the workers in the industry have demonstrated their bona fides because of what I have seen in Tasmania. I know that the environmental groups in Tasmania were prepared to sit with workers in the industry and the environmental groups were prepared to work through serious issues with serious people about security, real environmental sustainability, real jobs and real prosperity 


I know that the CFMEU actually took those industry agreements to a secret ballot of their members and that they were carried by those men and women who work in that industry. And those agreements have been stuck to; those agreements have been delivered. Even when this government—this Canberra government—wanted to remove the heritage listing of forests in Tasmania, those workers and employers stuck to those arrangements. I am equally confident that the same process will be followed in Victoria, because serious people who are serious about jobs and the future of Gippsland know that the only way to sort these issues is to actually get around a table and make binding commitments to one another about preserving jobs and the environment, and ensuring economic prosperity of the region.


Environmental groups will insist that solutions can be found. The Greens, however, have a long history of opposing such approaches. I take the view that, if you want to save the forests and if you want to be able to ensure that you save forest communities, you ensure that there are proper discussions— (Time expired)

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:23):  Our environment is under attack like never before, and we are feeling it in Victoria. We are facing climate disaster due to our reliance on polluting fossil fuels and we are seeing unprecedented species loss. Our dig-it-up and ship-it-out mentality to our natural resources prevails in the face of all evidence that this is an unsustainable way to manage our economy and our environment. Tony Abbott wants to make our environment laws even weaker—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Senator Rice, would you refer to the Prime Minister by his appropriate title.




Senator RICE:
  Prime Minister Abbott wants to make our environment laws even weaker, hacking away at vital safeguards and calling it 'cutting red and green tape'. It is selling out our future. We cannot leave protecting Australia's environment up to the states. As my colleagues in this place have pointed out time and time again, if we had given state governments sole control of national environmental law in the past, the Franklin River would be dammed, there would be oil rigs on the Great Barrier Reef, we would have cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park and the Traveston dam would have gone ahead—all with outrageous environmental impacts. The Greens are standing up to the Abbott government's plan to hand off national environment law to the states.


We are also working in our own patches for a clean, green future. In my home state, Victorians have welcomed with open arms my state Greens colleagues' environmental policies and initiatives that we are taking to this weekend's state election, because we know that the health of our economy will be based on how well we shift to a clean energy economy and protect our natural heritage. We understand that a healthy economy, healthy society and healthy environment are completely interconnected; you cannot have one without the other. We need to be building our natural capital rather than destroying it. Shifting to a clean energy economy is a win-win-win—providing jobs, building wealth and creating a safe climate and healthy environment all at once.


Victoria stands to lose so much from climate change, and we do not see our federal government standing up against the threats. Our farmers are facing a bleak future, with the threat of worse and more prolonged droughts. This summer is looking like it is going to be particularly grim. Global warming threatens to reduce Australia's livestock carrying capacity by in the vicinity of 40 per cent. Crops like canola, wheat and barley will be absolutely challenged by increasing temperatures. Heat waves are going to hit Victoria like never before. People living in Melbourne and other urban centres are going to suffer health threats. Excessively hot days will take a huge toll on our community's most vulnerable. The young, the elderly and the sick suffer most on hot days, and this is worsened in the centre of our cities. Heat-related deaths will increase, and we need a plan that is going to effectively mitigate this threat.


The increase in prevalence and severity of extreme weather associated with climate change is going to place a huge strain on Victoria. No-one wants to live through bushfires like those we saw in 2009. While Prime Minister Abbott and his government insists on wrecking our land, our water and our environment, the Greens in Victoria have a set of ideas that respond to 21st-century challenges. We have a plan to retire dirty coal plants and create jobs as we shift to renewable energy. In Victoria, we have the dubious honour of producing the dirtiest energy. But we do not need so many brown coal electricity generators. Renewable energy has been doing its job, and we now have an excess of electricity in the grid. So shifting and really encouraging that transition to clean energy generation makes sense for our environment and it makes sense for jobs. More people are employed putting solar panels on roofs than in the entire coalmining industry. Clean energy is not a threat but an employment opportunity right around Victoria for places like Anglesea and the Latrobe Valley.


We can shift our energy mix to wean Victoria off coal. We support communities threatened by mining companies and want a permanent ban on fracking, onshore gas and new coalmines in Victoria, because Victorians want to see a fast shift away from fossil fuels to a clean energy future. We plan to support the growth of wind farms, creating jobs and investment in our regional areas. And we want to establish the Great Forest National Park, just east of Melbourne, for all Victorians to enjoy, rather than leaving it shut off for all but those who drive the loggers' trucks. This important plan will protect the habitat and ecosystem of our animal emblem, the Leadbeater's possum, which we expect is going to be reclassified as critically endangered next month. We need the national park for tourism, for regional revitalisation and for opening up Victoria's forests for generations to enjoy. I must address the furphy that by establishing national parks you are increasing bushfire risk. The science shows very clearly that, if you leave forests to grow old, they are less susceptible to fire, and that younger forests, such as those created by regeneration after clear-fell logging, are much more susceptible to fire and are putting our communities at risk.


The good news is: we have enough plantation estate to serve our wood products industry. Already, over two-thirds of Victoria's wood production comes from plantations, and it is increasing every year. Only 10 per cent of forest industry jobs in Victoria are in native forests, and they are in decline. The growth for our timber industry is in plantations. We can all agree on this. The way to end the rancour and the division is to accept that we need to move industrial scale logging out of our native forests and we need to base our wood products industry on plantations. But we are going backwards. What is left of our native forests is under threat. The Prime Minister and his government are falling into lock step with their Victorian mates who want to perpetuate the destruction of our native forests and subsidise those who do this dirty work. The government's direct action policy is, sadly, set to do just this. The clean energy package which it replaced specifically did not allow the use of wood from native forests to be used as part of a carbon farming initiative or to be eligible for renewable energy certificates—for good reason.


Woodchipping has been cast as an industry that uses 'waste' wood, but, in reality it is the tail that wags the dog. Twice as many logs get sent off as chip logs as sawlogs. Over 80 per cent of the volume of wood that comes out of our forests ends up as woodchips. And now, just as the global market for Australian woodchips is in decline—as we have been outcompeted by plantation chips from elsewhere in the world—the woodchip mill in Eden is about to stop taking chips from East Gippsland, as forest furnaces to burn native forest wood are set to take over. We have already seen what is likely to be in store. Brickworks, the Liberal Party's very large donor, announced—immediately after the announcement of the direct action package—that they were very interested in the potential of using native forest wood to feed their kilns. This is not renewable energy. This is not something that should be supported under a carbon farming initiative aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change. In using native forest based wood and perpetuating industrial scale logging of our forests, it is going to increase the impact of climate change and reduce our carbon stores. It is going exactly in the wrong direction.


The carbon density of Victoria's forests is incredible, which is why they are so important as carbon stores.  We have centuries-old trees that rival California's redwoods in their size and in their environmental significance. Our mountain ash is the tallest hardwood tree in the world. It grows extraordinarily quickly, reaching its maximum height in 200 years—five times faster than the redwoods—but it is as carbon stores that our mountain ash forests are the world's best. They store three times as much carbon as the forests of the American Pacific Northwest. These forest ecosystems, just to the north-east of Melbourne, do the heavy lifting in maintaining our carbon stores. 


Beyond Zero Emissions had a session here at Parliament House today and said that protecting our native forests, leaving them to recover, is the best thing we can be doing to sequester carbon in Australia. We have got only one per cent of our original forest cover left in Victoria, yet our governments federally and in Victoria are standing by while our money is being spent on subsidising the clear fell logging of these forests. Together we can protect what we love about Australia. We must protect our land, our water and our natural wonders so that we can have them to share for generations to come.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-11-25,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:33):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. A vote for the state coalition government on Saturday in Victoria will deliver strong environmental policies to address climate change and safeguard natural resources in Victoria. What we have before us is proof from the Greens that they struggle to understand the far-reaching implications that the imbalance of the state coalition government has upon Victoria. Far from ignoring climate change and not safeguarding our natural resources, the Victorian government has progressively worked on these issues over the past four years. 


The Greens and Labor do not understand that our government, with the Victorian coalition, is committed to environmental standards that also manage to protect the small businesses and families that we are all here to protect. Since coming into office in 2010, the Victorian government has struck a balance, ensuring that we can preserve our environment and natural resources, not damage small communities and still stimulate business investment. The Greens have never managed to find a policy that strikes this balance, and their support for the carbon tax is a clear indication that they cannot safeguard our natural resources or find a pragmatic solution to climate change.


I have spoken many times about the effects that the carbon tax had on my constituents in Victoria, but I feel I must remind the Senate today, because those opposite are clearly incapable of grasping how drastic their policies were. Electricity prices soared with the implementation of the carbon tax. In the few short months since the coalition removed the carbon tax, we have seen electricity prices fall by 8.9 per cent for Victorian households and 10.7 per cent for Victorian businesses. The Treasury has also suggested that abolition of the carbon tax will reduce costs to the Australian consumer by about $550. But let's consider the practical implications this tax had on some typical Victorians that I represent. Dairy farmers were significantly impacted by the carbon tax, as I have spoken about several times in this place. They saw a 41 per cent increase in their electricity costs. This industry was disproportionately impacted because of milking machinery, milk storage and processes. Dairy farmers, along with many other farmers, struggled to pass their costs on to consumers and so they bore the burden of the last government's poorly constructed environmental policy.


I would like to commend the Victorian government for implementing goals that focus on uniting communities, business and local government in addressing climate change and preserving natural resources. Since 2011-12, the Victorian government has invested $3.1 billion in the environment and climate change portfolio. This investment has been channelled to the management of land, forests and parks, ambitious environmental programs and fire and emergency management. The coalition has been committed to ensuring that a wide variety of environmental concerns are addressed in a multitude of ways. So do not believe the rhetoric. Do not believe the hype. Senator Di Natale comes in, Senator Rice comes in, and they like to claim that the Victorian state government is not concerned about our national parks, is not concerned about the Leadbeater's possum, is not concerned about ensuring that Victorians have a healthy and sustainable future—which, in and of itself requires a healthy and sustainable environment. It is a no-brainer. Of course the state government is working towards that end. 


Far from ignoring the threat of climate change, Victoria is indirectly supporting national emissions mitigation efforts, through the Commonwealth's Direct Action Plan. Australia's most comprehensive adaptation plan to increase resilience to fire, floods, drought, reduced snowfall and sea level rise has been released by the Victorian government. But the research has been focused on various ways to address climate change. For example, Victoria has invested in new forms of technology. The focus has been on practical action that has tangible results and delivers value for money and on continuing to invest in programs that improve sustainability outcomes.


Since 2010—you do not like to hear it, but please listen up; I have got some good news for you—over $12 million in grants have been awarded to research and development and pilot projects harnessing renewable resources, including wave, solar, geothermal and biomass. If you listened to those opposite, you would think that the Victorian state government is not doing anything in respect of these issues. The cold, hard facts are that it is more than adequately addressing them.


I also want to commend the Victorian government on the implementation of the Environmental Partnerships Program. This proves more than ever that we are a government that can find the balance. We are the side of politics that can get a triple bottom line occurring—good community outcomes, good economic outcomes based on sound economic principles, and environmental sustainability. Unless you have a healthy environment and a sound and stable fiscal position, people and communities are not going to thrive and prosper. But, if you tip that balance too far towards the environment, you are not going to ensure that communities can prosper, that families can remain healthy and safe. Senator Rice, I see you are shaking your head. You were not in this place for the Murray-Darling Basin conversation.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Address your comments to the chair, Senator McKenzie.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Through you, Chair. But it got pretty ugly along the Murray in our state of Victoria when the previous government decided to roll out the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Senator Hanson-Young was railing loud and proud about the amount of sustainable take that could be taken out of the system. We now know that was incredibly poor advice from Senator Hanson-Young. Our home state has managed to find environmental efficiencies to ensure a healthy river. As the water makes its way through New South Wales, along our beautiful Murray down into South Australia, the sustainable take is much less than Senator Hanson-Young claimed. That is due to the fact that we chose to invest in infrastructure throughout irrigation districts that ensured businesses could still prosper, families could stay on their farms, communities could remain economically viable and the environment could still get the water. 


We hear the emotive arguments of the Greens and can get wrapped up in the hyper-rhetoric that they bring to the table. It is going on throughout my home state of Victoria right now, particularly around regional areas. It is just based on whipping up fear in uninformed communities. The fact is, when you put your heads together, sit down with communities and businesses and think about viable alternatives, you can get a triple bottom line. That is what this government is committed to doing.


The Environmental Partnerships Program aims to work with local communities and land managers to achieve positive outcomes for the environment through initiatives like committing more than $9 million to the Coastal Environments Program, supporting on-ground coastal risk management works; a commitment to plant two million trees across regional Victoria and metropolitan Melbourne; the $20 million Communities for Nature grants program, enabling local groups to carry out important on-ground works to conserve and enhance the local environment; investing nearly $16 million to protect priority habitat and threatened species; and investing $9 million over four years to renourish key beaches in Port Phillip Bay, by reintroducing sand to beaches depleted of sustainable sand levels by storm events and coastal processes. 


This goes exactly to Senator Di Natale's scare campaign on the Leadbeater's possum issue. The Victorian government is fully committed to implementing all 13 recommendations from the Leadbeater's Possum Advisory Group, with $11 million committed for implementation. For Senator Di Natale to stand up and spruik the fact that our state faunal emblem is going extinct and will have to be rediscovered for the second time in the last hundred years is absolute bollocks. The state government has committed $11 million to implement all the recommendations. This is what environmental policy should look like. This is how to safeguard natural resources—bottom-up consultation, discovering what communities and businesses and people can do and how government can assist them. It reminds me of a community that has approached me on numerous occasions, the Mountain Cattlemen's Association. It is about getting the balance right and how we sustainably and safely use our natural resources for the forest industry, to ensure the Leadbeater's possum habitat is maintained and to ensure that communities like the mountain cattlemen can access those economic resources in our national parks to continue their economic and cultural practices. We can get it right.


Look at the water policy of past Labor governments in our state. The desalination plant is an albatross around Victorians' necks. The $75 million north-south pipeline, which we are still paying for, never delivered a drop for Melbourne. That is what happens when you let the Labor Party and the Greens control environmental policy at a state level. We are getting the balance right. We are reducing red and green tape and ensuring that we can get economic growth out into the regions, into our communities, while safeguarding our natural resources. That is exactly what good governance looks like. Vote 1 coalition.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:43):  I rise to note for the Senate the excellent work that the Victorian Leader of the Opposition, Daniel Andrews, and his team have been doing in their election campaign against what four leading Victorian environmental groups have described as a government with the 'worst record on the environment since the 1960s'. Let me just repeat that: the Napthine record has the worst record on the environment since the 1960s. Just like our federal Abbott government, with its Victorian based federal Minister for the Environment, Denis Napthine has presided over a wholesale attack on the state's environmental assets. These four environmental groups and their members have never witnessed a government with such a callous indifference to the environment. For those of us observing this federal government hack its way into Australia's environmental protections and the climate change framework, increasing the clear and present danger to Australia's national environmental security, the numerous examples of the Victorian coalition's callous indifference to the environment are all too familiar. They are all too similar to what we have witnessed in the federal arena when it comes to a lack of support, let alone care for our environment. So they present the template and an alarming warning for the two years left of the Abbott government's term in office. What are they? Let us have a look. 


Since 2010 Victorian coalition governments have, one, scrapped the Victorian emissions reduction target of 20 per cent by 2020 implemented by the Brumby government; two, abandoned Victoria's solar target of five per cent of Victoria's power coming from solar energy and made it almost impossible to get approvals for new wind farms; three, promoted coalmining, gas extraction and the coal export industry; four, extended the life of ageing and polluting Anglesea and Hazelwood coalmines and power stations; five, allowed loggers to operate in threatened species habitats; six, attempted to abolish energy efficiency targets; and, seven, slashed jobs at Parks Victoria. So it is no wonder that a study conducted recently by the Climate Council found that Victoria has the worst policy environment for renewable energy in Australia. In fact, its report said a comparison of each state's renewable energy sector found Victoria was the worst-performing state.


Matt Ruchel, the Executive Director of the Victorian National Parks Association, said:


I’ve not come across a government so openly hostile to conservation. I suspect they consider it some sort of war.


Well he could have just as easily been talking about the Abbott government, a government that views the environment as an obstacle to be quickly cleared, not as an asset to be properly managed. Similarly, when Mr Wakeham, the CEO of the state's peak group Environment Victoria, said he was surprised by how aggressively anti-environment the government proved to be after it won the 2010 Victorian election without releasing an environment policy during the campaign he might have been referring again to the Abbott government, whose only environmental policies before the election were to abolish the carbon price and to revoke—and we will never forget this embarrassing step—the World Heritage listing for some of Tasmania's most amazing forests, which was something UNESCO overturned and threw out the window.


Mr Wakeham described the Napthine government as 'totally out of step with where public opinion is at'. He said:


Not only have they been poor on the environment; they have actively attacked environmental protections. They’re not ‘do nothing’.


That is a description that rings equally and shamefully true of the Abbott government's approach to the environment, whether it is looking at the Abbott government's ripping up of the management plans of marine parks, looking at the rebuke of its bipartisan support for the renewable energy target or looking at the fact that we now no longer have any sort of legal cap on carbon pollution in this country, leaving us as the only country to go backwards on climate change. I could go on and on with the backflips and the lack of action by this Abbott government on the environment but, having said that, I am focusing today on the Napthine government. 


There are so many similarities between the two governments. They have both attacked—and undermined of course in doing so—Australia's environmental security at every turn. However, an Andrews Victorian Labor government will respond to these attacks by addressing renewable energy, including the restrictive planning laws of the current government, strengthening protections and oversight for coastal and marine reserve management as well as riparian environments. Only last week we heard that an Andrews Labor government will make Newstead on the Loddon River Victoria's first solar town by transitioning it to renewable energy. Those words from Daniel Andrews certainly must be a breath of fresh air for Victorians who know that they will have a leader who will address the issues of renewable energy, which so many Victorian voters so desperately want. I attended one of the Solar Council's forums in Victoria only a couple of months ago. Over 300 people turned out. Of course the focus there was on the renewable energy target but it was very much on solar energy. So many Victorians wanted to continue to see an increase in solar power and an increase in renewable energy. I know that Victorians will be very pleased to hear from the Andrews Victorian Labor team about how it will very much invest in renewable energy. 


Through solar power and energy storage Newstead residents will be able to rely on 100 per cent renewable energy to power their homes and businesses by 2017. What a formidable campaign to have. To underpin this project Labor will ensure that small renewable energy projects can have fair access to the existing grid and that distribution businesses are more responsive to distributed energy proposals. Labor will also ask the Essential Services Commission to inquire into the true value to the grid of distributed generation. I recently joined the Victorian shadow minister for energy and resources, my friend and colleague Ms Lily D'Ambrosio, at the save our solar forum in Ringwood. What she promised was:


Not only will the residents in Newstead reduce their reliance on coal fired power and cut their carbon footprint, they will be driving down household costs through cheaper energy bills.


So not only is this about a win for the environment; this is about a win for consumers. This is about a win for families. It is going to drive down the costs of energy bills. It could not get any better. She said:


… Labor will work with the community in Newstead to help them to achieve their goal of moving to renewable energy by 2017.


Newstead will be a leading example of what can be achieved when locals and government work together. It will take an Andrews Labor Government for this to happen.


I agree totally with Shadow Minister D'Ambrosio on that. Labor will also reboot the Victorian wind energy industry, which will employ thousands of Victorians and create energy for Victorian homes. Labor will also create the $20 million New Energy Jobs Fund, which will offer grants of up to $1 million to firms and companies specialising in high-growth renewable sectors like renewable energy technology. Mr Andrews and the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party are going into this election armed with the policies to beat back the conservative attack on Victoria's environment, and I wish him and the people of Victoria good luck.

The speech read as follows—



AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2014


Australian citizenship is something to be treasured. It is a common bond which unites us all, whether we were born here or chose to make Australia our home. Australian citizenship involves a commitment to this country and its people. It is a privilege which should not be taken lightly.


This year, we celebrate the 65th anniversary of Australian citizenship. It is therefore appropriate to review the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to ensure that it upholds the value of our citizenship. This Bill, the Australian Citizenship and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2014, supports the integrity and effectiveness of the citizenship programme, providing a clear legislative framework to underpin the government's policy. 


The Bill has a range of amendments grouped into three broad themes:


strengthening programme integrity;


underlining the importance of connection to Australia; and


improving decision-making. 


The first theme is strengthening programme integrity.


Currently under the Citizenship Act revocation may be considered in cases where a person has acquired Australian citizenship 'by application' and:


has been convicted of making a false statement or misrepresentation in relation to a migration or citizenship application that resulted in them becoming an Australian citizen; or


has committed a serious criminal offence prior to becoming an Australian citizen, failed to disclose it on application, and is convicted of the offence after making an application to become an Australian citizen. A serious offence is one where a person was sentenced to death or a prison sentence of 12 months or more. This provision applies to serious criminal offences committed in Australia or overseas; or


has acquired citizenship since 1 July 2007 as a result of third party fraud where the third party who committed the offence has been convicted of the offence.


After one or more of these criteria have been met, the Minister then must be satisfied that it would be contrary to the public interest for the person to remain an Australian citizen. 


The Minister can revoke Australian citizenship where a person acquires it 'by application'. This means through conferral, descent, or adoption in accordance with the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption.


The Bill expands the Minister's power to revoke citizenship when satisfied that the person became a citizen as a result of fraud or misrepresentation, by allowing revocation without a prior criminal conviction for fraud. Law enforcement agencies and courts have limited capacity to prosecute all cases of fraud, or any other type of criminal behaviour, thereby reducing the ability of the government to ensure that high community expectations of behaviour are maintained in respect of those who obtain Australian citizenship. In line with other revocation provisions, I intend that the Minister must be satisfied that it would be contrary to the public interest for the person to remain a citizen.



The Citizenship Act has two mechanisms for assessing the character of an applicant.


The ""good character requirement"" extends to everyone who applies to become a citizen aged 18 years and over. The Bill amends these provisions to require applicants aged under 18 to also be of good character. Character concerns are not limited to adults and indeed my department has had serious concerns about the character of certain applicants aged under 18. In practice, the change will mean that my department may now seek to obtain police clearances for 16-17 year olds. We would also be able to assess the character of youths younger than 16 if the department becomes aware of particularly relevant character issues.


Secondly, the Act currently prevents the Minister from approving a person becoming a citizen by conferral in circumstances related to criminal offences. The Bill promotes consistency by providing that this bar on approval will also apply to applicants for citizenship by descent, adoption under Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption and resumption. 


In addition, the Bill amends the offence provisions to reflect modern sentencing practices, including where a person is subject to a court order for home detention or when they have not been sentenced to prison but are nonetheless under obligations to a court.


The Act currently provides that approval of citizenship by conferral for adult applicants may be cancelled, prior to the Pledge of commitment being taken, in certain limited circumstances. The Bill amends this provision to meet current challenges to programme integrity and extends the cancellation powers to cover applicants aged under 18.


The Bill provides that approval must be cancelled if the Minister is no longer satisfied of the applicant's identity or if they have become a risk to national security. The Bill further provides that the Minister may cancel approval if satisfied that the person no longer meets other eligibility requirements.


The Bill extends the maximum period of time where the Minister can delay an applicant making the Pledge of commitment from 12 months to two years, recognising that investigations into whether there are grounds for cancellation can take longer than 12 months.


The Bill introduces safeguards to the provision giving automatic citizenship to those whose adoptions are finalised in Australia, by requiring such adoptions to be commenced before the applicant turned 18. This amendment is particularly concerned with preventing clients seeking adoption as adults to avoid being removed from Australia after their visas were cancelled under the Migration Act because they were no longer of good character. 


The second theme is underlining the importance of connection to Australia.


Most applicants for citizenship by conferral must have been present in Australia for four years prior to making a citizenship application. However, there has been some confusion about when this four year period commences, leading to different interpretations by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal - the AAT. Therefore, the Bill clarifies the start date for this period. 


The Bill clarifies the scope of the ministerial discretion to allow overseas absences to count towards the residence requirement for spouses and de facto partners of Australian citizens. It was a guiding principle in the new Citizenship Act in 2007 that partners should qualify for citizenship in their own right, not just as the partner of a citizen. The Bill therefore entrenches the policy position that the discretion should only be considered if the applicant has spent at least 365 days in Australia in the four years immediately before application. It is important that applicants spend a sufficient amount of time here to understand what being Australian means. Indeed, they must have a connection to Australia, not just to an Australian. The Bill also inserts definitions of spouse and de facto partner, aligning them with the definitions in the Migration Act.


People are eligible to acquire citizenship automatically if they are born in Australia to an Australian citizen or permanent resident parent, or if they are ordinarily resident in Australia until their 10th birthday. The Bill limits automatic acquisition of citizenship on the 10th birthday to those persons who have maintained lawful residence in Australia throughout the 10 years, including maintaining a right to return if they travel outside Australia during those years. These amendments will not affect access to citizenship by children born in Australia to New Zealand citizens or children who are stateless. 


In addition, the Bill clarifies that a child born to a parent who was in Australia with diplomatic or consular privileges and immunities cannot automatically acquire citizenship if they are still living here on their 10th birthday. This amendment reflects the policy position that such children are not considered to be ""ordinarily resident"" in Australia but are here for a special or temporary purpose only. It would not apply if the child's other parent is an Australian citizen or permanent resident.


The Bill also amends the provision giving citizenship to children found abandoned in Australia so it is consistent with the original policy intent, which is to reflect Australia's international obligations under the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.


The Bill improves the legal position of citizens by descent who are registered as Australian citizens but are later found not to have been eligible to be so registered. Under the current law, these people are automatically taken never to have been a citizen. The Bill repeals this provision and replaces it with a discretion for the Minister to revoke citizenship where a person was registered despite not meeting the requirements for registration. This would allow the circumstances of the particular case to be taken into account when deciding if citizenship of such a person should be revoked. 


The third theme is improving decision-making.


In line with the Prime Minister's commitment to facilitate adoptions, the Bill improves access to citizenship by conferral for children who are granted an adoption visa overseas and whose adoption is finalised overseas, allowing them to enter Australia as citizens. Adopted children can encounter difficulties acquiring a document to travel to Australia if not an Australian citizen.


Most applicants for citizenship have come to Australia as migrants and the department has collected personal information about them under the Migration Act. This personal information is relevant when the person applies for citizenship. Likewise, personal information collected about a person under the Citizenship Act can be relevant if the department is considering whether to cancel the person's visa after a citizenship application has been refused. To ensure that the use and disclosure of personal information within the department complies with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988, the Bill provides that personal information collected under one Act and associated regulations may be used and disclosed for the purposes of the other Act and associated regulations.


The Bill aligns the merits review requirements for conferral applicants aged under 18 with the relevant requirements for citizenship by conferral to prevent unfounded review applications tying up the resources of the AAT.


On occasion, the Minister makes personal decisions under the Act. The Bill makes it clear that the Minister can specify that such a decision is made in the public interest. As it is not appropriate for merits review to be available in respect of decisions that have been made by the Minister personally the Bill protects them from merits review. Judicial review will remain available.


The Bill also provides the Minister with a power to personally set aside certain decisions of the AAT if it is in the public interest to do so. I am concerned that some decisions made by the AAT have led to outcomes that are outside the community standards that citizenship policy is intended to meet, including recent occasions where the AAT found that people were of good character despite having been convicted of child sexual offences, manslaughter, people smuggling or domestic violence. 


These amendments to protect the Minister's personal decisions from merits review and to allow the Minister to set aside decisions of the AAT in certain circumstances will bring the Minister's powers under the Citizenship Act in line with similar powers under the Migration Act. 


The Bill also provides the Minister with a power to make legislative instruments. Such instruments may cover issues such as the currencies and exchange rates for fee payment, eliminating the need to amend the Citizenship Regulations every six months. 




Conclusion



In conclusion, this Bill will result in more consistent decisions on applications for citizenship, bringing fairness and clarity to clients. The amendments uphold the value of Australian citizenship by preserving the integrity of the programme. The amendments will also ensure the connection between the applicant and Australia, helping them to understand the heritage that we share as citizens, an inheritance that is ours to steward, protect and enjoy.


I commend this Bill to the Chamber.

I was of the understanding that the Attorney-General would be here to speak to the bill, because I have some questions indeed for the Attorney-General and he might have some amendments to move as well.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:44):  Perhaps I could facilitate matters by pre-empting the government in moving their amendments and indicate the Labor opposition's position with respect to those amendments. It might save the committee some time later in the discussion. It has consistently been Labor's position that all national security legislation should be rigorously examined to make sure not only will it be effective in protecting our nation but also that it does not unduly infringe on important rights and freedoms. In keeping with that position, Labor insisted to the government that these three new measures be introduced in a separate bill and subject to public scrutiny and a full Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security inquiry. In its report the intelligence committee recommended the bill be passed and made 15 substantive recommendations. Significant recommendations include amendment to the bill to require the AFP to provide the Attorney-General with a summary of facts when seeking consent to apply to the court for each control order, including any facts why it should not be made; retention of the requirement for the AFP to explain to the issuing court each condition in a draft control order—the bill, as introduced, would only require the AFP to justify the control order as a whole; shortening of periods for notification of the relevant minister where agencies issue emergency authorisations; that the government urgently appoint a new Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and task it with reviewing whether recommendations for safeguards on the control order regime recommended by the 2013 COAG review should be implemented; and finally, it recommended a range of oversight measures.


Labor has asked the government to implement those recommendations and the government has agreed to do so. Labor will accordingly support the bill. The recommendations will improve the accountability and transparency of decision making by national security agencies. The recommendations will also ensure that control order applications are closely and appropriately scrutinised.


In the absence of the Attorney, I might move through government amendments number by number, although that possibly would not have been necessary had the Attorney been here to move them. I notice the Attorney is here, so I will let him proceed with his amendments.

I should add that there are also some recommendations by the PJCIS for amendments to the explanatory memorandum and those amendments will be made when a revised explanatory memorandum is tabled in the House of Representatives. Beyond that, that is all I have to say.

We are pleased that the government has introduced amendments to act many of the 15 recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and we consider that these changes constitute the absolute minimum necessary to begin to bring the bill closer to what is acceptable in terms of incursions on human rights and civil liberties. However, it is our view that these remain seriously inadequate to remedy the full range of human rights concerns that have been raised by many organisations and, indeed, by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights of this parliament.


There are three of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security recommendations that are not reflected in the government's amendments and I would like to take the opportunity to ask the Attorney-General about those and why the government was not minded to take up those recommendations. The first I want to advert to is the PJCIS recommendation 1, which refers to the need to finalise the appointment of an Independent National Security Legislation Monitor 'as a matter of absolute urgency', to quote that recommendation. Attorney-General, given that the government has stated in the media that it accepts this recommendation, when can we expect to see a fully-qualified, well-resourced person in this role, given that there has never been a time when a person in that role has ever been needed as much as they are today.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:51):  There is always a time when an Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is needed. Even more importantly though, it is important that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor be heeded. Unfortunately, when the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor was eventually appointed by the previous government, none of his reports was responded to in a timely fashion. In fact, when the government changed 14 months ago, we inherited most of the reports of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor which had not even been responded to by the previous government and they have been responded to by this government. Senator Wright, you or one of your colleagues asked me about this recently, and I said that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor would be appointed soon. I think I can tell you, Senator Wright, that I have written to the Prime Minister—who ultimately makes the appointment—recommending some names, with one preferred name of someone who, I think, would satisfy you as a man of very, very great eminence and suitability. I expect that that announcement will be made any day now.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (17:53):  Thank you, Attorney-General. It is interesting that you have often waxed eloquent about the importance of the role and, indeed, you have often claimed credit for being one of the people who moved to have the role introduced after the initial tranche of national security legislation was introduced during the Howard government. But, with respect, you cannot have it all ways. We have to actually look at not the talk but the walk. We have had this office vacant for seven months. Prior to that, you acknowledge that, in fact, your government was going to abolish the position. Given the importance that you put on the role, you will be very pleased to hear that I will be introducing a private senator's bill to require that the role be filled with alacrity in the future and that, indeed, the reports of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor be responded to by governments within a timely period. I agree with you that it has been somewhat scandalous that report after report has not been heeded, as you say. With respect, I would suggest that it is now an opportunity for your government to take those previous reports seriously and to heed them now. Certainly, one of the major concerns that was consistently raised by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor was with the control order regime—and we will come back to that in some questions that I have for you later. As much as it is nice to hear that soon we may have someone within that office, what kind of heed has the government paid to the previous discussion of the control order regime by the INSLM? And how can you point to that being reflected in the legislation that we are considering today?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:54):  The legislation speaks for itself. The government has reviewed the whole range of Australia's counter-terrorism laws. We do not necessarily share the views of the previous INSLM. The INSLM is a person who contributes in a well-informed and intelligent way to the thinking of the government of the day and, indeed, to the thinking of the parliament. That does not mean that the INSLM is like a final authority on the policy merits of any particular proposal. The policy merits of the particular proposal is ultimately a matter for the government of the day, subject to the will of the parliament. The government respectfully disagreed with some of the views about the control order regime of the former Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, and our views were closer to the views expressed by the COAG review of these laws. The fact that you had one respected person of one mind and another respected person of another mind, neither of them political partisans, should tell you that there is a variety of views about this. But the view of the parliament, or at least the view of the overwhelming sentiment of the parliament as reflected in the unanimous report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, should tell you that both sides of politics—not, of course, you 'Green' people—are of the view that there is a role for control orders. That reflects the overwhelming sentiment of the elected representatives sitting in parliament. It reflects, no doubt, the overwhelming sentiment of the Australian people who want to see this government pass laws that are suitable and appropriate to deal with the issue of terrorism.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:57):  Thank you, you 'Green' Chair, Senator Whish-Wilson! No, Chair, I should be more respectful. I will take this opportunity to address in some detail the various amendments by the government. I think it might help Senator Wright, particularly on her first question where she was asking for advice from the Attorney in relation to the position on control orders. Perhaps I will address Labor's position, as reflected in these amendments, issue by issue. If the committee will bear with me, I will probably be dealing with some matters that are in what I expect will be in the second tranche of amendments that we will deal with with the next question—that certain items of schedule 1 stand as printed. But they go across issues, if the committee can bear with that.


Government amendments (1), (3) and (14) relate to requesting interim control orders. These, as with, I think, all of the amendments, are the implementation of recommendations of the intelligence committee. Labor accepts that the purpose of this bill is to improve the operation of the control order regime. We support the bill's intention to reduce unnecessary duplication of decision making by the Attorney-General and then the issuing court. However, the Attorney-General's consent is required for an application for a control order for a reason. The Attorney-General's involvement is necessary to provide an appropriate level of oversight and accountability at the highest level of executive government for the exercise of what is an extraordinary power. The intelligence committee's recommendation that the AFP provide the Attorney-General with a statement of reasons related to why a control order should be made and, also, any facts of why the order should not be made is, therefore, a very sensible suggestion. These amendments strike the right balance between the operational effectiveness and appropriate oversight. For this reason, we are supporting them.


I will move now down to amendments (4) and (7) and (15) to (18) regarding details of limitations. Again, these follow the recommendations of the intelligence committee. The committee recommended retention of the requirement under the current law for the AFP to explain to an issuing court each condition in a draft control order The bill as introduced would only require the AFP to justify the control order as a whole. Again, while Labor accept that the purpose of this bill is to improve the operation of the control order regime, we would not support removal of proper testing by an issuing court of the appropriateness and necessity of proposed control orders. Control orders allow for the imposition on a person of conditions, obligations and prohibitions which deprive that person of their usual rights. It is appropriate, therefore, that each and every one of those stipulations is assessed to see whether it is necessary to Australia's national security. Labor believe that extraordinary measures like control orders must always be rigorously justified, and we support these amendments which make sure that this will be the case.


Regarding amendments (8), (10), (12) and (13) around obtaining the Attorney-General's consent, this was another recommendation of the intelligence committee. The government's bill as introduced extended the time which the AFP would have to obtain the Attorney-General's consent to an urgent interim control order from four to 12 hours. As the intelligence committee noted, it is difficult to imagine circumstances where the Attorney-General would be unable to be contacted for a period of 12 hours and that eight hours should be sufficient for any reasonable contingency. Labor agrees, and we will support the government's amendments to implement this recommendation.


We understand amendment (9) to be a technical correction. Amendment (19), regarding references to ministers, implements a recommendation from the intelligence committee. It clarifies a drafting issue the committee raised and it ensures that references to ministers in the Intelligence Services Act are taken to refer only to the most senior responsible ministers. Again, this amendment is consistent with Labor's focus on oversight and accountability. The powers granted in the act should be exercised by senior ministers with the requisite experience and departmental support. The powers granted in the act should be subject to the oversight of the most senior levels of government. 


Regarding amendments (20) to (29), this is a further intelligence committee recommendation. The amendments provide that where an agency head gives an authorisation when a minister is unavailable, the minister must be notified within eight hours. Although the bill as introduced imposed an obligation for agency heads to notify ministers as soon as practicable, the bill provides for this time period to not exceed 48 hours at the outside. There can be no justification for such a long delay. Labor supports these amendments, which will ensure that ministers are promptly notified when decisions are taken by agency heads in their absence. This will ensure the oversight and accountability that Labor insists on when powers are exercised under the Intelligence Services Act.


Finally, regarding amendment (30) and the inquiry, this amendment implements the previous intelligence committee's recommendation that new provisions of national security legislation be reviewed by the intelligence committee ahead of sunset periods, now set two years after the next federal election. Labor supports this amendment. There should be proper, sober consideration of new national security measures, and we welcome the guarantee provided by a statutory and timely review.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:03):  Coming back to the response of the Attorney-General to my question regarding the INSLM, I would observe that you are quite right, Attorney-General: we 'Green people' did not have an opportunity to be part of the Liberal-Labor club on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security because, as everybody knows, it is a committee for which sole membership is available to the two old parties and none of the crossbenchers have an opportunity to be part of that—to examine the proposed legislation, to ask questions and to hear from the witnesses in person.


Coming back to the point that you made, Attorney-General, in relation to the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor's previous recommendations and reports, you were the person who used the word 'heed' in terms of how important it is to have a person in that role and how you will be moving to have someone in that role, but again you are trying to have things all ways. You are saying that it is important to have someone to heed their reports. I have just checked, because my initial reaction was that the word 'heed' is not a neutral term. It is not a term that means just 'take note of'. It has connotations of being guided by, taken to heart, to follow, attend to, listen to, pay due regard to. I do not know what your attitude will be to the new Independent National Security Legislation Monitor that you are proposing to appoint, but it would seem to me logical and reasonable that if someone is appointed to that position—a position that is acknowledged to be an extremely important position, a position which the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security indicated should be filled with absolute urgency—it would be sensible to heed their advice. In fact, it is interesting that you suggested that, because Liberal and Labor members of parliament on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security were able to come to a consensus on the recommendations for changes to this legislation, that that would somehow reflect the overwhelming view of the Australian public. I do not think you can logically conclude that, and certainly I think it is pretty clear from the submissions in relation to this bill that the bill, as it stands—even with the amendments that are being moved by the government today—will not reflect the overwhelming views of those organisations in Australia who are in a position to understand the implications on civil liberties and human rights in Australia by dint of their longstanding work and understanding of these issues and also their experience in seeing how these sorts of issues play out overseas. 


I could come back to the fact that, much as you extol the virtues of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the government has not seen fit to pick up all the recommendations of that committee. If I could take you to recommendation 2, which refers to ensuring clarity around the terms 'supports and 'facilitates' in the provisions in the bill that extend the control order regime, certainly this is a term whose potential and vagueness has concern among people who have made submissions on the bill. Recommendation 2 was seeking to ensure clarity around the term 'supports and facilitates'. I note that the government has apparently accepted that recommendation, so, Attorney, can you please explain how these terms have been redefined in the redrafted explanatory memorandum?

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wright?




Senator WRIGHT:
  I am not going to get a response to that question, I imagine, but I do have a follow-up question. I put this to everyone really, and particularly the Attorney-General. I am not playing a game here; I am seriously interested in having clarity from the government which is proposing this legislation, to help answer, reassure people about or clarify the concerns that have been legitimately raised by organisations in Australia who are concerned about the implications of this legislation. The question is: can you, as Attorney-General, give us and give the Australian public—anyone who might be listening, or reading the Hansard transcript—an example of what this term 'supports and facilitates' will mean in context?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Brandis, I am going to get Senator Wright to repeat the very last question she asked so that you can listen to it, because you were in conversation with the Clerk.




Senator WRIGHT:
  Given that the government has accepted PJCIS recommendation No. 2, referring to ensuring the clarity around the term 'supports and facilitates' in the provisions in the bill that extend the control order regime, I am asking, Attorney, if you can give us an example of what that will mean in context.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wright, I do not have the right to call you again because you have just spoken twice.

Senator Wright asked a series of reasonable questions about the operation of the bill and the context in which it has been drafted, and I draw the Attorney-General's attention to the reasonable questions that have been put to him. This is the stage of the bill debate where senators are able to establish how the bill is going to work in practice. Chair, I ask you to draw the minister's attention to the questions that are being put to him.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I think the minister is aware of the questions that are being put to him. Senator Wright, do you want the call?

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:12):  Yes. I am going to ask a further question. With respect, I think this is an outrageous abuse of process. Some of my questions later will go to the fact that we have a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, established in this parliament, which has sought clarification on some of the same questions that I am asking. Some of that information that was sought was in relation to the previous national security law, which has now passed—the foreign fighters bill—and that committee is still waiting for clarification and answers, for justification on the basis of necessity, reasonableness and proportionality, which are an acknowledged human rights frame of reference in matters such as this. The committee is still waiting for responses from the Attorney-General in relation to that significant law affecting the rights of people living in Australia in 2014. 


This is, in my understanding, an opportunity to clarify the way this legislation will play out if it is passed. I am not abusing the process. I am asking reasonable questions, many of which have been asked by other organisations, and I can only assume that the Attorney-General does not have answers for these questions, or presumably he would be putting those answers on the record. So I am going to go now to Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security recommendation No. 7, another of the recommendations which—although I understand the government has accepted them—have not been put into the form of an amendment to this bill. This concerns schedule 2 of the bill. This is from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. This is the coalition and Labor committee. The recommendation relates to the need for clarity around what constitutes a class of Australian persons for the purposes of the expanded powers given to ASIS to conduct activities in respect of Australians overseas. My question is: given that this recommendation is accepted, how is 'class of persons' defined in the redrafted explanatory memorandum?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Before I put the question—

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:15):  I have some questions to ask. I will ask them. They will remain on the record. The Attorney-General's silence will speak for itself. I know there are many people in Australia who will be watching this with great interest. So my next question is: Attorney-General, can you give us an example of what the phrase 'class of persons' for the purposes of expanded powers given to ASIS to conduct activities in respect of Australians overseas means in context?




Senator Ludlam:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I seek a ruling from you. We have all participated in these debates before and I have never seen a minister behave like this one. I would like a ruling from you, Chair. If a minister refuses to answer a legitimate question put by a senator from any part of this chamber, the senator is entitled to put a different question. We cannot compel the minister to put information into the public domain—it is his choice—but it is the case I believe—and I am seeking your ruling, Chair—that senators are entitled to put other questions to the minister and he can choose to answer them or not.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wright, if you or Senator Ludlam have a number of questions, you will have 15 minutes to speak. You should outline those questions in the time allocated to you rather than perhaps asking them one by one. You will not be allowed to speak twice in a row. Senator Wright, after you ask one question, Senator Ludlam can ask another question but you will not be allowed to ask two questions in a row.




Senator Wright:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I have a point of order. I seek the standing orders you are referring to on those two aspects of that ruling: the first is not being able to ask two questions in a row and the second is why the time limit of 15 minutes. Where does that come from?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  My understanding is it is standing order 189(3) in relation to two questions in a row. In relation to the time allocated, 15 minutes is standard. It was my advice to you to put a number of your questions in that 15 minutes if you want to get them all on the record because under standing order 189(3) you will not be able to ask two questions in a row.




Senator Wright:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I am seeking clarification again. So the 15 minutes only pertains if I try to speak twice in a row?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wright, you have a full 15 minutes and you would be allowed to speak for another 15 minutes but after that you would have to have another senator ask a question in between. Is that clear?




Senator Wright:
  Yes, thank you, Chair. That is clear. That was the clarification that I was seeking.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wright.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:19):  I want to following on the same theme in relation to the class of persons I was asking about—and I did not receive an answer so we are none the wiser as to the government's understanding of how that would be applied in context, what it means, how it is defined and then how it might actually be applied in practice. I take the Attorney to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' report. It is the 16th report of this parliament. It was tabled today. There were issues raised about the expansion of the ASIS powers in relation to class of persons in that report. Paragraph 1.73 of that report states the expansion of powers will:


… enable the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give an authorisation to ASIS to undertake activities for a purpose which includes producing intelligence on a … class of Australian persons or to undertake activities that will … effect … a … class of Australian persons. 


This is a significant shift away from where it would be in relation to an identified individual person. This is where ASIS is providing support for the Australian Defence Force. 


So my first question—and these are questions that are raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights—is: why is this necessary? The statement of compatibility that accompanied the legislation we are considering today, which is a requirement from the legislation that established the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, provided by the Attorney-General's Department does not actually identify this particular expansion of powers as engaging human rights and certainly does not explain why it is necessary. The frame through which human rights issues are considered is whether they are necessary. When human rights are engaged they may be limited on the basis that it is established that it is reasonable to do it, necessary for a legitimate objective and proportionate to achieving that objective. We have a situation where we have ASIS being able to provide support to the Australian defence forces, to obtain intelligence or to undertake activities which may affect a class of Australians in a foreign country—and the statement of compatibility did not acknowledge that that was engaging human rights, and has not explained why it is necessary. My question to the Attorney-General is: it may well be necessary, but there is not information on the public record as to why this significant step is necessary—so why is it necessary to have that expansion of powers?

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (18:23):  I have some questions as well, but I just want to note, for those who might be observing this debate from outside the building, that this is the most extraordinary abuse of Senate procedure that I have seen since I have been in here. This is the stage of the bill where senators from the government side or the crossbenchers or the opposition get to put reasonable questions to the minister about the operation of the bill in practice. This is not a trivial bill that we are debating. This is the third in a series of national security bills that the government has brought forward with very little explanation that has provoked, I would say, very strong consternation and opposition in people who follow human rights closely—people who care about the operation of the law in this country and the way in which our civil liberties are protected. And the Attorney-General—the first law officer of the country—is treating this chamber with profound contempt. There is nothing unreasonable, Senator Brandis, in anything that Senator Wright has put to you this afternoon. They are reasonable questions that have been asked not just by the Greens but by people who made submissions to the parliamentary joint committee—people who have been observing the way that this bill has run through parliamentary process. They are entirely reasonable questions, and I would seek at the outset an explanation from the minister—maybe just to short-circuit this debate and save us all a bit of time. Does the minister intend to answer any questions put to him from any MPs on the operation of this bill? I see he is maybe even going to dignify us with an answer, so let us start with that: does the minister intend to grace us with any answers to any questions at all this afternoon?

So, rather than refresh your opportunity to continue to prolong the debate by responding to each question sequentially, I will, as the chair has suggested on the advice of the Clerk, respond to all the questions asked of me in one go, and that way we will get through this a lot faster.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:25):  It is interesting. I have observed in life how people suspect other people of doing things that they are capable of themselves. Earlier on I was actually asked by a member of the opposition how long I thought this debate would go on for; they had a particular interest in other legislation not coming on. I said to them: I have absolutely no intention of filibustering. I have a series of legitimate and reasonable questions to ask, and once I have asked those I will sit down. I have absolutely no intention of filibustering. I am interested in asking these questions, and I feel in some ways that I am performing the role of asking questions that the committee of which I am a proud member, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, has asked the Attorney, and is in the process of asking the Attorney, in terms of not being able to finalise their consideration of this legislation because those questions are still unanswered. As I said, questions pertaining to the previous national security legislation—which has now been passed, is on the books and will be affecting the lives of everyday Australians from now on—still remain unanswered. But this is an opportunity for me to at least ask those same questions in this chamber and to try and get some clarity for the people in Australia who actually care about these issues. So I am not filibustering, and I take exception to that suggestion. I think it will be very interesting, Attorney-General. I am quite pleased to think that you will be answering these questions—and I hope you are writing them down, because there are quite a few here and I hope that we will be able to see that we have responses to the various questions that I have asked.


As a result of you refusing to answer them as we go, if I am not clear on what you are saying or I need some further explanation, then obviously that puts me at a disadvantage because that will not necessarily be possible. When you have given your answer, maybe I will be able to come back and ask some more questions about those.


For people who may be listening to this debate and who may think: 'Maybe she is filibustering,' I will go to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights report and go to the paragraph which I think really encapsulates why this particular issue of having powers expanded to allow ASIS in overseas countries to support the Australian defence forces in relation to a class of persons—not individual identified persons about whom there may be serious concerns because of their behaviour or their likely behaviour, but indeed a class of persons—is an issue. I will go to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights report to explain why that might be an issue. I am referring to paragraph 1.75 of that report:


As a result of these proposed amendments, ASIS would be able to collect intelligence on an Australian person, including using surveillance techniques on that person, simply because that person belongs to a specified class. The committee is concerned that in the absence of detailed legislative criteria for the determination of a class of persons, a class of persons may include, for example, all Australian persons:


adhering to certain religious beliefs;


adhering to certain political or ideological beliefs; or


who have certain ethnic backgrounds.


That sounds horribly reminiscent to me of the way, throughout history, classes of people have been categorised according to things like their religious beliefs, political or ideological beliefs, or ethnic backgrounds. We are making laws today that will have an effect into the future. We do not know who will be making these decisions in the future. We are putting these laws on the books. These are unprecedented laws, and I am asking questions to clarify why it is necessary to go this far and how this may potentially affect people who are living today and in the future—until these laws, if passed, are revoked. Section 1.76 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights report says:


While the committee acknowledges that there are a number of safeguards in the ISA, the committee considers that a class authorisation power has the potential to apply intrusive interrogation powers to a group, which do not apply to the broader community and as such could be indirectly discriminatory because, although neutral on its face, it disproportionately affects people with a particular personal attribute such as religious or political belief, or ethnic background.


It is on that basis that the committee has sought the advice of the Attorney-General:


 … as to whether the amendments in Schedule 2 are compatible with the right to equality and non-discrimination, and in particular whether the limits imposed on human rights by the amendments are in pursuit of a legitimate objective, and are proportionate to achieving that objective.


That is why I am asking this question and that is the question I am asking the Attorney-General now.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (18:31):  What the Attorney-General is doing in deciding to behave like a child in the course of this debate is preventing us from having the kind of dialogue you normally get in the committee stage of the bill. Some of these questions, I suspect—those of Senator Wright or myself or others—could be resolved on the spot and we could just move on. The problem with Senator Brandis just sitting there mute, instead of providing us with answers, is that we do not know for which of the issues we are chasing the government has a measured and considered response, and for which it does not. I would like to record the profound contempt with which this chamber is being treated. This is not the way in which committee debates are meant to proceed. I suspect, also, that as a result this debate is going to take a lot longer than if we were getting sensible answers to questions as they were being put. I have never come across a minister who treated the rest of us with this kind of contempt.


The questions I am interested in are those that relate to collaboration between ASIS and the ADF. I know Senator Wright has concentrated largely on the control order regime and other elements in the Attorney-General's portfolio, but one of the things Senator Wright indicated in her second reading contribution is the possibility that increased cooperation between ASIS and the ADF may in fact lead to the targeted killings of Australian citizens fighting in Iraq and Syria. It may be that is not remotely the government's intention. Even calling it an allegation is pretty strong, because we simply do not know if that is what the Australian government intends to enable with this bill. Our intelligence services are prevented from this by law at the moment—as section 6.4 of the Intelligence Services Act states quite explicitly:


In performing its functions, ASIS must not plan for, or undertake, activities that involve:


(a) paramilitary activities; or 


(b) violence against the person; or 


(c) the use of weapons.


If it is the case that this amendment is a backdoor allowing ASIS to directly contravene section 6(4) of the Intelligence Services Act, or to be complicit in the targeted killing of Australian citizens who have not been charged or convicted of any criminal offence, that takes us into uncharted territory.


Senator Brandis, you may thoroughly repudiate that. I am not even putting it to you as an allegation; it is genuinely a question. I am interested to know: is it the intention, in allowing this closer collaboration between ASIS and the ADF—which is sensible on its face—to allow either ASIS or the ADF to specifically seek out Australian nationals fighting in overseas theatres of war and target them for killing or capture? Is that the Australian government's intention? If it is not, Senator Brandis, and you are able to set our minds at rest, I will not continue with the rest of this line of questioning. If you are intending on sitting there for the rest of the afternoon and not providing us with answers, then I am going to continue this line of questioning. You could choose to set this to rest if it is simply not Australian government policy to proceed that way.


I will put the question directly; I think you know where this is heading. Is it the intention of these amendments to allow the targeting of Australian nationals fighting in overseas theatres of war or is that not the case?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (18:35):  Senator Wright, if you want to ask your questions, go ahead and ask them and I will respond to them. That is the most efficient way to conduct this debate. But do not deny that you are filibustering and then spend the next five minutes avoiding putting questions.


Senator Ludlam, you should know that the proposition you put is preposterous. Section 6(4) of the Intelligence Services Act contains an absolute prohibition against those agencies engaging in acts of violence. There is no way at all that these amendments can limit or confine or otherwise qualify the operation of the absolute terms of section 6(4), which is not the subject of amendment at all. I explained that, by the way, Senator, in winding up the second reading debate, but you were not in the chamber. So the issue has already been addressed in this debate; but since you raise it again, the answer to your question, 'Is it the Australian government's intention to use this legislation to target people?' is that it is a preposterous suggestion which I dismiss with complete contempt. Section 6(4) of the Intelligence Services Act, which is absolute in its terms, is absolutely unaffected by this legislation.


In relation to the further progress of this debate: Senator Wright, if you are the principal spokesman for the Greens, I am making a note of each of your questions as we progress through. I suggest that rather than comment on your questions you just put the questions and sit down and I will then answer the questions.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:37):  Senator Brandis, you have said that we should put the questions and you will answer them, so I would like to follow up on the question that Senator Wright asked with regard to what constitutes a class of Australian persons for the purpose of the expanded powers, given that ASIS can conduct activities in respect of Australians overseas. I note the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights report, on page 19, points out that, as a result of these proposed amendments, ASIS would be able to collect intelligence on an Australian person, using surveillance techniques on that person simply because that person belongs to a specified class. The committee is concerned that, in the absence of detailed legislative criteria for the determination of a class of persons, that class of persons may include all Australian persons adhering to certain religious beliefs, adhering to certain political or ideological beliefs or who have certain ethnic backgrounds. It goes on to say that the committee considers that a class authorisation power has the potential to apply intrusive interrogation powers to a group which do not apply to the broader community and, as such, could be indirectly discriminatory because—although neutral on its face—it disproportionately affects people with a particular personal attribute such as religious or political belief or ethnic background. So it is not unreasonable to ask you to point out, as Senator Wright has done, how 'class of persons' is defined in the redrafted explanatory memorandum. What does it mean in context? What do you mean by a 'class of persons' that will now be subjected, if this legislation were to pass, to these surveillance powers being unleashed upon them?

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (18:39):  There is one issue that Senator Wright raised earlier that I would like to go back to for a moment, because she was asking questions in relation to revisions to the explanatory memorandum, which arises also from some of the recommendations of the intelligence committee. For the committee's benefit, I should indicate that my understanding is that a revised explanatory memorandum or supplementary additions to the explanatory memorandum will be dealt with when this bill is dealt with in the House. It concerns me that questions relating to such matters be dealt with in the Senate consideration. I can understand the Greens' frustration that—at least in the earlier stages—some of their questions did not appear to be progressed in the committee consideration. I take Senator Brandis's point now that he is dealing with some questions as they are being presented and I would encourage him to consider to do so, because, whilst the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has considered some of these things in detail and satisfied the Labor Party's concern, we do not think that that is a substitute for the role of the Senate committee stage consideration of a bill. We would encourage that consideration to continue in a substantive manner.


I earlier provided the Labor Party's position on all of the government amendments and what we understood them to be doing and why we were supporting them. Any other substantive matters that need to be raised should be addressed at this stage.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:41):  Thank you, Senator Collins. As I indicated at the outset of this, the questions that I was asking at this stage were actually about the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security which have not been reflected in the government's amendments. That is why I am asking the questions—to get more clarification. They were issues that were fairly and squarely raised by that committee, and that is why I have been asking the questions. It is not helpful to not have the answers as we go. It might be, as Senator Ludlam indicated, that we have dealt with those, that I have the best answer that I can have, that I am as clear as possible on it and that we can move on. Hopefully, a lot of information will come from the Attorney-General later, and then there may be further questions that need to come out of that. So I think it is not a very efficient way to do this.


I am going to go to a question. The government amendments include changes to the Intelligence Services Act, relating to what matters the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security must review. The date set for this review is 7 March 2018. This was the date set by the Foreign Fighters Bill, which, among many of its significant changes, pushed out the date set for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to review ASIO's questioning and attention powers from January 2016 to March 2018. My first question is: on what basis was 7 March 2018 set as the date for review of these very serious provisions relating to the Intelligence Services Act and the matters that the PJCIS must review? What was the basis of that date being set?

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (18:43):  Just briefly in response to Senator Wright, I should indicate that the Labor Party is completely satisfied that the full recommendations of the intelligence committee have been addressed by the government. Some of those matters are dealt with by amendment; some of them are dealt with by what will be a revised explanatory memorandum; and some of them are dealt with by other means. But I should not let the committee have the view, at least from our point of view, that all of those recommendations have been satisfactorily met.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:44):  I am genuinely interested in seeing where these clarifications are reflected, and that is why my questions included: 'Where in the explanatory memorandum?' If the Attorney-General or, indeed, you, Senator Collins, or anyone, could point us to where these recommendations are reflected such that there is clarity about the issues raised legitimately by the PJCIS, then that may answer the question. I do not know if you are in a position to do that.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (18:45):  I thank the Attorney-General for actually providing an answer. As I suspected, it does allow us to move the committee stage debate forward on the areas that I am interested in. I should acknowledge, in response to the Attorney-General's helpful advice about who he wants to take questions from and who he thinks should be running the debate, that I am here in my capacity as a shadow spokesperson for defence. The area of questioning that I want to put to the Attorney-General mainly revolves around the operation or interoperation of ASIS and the ADF. This may be a question that goes outside the Attorney-General's portfolio so if you want to take this on notice I will understand.


I thank the minister for clarifying that nothing in this act impinges on section 6(4) of the Intelligence Services Act, so it is not that ASIS's role has profoundly changed and this is about intelligence-sharing between ASIS and the ADF. The question really goes to back to a statement that was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald in a piece by Heath Aston on 12 November 2014—not that long ago:


Chief of Joint Operations Vice Admiral David Johnston said Defence is prepared to deliver strikes against Australian citizens fighting for Islamic State, also known as ISIL, provided they are a legitimate target.


The piece noted:


An estimated 71 Australians have fought in Iraq and Syria.


It said that roughly 15 were known to have been killed. I am interested, I guess, Attorney, to know whether it is a change in defence posture that the Australian Defence Force is seeking out and targeting Australian citizens who are fighting Islamic State—or, I guess, on any side of that conflict. 


You have, I think, confirmed for us that this will continue not to be ASIS's role, which is something of a relief. Nonetheless, my reading of the way that this bill has been drafted is that it will effectively streamline intelligence-sharing between ASIS and the ADF. If it is an ADF policy to seek out and target Australian nationals fighting for Islamic State then I think that is an area of concern. 


Recognising that you would be outside your portfolio in terms of the positioning of the ADF in these matters, I wonder nonetheless whether you can enlighten us as to whether it is the policy of Australian Defence personnel fighting in Iraq—or potentially in Syria if we end up there—to seek out and target Australian citizens. Is that the purpose behind allowing ASIS these more streamlined intelligence-sharing powers with the ADF?

In the interests of genuinely debating and discussing this legislation, I would like clarification about when the Attorney-General is proposing to answer this bulk lot of questions. Is he going to answer them at the end of the debate, in the last speech, so that there is no opportunity for any further discussion or clarification of the answers and when there is no opportunity to point out that he may have missed one of the questions that I asked because he has taken so many at once? I put that question to the Attorney-General.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (18:49):  I will respond to Senator Ludlam. As I said, my only interest here is to make this debate proceed in an appropriate and prompt manner and not allow it to be filibustered by the very cynical exploitation of the provisions of standing order 189(3) which we saw from you, Senator Ludlam, during the last debate.


I regard you as an honest person, Senator Wright. If you tell me that you are not filibustering I will accept that. I would not accept it from Senator Ludlam but I will accept it from you. What I urge you to do, Senator Wright, is to ask all of your questions and I will answer all your questions. This is a little bizarre, frankly, because you announced in your first contribution that the Greens support these government amendments. So we are debating government amendments that you have announced you support. You then asked a series of questions that have nothing to do with the amendments. You have asked a series of questions which relate to aspects of the PJCIS report which do not bear on the amendments which are the question before the chair.


But, be that as it may, I understand that a degree of latitude is allowed in these debates to range over matters that are not precisely on the point of the question before the chair, which is why am not saying that you are out of order here. In order to deal with your questions and progress this debate in the most efficient manner—and to avoid the cynical abuse of standing order 189(3), which we saw from your colleague Senator Ludlam not long ago—I am proposing to listen to your questions carefully, as I have been doing, make a note of each of them and, when you have finished asking all your questions, respond to all of them. You may have subsequent questions of clarification arising out of that. That is a matter for you.


Perhaps you are being made the play thing of a more Machiavellian colleague to your immediate right. Senator Wright, I do not want this debate filibustered. These are important matters. You have announced that you are supporting these amendments and yet, between you, Senator Ludlam and Senator Milne, somehow we do not seem able to get to a vote. Nor, indeed, do we seem able to get to a position where you have asked all your questions so that I can answer all your questions.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:52):  There is quite a lot there, Chair. Firstly, I am a big girl—I am a very big girl—and I am big enough and ugly enough to determine my own questions. I do not need to be patronised in any way by anyone. Secondly, yes, I am halfway through my first term in this parliament, but I have sat through enough committee stages of debate to be very, very clear that the purpose of this process in the Senate is to enable questioning, debating and understanding about the implications of any legislation that is being proposed either by the government or whoever has introduced the bill. It is by no means unusual to ask broad-ranging questions. I am also a lawyer, and I know that to some extent even comments that are made in the course of parliamentary debates can provide information and assistance in limited circumstances when interpretation of the legislation is ambiguous and needs to be clarified. It is very useful to have an opportunity to ask questions where there are provisions that are begging explanation and which are not clear. As I have said consistently throughout this debate: this is not something I thought up in the shower this morning; these are questions that have been legitimately put by a range of organisations, and to parliamentary committees in some cases, and I am seeking clarification. This is the national Parliament of Australia, these are significant laws and people in Australia have a right to understand how they may work once they are passed. That is the basis on which I am asking these questions.


I am reassured to think that if you give answers to the questions I have asked, Attorney-General, then there will not be some game played whereby it will be the last speech and then we will have to go to a vote, but that I will have an opportunity to clarify, in good faith, those aspects that I am not clear about. That being the case, I am happy to hear now the responses to my questions. They were all the general questions that I had, and in relation to the amendments. As I said when I was asking my first question: while these amendments go to some of the recommendations of the PJCIS, they do not go to all of them. They certainly do not allay all of the concerns that the Australian Greens have, but given that they do improve the bill we will be supporting them. I am happy to hear answers to those questions now, if the Attorney-General is minded to provide those.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-11-25,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (18:55):  Thank you, Senator Wright. I thought you had more questions, I must say, but if those are all your questions then let me give you the answers. In fact, Senator Wright, there are really only three issues you have raised.


First of all, you addressed recommendation 2 of the PJCIS report. I am asked why it is that the legislation does not define the expressions 'supports' and 'facilitates'. What recommendation 2 in fact does, and what the government has accepted because the government accepted all of the PJCIS recommendations, is to provide guidance in a revised explanatory memorandum of those terms. There is a particular reason why both the PJCIS and the government, in responding to its recommendations, have decided to approach the matter in that way. Those terms are borrowed from the Criminal Code. They are not defined in the Criminal Code either, but they are the subject of a body of judicial interpretation. The word 'supports', as you would know, Senator, as a lawyer, is not a lawyer's term of art; it has its common speech meaning. The word 'facilitates' is not a lawyer's term of art; it has its common speech meaning. Those terms used in a number of sections of the Criminal Code have been interpreted by the courts.


So you will readily understand, I am sure, Senator Wright, that if we were now to introduce a statutory definition of 'supports' and 'facilitates' here, then we would have the logical problem of having the terms undefined in other provisions of the Criminal Code, except by judicial interpretation, but defined in this section in a way which may not precisely mirror the judicial interpretation of the words elsewhere, so there would be the risk of inconsistent sets of definitions. You know the way courts approach these issues, Senator Wright: they would say, 'Well, the legislature, in its wisdom, defined these terms here, but it left them undefined there and there must be a reason for that, so the terms here must have a different meaning to the terms elsewhere in the legislation'. Purely from a legislative drafting point of view, the decision was made by both the PJCIS and by the government, in responding, to maintain consistency throughout the Criminal Code in the use of these terms but, as is commonly done, to give a fuller explanation in the explanatory memorandum. That is what the PJCIS asked us to do, and that is what we are doing.


The second issue you raise is an issue raised by recommendation 7 of the PJCIS report, and it is also an issue raised by paragraphs 1.73 through to 1.76 of the human rights committee report. I should say that the human rights committee report was only tabled during the course of the afternoon. I have not had an opportunity to study it carefully, but I accept what you say: that the paragraphs from which you have quoted—paragraphs 1.73 through to 1.76—raise essentially the same issue—that is, the definition of a class of persons. Recommendation 7 of the PJCIS report also was to the effect that that term should be explained in the EM, not in the bill, and that recommendation has also been adopted by the government.


What the amended EM which deals with this matter will explain is that a class of persons is identified solely by reference to the involvement or likely involvement of all of its members in activities of the type specified in paragraph 9(1A)(a) and not the personal or situational characteristics of individual persons, such as religion, political or ideological orientation, ethnicity or mere presence in a particular location. The activities specified in paragraph 9(1A)(a) are activities which involve a threat to security. The common feature of the class members is their involvement in hostile or prejudicial acts—not whether or not, for example, they happen to belong to a religious group or a political or ideological group or a particular ethnicity. So the meaning of 'class' is both narrow and specific to engagement in unlawful conduct. I should add that the Attorney-General's agreement to a class of persons can only be provided where the entire class of persons is involved or is likely to be involved in an activity or activities that are or are likely to be a threat to security as defined in section 4 of the ASIO Act. 


In particular I want to make it clear to you, Senator Wright, that the class of persons is defined solely by reference to the involvement or likely involvement of all of its members in an activity that is or is likely to be a threat to security—and not the personal or situational characteristics of individual persons. That is why, by the way, the identification of a group by reference to a class of persons, as opposed to a nominated individual or individuals, is adopted—because, to be a class member, every member of that group has to be involved in the activity prejudicial to security. This is a compendious way of dealing with one or more activities inimical to security in which a multiplicity of persons are jointly embarked. That is the reason for the adoption of that language. It will be clarified in the amended explanatory memorandum which will be circulated tomorrow. That equally explains the question posed by the Human Rights Committee.


Thirdly, Senator Wright, you asked on what basis 7 March 2018 was set as the date of review of this legislation by the PJCIS. The PJCIS report on the foreign fighters bill, of which this is, in a sense, a further elaboration, recommended that certain powers be reviewed and sunset 18 months and two years, respectively, after the next federal election—18 months for review and two years, potentially, for sunset. Rather than have uncertainty about the dates in the legislation, dates 18 months and two years after the third anniversary of the last federal election were used. Those dates are, respectively, 7 March 2018 and 17 September 2018. The judgement that was made, purely for the sake of convenience and clarity, was to take the date three years after the 2013 federal election and identify dates, respectively, 18 months and two years after that. Those were the three issues you raised, Senator Wright, and those are the answers.


Senator Ludlam, you referred to a report by a journalist called Heath Aston quoting Vice Admiral David Johnston. I of course adopt the prudent practice of never taking anything that you say at face value and I will check the report of Vice Admiral David Johnston's remarks. Nevertheless, your question was, according to my notes: is it the policy of the Australian government to seek out and target Australian citizens and is this the purpose of these amendments? The answer to both of those questions is no.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (19:05):  Thank you, Attorney. I do have some questions that flow from that. Although you did take good notes of some of the questions I was asking, there were some you did not respond to. I do not know if that was because you did not want to respond to them or because you did not note them. They were questions about the necessity of the measures and about how these things will actually look on the ground—the context. 


First, however, there was an issue about which I wanted to seek clarification. You said, I think, that the two phrases that I had asked about—the 'support and facilitate' phrase and the 'classes of Australians' phrase—are in the explanatory memorandum. Is it right that that has not yet been circulated?




Senator Brandis:
  That is right.




Senator WRIGHT:
  That makes it a little difficult to understand what the implications—




Senator Brandis:
  Senator Wright, I have asked for that explanatory  memorandum to be circulated—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator O'Neill
):  Senator Brandis! In your urgency, you did not wait for the call. Senator Wright has not finished her speech.




Senator Brandis:
  I was trying to respond to Senator Wright's questions.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  You have to ask me for the call. You might sit down for the moment, because Senator Wright was on her feet and continuing to speak.




Senator Brandis:
  I am not going to ask you, Madame Chair. I am going to reply to Senator Wright.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Please take your seat, Senator Brandis. Senator Wright has the call.




Senator WRIGHT:
  I am sorry—I automatically sit down. I am a bit too polite, I think.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I appreciate that, Senator Wright. Please continue your remarks.




Senator WRIGHT:
  I just automatically did. The point that I make is that this is genuinely frustrating because, if that explanatory memorandum had been circulated before we were debating this issue, some of those questions that I asked may not have needed to be asked or, indeed, I may have other questions that arise from that when I see it. I was listening carefully to the reading that the Attorney-General gave, but I was trying to understand quickly what the implications of that kind of definition might be.


I will come back to the question—and, Attorney-General, you may want to now respond to that—but I will ask another question in the meantime so that you can respond to that too. I did ask not only how the term 'supports and facilitates' has been defined in the redrafted explanatory memorandum—because I understand now that we will see that tomorrow and, presumably, before we vote on the bill; I am hoping for obvious reasons—but also what that will mean in context. That is because the potential breadth of that phrase has caused concern, and some submission makers have even suggested that it could be used to prevent a person from, for instance, using social media or accessing online banking, if it were thought that it might be useful for a terrorist investigation. So what are the outer limits, in a sense, of that regime that is being proposed in the bill and the definition of that phrase?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (19:08):  I am very perplexed, Senator. You were criticising me a few moments ago for not responding properly enough to your questions and now, Senator Wright, you are criticising me for being too eager to respond to your questions. All I was trying to tell you, Senator Wright, is that I have asked for the explanatory memorandum to be available as early and as quickly as possible. I expect that it will be able to be circulated in the chamber when the debate resumes tomorrow morning. That was the answer to the question that you asked me and then did not pause for the answer when I offered it.


Senator Wright, in relation to the substantive issue you raise, I think I have already addressed this by pointing out that there are accretions of judicial interpretation to the existing use of those terms in the Criminal Code. It is very bad practice, in fact, and productive of confusion, frankly, to define too narrowly generic common speech language in an act of parliament and to rule in and to rule out whether language is caught by generic common speech words on a series of hypothetical examples. That is not what parliaments do; that is what courts do. The word 'support' and the word 'facilitate' each have an ordinary natural meaning in the English language. As those words are used in the existing provisions of the Criminal Code, they have on occasions been applied to the facts of particular cases, and courts applying those general words to the facts of particular cases have developed their meaning, in the way that the law always does when it applies general language to particular instances. That is the way this should work. That is why the PJCIS and the government both decided that it would be bad drafting practice to include a definition within the statute of these words which have an ordinary natural meaning in the English language. I am not going to speculate about what a court might do on a hypothetical case in applying general words to particular hypothetical facts. I am just not going to do it. You said yourself, Senator Wright—and you were quite right in saying so—that on occasions courts, in construing an act, will have regard to what ministers say in the course of parliamentary debates. How wrong would it be of me, as the responsible minister here, to, as it were, dictate to the guidance of a court how it ought to apply these general words in particular hypothetical cases?

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (19:12):  I agree with you: it is the role of courts to determine the meaning of legislation in a particular case when that case goes to the court. However, my view is that it is the responsibility and accountability of parliament to take responsibility for the language that it chooses to enact in legislation which will potentially affect people's lives significantly. It is certainly an accepted principle of law that it is desirable to have clarity in legislation so that a person who is going about their business within the community has some understanding about what behaviour may or may not be caught by what, in this case, are significant provisions which have the effect of potentially destroying someone's livelihood, in the sense that they may not be able to work, there may be an order that they are not able to attend their place of work, and so on. Always, as much certainty as possible is desirable so that people do not have to 'suck it and see'—they do not have to wait and see if they are caught up by behaviour. When there is broad, ordinary language that is encompassed in ordinary meaning—which could be extremely broad; 'support' is a very broad word—I put it to you, Attorney, that it is reasonable to ask about hypothetical examples. I think the requirement for certainty would be directly proportional to the consequences of the legislation or the provisions that are being enacted—and these are significant provisions with a significant effect on the human rights of Australian citizens. That is why I have been asking the question, but I accept that you are not going to give any further answers on that.


I come to the response that you gave to my request for more clarity on the definition of the class of Australian persons. I do not have the explanatory memorandum in front of me, so I do not have the wording here, but I noted that paragraph 9(1A)(a) has defined or indicated that this will not be a class by reference to ethnicity, religious or political belief but will be a class of persons that has to be involved in activity that is prejudicial to security. If I have that wrong, I would appreciate you correcting me on that. 


In that case, I am still interested in asking the question: how would that provision operate in context? How would it be possible to identify a class of persons in a foreign country that is involved in a way that is prejudicial to security? How will they be identified? I can envisage various scenarios where—even if people are in a particular geographical area, perhaps dressed in certain clothing, perhaps holding certain flags that might suggest that they are associated with a terrorist organisation—it may still be possible that some of those people are there subject to coercion or for some other reason. I am interested in the parameters again, in how that will operate contextually.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (19:16):  They are going to be defined by reference to their conduct. It is that simple. If it is the kind of conduct to which section 9(1A)(a) applies, then they can be deemed a constituted class. For that to occur, every such person has to partake of the proscribed conduct. If not, then not. 


If I may say so—with all due respect, Senator Wright—this is a very good example of why it is not a useful or a fruitful exercise, in a debate of this kind, to continually propose hypothetical situations. This is for investigators, and prosecutors, and ultimately it is for the courts to determine. It is for the legislature to give clear guidance, which in the nature of statutory language is of necessity at a level of generality. It is for investigators—perhaps prosecutors, perhaps courts ultimately—to apply those general words to a particular case. But, to answer your question about the conceptual level, the way in which membership of a class will be judged is by reference to conduct.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:44):  Perhaps I could facilitate matters by pre-empting the government in moving their amendments and indicate the Labor opposition's position with respect to those amendments. It might save the committee some time later in the discussion. It has consistently been Labor's position that all national security legislation should be rigorously examined to make sure not only will it be effective in protecting our nation but also that it does not unduly infringe on important rights and freedoms. In keeping with that position, Labor insisted to the government that these three new measures be introduced in a separate bill and subject to public scrutiny and a full Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security inquiry. In its report the intelligence committee recommended the bill be passed and made 15 substantive recommendations. Significant recommendations include amendment to the bill to require the AFP to provide the Attorney-General with a summary of facts when seeking consent to apply to the court for each control order, including any facts why it should not be made; retention of the requirement for the AFP to explain to the issuing court each condition in a draft control order—the bill, as introduced, would only require the AFP to justify the control order as a whole; shortening of periods for notification of the relevant minister where agencies issue emergency authorisations; that the government urgently appoint a new Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and task it with reviewing whether recommendations for safeguards on the control order regime recommended by the 2013 COAG review should be implemented; and finally, it recommended a range of oversight measures.


Labor has asked the government to implement those recommendations and the government has agreed to do so. Labor will accordingly support the bill. The recommendations will improve the accountability and transparency of decision making by national security agencies. The recommendations will also ensure that control order applications are closely and appropriately scrutinised.


In the absence of the Attorney, I might move through government amendments number by number, although that possibly would not have been necessary had the Attorney been here to move them. I notice the Attorney is here, so I will let him proceed with his amendments.

Beyond that, that is all I have to say.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (17:49):  I indicate that the Australian Greens will be supporting the amendments. Indeed, they replicate some amendments that the Australian Greens were intending to move ourselves and we will not necessarily have to do that now. We are pleased that the government has introduced amendments to act many of the 15 recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and we consider that these changes constitute the absolute minimum necessary to begin to bring the bill closer to what is acceptable in terms of incursions on human rights and civil liberties. However, it is our view that these remain seriously inadequate to remedy the full range of human rights concerns that have been raised by many organisations and, indeed, by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights of this parliament.


There are three of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security recommendations that are not reflected in the government's amendments and I would like to take the opportunity to ask the Attorney-General about those and why the government was not minded to take up those recommendations. The first I want to advert to is the PJCIS recommendation 1, which refers to the need to finalise the appointment of an Independent National Security Legislation Monitor 'as a matter of absolute urgency', to quote that recommendation. Attorney-General, given that the government has stated in the media that it accepts this recommendation, when can we expect to see a fully-qualified, well-resourced person in this role, given that there has never been a time when a person in that role has ever been needed as much as they are today.

 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:51):  There is always a time when an Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is needed. Even more importantly though, it is important that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor be heeded. Unfortunately, when the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor was eventually appointed by the previous government, none of his reports was responded to in a timely fashion. In fact, when the government changed 14 months ago, we inherited most of the reports of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor which had not even been responded to by the previous government and they have been responded to by this government. Senator Wright, you or one of your colleagues asked me about this recently, and I said that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor would be appointed soon. I think I can tell you, Senator Wright, that I have written to the Prime Minister—who ultimately makes the appointment—recommending some names, with one preferred name of someone who, I think, would satisfy you as a man of very, very great eminence and suitability. I expect that that announcement will be made any day now.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (17:53):  Thank you, Attorney-General. It is interesting that you have often waxed eloquent about the importance of the role and, indeed, you have often claimed credit for being one of the people who moved to have the role introduced after the initial tranche of national security legislation was introduced during the Howard government. But, with respect, you cannot have it all ways. We have to actually look at not the talk but the walk. We have had this office vacant for seven months. Prior to that, you acknowledge that, in fact, your government was going to abolish the position. Given the importance that you put on the role, you will be very pleased to hear that I will be introducing a private senator's bill to require that the role be filled with alacrity in the future and that, indeed, the reports of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor be responded to by governments within a timely period. I agree with you that it has been somewhat scandalous that report after report has not been heeded, as you say. With respect, I would suggest that it is now an opportunity for your government to take those previous reports seriously and to heed them now. Certainly, one of the major concerns that was consistently raised by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor was with the control order regime—and we will come back to that in some questions that I have for you later. As much as it is nice to hear that soon we may have someone within that office, what kind of heed has the government paid to the previous discussion of the control order regime by the INSLM? And how can you point to that being reflected in the legislation that we are considering today?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (17:54):  The legislation speaks for itself. The government has reviewed the whole range of Australia's counter-terrorism laws. We do not necessarily share the views of the previous INSLM. The INSLM is a person who contributes in a well-informed and intelligent way to the thinking of the government of the day and, indeed, to the thinking of the parliament. That does not mean that the INSLM is like a final authority on the policy merits of any particular proposal. The policy merits of the particular proposal is ultimately a matter for the government of the day, subject to the will of the parliament. The government respectfully disagreed with some of the views about the control order regime of the former Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, and our views were closer to the views expressed by the COAG review of these laws. The fact that you had one respected person of one mind and another respected person of another mind, neither of them political partisans, should tell you that there is a variety of views about this. But the view of the parliament, or at least the view of the overwhelming sentiment of the parliament as reflected in the unanimous report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, should tell you that both sides of politics—not, of course, you 'Green' people—are of the view that there is a role for control orders. That reflects the overwhelming sentiment of the elected representatives sitting in parliament. It reflects, no doubt, the overwhelming sentiment of the Australian people who want to see this government pass laws that are suitable and appropriate to deal with the issue of terrorism.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2014-11-25,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (17:57):  Thank you, you 'Green' Chair, Senator Whish-Wilson! No, Chair, I should be more respectful. I will take this opportunity to address in some detail the various amendments by the government. I think it might help Senator Wright, particularly on her first question where she was asking for advice from the Attorney in relation to the position on control orders. Perhaps I will address Labor's position, as reflected in these amendments, issue by issue. If the committee will bear with me, I will probably be dealing with some matters that are in what I expect will be in the second tranche of amendments that we will deal with with the next question—that certain items of schedule 1 stand as printed. But they go across issues, if the committee can bear with that.


Government amendments (1), (3) and (14) relate to requesting interim control orders. These, as with, I think, all of the amendments, are the implementation of recommendations of the intelligence committee. Labor accepts that the purpose of this bill is to improve the operation of the control order regime. We support the bill's intention to reduce unnecessary duplication of decision making by the Attorney-General and then the issuing court. However, the Attorney-General's consent is required for an application for a control order for a reason. The Attorney-General's involvement is necessary to provide an appropriate level of oversight and accountability at the highest level of executive government for the exercise of what is an extraordinary power. The intelligence committee's recommendation that the AFP provide the Attorney-General with a statement of reasons related to why a control order should be made and, also, any facts of why the order should not be made is, therefore, a very sensible suggestion. These amendments strike the right balance between the operational effectiveness and appropriate oversight. For this reason, we are supporting them.


I will move now down to amendments (4) and (7) and (15) to (18) regarding details of limitations. Again, these follow the recommendations of the intelligence committee. The committee recommended retention of the requirement under the current law for the AFP to explain to an issuing court each condition in a draft control order The bill as introduced would only require the AFP to justify the control order as a whole. Again, while Labor accept that the purpose of this bill is to improve the operation of the control order regime, we would not support removal of proper testing by an issuing court of the appropriateness and necessity of proposed control orders. Control orders allow for the imposition on a person of conditions, obligations and prohibitions which deprive that person of their usual rights. It is appropriate, therefore, that each and every one of those stipulations is assessed to see whether it is necessary to Australia's national security. Labor believe that extraordinary measures like control orders must always be rigorously justified, and we support these amendments which make sure that this will be the case.


Regarding amendments (8), (10), (12) and (13) around obtaining the Attorney-General's consent, this was another recommendation of the intelligence committee. The government's bill as introduced extended the time which the AFP would have to obtain the Attorney-General's consent to an urgent interim control order from four to 12 hours. As the intelligence committee noted, it is difficult to imagine circumstances where the Attorney-General would be unable to be contacted for a period of 12 hours and that eight hours should be sufficient for any reasonable contingency. Labor agrees, and we will support the government's amendments to implement this recommendation.


We understand amendment (9) to be a technical correction. Amendment (19), regarding references to ministers, implements a recommendation from the intelligence committee. It clarifies a drafting issue the committee raised and it ensures that references to ministers in the Intelligence Services Act are taken to refer only to the most senior responsible ministers. Again, this amendment is consistent with Labor's focus on oversight and accountability. The powers granted in the act should be exercised by senior ministers with the requisite experience and departmental support. The powers granted in the act should be subject to the oversight of the most senior levels of government. 


Regarding amendments (20) to (29), this is a further intelligence committee recommendation. The amendments provide that where an agency head gives an authorisation when a minister is unavailable, the minister must be notified within eight hours. Although the bill as introduced imposed an obligation for agency heads to notify ministers as soon as practicable, the bill provides for this time period to not exceed 48 hours at the outside. There can be no justification for such a long delay. Labor supports these amendments, which will ensure that ministers are promptly notified when decisions are taken by agency heads in their absence. This will ensure the oversight and accountability that Labor insists on when powers are exercised under the Intelligence Services Act.


Finally, regarding amendment (30) and the inquiry, this amendment implements the previous intelligence committee's recommendation that new provisions of national security legislation be reviewed by the intelligence committee ahead of sunset periods, now set two years after the next federal election. Labor supports this amendment. There should be proper, sober consideration of new national security measures, and we welcome the guarantee provided by a statutory and timely review.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:03):  Coming back to the response of the Attorney-General to my question regarding the INSLM, I would observe that you are quite right, Attorney-General: we 'Green people' did not have an opportunity to be part of the Liberal-Labor club on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security because, as everybody knows, it is a committee for which sole membership is available to the two old parties and none of the crossbenchers have an opportunity to be part of that—to examine the proposed legislation, to ask questions and to hear from the witnesses in person.


Coming back to the point that you made, Attorney-General, in relation to the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor's previous recommendations and reports, you were the person who used the word 'heed' in terms of how important it is to have a person in that role and how you will be moving to have someone in that role, but again you are trying to have things all ways. You are saying that it is important to have someone to heed their reports. I have just checked, because my initial reaction was that the word 'heed' is not a neutral term. It is not a term that means just 'take note of'. It has connotations of being guided by, taken to heart, to follow, attend to, listen to, pay due regard to. I do not know what your attitude will be to the new Independent National Security Legislation Monitor that you are proposing to appoint, but it would seem to me logical and reasonable that if someone is appointed to that position—a position that is acknowledged to be an extremely important position, a position which the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security indicated should be filled with absolute urgency—it would be sensible to heed their advice. In fact, it is interesting that you suggested that, because Liberal and Labor members of parliament on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security were able to come to a consensus on the recommendations for changes to this legislation, that that would somehow reflect the overwhelming view of the Australian public. I do not think you can logically conclude that, and certainly I think it is pretty clear from the submissions in relation to this bill that the bill, as it stands—even with the amendments that are being moved by the government today—will not reflect the overwhelming views of those organisations in Australia who are in a position to understand the implications on civil liberties and human rights in Australia by dint of their longstanding work and understanding of these issues and also their experience in seeing how these sorts of issues play out overseas. 


I could come back to the fact that, much as you extol the virtues of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the government has not seen fit to pick up all the recommendations of that committee. If I could take you to recommendation 2, which refers to ensuring clarity around the terms 'supports and 'facilitates' in the provisions in the bill that extend the control order regime, certainly this is a term whose potential and vagueness has concern among people who have made submissions on the bill. Recommendation 2 was seeking to ensure clarity around the term 'supports and facilitates'. I note that the government has apparently accepted that recommendation, so, Attorney, can you please explain how these terms have been redefined in the redrafted explanatory memorandum?

  I am not going to get a response to that question, I imagine, but I do have a follow-up question. I put this to everyone really, and particularly the Attorney-General. I am not playing a game here; I am seriously interested in having clarity from the government which is proposing this legislation, to help answer, reassure people about or clarify the concerns that have been legitimately raised by organisations in Australia who are concerned about the implications of this legislation. The question is: can you, as Attorney-General, give us and give the Australian public—anyone who might be listening, or reading the Hansard transcript—an example of what this term 'supports and facilitates' will mean in context?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Brandis, I am going to get Senator Wright to repeat the very last question she asked so that you can listen to it, because you were in conversation with the Clerk.




Senator WRIGHT:
  Given that the government has accepted PJCIS recommendation No. 2, referring to ensuring the clarity around the term 'supports and facilitates' in the provisions in the bill that extend the control order regime, I am asking, Attorney, if you can give us an example of what that will mean in context.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wright, I do not have the right to call you again because you have just spoken twice.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (18:11):  I am not sure what kind of procedural games the Attorney-General is playing here. Senator Wright asked a series of reasonable questions about the operation of the bill and the context in which it has been drafted, and I draw the Attorney-General's attention to the reasonable questions that have been put to him. This is the stage of the bill debate where senators are able to establish how the bill is going to work in practice. Chair, I ask you to draw the minister's attention to the questions that are being put to him.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I think the minister is aware of the questions that are being put to him. Senator Wright, do you want the call?

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:12):  Yes. I am going to ask a further question. With respect, I think this is an outrageous abuse of process. Some of my questions later will go to the fact that we have a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, established in this parliament, which has sought clarification on some of the same questions that I am asking. Some of that information that was sought was in relation to the previous national security law, which has now passed—the foreign fighters bill—and that committee is still waiting for clarification and answers, for justification on the basis of necessity, reasonableness and proportionality, which are an acknowledged human rights frame of reference in matters such as this. The committee is still waiting for responses from the Attorney-General in relation to that significant law affecting the rights of people living in Australia in 2014. 


This is, in my understanding, an opportunity to clarify the way this legislation will play out if it is passed. I am not abusing the process. I am asking reasonable questions, many of which have been asked by other organisations, and I can only assume that the Attorney-General does not have answers for these questions, or presumably he would be putting those answers on the record. So I am going to go now to Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security recommendation No. 7, another of the recommendations which—although I understand the government has accepted them—have not been put into the form of an amendment to this bill. This concerns schedule 2 of the bill. This is from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. This is the coalition and Labor committee. The recommendation relates to the need for clarity around what constitutes a class of Australian persons for the purposes of the expanded powers given to ASIS to conduct activities in respect of Australians overseas. My question is: given that this recommendation is accepted, how is 'class of persons' defined in the redrafted explanatory memorandum?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Before I put the question—

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:15):  I have some questions to ask. I will ask them. They will remain on the record. The Attorney-General's silence will speak for itself. I know there are many people in Australia who will be watching this with great interest. So my next question is: Attorney-General, can you give us an example of what the phrase 'class of persons' for the purposes of expanded powers given to ASIS to conduct activities in respect of Australians overseas means in context?




Senator Ludlam:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I seek a ruling from you. We have all participated in these debates before and I have never seen a minister behave like this one. I would like a ruling from you, Chair. If a minister refuses to answer a legitimate question put by a senator from any part of this chamber, the senator is entitled to put a different question. We cannot compel the minister to put information into the public domain—it is his choice—but it is the case I believe—and I am seeking your ruling, Chair—that senators are entitled to put other questions to the minister and he can choose to answer them or not.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wright, if you or Senator Ludlam have a number of questions, you will have 15 minutes to speak. You should outline those questions in the time allocated to you rather than perhaps asking them one by one. You will not be allowed to speak twice in a row. Senator Wright, after you ask one question, Senator Ludlam can ask another question but you will not be allowed to ask two questions in a row.




Senator Wright:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I have a point of order. I seek the standing orders you are referring to on those two aspects of that ruling: the first is not being able to ask two questions in a row and the second is why the time limit of 15 minutes. Where does that come from?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  My understanding is it is standing order 189(3) in relation to two questions in a row. In relation to the time allocated, 15 minutes is standard. It was my advice to you to put a number of your questions in that 15 minutes if you want to get them all on the record because under standing order 189(3) you will not be able to ask two questions in a row.




Senator Wright:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I am seeking clarification again. So the 15 minutes only pertains if I try to speak twice in a row?



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wright, you have a full 15 minutes and you would be allowed to speak for another 15 minutes but after that you would have to have another senator ask a question in between. Is that clear?




Senator Wright:
  Yes, thank you, Chair. That is clear. That was the clarification that I was seeking.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Wright.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:19):  I want to following on the same theme in relation to the class of persons I was asking about—and I did not receive an answer so we are none the wiser as to the government's understanding of how that would be applied in context, what it means, how it is defined and then how it might actually be applied in practice. I take the Attorney to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' report. It is the 16th report of this parliament. It was tabled today. There were issues raised about the expansion of the ASIS powers in relation to class of persons in that report. Paragraph 1.73 of that report states the expansion of powers will:


… enable the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give an authorisation to ASIS to undertake activities for a purpose which includes producing intelligence on a … class of Australian persons or to undertake activities that will … effect … a … class of Australian persons. 


This is a significant shift away from where it would be in relation to an identified individual person. This is where ASIS is providing support for the Australian Defence Force. 


So my first question—and these are questions that are raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights—is: why is this necessary? The statement of compatibility that accompanied the legislation we are considering today, which is a requirement from the legislation that established the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, provided by the Attorney-General's Department does not actually identify this particular expansion of powers as engaging human rights and certainly does not explain why it is necessary. The frame through which human rights issues are considered is whether they are necessary. When human rights are engaged they may be limited on the basis that it is established that it is reasonable to do it, necessary for a legitimate objective and proportionate to achieving that objective. We have a situation where we have ASIS being able to provide support to the Australian defence forces, to obtain intelligence or to undertake activities which may affect a class of Australians in a foreign country—and the statement of compatibility did not acknowledge that that was engaging human rights, and has not explained why it is necessary. My question to the Attorney-General is: it may well be necessary, but there is not information on the public record as to why this significant step is necessary—so why is it necessary to have that expansion of powers?

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (18:23):  I have some questions as well, but I just want to note, for those who might be observing this debate from outside the building, that this is the most extraordinary abuse of Senate procedure that I have seen since I have been in here. This is the stage of the bill where senators from the government side or the crossbenchers or the opposition get to put reasonable questions to the minister about the operation of the bill in practice. This is not a trivial bill that we are debating. This is the third in a series of national security bills that the government has brought forward with very little explanation that has provoked, I would say, very strong consternation and opposition in people who follow human rights closely—people who care about the operation of the law in this country and the way in which our civil liberties are protected. And the Attorney-General—the first law officer of the country—is treating this chamber with profound contempt. There is nothing unreasonable, Senator Brandis, in anything that Senator Wright has put to you this afternoon. They are reasonable questions that have been asked not just by the Greens but by people who made submissions to the parliamentary joint committee—people who have been observing the way that this bill has run through parliamentary process. They are entirely reasonable questions, and I would seek at the outset an explanation from the minister—maybe just to short-circuit this debate and save us all a bit of time. Does the minister intend to answer any questions put to him from any MPs on the operation of this bill? I see he is maybe even going to dignify us with an answer, so let us start with that: does the minister intend to grace us with any answers to any questions at all this afternoon?

So, rather than refresh your opportunity to continue to prolong the debate by responding to each question sequentially, I will, as the chair has suggested on the advice of the Clerk, respond to all the questions asked of me in one go, and that way we will get through this a lot faster.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:25):  It is interesting. I have observed in life how people suspect other people of doing things that they are capable of themselves. Earlier on I was actually asked by a member of the opposition how long I thought this debate would go on for; they had a particular interest in other legislation not coming on. I said to them: I have absolutely no intention of filibustering. I have a series of legitimate and reasonable questions to ask, and once I have asked those I will sit down. I have absolutely no intention of filibustering. I am interested in asking these questions, and I feel in some ways that I am performing the role of asking questions that the committee of which I am a proud member, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, has asked the Attorney, and is in the process of asking the Attorney, in terms of not being able to finalise their consideration of this legislation because those questions are still unanswered. As I said, questions pertaining to the previous national security legislation—which has now been passed, is on the books and will be affecting the lives of everyday Australians from now on—still remain unanswered. But this is an opportunity for me to at least ask those same questions in this chamber and to try and get some clarity for the people in Australia who actually care about these issues. So I am not filibustering, and I take exception to that suggestion. I think it will be very interesting, Attorney-General. I am quite pleased to think that you will be answering these questions—and I hope you are writing them down, because there are quite a few here and I hope that we will be able to see that we have responses to the various questions that I have asked.


As a result of you refusing to answer them as we go, if I am not clear on what you are saying or I need some further explanation, then obviously that puts me at a disadvantage because that will not necessarily be possible. When you have given your answer, maybe I will be able to come back and ask some more questions about those.


For people who may be listening to this debate and who may think: 'Maybe she is filibustering,' I will go to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights report and go to the paragraph which I think really encapsulates why this particular issue of having powers expanded to allow ASIS in overseas countries to support the Australian defence forces in relation to a class of persons—not individual identified persons about whom there may be serious concerns because of their behaviour or their likely behaviour, but indeed a class of persons—is an issue. I will go to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights report to explain why that might be an issue. I am referring to paragraph 1.75 of that report:


As a result of these proposed amendments, ASIS would be able to collect intelligence on an Australian person, including using surveillance techniques on that person, simply because that person belongs to a specified class. The committee is concerned that in the absence of detailed legislative criteria for the determination of a class of persons, a class of persons may include, for example, all Australian persons:


adhering to certain religious beliefs;


adhering to certain political or ideological beliefs; or


who have certain ethnic backgrounds.


That sounds horribly reminiscent to me of the way, throughout history, classes of people have been categorised according to things like their religious beliefs, political or ideological beliefs, or ethnic backgrounds. We are making laws today that will have an effect into the future. We do not know who will be making these decisions in the future. We are putting these laws on the books. These are unprecedented laws, and I am asking questions to clarify why it is necessary to go this far and how this may potentially affect people who are living today and in the future—until these laws, if passed, are revoked. Section 1.76 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights report says:


While the committee acknowledges that there are a number of safeguards in the ISA, the committee considers that a class authorisation power has the potential to apply intrusive interrogation powers to a group, which do not apply to the broader community and as such could be indirectly discriminatory because, although neutral on its face, it disproportionately affects people with a particular personal attribute such as religious or political belief, or ethnic background.


It is on that basis that the committee has sought the advice of the Attorney-General:


 … as to whether the amendments in Schedule 2 are compatible with the right to equality and non-discrimination, and in particular whether the limits imposed on human rights by the amendments are in pursuit of a legitimate objective, and are proportionate to achieving that objective.


That is why I am asking this question and that is the question I am asking the Attorney-General now.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (18:31):  What the Attorney-General is doing in deciding to behave like a child in the course of this debate is preventing us from having the kind of dialogue you normally get in the committee stage of the bill. Some of these questions, I suspect—those of Senator Wright or myself or others—could be resolved on the spot and we could just move on. The problem with Senator Brandis just sitting there mute, instead of providing us with answers, is that we do not know for which of the issues we are chasing the government has a measured and considered response, and for which it does not. I would like to record the profound contempt with which this chamber is being treated. This is not the way in which committee debates are meant to proceed. I suspect, also, that as a result this debate is going to take a lot longer than if we were getting sensible answers to questions as they were being put. I have never come across a minister who treated the rest of us with this kind of contempt.


The questions I am interested in are those that relate to collaboration between ASIS and the ADF. I know Senator Wright has concentrated largely on the control order regime and other elements in the Attorney-General's portfolio, but one of the things Senator Wright indicated in her second reading contribution is the possibility that increased cooperation between ASIS and the ADF may in fact lead to the targeted killings of Australian citizens fighting in Iraq and Syria. It may be that is not remotely the government's intention. Even calling it an allegation is pretty strong, because we simply do not know if that is what the Australian government intends to enable with this bill. Our intelligence services are prevented from this by law at the moment—as section 6.4 of the Intelligence Services Act states quite explicitly:


In performing its functions, ASIS must not plan for, or undertake, activities that involve:


(a) paramilitary activities; or 


(b) violence against the person; or 


(c) the use of weapons.


If it is the case that this amendment is a backdoor allowing ASIS to directly contravene section 6(4) of the Intelligence Services Act, or to be complicit in the targeted killing of Australian citizens who have not been charged or convicted of any criminal offence, that takes us into uncharted territory.


Senator Brandis, you may thoroughly repudiate that. I am not even putting it to you as an allegation; it is genuinely a question. I am interested to know: is it the intention, in allowing this closer collaboration between ASIS and the ADF—which is sensible on its face—to allow either ASIS or the ADF to specifically seek out Australian nationals fighting in overseas theatres of war and target them for killing or capture? Is that the Australian government's intention? If it is not, Senator Brandis, and you are able to set our minds at rest, I will not continue with the rest of this line of questioning. If you are intending on sitting there for the rest of the afternoon and not providing us with answers, then I am going to continue this line of questioning. You could choose to set this to rest if it is simply not Australian government policy to proceed that way.


I will put the question directly; I think you know where this is heading. Is it the intention of these amendments to allow the targeting of Australian nationals fighting in overseas theatres of war or is that not the case?

 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (18:35):  Senator Wright, if you want to ask your questions, go ahead and ask them and I will respond to them. That is the most efficient way to conduct this debate. But do not deny that you are filibustering and then spend the next five minutes avoiding putting questions.


Senator Ludlam, you should know that the proposition you put is preposterous. Section 6(4) of the Intelligence Services Act contains an absolute prohibition against those agencies engaging in acts of violence. There is no way at all that these amendments can limit or confine or otherwise qualify the operation of the absolute terms of section 6(4), which is not the subject of amendment at all. I explained that, by the way, Senator, in winding up the second reading debate, but you were not in the chamber. So the issue has already been addressed in this debate; but since you raise it again, the answer to your question, 'Is it the Australian government's intention to use this legislation to target people?' is that it is a preposterous suggestion which I dismiss with complete contempt. Section 6(4) of the Intelligence Services Act, which is absolute in its terms, is absolutely unaffected by this legislation.


In relation to the further progress of this debate: Senator Wright, if you are the principal spokesman for the Greens, I am making a note of each of your questions as we progress through. I suggest that rather than comment on your questions you just put the questions and sit down and I will then answer the questions.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:37):  Senator Brandis, you have said that we should put the questions and you will answer them, so I would like to follow up on the question that Senator Wright asked with regard to what constitutes a class of Australian persons for the purpose of the expanded powers, given that ASIS can conduct activities in respect of Australians overseas. I note the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights report, on page 19, points out that, as a result of these proposed amendments, ASIS would be able to collect intelligence on an Australian person, using surveillance techniques on that person simply because that person belongs to a specified class. The committee is concerned that, in the absence of detailed legislative criteria for the determination of a class of persons, that class of persons may include all Australian persons adhering to certain religious beliefs, adhering to certain political or ideological beliefs or who have certain ethnic backgrounds. It goes on to say that the committee considers that a class authorisation power has the potential to apply intrusive interrogation powers to a group which do not apply to the broader community and, as such, could be indirectly discriminatory because—although neutral on its face—it disproportionately affects people with a particular personal attribute such as religious or political belief or ethnic background. So it is not unreasonable to ask you to point out, as Senator Wright has done, how 'class of persons' is defined in the redrafted explanatory memorandum. What does it mean in context? What do you mean by a 'class of persons' that will now be subjected, if this legislation were to pass, to these surveillance powers being unleashed upon them?

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (18:39):  There is one issue that Senator Wright raised earlier that I would like to go back to for a moment, because she was asking questions in relation to revisions to the explanatory memorandum, which arises also from some of the recommendations of the intelligence committee. For the committee's benefit, I should indicate that my understanding is that a revised explanatory memorandum or supplementary additions to the explanatory memorandum will be dealt with when this bill is dealt with in the House. It concerns me that questions relating to such matters be dealt with in the Senate consideration. I can understand the Greens' frustration that—at least in the earlier stages—some of their questions did not appear to be progressed in the committee consideration. I take Senator Brandis's point now that he is dealing with some questions as they are being presented and I would encourage him to consider to do so, because, whilst the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has considered some of these things in detail and satisfied the Labor Party's concern, we do not think that that is a substitute for the role of the Senate committee stage consideration of a bill. We would encourage that consideration to continue in a substantive manner.


I earlier provided the Labor Party's position on all of the government amendments and what we understood them to be doing and why we were supporting them. Any other substantive matters that need to be raised should be addressed at this stage.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:41):  Thank you, Senator Collins. As I indicated at the outset of this, the questions that I was asking at this stage were actually about the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security which have not been reflected in the government's amendments. That is why I am asking the questions—to get more clarification. They were issues that were fairly and squarely raised by that committee, and that is why I have been asking the questions. It is not helpful to not have the answers as we go. It might be, as Senator Ludlam indicated, that we have dealt with those, that I have the best answer that I can have, that I am as clear as possible on it and that we can move on. Hopefully, a lot of information will come from the Attorney-General later, and then there may be further questions that need to come out of that. So I think it is not a very efficient way to do this.


I am going to go to a question. The government amendments include changes to the Intelligence Services Act, relating to what matters the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security must review. The date set for this review is 7 March 2018. This was the date set by the Foreign Fighters Bill, which, among many of its significant changes, pushed out the date set for the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to review ASIO's questioning and attention powers from January 2016 to March 2018. My first question is: on what basis was 7 March 2018 set as the date for review of these very serious provisions relating to the Intelligence Services Act and the matters that the PJCIS must review? What was the basis of that date being set?

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (18:45):  I thank the Attorney-General for actually providing an answer. As I suspected, it does allow us to move the committee stage debate forward on the areas that I am interested in. I should acknowledge, in response to the Attorney-General's helpful advice about who he wants to take questions from and who he thinks should be running the debate, that I am here in my capacity as a shadow spokesperson for defence. The area of questioning that I want to put to the Attorney-General mainly revolves around the operation or interoperation of ASIS and the ADF. This may be a question that goes outside the Attorney-General's portfolio so if you want to take this on notice I will understand.


I thank the minister for clarifying that nothing in this act impinges on section 6(4) of the Intelligence Services Act, so it is not that ASIS's role has profoundly changed and this is about intelligence-sharing between ASIS and the ADF. The question really goes to back to a statement that was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald in a piece by Heath Aston on 12 November 2014—not that long ago:


Chief of Joint Operations Vice Admiral David Johnston said Defence is prepared to deliver strikes against Australian citizens fighting for Islamic State, also known as ISIL, provided they are a legitimate target.


The piece noted:


An estimated 71 Australians have fought in Iraq and Syria.


It said that roughly 15 were known to have been killed. I am interested, I guess, Attorney, to know whether it is a change in defence posture that the Australian Defence Force is seeking out and targeting Australian citizens who are fighting Islamic State—or, I guess, on any side of that conflict. 


You have, I think, confirmed for us that this will continue not to be ASIS's role, which is something of a relief. Nonetheless, my reading of the way that this bill has been drafted is that it will effectively streamline intelligence-sharing between ASIS and the ADF. If it is an ADF policy to seek out and target Australian nationals fighting for Islamic State then I think that is an area of concern. 


Recognising that you would be outside your portfolio in terms of the positioning of the ADF in these matters, I wonder nonetheless whether you can enlighten us as to whether it is the policy of Australian Defence personnel fighting in Iraq—or potentially in Syria if we end up there—to seek out and target Australian citizens. Is that the purpose behind allowing ASIS these more streamlined intelligence-sharing powers with the ADF?

As I said, my only interest here is to make this debate proceed in an appropriate and prompt manner and not allow it to be filibustered by the very cynical exploitation of the provisions of standing order 189(3) which we saw from you, Senator Ludlam, during the last debate.


I regard you as an honest person, Senator Wright. If you tell me that you are not filibustering I will accept that. I would not accept it from Senator Ludlam but I will accept it from you. What I urge you to do, Senator Wright, is to ask all of your questions and I will answer all your questions. This is a little bizarre, frankly, because you announced in your first contribution that the Greens support these government amendments. So we are debating government amendments that you have announced you support. You then asked a series of questions that have nothing to do with the amendments. You have asked a series of questions which relate to aspects of the PJCIS report which do not bear on the amendments which are the question before the chair.


But, be that as it may, I understand that a degree of latitude is allowed in these debates to range over matters that are not precisely on the point of the question before the chair, which is why am not saying that you are out of order here. In order to deal with your questions and progress this debate in the most efficient manner—and to avoid the cynical abuse of standing order 189(3), which we saw from your colleague Senator Ludlam not long ago—I am proposing to listen to your questions carefully, as I have been doing, make a note of each of them and, when you have finished asking all your questions, respond to all of them. You may have subsequent questions of clarification arising out of that. That is a matter for you.


Perhaps you are being made the play thing of a more Machiavellian colleague to your immediate right. Senator Wright, I do not want this debate filibustered. These are important matters. You have announced that you are supporting these amendments and yet, between you, Senator Ludlam and Senator Milne, somehow we do not seem able to get to a vote. Nor, indeed, do we seem able to get to a position where you have asked all your questions so that I can answer all your questions.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:52):  There is quite a lot there, Chair. Firstly, I am a big girl—I am a very big girl—and I am big enough and ugly enough to determine my own questions. I do not need to be patronised in any way by anyone. Secondly, yes, I am halfway through my first term in this parliament, but I have sat through enough committee stages of debate to be very, very clear that the purpose of this process in the Senate is to enable questioning, debating and understanding about the implications of any legislation that is being proposed either by the government or whoever has introduced the bill. It is by no means unusual to ask broad-ranging questions. I am also a lawyer, and I know that to some extent even comments that are made in the course of parliamentary debates can provide information and assistance in limited circumstances when interpretation of the legislation is ambiguous and needs to be clarified. It is very useful to have an opportunity to ask questions where there are provisions that are begging explanation and which are not clear. As I have said consistently throughout this debate: this is not something I thought up in the shower this morning; these are questions that have been legitimately put by a range of organisations, and to parliamentary committees in some cases, and I am seeking clarification. This is the national Parliament of Australia, these are significant laws and people in Australia have a right to understand how they may work once they are passed. That is the basis on which I am asking these questions.


I am reassured to think that if you give answers to the questions I have asked, Attorney-General, then there will not be some game played whereby it will be the last speech and then we will have to go to a vote, but that I will have an opportunity to clarify, in good faith, those aspects that I am not clear about. That being the case, I am happy to hear now the responses to my questions. They were all the general questions that I had, and in relation to the amendments. As I said when I was asking my first question: while these amendments go to some of the recommendations of the PJCIS, they do not go to all of them. They certainly do not allay all of the concerns that the Australian Greens have, but given that they do improve the bill we will be supporting them. I am happy to hear answers to those questions now, if the Attorney-General is minded to provide those.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (18:55):  Thank you, Senator Wright. I thought you had more questions, I must say, but if those are all your questions then let me give you the answers. In fact, Senator Wright, there are really only three issues you have raised.


First of all, you addressed recommendation 2 of the PJCIS report. I am asked why it is that the legislation does not define the expressions 'supports' and 'facilitates'. What recommendation 2 in fact does, and what the government has accepted because the government accepted all of the PJCIS recommendations, is to provide guidance in a revised explanatory memorandum of those terms. There is a particular reason why both the PJCIS and the government, in responding to its recommendations, have decided to approach the matter in that way. Those terms are borrowed from the Criminal Code. They are not defined in the Criminal Code either, but they are the subject of a body of judicial interpretation. The word 'supports', as you would know, Senator, as a lawyer, is not a lawyer's term of art; it has its common speech meaning. The word 'facilitates' is not a lawyer's term of art; it has its common speech meaning. Those terms used in a number of sections of the Criminal Code have been interpreted by the courts.


So you will readily understand, I am sure, Senator Wright, that if we were now to introduce a statutory definition of 'supports' and 'facilitates' here, then we would have the logical problem of having the terms undefined in other provisions of the Criminal Code, except by judicial interpretation, but defined in this section in a way which may not precisely mirror the judicial interpretation of the words elsewhere, so there would be the risk of inconsistent sets of definitions. You know the way courts approach these issues, Senator Wright: they would say, 'Well, the legislature, in its wisdom, defined these terms here, but it left them undefined there and there must be a reason for that, so the terms here must have a different meaning to the terms elsewhere in the legislation'. Purely from a legislative drafting point of view, the decision was made by both the PJCIS and by the government, in responding, to maintain consistency throughout the Criminal Code in the use of these terms but, as is commonly done, to give a fuller explanation in the explanatory memorandum. That is what the PJCIS asked us to do, and that is what we are doing.


The second issue you raise is an issue raised by recommendation 7 of the PJCIS report, and it is also an issue raised by paragraphs 1.73 through to 1.76 of the human rights committee report. I should say that the human rights committee report was only tabled during the course of the afternoon. I have not had an opportunity to study it carefully, but I accept what you say: that the paragraphs from which you have quoted—paragraphs 1.73 through to 1.76—raise essentially the same issue—that is, the definition of a class of persons. Recommendation 7 of the PJCIS report also was to the effect that that term should be explained in the EM, not in the bill, and that recommendation has also been adopted by the government.


What the amended EM which deals with this matter will explain is that a class of persons is identified solely by reference to the involvement or likely involvement of all of its members in activities of the type specified in paragraph 9(1A)(a) and not the personal or situational characteristics of individual persons, such as religion, political or ideological orientation, ethnicity or mere presence in a particular location. The activities specified in paragraph 9(1A)(a) are activities which involve a threat to security. The common feature of the class members is their involvement in hostile or prejudicial acts—not whether or not, for example, they happen to belong to a religious group or a political or ideological group or a particular ethnicity. So the meaning of 'class' is both narrow and specific to engagement in unlawful conduct. I should add that the Attorney-General's agreement to a class of persons can only be provided where the entire class of persons is involved or is likely to be involved in an activity or activities that are or are likely to be a threat to security as defined in section 4 of the ASIO Act. 


In particular I want to make it clear to you, Senator Wright, that the class of persons is defined solely by reference to the involvement or likely involvement of all of its members in an activity that is or is likely to be a threat to security—and not the personal or situational characteristics of individual persons. That is why, by the way, the identification of a group by reference to a class of persons, as opposed to a nominated individual or individuals, is adopted—because, to be a class member, every member of that group has to be involved in the activity prejudicial to security. This is a compendious way of dealing with one or more activities inimical to security in which a multiplicity of persons are jointly embarked. That is the reason for the adoption of that language. It will be clarified in the amended explanatory memorandum which will be circulated tomorrow. That equally explains the question posed by the Human Rights Committee.


Thirdly, Senator Wright, you asked on what basis 7 March 2018 was set as the date of review of this legislation by the PJCIS. The PJCIS report on the foreign fighters bill, of which this is, in a sense, a further elaboration, recommended that certain powers be reviewed and sunset 18 months and two years, respectively, after the next federal election—18 months for review and two years, potentially, for sunset. Rather than have uncertainty about the dates in the legislation, dates 18 months and two years after the third anniversary of the last federal election were used. Those dates are, respectively, 7 March 2018 and 17 September 2018. The judgement that was made, purely for the sake of convenience and clarity, was to take the date three years after the 2013 federal election and identify dates, respectively, 18 months and two years after that. Those were the three issues you raised, Senator Wright, and those are the answers.


Senator Ludlam, you referred to a report by a journalist called Heath Aston quoting Vice Admiral David Johnston. I of course adopt the prudent practice of never taking anything that you say at face value and I will check the report of Vice Admiral David Johnston's remarks. Nevertheless, your question was, according to my notes: is it the policy of the Australian government to seek out and target Australian citizens and is this the purpose of these amendments? The answer to both of those questions is no.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (19:05):  Thank you, Attorney. I do have some questions that flow from that. Although you did take good notes of some of the questions I was asking, there were some you did not respond to. I do not know if that was because you did not want to respond to them or because you did not note them. They were questions about the necessity of the measures and about how these things will actually look on the ground—the context. 


First, however, there was an issue about which I wanted to seek clarification. You said, I think, that the two phrases that I had asked about—the 'support and facilitate' phrase and the 'classes of Australians' phrase—are in the explanatory memorandum. Is it right that that has not yet been circulated?




Senator Brandis:
  That is right.




Senator WRIGHT:
  That makes it a little difficult to understand what the implications—




Senator Brandis:
  Senator Wright, I have asked for that explanatory  memorandum to be circulated—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator O'Neill
):  Senator Brandis! In your urgency, you did not wait for the call. Senator Wright has not finished her speech.




Senator Brandis:
  I was trying to respond to Senator Wright's questions.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  You have to ask me for the call. You might sit down for the moment, because Senator Wright was on her feet and continuing to speak.




Senator Brandis:
  I am not going to ask you, Madame Chair. I am going to reply to Senator Wright.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Please take your seat, Senator Brandis. Senator Wright has the call.




Senator WRIGHT:
  I am sorry—I automatically sit down. I am a bit too polite, I think.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I appreciate that, Senator Wright. Please continue your remarks.




Senator WRIGHT:
  I just automatically did. The point that I make is that this is genuinely frustrating because, if that explanatory memorandum had been circulated before we were debating this issue, some of those questions that I asked may not have needed to be asked or, indeed, I may have other questions that arise from that when I see it. I was listening carefully to the reading that the Attorney-General gave, but I was trying to understand quickly what the implications of that kind of definition might be.


I will come back to the question—and, Attorney-General, you may want to now respond to that—but I will ask another question in the meantime so that you can respond to that too. I did ask not only how the term 'supports and facilitates' has been defined in the redrafted explanatory memorandum—because I understand now that we will see that tomorrow and, presumably, before we vote on the bill; I am hoping for obvious reasons—but also what that will mean in context. That is because the potential breadth of that phrase has caused concern, and some submission makers have even suggested that it could be used to prevent a person from, for instance, using social media or accessing online banking, if it were thought that it might be useful for a terrorist investigation. So what are the outer limits, in a sense, of that regime that is being proposed in the bill and the definition of that phrase?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (19:08):  I am very perplexed, Senator. You were criticising me a few moments ago for not responding properly enough to your questions and now, Senator Wright, you are criticising me for being too eager to respond to your questions. All I was trying to tell you, Senator Wright, is that I have asked for the explanatory memorandum to be available as early and as quickly as possible. I expect that it will be able to be circulated in the chamber when the debate resumes tomorrow morning. That was the answer to the question that you asked me and then did not pause for the answer when I offered it.


Senator Wright, in relation to the substantive issue you raise, I think I have already addressed this by pointing out that there are accretions of judicial interpretation to the existing use of those terms in the Criminal Code. It is very bad practice, in fact, and productive of confusion, frankly, to define too narrowly generic common speech language in an act of parliament and to rule in and to rule out whether language is caught by generic common speech words on a series of hypothetical examples. That is not what parliaments do; that is what courts do. The word 'support' and the word 'facilitate' each have an ordinary natural meaning in the English language. As those words are used in the existing provisions of the Criminal Code, they have on occasions been applied to the facts of particular cases, and courts applying those general words to the facts of particular cases have developed their meaning, in the way that the law always does when it applies general language to particular instances. That is the way this should work. That is why the PJCIS and the government both decided that it would be bad drafting practice to include a definition within the statute of these words which have an ordinary natural meaning in the English language. I am not going to speculate about what a court might do on a hypothetical case in applying general words to particular hypothetical facts. I am just not going to do it. You said yourself, Senator Wright—and you were quite right in saying so—that on occasions courts, in construing an act, will have regard to what ministers say in the course of parliamentary debates. How wrong would it be of me, as the responsible minister here, to, as it were, dictate to the guidance of a court how it ought to apply these general words in particular hypothetical cases?

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-11-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (19:12):  I agree with you: it is the role of courts to determine the meaning of legislation in a particular case when that case goes to the court. However, my view is that it is the responsibility and accountability of parliament to take responsibility for the language that it chooses to enact in legislation which will potentially affect people's lives significantly. It is certainly an accepted principle of law that it is desirable to have clarity in legislation so that a person who is going about their business within the community has some understanding about what behaviour may or may not be caught by what, in this case, are significant provisions which have the effect of potentially destroying someone's livelihood, in the sense that they may not be able to work, there may be an order that they are not able to attend their place of work, and so on. Always, as much certainty as possible is desirable so that people do not have to 'suck it and see'—they do not have to wait and see if they are caught up by behaviour. When there is broad, ordinary language that is encompassed in ordinary meaning—which could be extremely broad; 'support' is a very broad word—I put it to you, Attorney, that it is reasonable to ask about hypothetical examples. I think the requirement for certainty would be directly proportional to the consequences of the legislation or the provisions that are being enacted—and these are significant provisions with a significant effect on the human rights of Australian citizens. That is why I have been asking the question, but I accept that you are not going to give any further answers on that.


I come to the response that you gave to my request for more clarity on the definition of the class of Australian persons. I do not have the explanatory memorandum in front of me, so I do not have the wording here, but I noted that paragraph 9(1A)(a) has defined or indicated that this will not be a class by reference to ethnicity, religious or political belief but will be a class of persons that has to be involved in activity that is prejudicial to security. If I have that wrong, I would appreciate you correcting me on that. 


In that case, I am still interested in asking the question: how would that provision operate in context? How would it be possible to identify a class of persons in a foreign country that is involved in a way that is prejudicial to security? How will they be identified? I can envisage various scenarios where—even if people are in a particular geographical area, perhaps dressed in certain clothing, perhaps holding certain flags that might suggest that they are associated with a terrorist organisation—it may still be possible that some of those people are there subject to coercion or for some other reason. I am interested in the parameters again, in how that will operate contextually.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-11-25,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (19:16):  They are going to be defined by reference to their conduct. It is that simple. If it is the kind of conduct to which section 9(1A)(a) applies, then they can be deemed a constituted class. For that to occur, every such person has to partake of the proscribed conduct. If not, then not. 


If I may say so—with all due respect, Senator Wright—this is a very good example of why it is not a useful or a fruitful exercise, in a debate of this kind, to continually propose hypothetical situations. This is for investigators, and prosecutors, and ultimately it is for the courts to determine. It is for the legislature to give clear guidance, which in the nature of statutory language is of necessity at a level of generality. It is for investigators—perhaps prosecutors, perhaps courts ultimately—to apply those general words to a particular case. But, to answer your question about the conceptual level, the way in which membership of a class will be judged is by reference to conduct.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (19:20):  The recent commemorations marking the centenary of the departure of the first Anzac convoy from Albany were especially meaningful for two residents of Albany. On the afternoon of Saturday, 1st of November, brothers Murray and Eric Maxton were presented with the Legion of Honour by France's Minister for Defence, who was in Albany to attend the Anzac commemorative events. Both now aged in their 90s, Murray and Eric Maxton flew 30 bombing missions over Germany aboard a Lancaster aircraft with the RAAF Bomber Command in 1944, in the process helping to liberate France from Nazi occupation.


Elements of the Maxton's story are not atypical from the wartime experience of so many Australian families in the 1930s and 1940s. Wartime service was a family tradition. Their uncle had been killed at Gallipoli, and their own father, Eric Sr had served in the First World War, was gassed by the Germans and was subsequently repatriated to Western Australia. Their father's horrific experiences meant he urged his sons not to enlist when the Second World War commenced, but both Eric and Murray felt the call to service strongly.


Murray was the first to enlist in the RAAF, and he was joined by his brother a year later. Both eventually found themselves in the United Kingdom, though training in different places. By pure chance, they were reunited when they ran into each other in a London cafe one afternoon, and from that point remained together. At the time, the RAAF had a strict rule in place that no two members of the same family were to fly in combat missions aboard the same aircraft. However, the war had already extracted a heavy toll. Bomber Command had lost thousands of men, and a shortage of qualified RAAF personnel by this stage of the war meant that the rules were increasingly being sidestepped. 


So it was that Murray and Eric Maxton came to fly combat missions together over Europe, believed to be the only brothers to do so. Yet, their heroic service went unrecognised for too long. Indeed, the brothers recently spoke of feeling 'shunned' when they returned to Australia and a seeming atmosphere of resentment towards RAAF airmen with Bomber Command because they had fought in Europe rather than fighting the Japanese, closer to home. This parochial attitude was most unfortunate. The threat to freedom at that time in world affairs was not confined to the Pacific region, and Australians were right to participate in the war in Europe. The Maxtons received their Legion of Honour awards almost 70 years to the day after their tour of duty. Others are still waiting. 


Some senators may be familiar with the circumstance of 93-year-old Mr. Doug Groome, also of Albany, which has received some media attention this week. Mr. Groome also served in Bomber Command but as a British citizen with the RAF. He later emigrated to WA following the war in 1957. Like the Maxtons, Mr. Groome put his life in grave danger flying bombing missions over Germany. Like them, he is entitled to appropriate recognition for his service, and I am pleased that, as soon as his case came to light, the government moved quickly to work with Mr Groome's family to establish how this could best be achieved. However, I suspect there are many others like Mr. Groome, not just in Western Australia but around our country, whose service has gone unrecognised, or  under-recognised, for too long.


Of course, not every war veteran seeks recognition. For some, it simply serves to bring painful memories to the fore, and we should respect their wish for privacy. However, for those who do wish to be identified and more fully recognised, the Centenary of Anzac offers an appropriate opportunity. Last week, I wrote to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson, and said I would be happy to work closely with him and other parliamentary colleagues in making certain that veterans and their families better understand the process for obtaining honours, particularly from foreign governments.


The Centenary of Anzac program, which will continue until 2018, is giving many Australians a fuller appreciation of our nation's military heritage, making certain that the service and sacrifice of those who fought on our behalf is a crucial aspect of that history. Now is the time to make sure we get it right.
