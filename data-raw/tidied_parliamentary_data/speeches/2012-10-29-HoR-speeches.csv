Mr WINDSOR
 (New England) (10:10):  by leave—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regional Australia, I wish to make a statement on the committee's visit to Canada and Mongolia as part of our inquiry into the use of fly-in fly-out workforce practices in regional Australia. This statement specifically concerns the committee's visit to Canada and Mongolia undertaken as part of the annual parliamentary delegation visit to the Asia-Pacific region. The document that I will seek leave to table shall not be considered a delegation report but rather a statement of the reasons for travel and the program of meetings undertaken. I know my colleagues the member for Capricornia and the member for Riverina wish to speak on the delegation in the Federation Chamber, and the committee will report on the findings of the delegation in its inquiry report, which I intend to table early next year.


The Regional Australia Committee is conducting an exhaustive inquiry into the use of FIFO and DIDO—fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive-out—working practices. The committee felt that it needed to undertake wider research on the issue to get more ideas about what solutions could be put in place to support and build our regional communities. In Canada, the committee visited St Johns, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Edmonton and Fort McMurray in Alberta. I am grateful to the many local officials and industry groups who generously gave their time and knowledge to the delegation. While there is much to learn from Canada—and the committee spent quite a lot of time talking with many people who were experiencing very similar situations to some parts of Australia—the Canadians are very much looking at us as well to learn from our fly-in fly-out experience. Perhaps most tellingly, in St Johns the comment was made: 'We saw what was happening in the Pilbara and resolved that we'll do everything we can to make sure that doesn't happen here.' Provincial governments across Canada are playing catch-up with the fly-in fly-out phenomenon but are leading the expectations of companies and communities to drive a local workforce focus. One of the issues that our committee will pick up on is the experience the Canadians are having in certain parts. 


The Mongolian mining industry is relatively young. We had the unique experience of touring the completed Oyu Tolgoi copper mine before the switch was flipped to start operations. This large operation will need a fly-in fly-out workforce, but the company, Rio Tinto, is prioritising building the local workforce through building a local community. Again, the government is heavily involved driving a culture of local community development. 


The delegation findings prove that a balance can be found between utilising a fly-in fly-out workforce and building local, sustainable communities as long as strong leadership from all levels of government is put in place. I look forward to reporting on the full findings to the House in due course. 


As I have a couple of minutes left, I would very much like to thank the committee membership and the secretariat for the work they put into the trip. I would particularly like to thank all of those people we met overseas, both in private companies and in various areas of government. 



In the case of Mongolia, I would like to thank Rio Tinto in particular for giving us an insight into their workings. One of the things that is becoming very plain to members on the committee is that different companies in different parts of the world are doing different things to try and address the same issue—that of regional communities and the phenomenon of fly-in fly-out and, in some circumstances, drive-in drive-out. Even though the Canadian experience and the Mongolian experience are different, there is an enormous amount for us to learn from their experiences. I thank the Australian Consul-General, David Lawson, and his people in particular. I also thank the Mongolians who have been educated in Australia—they are known as the 'Mozzies'—for giving us some great experiences in their country. I am sure that the member for Riverina would endorse my remarks, particularly those in relation to the Mongolian people and their children, for their capacity, need and want to be educated right across the spectrum. Given the announcements by the Prime Minister in the last few days, I think Mongolia should be well placed to take advantage of some of the issues she raised. I present the statement relating to the committee delegation to Canada and Mongolia. I seek leave to table it. (Time expired)


Leave granted.




Mr WINDSOR:
  I move:


That the House take note of the document.



The SPEAKER:  Does the member for New England seek to move a motion to move this statement to the Federation Chamber?




Mr WINDSOR:
  I move:

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (10:16):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Australia's overseas representation: punching below our weight?


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr CHAMPION:
  This report identifies a chronic underfunding of DFAT over the last three decades which has resulted in a diplomatic network which is seriously deficient and does not reflect Australia's position within the G20 or the OECD. Australia has the smallest diplomatic network of the G20 countries and sits at 25th in comparison to the 34 countries in the OECD. Australia is clearly punching below its weight.


The committee has recommended in this report that a budget priority for overseas representation should be significantly raised because of the benefits that accrue from diplomacy.


In the medium term, Australia should substantially increase the number of its diplomatic posts by at least 20 posts to bring it level with its position in the G20 and the OECD.


In the longer term, funding to DFAT should be increased to a set percentage of gross domestic product sufficient to reflect Australia's standing as a middle power.


There appears to be no overall strategy for Australia's diplomatic engagement with the world or criteria for establishing, continuing or closing diplomatic posts. To address this deficiency, the committee has recommended that the government produce a white paper to set the agenda for Australia's whole-of-government overseas representation.


The committee has received DFAT's priorities for increasing Australia's diplomatic footprint should it receive increased funding, and a number of suggestions from interested parties for opening new diplomatic posts in particular countries. The committee, however, has restricted itself to recommending that there should be additional posts in Asia, and in particular in China and Indonesia.


The committee recognises the valuable activities undertaken abroad by Australia's representatives in promoting Australia's interests, promoting trade opportunities, and through providing consular assistance to Australians abroad.


The committee notes, however, that issues relating to the effect of recent funding cuts on overall effectiveness, resource allocation of any additional funding and the number and performance of locally engaged staff would benefit from further examination and review.


The committee has therefore recommended that there be an external review of DFAT to prepare it for the future, and hopefully the implementation of other recommendations in this report.


The committee has made a number of other recommendations, including funding the ever-increasing demand for consular services from Australians who travel abroad, in part from revenue sources such as increased passport fees and a small tiered levy, structured to take into account those Australians who have taken out travel insurance or who have been unable to obtain travel insurance—that is, particularly, the aged. We have also recommended placing on the COAG agenda discussion of the location, coordination and effective use of state and Commonwealth overseas trade representatives. We have recommended the creation within AusAID of a mediation unit to reduce the potential need for aid and rebuilding assistance and to prevent armed conflict in the region. We have also recommended the establishment of an office of e-diplomacy within DFAT to harness the potential and deal with the challenges of e-diplomacy, particularly in the light of the constantly evolving nature of technology and, in particular, social media.


The operations of our diplomatic network are being challenged by a lack of funding, the growth and development of Australia's economy, the shift of global power towards Asia, the impact of technology and the rising importance of public diplomacy.


This report along with recent reports from the Lowy Institute and, of course, the Asian century white paper highlight the urgent need to rebuild Australia's diplomatic network and enhance our international standing.


Our diplomatic network must be resourced to grow if Australia is to punch above its weight in the world.


In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who provided submissions to the review and who provided evidence at the hearings. I particularly thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his guidance and his active participation in the committee. I also thank the members of the subcommittee and the secretariat, particularly John Carter, Peter Kakogiannis, Jessica Butler and Sonya Gaspar.


I commend the report to the House.

Dr STONE
 (Murray) (10:22):  This report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Australia’s overseas representation: punching below our weight?, comes at a most opportune time, given that just this weekend the Prime Minister released the Australia in the Asian century white paper. Our report follows earlier inquiries which also identified chronic underfunding of our diplomatic services over a very long period of time. At the moment, DFAT manages 95 overseas posts in 77 countries. It also manages 46 consulates headed by honorary consuls. Of these, 23 are in countries with no other Australian embassies or high commissions.


We have in the past played a very important role in global diplomacy. I refer in particular to the work that was carried out in the fifties and sixties, when we were the major architects of the Antarctic Treaty System. Successive prime ministers then also played important roles in negotiating bans on mineral exploitation and on military activity in the Antarctic. We have done an enormous job in the past with the Security Council of the United Nations. It now seems that we are no longer capable of pulling the weight we should as a middle power—because we are underinvesting in our diplomatic effort. Our inquiry found that, compared with other OECD countries and the G20, Australia's diplomatic representation footprint is amongst the smallest, ranking 25th out of 34 OECD countries. One of the ways our diplomatic posts and DFAT have tried to overcome the shortfalls in funding and in the number of posts is, increasingly, to employ locally engaged staff. 


We are concerned, having talked and taken evidence about this in our inquiry, about the relative efficacy and performance of the increasing number of locally-engaged staff who are often employed as a cost-saving measure. We believe that there should be ongoing dialogue with interested parties—for example, the Migration Institute of Australia—given that they are often made aware of issues or concerns about equitable or appropriate treatment of Australian embassy or high commission clients. We need to make sure that, if you come to an Australian embassy or high commission, you are treated in the way that Australians would expect to be treated in Australia when doing business with a public agency.


We took evidence about the sometimes competing or poorly-coordinated actions of state agents-general or other state or territory trade representatives working overseas. We have recommended that COAG discuss the location, coordination and effectiveness of this plethora of often piecemeal representation, which can confuse new markets. Some markets, indeed, are not aware of where our states are located, and, when they are told about competing products or services, this can be to the detriment of the development of our trade rather than supporting it.


Whilst we have substantially increased our foreign aid budget, and whilst this increase has bipartisan support, it has not been matched by an adequately increased capacity in Australia's network of posts to match the additional funds to ensure best value for money and adequate recognition of Australia's contribution. We need to make sure that as we are increasing this foreign aid budget—as we should and must—we at the same time overcome past problems by ensuring that AusAID, our embassies and our posts can properly manage the additional budget on the ground.


We are very concerned that a lot of our diplomats have to cover a number of countries—in Africa, in particular. We have engaged with some of our superb diplomats whose  task is to try to represent Australian in five or six different countries. This is almost an impossible task. I have already mentioned that sometimes we then resort to honorary consulates, which do the best they can, but it is not the same as having Australian diplomatic missions. I commend the report to the House. It is most timely.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (10:49):  War comes on very unpredictably. There was a man called Chamberlain who walked into the British parliament and announced, 'We don't have anything to worry about because we have peace in our time,' and he waved a letter around that he had got from another man called Mr Adolf Hitler, saying that he had no designs upon Europe and there was nothing to worry about. There was no effort made to increase the military budget or the military preparedness of Great Britain. If my memory serves me correctly, within a year or a year and half of that statement, Britain lost her entire army at Dunkirk, in the sense that the personnel got home, but they were not to take their rifles. Most of them swam or waded out from the beach. They took the bolts of their rifles with them. All of the tanks, artillery pieces and rifles were left behind, and Britain was left without an army to protect itself. It had a very great navy but no army.


In Australia, in this parliament, in this place, Mr Curtin got up and said that he was wonderfully pleased and we should not involve ourselves in any wars in Europe, we had nothing to worry about and European wars did not concern us, and he stridently spoke out against any increases in the military budget. The government believed and assured the people of Australia that we did not have anything to worry about. There was nothing pending and there was no necessity to increase military spending. Both sides agreed that there was no problem.


Within two years, Brigadier General Mackay presented to the cabinet of Australia a paper in which he said: 'We can't possibly defend Australia. All we can defend is the narrow coastline stretching from Brisbane to Sydney and Melbourne and across to Adelaide.' It was not a Brisbane line; the whole of Australia was handed over except the small area that was all that the tiny little army and security services that we had could defend. Then General Blamey, the commander of the Australian forces, said that if the Japanese took Port Moresby—and they were two weeks away from taking Port Moresby; 15,000 had landed at Rabaul—we had 3,000 militia in battalions who were unfit and untrained and had virtually no machine guns at all to stop them. If they took Port Moresby, there would be no way of stopping them from invading Australia.


In preparation for that invasion, something like 50 or 60 sorties and bombings of Darwin took place. Horn Island was bombed. Bamaga was bombed. Townsville was bombed. Cairns was bombed. Kalumburu was bombed. Some 72 ships off the Australian coastline were sunk in preparation for the invasion. Newcastle and Sydney both had bombs dropped upon them, albeit only one or two.


So war comes on very quickly, and we must call upon our security forces, our Army, Navy and Air Force, to defend us. Even when the war broke out, we did not worry much in Australia because Britain said she would come over and save us if anything happened over here, not that anything was likely to happen over here. The Americans stood between Australia and Japan. If the worst came to the worst, the Americans would save us. Quite frankly, neither of them saved us. The Battle of Milne Bay and the Battle of Kokoda were fought by Australians, preventing the Japanese from taking Port Moresby, and it was only the Australians that prevented the taking of Port Moresby.


The Fair Indexation of Military Superannuation Entitlements Bill 2012 is to look after our soldiers. It is an expression from the Parliament of Australia, representing the people of Australia, that we appreciate what you do.


We appreciate that, if you are in the services now, you will almost certainly be sent to Afghanistan at some time and that, if you are sent to Afghanistan, you have a one in 400 or one in 500 chance of dying. According to the newspaper reports—I have not checked them—39 deaths have taken place in Afghanistan. Those of us who attend the funerals of the people from our areas—as I attended the funeral of Ben Chuck, a commando, in Yungaburra—will never forget them. 


Yet we say to our troops: 'You are substandard. You do not deserve the same arrangements as other pensioners. You do not deserve the arrangements we in this parliament enjoy.' Our remuneration is tied to average weekly earnings and our pensions are tied to whichever is the better deal out of average weekly earnings and the CPI. But these men who risk their lives for their country are confined to the CPI. Don't you think that they are being told that we do not care about them—that they are expendable? Could there be a worse message to send to the parents and relatives of Ben Chuck and all the other Ben Chucks?


We are fighting wars. I was handed a rifle when I was 18 years of age. I heard John F. Kennedy and I thought we were all going to go to war—as did everyone in my senior class at Mt Carmel School after hearing him speak on that famous day. But then it blew over and the world was gay and happy—because there was not going to be any war. But, 18 months later, I was carrying a rifle and I had to give three telephone numbers to my commanding officer. I was on 24-hour call to go and fight in Indonesia. That war was about protecting our oil pipeline. 


There is a bit of get even and get square about the war in Afghanistan—and we do not blame the Americans for that. They are fully entitled to get square. But ultimately, in my opinion, the war in Afghanistan is about protecting their oil pipeline. I think you have to fight a war to protect your oil pipeline. But I plead with people in this place to understand that, if you want to fight a war to protect an oil pipeline, don't you think the people in the Indonesian archipelago might get a bit upset when we cut off their food pipeline—when we sink the little boats they sail out here to try to catch fish to keep their families alive? 


We are also fighting to protect the American alliance—and, quite frankly, we would ultimately have been invaded if it had not been for the Americans. Everybody knows that. We also provide peacekeeping forces—and we all want to make our contribution so that we do not see a repeat of the terrible things which have occurred in the past. An example of what can happen if you do not have a peacekeeping force is what happened in the Boer War. The British—and very sadly and to the shame of this nation, we were in there too—starved 26,000 women and children to death in the camps. They did so as government policy. If there had been a peacekeeping force to stop those greedy people like Cecil Rhodes, Barney Barnato and NM Rothschild, that concentration camp incident may not have occurred—and if that had not occurred, I do not think there would have been a First World War. There was no way the Germans were going to allow that to go unpunished. On their belts, it said, 'God is with us.' As a result of the Boer War, to some degree they were dead right—that God was with them. I speak not to condemn my own forces. I am very proud and honoured to sit under the portrait on my wall of Albert Anthony Henley, my great-grandfather's brother, who died at Gallipoli. 


We are moving today that our servicemen and women get the same deal as everyone else in Australia. I cannot see how anyone on either side of this parliament can hold their head up straight or look a soldier or an ex-soldier in the eye unless they support this proposal. 


We do not do this to blow our own trumpet. We would have been most happy for the government or the opposition to have moved this. I am quite sure the crossbenchers will very strongly support this bill. It will be voted upon and we hope that everyone votes for it. We very strongly commend the bill to the House.

The Fair Indexation of Military Superannuation Entitlements Bill 2012 is to look after our soldiers. It is an expression from the Parliament of Australia, representing the people of Australia, that we appreciate what you do.


We appreciate that, if you are in the services now, you will almost certainly be sent to Afghanistan at some time and that, if you are sent to Afghanistan, you have a one in 400 or one in 500 chance of dying. According to the newspaper reports—I have not checked them—39 deaths have taken place in Afghanistan. Those of us who attend the funerals of the people from our areas—as I attended the funeral of Ben Chuck, a commando, in Yungaburra—will never forget them. 


Yet we say to our troops: 'You are substandard. You do not deserve the same arrangements as other pensioners. You do not deserve the arrangements we in this parliament enjoy.' Our remuneration is tied to average weekly earnings and our pensions are tied to whichever is the better deal out of average weekly earnings and the CPI. But these men who risk their lives for their country are confined to the CPI. Don't you think that they are being told that we do not care about them—that they are expendable? Could there be a worse message to send to the parents and relatives of Ben Chuck and all the other Ben Chucks?


We are fighting wars. I was handed a rifle when I was 18 years of age. I heard John F. Kennedy and I thought we were all going to go to war—as did everyone in my senior class at Mt Carmel School after hearing him speak on that famous day. But then it blew over and the world was gay and happy—because there was not going to be any war. But, 18 months later, I was carrying a rifle and I had to give three telephone numbers to my commanding officer. I was on 24-hour call to go and fight in Indonesia. That war was about protecting our oil pipeline. 


There is a bit of get even and get square about the war in Afghanistan—and we do not blame the Americans for that. They are fully entitled to get square. But ultimately, in my opinion, the war in Afghanistan is about protecting their oil pipeline. I think you have to fight a war to protect your oil pipeline. But I plead with people in this place to understand that, if you want to fight a war to protect an oil pipeline, don't you think the people in the Indonesian archipelago might get a bit upset when we cut off their food pipeline—when we sink the little boats they sail out here to try to catch fish to keep their families alive? 


We are also fighting to protect the American alliance—and, quite frankly, we would ultimately have been invaded if it had not been for the Americans. Everybody knows that. We also provide peacekeeping forces—and we all want to make our contribution so that we do not see a repeat of the terrible things which have occurred in the past. An example of what can happen if you do not have a peacekeeping force is what happened in the Boer War. The British—and very sadly and to the shame of this nation, we were in there too—starved 26,000 women and children to death in the camps. They did so as government policy. If there had been a peacekeeping force to stop those greedy people like Cecil Rhodes, Barney Barnato and NM Rothschild, that concentration camp incident may not have occurred—and if that had not occurred, I do not think there would have been a First World War. There was no way the Germans were going to allow that to go unpunished. On their belts, it said, 'God is with us.' As a result of the Boer War, to some degree they were dead right—that God was with them. I speak not to condemn my own forces. I am very proud and honoured to sit under the portrait on my wall of Albert Anthony Henley, my great-grandfather's brother, who died at Gallipoli. 


We are moving today that our servicemen and women get the same deal as everyone else in Australia. I cannot see how anyone on either side of this parliament can hold their head up straight or look a soldier or an ex-soldier in the eye unless they support this proposal. 


We do not do this to blow our own trumpet. We would have been most happy for the government or the opposition to have moved this. I am quite sure the crossbenchers will very strongly support this bill. It will be voted upon and we hope that everyone votes for it. We very strongly commend the bill to the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (11:23):  I move:


That this House:


(1) recognises that the rate of employment for people with disability in Australia is significantly less than people without disability;


(2) commends the efforts taken so far by disability advocates and a number of big and small businesses that are working to remedy this concerning trend;


(3) acknowledges the significant economic and productivity benefits of having in work, more Australians with disability; and


(4) calls on the Government to:


(a) engage with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) about the merits of the ASX extending its Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations to require reporting on the employment of people with disability; and


(b) explore ways to ensure companies employing more than 100 employees report on their efforts to employ more people with disability.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Is there a seconder for the motion?




Mr Hayes:
  I second the motion.




Mr NEUMANN:
  In 1949, at the Australian Labor Party National Conference, then Prime Minister Ben Chifley said:


The success of the Labor Party at the next election depends, entirely, as it always has done, on the people who work.


His words still resonate decades later. Ben Chifley put into words what those on this side of politics have always believed in: the value of work. He verbalised our core values in that wonderful speech about 'the light on the hill', the great objective, and he talked about the Labor Party and the labour movement giving people a helping hand. Our strength on this side of politics comes from those people who have worked, who do work and who want to work. Now, more than ever, this nation needs a healthy, highly educated, creative workforce. We need to encourage men and women to work, for we believe that everyone has a right to work, regardless of their gender, race, postcode or disability. As a nation we have gone a long way, but there is much more to be done.


Among the OECD countries, Australia is ranked 13th out of 19 in employment rates for people with a disability. A study conducted by Deloitte Access Economics in 2011 on the economic benefits of employing people with disabilities suggests that closing the gap between the labour-market participation rates and unemployment rates of people with and without disability by even just one third would result in a cumulative $43-billion increase in Australia's GDP over the next decade in real dollar terms. The Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers conducted by the ABS in 2009 showed the labour participation rate for people with disability aged 15 to 64 was 54.3 per cent, compared to 82.8 per cent for people without disability, and that rate largely remained unchanged from 1993 to 2006. In my home state of Queensland, the participation rate for people with disability in the workforce is even lower: it is 48.3 per cent. We are, as a nation, wrestling with the challenges of skill shortages, and we have a vastly untapped potential group of employees here.


We are passionate on this side of politics about getting people into jobs—maximising the capacity of those with disability who are willing and able to work—and I commend organisations like Centrelink, Disability Employment Services and Job Services Australia; Disability Employment Services are doing a good job in that regard. And we are supporting those on disability support pensions to work up to 30 hours a week without their payments being suspended or cancelled, subject to an income test.


In my electorate, the electorate of Blair, based on Ipswich in the Somerset region, we have about 4,000 people on a disability support pension. Recently, at a carers event, I advised Carers Queensland and those who were there that we have 4,313 carers who do wonderful work and contribute to part of the $40 billion nationally of unfunded assistance and care that is given each year—great people in our community who are great advocates for people with a disability, like Peter and Linda Tully, associated with Queenslanders with Disability Network; the Endeavour Foundation; MACH 1; Uniting Church care; WorkVentures; CODI; Focal Extended and others in my electorate.


But we need to tap the potential of those job seekers who have not been targeted so far. We are putting lots of effort in, and we are determined to take action to address workforce shortages and increase the employment of people with disability. The $2,000 Supported Wage System employer payment is available to employers who employed someone with disability for a minimum of 15 hours a week for over six months. But we recognise there are unconscious, systematic biases in the labour market against those people with disability. Even well-intentioned people can succumb to stereotypes. I commend the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations who has been a passionate advocate for disability employment along with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As a government, we care that people with impairment are not getting first-class outcomes often, experiencing what Minister Shorten described as a 'jobs apartheid' in an otherwise great country.


Last Friday I held a DisabiliTEA outside my office in the Brassall Shopping Centre. Australians are generous by nature, and I was really chuffed and really touched by the support from local small businesses, who donated prizes and other sorts of assistance for people there with disability. It is often the small business people who really care and show their concern and communitarian spirit in what they do. But I believe we can all do better, and I believe large corporations ought to set the standard.


One of the options we need to discuss in this country is having Australian companies who employ more than 100 people report on how many employees with disability are on their payrolls. It is a simple, practical and relatively easy step towards equality in the workforce.


We need to engage with the Australian stock exchange to tackle a range of corporate biases. For instance, about 90 per cent of the boards of the ASX top 200 companies are full of men. We have relatively little ethnic diversity in our boards, and I would not hazard a guess about how many people with disability are on those boards either. Hiring people with disability is good for corporate Australia and it is good for the national bottom line. People with disability represent a massive untapped talent, particularly as the labour force shrinks with an ageing population.


I urge Minister Shorten to take further steps in relation to this. I know that he, along with Minister Ellis, has written to the ASX governing council seeking support in amending its Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations to require reporting on employment of people with disability. Members in this chamber will no doubt be aware of the inclusion of recommendations about diversity, particularly gender diversity, in the Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations and the positive effect that has had in promoting gender equity in key business and governance issues—but not enough yet, as the figures clearly show, with too few women on those boards. Extending the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations would assist, as it has done and will continue to do in relation to gender diversity, and I think it would represent an important step towards promoting cultural change and improving employment outcomes for people with disability.


But we also need direct action from government. I know that Labor governments undertake the tough task with respect to this, and we are setting up a National Disability Insurance Scheme. We put a billion dollars in the last budget towards launch sites in five states and territories but sadly, tragically and shamefully, not one in Queensland, my home state, because of the attitude taken by the LNP state government in Queensland.


On 3 December this year, I will hold my annual Blair Disability Links, an event that brings together disability service providers, including employers and those people who assist people who are suffering from disability—mental challenges, physical challenges and the like—to get jobs, into one place in a mini expo. We will launch again our Blair Disability Links booklet, which is like a one-stop shop, a little white pages or yellow pages for people. We give out literally hundreds and hundreds of those booklets all the time. They are probably the thing that gets picked up most at the mobile offices I have around Ipswich and the Somerset region. We will launch a fresh copy of that. I urge all those people who might be listening to contact my office—particularly Kylie Stoneman, who is doing a terrific job in my office organising that. We provide information in our community to help those people to get jobs, particularly in the many small businesses, because 96 per cent of people in the Ipswich and West Moreton region are employed in small businesses.


But corporate Australia have to make some tough decisions. They need to get on board in relation to this issue. It is no good just mouthing the words; they have to put them into action on disability. I know that privately and personally some of those company boards and directors are supportive of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and they have said so, but there is a difficult road ahead. The Labor Party is the party of reform, particularly in social and economic spheres. We are building the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but it is time for the big end of town, corporate Australia, the multinationals and the banks, to also get on board. This motion brings it to their attention because they need to consult broadly. I commend to the government to work on this, because people with disability and their carers and representatives are asking for this. I think this motion will bring to national attention this issue, important as it is.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-10-29,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:33):  I rise to speak on this motion put forward by the member for Blair. I encourage him not to politicise this debate. It is all well and good to say that people on his side of parliament support a National Disability Insurance Scheme and support people with disabilities in employment opportunities. Certainly those wonderful measures are also supported by those on this side of the House and, dare I say, on the crossbenches too, because people with disabilities need all the support they can get. The chairman and life member of Kurrajong Waratah, a disability service organisation in Wagga Wagga, Michael Kennedy OAM, in his chairman's report delivered at the annual meeting on 17 October, said, 'It has been said that the measure of a civilised society is the way in which it looks after its most disadvantaged and vulnerable community members.' Certainly all of us in this parliament, in this place, should be well aware of that absolute necessity to look after those most vulnerable members of society.


All across Australians head to work every day. However, for some Australians their disability acts as a barrier to finding employment despite their desire to have a job. Disability Employment Australia states that of the one in five Australians of working age with a disability only 53 per cent participate in the workforce, compared with 81 per cent for people without a disability. 


Disabilities are not always obvious and in many people you may not even be aware the person is disabled because the disability is not visible. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, Disability, Ageing and Carers Australia: Summary of Findings, found that 86 per cent of people with a disability experience limitations in core activities, including mobility and communication; almost 84 per cent have a physical condition, which can range from being confined to a wheelchair to having epilepsy or to suffering from AIDS; 11.3 per cent have mental and behavioural disorders; and, 4.8 per cent have intellectual and developmental disorders.


The most significant barriers to work for people with disabilities still appear to be stereotypical attitudes about what people with a disability can or cannot do. It is these attitudes which organisations across Australia are helping to break down, to assist disabled people into the workforce and, in the process, helping to increase productivity throughout Australia. Contrary to what may be believed, people with disabilities take fewer days off, take fewer sick leave days and tend to stay in jobs longer than other workers. Furthermore, people with disabilities also have fewer compensation incidents and accidents at work compared to other employees.


The Australian Network on Disability outlines the principles of employment as being the same for people with a disability as for those without disability, with the main focus on the skills, talents and capabilities the person with a disability can bring to the workplace. Many disabled people hold qualifications and do not require assistance in seeking employment. Businesses are employing people with disabilities because they are the best person for the job based on their skill set, not because they are disabled.


 For people who require assistance to gain employment, Australia is abundant with organisations willing and able to assist them to find a job which suits their needs. Australian Disability Employment Services currently assists approximately 140,000 individuals with a disability to gain and maintain employment in the labour market. This assistance is offered at almost 2,000 sites across Australia, with 224 providers operating the Disability Employment Services program.


Kurrajong Waratah, an organisation based in Wagga Wagga but which has operations right throughout the Riverina, provides services to children and adults with disabilities and support for their parents and carers in the Riverina-Murray region. Within the organisation, Work Solutions, a specialist recruitment and training agency, assists people with disabilities who find gaining employment and transition into the workplace difficult. There is a competitive labour market in the Riverina-Murray region and Work Solutions has broken into the market and found employment for people who have a disability. Kurrajong Waratah currently supports 268 people with a disability who have found employment in the region. Of these people, 37 per cent are employed in process work, 30 per cent in retail and 15 per in hospitality.


In addition to finding people employment, Work Solutions also assists those with a disability to gain the skills required to enter the workforce through vocational training and by employing 151 people with disabilities in business areas operated by Kurrajong Waratah, which includes Waratah Industries, Kurrajong Small Business Services and Kurrajong Recyclers. These businesses all provide professional services in the Riverina and I know the recyclers, particularly the e-waste recyclers, do a fantastic job around the region and are always prompt at collecting the recycling from every house in Wagga Wagga and certainly from my electorate office in Wagga Wagga.


Work Solutions also assists school leavers with a disability through the New South Wales government's Post School programs, which helps students transition from a school environment to the workplace. In the Kurrajong Waratah 2011-12 annual report, Crispin Lowe, the manager of Work Solutions, noted the great demand for the post school employment program. Schools leavers from Wagga Wagga, Leeton, Narrandera, Griffith, Temora and Deniliquin all started work placements in the community during the year.


Also based in Wagga Wagga is The Leisure Company, a not-for-profit organisation which provides recreation, work and life skill opportunities for people with disabilities in Wagga Wagga and the surrounding centres.


One of the programs run by The Leisure Company is the Transition to Work Program for school leavers which aims to develop living, educational, prevocational and recreational skills. These are all skills which can be carried over into the workplace. This is a fantastic program allowing young adults with a disability to develop practical skills to help them gain employment.


A PricewaterhouseCoopers report published in November last year found people with a disability are half as likely to be employed as people without a disability. Where the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average is 60 per cent, Australia ranks 21st out of 29 nations in the OECD. Whilst the National Disability Insurance Scheme would not be a magical fix for the problems in the system, it would assist in getting greater acceptance of disabled persons in the workplace. Rather poignantly, PricewaterhouseCoopers government sector leader Chris Bennett said:


It's clear the current system is broken big time. When you see Australia sitting last in OECD rankings on poverty for people with disabilities, it's just wrong. If we were sitting that low in the rankings in cricket or rugby Australians wouldn't countenance it.


The NDIS has the potential to support an additional 370,000 people with disabilities in the workforce by 2050. The coalition believes that the full implementation of an NDIS would be nothing short of a new deal for people with disabilities and their carers.


As the Productivity Commission recognised, this will require a high level of consultation and attention to detail which cannot be rushed into without risks to the scheme's subsequent success. We believe the commission's timetable is achievable with prudent government and good economic management. Launch sites are important, but the Labor government is yet to commit to the scheme over the long term. The only mention of the NDIS in the midyear economic and fiscal outlook is that it is a priority for the government over the medium term. The government must say whether it is committed to a full NDIS by the Productivity Commission's target date of 2018-19.


I am proud to say that I was the first federal parliamentarian in New South Wales to sign up to the NDIS: Every Australian Counts campaign. I stand by and support my comment that all Australians feel the need to have control of their own lives and it is incumbent upon the Commonwealth government to provide this freedom. I do not need any convincing this program needs my support. This comment extends to people with a disability who wish to have a job and contribute to the workforce, like every other Australian who wishes to have control over this aspect of their life. I commended the efforts taken so far by businesses which are employing people with disabilities and the work of advocates and organisations which assist people with a disability into the workforce on a daily basis.


Last Friday I attended a DisabiliTEA morning tea at Griffith which was arranged by Councillor Anne Napoli, whose son Patrick has a disability. She is a wonderful advocate for people with disabilities, certainly in the western Riverina. I look forward to continuing to work with Anne in the future to achieve better outcomes for people with disabilities in the region.


Finally, I will conclude with some remarks by Mr Kennedy of Kurrajong Waratah, who says:


It has been a remarkable achievement to reach this point from the release of the Productivity Commission's report and findings and recommendations for a NDIS in 2011.


…   …   …


Kurrajong Waratah's supportive and flexible relationships with people with a disability and their parent/carers will, under an NDIS, need to become stronger as they become not our 'clients' but our 'customers'.


He said that the NDIS is fully supported by Kurrajong Waratah and it looks forward to working with government into the future to make sure it is achievable for the benefit of people with a disability.

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2012-10-29,"



Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (11:43):  I speak in strong support of the honourable member for Blair's motion and commend him for bringing it to the House. I will associate myself with his contribution about, among other things, the NDIS and the Labor Party being the party of reform.


What I want to speak about in speaking in support of the motion is a particular program and project taking place in my seat of Page but more broadly across the North Coast area. That is the Disability Employment Broker program. It is a program designed to better help people with disabilities get jobs, help get them in the workforce and help maintain them in the workforce.


It is a program that can fund up to 10 Disability Employment Broker projects across Australia. It is a modest amount of money—$1 million in the 2012-13 budget—but with the potential to achieve significant outcomes. It has been introduced as part of Building Australia's Future Workforce package and that brings a lot of benefits with it. The Disability Employment Broker brings all aspects together—employee support, employer support, enhanced engagement with the employer—and looks at all industry sectors to see where it is easier to have people placed and where there is greater potential for ongoing employment, rather than short-term jobs.


I am pleased to say that TAFE New South Wales through its North Coast Institute was successful in its tender to undertake one of the brokering employment partnerships and training projects. That project commenced in September this year and will be completed in June next year. The project will cover the Northern Rivers and mid-North Coast areas and it will prioritise and target growing industries—retail, accommodation, food services, health and other industries that are experiencing skills shortages. They are industries that are quite significant and already established in the footprint where the project will take place. I was really pleased to see that the North Coast Institute of TAFE got the project, because I know that they have the specialised units, the skills and the commitment and they have set up a really nice style of management for this project. They are quite excited. I commend them for putting it forward. They will use a tripartite partnership model to broker the employment outcomes—which for the person wanting a job is a job. They will work with employer groups and Disability Employment Services, with TAFE as the architect and the lead of the project. They will engage with business networks, chambers of commerce, the Business Women's Networks and other industry in our area.


Part of the project will be about employment sustainability training. They are able to deliver that and work with employers on that. Another part of the project is working with employers to enhance their ability to manage people with disabilities in the workplace. Some of the job candidates will be provided with pre-vocational skills training and that will be designed and supported in partnership between North Coast Institute of TAFE and the providers and employers. It will help to create employment pathways, because sometimes it is really difficult to find which way to go. I am pleased to say that there is a project team, and the local employment coordinator from Building Australia's Future Workforce, who is from the North Coast, is on that with a range of other people with particular skills and expertise. It is a really good project for a small amount of money—about $130,000—and it will help about 20 people and it will help them long term.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (11:48):  I rise to speak on the motion put forward by the member for Blair, Mr Neumann. This is an issue that I take particular interest in and I thank the member for raising a matter of such importance. In my electorate I regularly meet with a group of parents and caregivers of people with a disability so that I can better understand the challenges that having a disability or having a loved one with a disability can present. These meetings give members of the community a chance to discuss what daily life involves for their family and how their circumstances could be improved. Many things have been achieved through this group, and one issue that has been brought to my attention is how much red tape people with a permanent disability have to go through to reprove that they have a disability year after year. The process is time-consuming, disruptive and frustrating.


One of my aspirations as a member of parliament is to see government departments imposing less red tape when dealing with people with a disability. I now have a greater understanding of the need for reform in this area through my experiences with the group of parents and caregivers. I would like to join the member for Blair in commending disability advocates and businesses employing people with a disability. In my electorate of Hasluck, I am fortunate enough to represent many members of the community who are part of such organisations. I am particularly proud to have a member of Disability Advocacy Network Australia in my electorate, and Midland Information, Debt and Legal Advocacy Service Inc., also affectionately known as MIDLAS, in the community.


I would like to congratulate Maria and the team at Friendship Cafe in my electorate on the work they do for the community of Hasluck, where they provide employment pathways and training to young adults with disabilities. The cafe is an excellent example of including and empowering people with a disability, and I hope to see many more initiatives like this in the future. I was honoured to be at the opening of the Friendship Cafe, and I would like to thank the staff for the excellent work that they do.


There are many other wonderful community organisations in Hasluck that I deal with regularly, including the Hills Community Support Group and the Foothills Information and Referral Service. Of course, more work needs to be done. In the 2009 Bureau of Statistics' Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers, 78.6 per cent of people without a disability aged 15 to 64 were employed, compared to just 50 per cent of people with a disability. 


The group of parents and caregivers that I meet with are always very honest in communicating with me about the challenges they face, and I always appreciate their input. I remember hearing at one particular meeting how parents of school-leaving-age children with a disability were worried about whether or not their children would be able to go on to higher learning. Members of the group were also worried about whether or not their children would be able to find employment and fit in at a workplace. 


I believe it is important for us as members of parliament to look at more effective approaches to creating pathways for people with a disability from school to higher education to employment. It is also important that we encourage the general public to give opportunities to people with a disability and to engage them in the workplace. I want to congratulate all businesses that are currently employing people with a disability. Having a job creates not only financial benefits for people with a disability but also a sense of independence, purpose and pride. I encourage more businesses to offer this sense of reward, along with the many benefits of employment, to people with disabilities in our community. In particular, I would like to see a reality check done on the businesses who have the capacity to provide such employment pathways. A particular young lady at a forum addressed the issue of her concern and then burst into tears because she had been applying for a job in a secretarial role but had not been successful. Even though there are job related services to support people with disabilities, she was unsuccessful. At the moment I am working with a couple of companies, hoping to find her a permanent job. The heartache of her circumstances is that her mother is dying of cancer and she has no father to care for her once her mother dies. So she is extremely worried about her own future.


There are many others who would be in similar circumstances, and I would hope that, within the industry and business sectors, there is compassionate consideration of giving people with disability real jobs that provide them with a pathway that is both rich and meaningful, and will enable them to enjoy a fulfilling life. I support the sentiments of the member for Blair and his motion.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-10-29,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (11:54):  I rise to support the member for Blair's motion. It is a timely motion and, in fact, one that is well overdue. I have met with representatives from various organisations, both legal services and advocacy organisations, advocating for the particular position and needs of people with disabilities who are seeking employment. I must admit that I was shocked to learn of the very low proportion of people with disabilities currently in full-time and meaningful employment, but I was more shocked to learn that there were not any strong national strategies in place to change this. 


One of the things that could have been done as a minimum for some time, and this motion does allude to it, is starting to set targets, or at least reporting targets, within public services and elsewhere for the employment of people with disabilities. Much is made by both the current government and previous governments when it comes to attacking welfare payments about the need to move people into meaningful employment, but one can only have the stick approach if one is serious about strategies for finding employment for people with disabilities. To date that has not really been the case. So requirements to report would be a very good start. 


I might suggest, too, that it is not just this category of employee, this category of people, who are going underrepresented in our work force and for which there should be reporting targets certainly in the public service. There is also another group of people who are highly represented in my electorate—people who have come here from refugee and migrant backgrounds. They maybe first generation having arrived here only a couple of years ago, or they may have arrived some time before that, potentially even generations ago. One of the things we are finding is that the unemployment and underemployment statistics amongst this group are particularly high as well. We are finding for example that if you have come here from a non-English speaking country and you have a tertiary degree or higher skills and qualifications, you are more than twice as likely to find yourself in a low-paid job compared with someone who has come here from an English speaking background. So underemployment is an issue, as is unemployment.


I would hope that if the government is serious about tackling the issue of underrepresentation in our work force we can go beyond this issue and take this perhaps as a template to look at other groups that are currently going unrepresented or underrepresented. But, more importantly, we are going to need more than reporting targets for people with disabilities. It is probably time for the government to consider binding employment targets within the public service and also to look at the government's procurement policy, because there is much more that can be done and it is far too often the case that when it comes to budget time the government is ready and willing to wield the axe and to rewrite the disability support pension impairment tables, for example, and to look at things that can be done to save money, yet there is not a corresponding national strategy for employment of people with disabilities. That is something that needs to change. We also need a national strategy for the employment of people who are underrepresented coming here from CALD communities and from other backgrounds as well.


I do commend the member for Blair for moving his motion, but there is much more that the government could be doing if it was serious about this issue, and it is time to take public service employment strategies and procurement policies much more seriously.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (12:04):  I rise to speak on the government's Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012. 


The Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 contains a range of measures implementing various changes to superannuation and income tax acts. The first schedule of this bill seeks to reinstate capital gains tax temporary loss relief and asset rollover for complying superannuation funds, other than self-managed superannuation funds, and approved deposit funds seeking to merge. These changes will see loss relief applied to transfers and from pool superannuation trusts and life insurance companies, as well as superannuation funds and approved deposit funds. This loss relief will be welcomed by some in the superannuation sector who missed the window when the opportunity for this relief was first granted in 2008 following the impact of the global financial crisis on equity markets and the impact that in turn had on the superannuation sector. The coalition supported the tax relief for merging super funds at the time as a sensible measure to ensure otherwise sensible mergers of superannuation funds were not prevented by taxation considerations. This bill seeks to again implement this measure on a temporary basis, this time for mergers that occur on or after 1 October 2011 and before 2July 2017. The coalition is supportive of this measure and understands the importance this has for the sector. 


Schedule 2 of the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 seeks to introduce a new registration regime for auditors of self-managed superannuation funds, SMSFs. While the government's Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012 establishes the framework of the new registration regime for SMSF auditors, some of the detail has been left to regulations. The coalition will be moving an amendment to excise schedule 2 from the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012. The coalition will be doing this on the grounds that we believe these provisions are yet another example of onerous regulation from a government addicted to applying red tape to the financial sector. No argument or evidence has been advanced by the government that current regulatory arrangements involving the tax office, the Tax Practitioners Board and the accounting professional bodies are failing or in some way deficient. I can state, however, that the coalition will not oppose this bill if our amendments are unsuccessful. We are doing this because we understand it is important to reinstate capital gains tax temporary loss relief and asset rollover for complying superannuation funds—and we would like to see these measures pass the parliament. The coalition will, however, use this opportunity to express our disappointment yet again at this government for the onerous regulatory impost it continues to impose on the superannuation sector.


The Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012 establishes the framework of the new registration regime for SMSF auditors, although some of the detail has been left to regulations. The bill lists a raft of new regulatory compliance measures on the sector such as the compulsory registration of self-managed superannuation fund auditor and the professional development requirements that will have to be met by self-managed superannuation fund auditors. Not only does the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012 set out a raft of new regulatory requirements but also it imposes a variety of new fees. One such detail is the fees to be charged. The legislation before the House seeks to allow a new application fee for registration as an approved SMSF auditor to be paid by the applicant; a new fee will be payable when an applicant is undertaking a competency examination; when a statement is made to ASIC in accordance with this new legislation a new fee will be payable, with a further fee payable if this statement was given one month after it fell due; and, a fee is also required to be paid when a person provides a change in particulars to ASIC in accordance with the legislation, with a further fee payable if this is given one month after such changes.


Under this new regime these fees are expected to not exceed a maximum of $1,000; however, there is no detail in the legislation, as it has been left to regulation. But there was a clue in the second reading speech from the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and the Minister for Workplace Relations. He indicated that self-managed superannuation fund orders will be subjected to a $100 initial registration fee for an online application, a $100 fee to take a competency exam in addition to a $50 fee for an annual statement to ASIC.


According to the regulatory impact statement, SMSF trustees will be subject to an approximate $14 increase in their SMSF levy, which will be paid annually. But how can those impacted by this legislation trust that the government will not increase these fees and charges, in light of what was handed down in MYEFO only last week? The government's early MYEFO, the one it handed down to avoid disclosing the true state of mining tax revenues, revealed a detraining budget position—yet, again the government chose to hit the self-managed superannuation sector by smacking it with higher fees. The increase to the SMSF fund levy from $191 to $259 will hit 480,000 self-managed superannuation funds and will raise $320 million over the forward estimates. This raid was also so the government could bolster its bottom line. Over half of the government's promised surplus in 2012-13 will be achieved through ripping even more money out of the superannuation system, a system already undermined by Labor's consistent tax grabs since coming to power.


As stated previously, the coalition will be opposing measures which impose further onerous regulatory requirements on self-managed superannuation funds. Schedule 3 of the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 aims to expand the reporting obligations for superannuation providers. Currently, a superannuation provider is only required to report about individual accounts if they have received contributions throughout the year and either the superannuation interest is held at the end of the period or the member received a benefit during the period. Effectively, no statement is requirement for inactive superannuation accounts. Under the revised reporting obligations funds will be required to provide statements for all members, both active and inactive. This is to support the implement the Stronger Future package, in particular the measures designed to facilitate consolidation of superannuation funds and accounts. The first member statements are due out by October 2013.


The changes contained within schedule 4 of the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 seek to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993  and the Retirement Savings Account Act 1997 to improve the linking of tax file numbers to superannuation accounts with the intended purpose of making them less likely to become inactive. These changes will enable the commissioner to keep a register containing information necessary to facilitate the transmission of information and electronic payments, and allow the commissioner to require information from an employer to determine whether regulations and standards are being met. The commissioner may disclose a member's tax file number to a superannuation fund only when the member has quoted their TFN in another superannuation fund with which they have an account. Trustees of eligible superannuation entities will the check the tax file number with the commission to ensure accurate information is being recorded, along with employers checking employees' tax file numbers. It should be noted that any member of a superannuation fund is not legally required to quote their tax file number. This legislation does not change that.


As stated at the outset on this debate on the bill, the coalition supports measures within the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 which seek to reinstate capital gains tax temporary loss relief and asset rollover for complying superannuation funds other than self-managed superannuation funds and for approved deposit funds seeking to merge. This measure will be welcome by those in the market who did not take advantage of this opportunity when it was originally offered back in 2008, during the heights of the global financial crisis. The coalition supports this measure.


However, as I have stated, the coalition does not approve of the additional regulatory burdens and fees that schedule 2 of the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief And Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012, imposed on the self-managed superannuation fund sector—particularly in light of the light of the increase charges the government handed down in it rushed MYEFO last week. The coalition will move detailed amendments to excise schedule 2 from the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief And Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012. If our amendments are unsuccessful then the coalition will not oppose this bill or the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (12:15):  I am very pleased to support the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012. These bills demonstrate the commitment of the government to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian superannuation system. The measures in these bills further the efforts of the government in its Stronger Super reform activities, about which I will say more in a moment. Australians can be confident that this Gillard Labor government is acting decisively in the present to ensure that every Australian can retire with dignity in the future.


I note the argument of the previous speaker, the member for Dunkley, that there was no evidence for the need to include provisions requiring further audit regulation. I suggest he take a look at the detailed findings of the Cooper Review into the Governance, Efficiency, Structure and Operation of Australia's Superannuation System and its specific consideration of these provisions. At page 16 of the Self-managed Super Solutions report, dated 29 April 2010, the Cooper review stated:


Submissions consistently supported the view that it was not the level of trustee knowledge, or compliance activity that needed to be increased; rather it was the qualifications, competency and professional standards of SMSF service providers. The theme of raising standards reverberated across all stakeholders groups (members, auditors, accountants, administrators and industry associations).


The Panel believes that the SMSF sector should be serviced by providers who are required to attain and maintain a minimum level of SMSF competency. Minimum standards would be aimed at greater consistency among service providers. More importantly, it would provide members with greater protection and reduce the risk of inappropriate advice.


So it is far from being something that was not carefully considered and based on evidence. Maybe in his own time the shadow minister can pick up and read the rest of the Cooper review. The provisions that the member specifically attacked are about increasing the integrity and probity of the explosion in the growth of SMSFs. By definition, self-managed super funds are those with four or less members. In Australia, there is over $400 billion in assets under self-management, which is about a third of total superannuation assets. SMSFs are promoted by entities such as accountants and financial planners, and in some cases the SMSF option may be ill-suited to a person or to a person's specific situation.


Given the exponential growth of SMSFs—which are regulated by the ATO and not APRA—it is important to have confidence in the audit process. I think it would be a good thing under the proposed reforms that a trustee must have an audit by an approved SMSF auditor. By any objective measure, it is better than having an accountant doing the books who is also signing off on the audit side. The clear intention arising from the recommendations in the Cooper review is to improve the integrity and probity of the process, enabling funds to do best what they are designed to do, which is to generate retirement savings and not lead to circumstances such as those experienced by victims of the Trio or Storm incidents.


I know from discussions with the sector that cases abound, for example in agribusiness schemes being promoted to SMSFs, where funds are ill-suited to the risks involved, and beneficiaries then wonder why they lose money. The predictable arguments of overregulation are not based in fact, are not based on inquiry, and in fact have no relevance to what we are discussing here today. Unfortunately that is not anything new—and I refer to some recent commentary on superannuation issues. Following the government's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, announced last week, the member for North Sydney made a number of outrageous statements suggesting that Australians with superannuation accounts that were dormant for 12 months would have their superannuation transferred to the ATO as lost accounts. He told Alan Jones on 2GB:


If your kids go overseas for 12 months or you're unemployed for 12 months and you don't access your superannuation account, then it's going to the tax office.


These statements are a total misrepresentation of the government's MYEFO measure in this area. Whether it is the result of intent or ignorance I do not know. Both the minister's press release and the MYEFO document make it perfectly clear that it is only the accounts of unidentifiable members that will be transferred to the ATO after 12 months of inactivity. If your contact details are known to the super fund, this measure has no impact on you whatsoever. 


It is absurd for the shadow Treasurer to repeatedly misrepresent the truth of this very important government measure. Of course, the member for North Sydney forgets that lost superannuation accounts can be claimed at any time through the ATO's SuperSeeker website. Furthermore, the relatively small number of Australians who will be impacted by this change will be better off in many instances. That is because they will not have their retirement savings chewed away by fees and costs charged by superannuation funds. 


If the member for North Sydney were so concerned about the entitlements of Australians, what prompted him in April this year to tell the Institute of Economic Affairs in London that the entitlement mentality was over and that bestowing entitlements on people placed future economic stability at risk? The hypocrisy of the member for North Sydney is staggering for those of us on this side of the House. His contribution to the debate in this area has been typical of the misinformed and false commentary that they have given on this government's important superannuation reform agenda.


As I mentioned earlier, the government is proud of its commitment to improving the Australian superannuation system and responding to industry needs. It is no secret that the rationale for reinstating the taxation relief foreshadowed in the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012, which I will refer to as the super CGT bill, is connected to the government's Stronger Super reform agenda. That agenda encourages increased size and scale of superannuation funds to provide a range of benefits to members, including enhanced product features, lower fees and greater potential for better investment returns from a larger pool of assets.


I have been fortunate to have had many discussions with members of the superannuation industry on this issue. A recurring theme with industry leaders is that tax considerations rank high for trustees of superannuation funds who are considering a merger. The value of a member's superannuation interest may include the tax benefit of unrealised net capital losses or revenue losses. In the absence of the optional loss relief and asset rollover contained in the super CGT bill, a merger may lead to a reduction in the value of the member's superannuation interest. In turn this can often act as a severe shackle on trustees of superannuation funds who are considering the merits of merging with one another. In fact, the trustees may decide to reject a merger proposal where there is a significant negative impact on member accounts.


The relief provided in the super CGT bill removes the obstacle to eligible funds merging that would otherwise exist because of the extinguishment of the tax losses. I note that the measures are designed to operate in respect of mergers that occur on or after 1 October 2011 and before 2 July 2017. These measures have been welcomed by the superannuation industry and there are some very recent examples of the benefits they will bring to the industry. Only last week two well-known industry funds—Asset Super and CareSuper—merged to create a fund with more than $6.5 billion under management and almost 270,000 members. In a press release dated 12 October 2012 from leading national law firm Corrs Chambers Westgarth, the legal counsel for Asset Super noted:


There is a great deal of merger activity in the superannuation industry at the moment and this is another example of the trend towards industry consolidation.


A key factor in the transaction was the availability of CGT relief for super fund mergers. The Government’s proposal to extend the availability of the CGT relief was critical in terms of enabling the merger to proceed.


In a joint release, dated 31 August 2012, from Asset Super and CareSuper regarding the merger, Julie Lander, CEO of CareSuper, commented:


… the estimated cost savings from merging are more than 15% per year just on business as usual activities. Looking ahead, further savings will be achieved with only one fund, rather than two, undertaking the significant amount of work needed to meet the new Stronger Super requirements.


The super CGT bill demonstrates this government's commitment to greater efficiency in the superannuation industry by providing for a reinstatement of the tax relief that the industry has been calling for. I am delighted to be part of a government that delivers such meaningful legislative responses to industry need.


I would now like to make some brief comments in relation to schedule 2 of the CGT bill and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012. They contain initiatives which are largely designed to introduce a new registration regime for auditors of SMSFs, or self-managed superannuation funds. APRA's latest quarterly superannuation performance statistics noted that at 30 June 2012 there were 478,263 SMSFs in Australia, compared to 442,987 as at 30 June 2011. The APRA statistics also revealed that these SMSFs have a total of $439 billion in assets under management, accounting for 31.3 per cent of all superannuation assets in Australia. So there are clearly a huge number of SMSFs in Australia, and their numbers are growing at an exponential rate. Ensuring their compliance with superannuation and tax laws and the accuracy of their financial statements is vitally important to the industry and this government.


As I mentioned earlier, the Cooper review identified a number of issues in the existing SMSF scheme for auditors. These issues include the lack of SMSF auditor independence, with a number of approved auditors also acting as the SMSFs' accountants, as I mentioned earlier; differences in minimum competency standards for approved auditors; and differences in the enforcement actions applicable to approved auditors. Consequently, the Cooper review made a number of recommendations to address these issues, including that ASIC be appointed the registration body for SMSF approved auditors, be responsible for determining eligibility requirements and setting competency standards, and determine and take appropriate enforcement action with the assistance of the ATO.


Schedule 2 of the CGT bill and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012 implement the government's response to those precise recommendations of the Cooper review in relation to auditor registration and independence. In essence, we have embraced the recommendations of the Cooper review in respect of SMSF auditor registration and independence. The government's objective in doing so is to raise the standard of SMSF audit competency and ensure there is a minimum set of standards that applies equally across the SMSF sector.


Those opposite may argue—as they have, indeed—that these are heavy burdens to place on the SMSF sector. The government flatly rejects such arguments. Given the size of the SMSF sector in the superannuation industry as reflected in the APRA data I referred to, it is critical to ensure that SMSF auditors are preparing high-quality audits and that any rogue elements of the sector are weeded out through appropriate enforcement action. Streamlining and strengthening superannuation are important matters for this government and feature strongly as part of our broader Stronger Super reform agenda.


There are several benefits associated with these bills. In the time available to me, I have sought to highlight some of them. It is evident that many working Australians will receive a tangible benefit from the measures being implemented by the passage of these bills. These actions are also a genuine reminder of the government's continued commitment to policy delivery and achieving its vision for the future of Australia in this regard. These bills are also another strong example of the government listening to the needs of the superannuation industry and responding to important policy issues rather than peddling untruths and seeking to alarm Australians about their superannuation savings, as some of those opposite have become accustomed to.


The superannuation framework under this Labor government has enabled Australia to amass a national savings pool in excess of $1.4 trillion, with estimates that this will grow to over $6 trillion by 2037. At a time when we all understand that we have an ageing population and the need to boost our national savings now, it is imperative for the reforms contained in bills such as these to be implemented in full. I urge all members to support these important reforms.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms O'Neill

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (12:28):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012, which are currently before the House. The former bill provides capital gains tax relief for the merger of superannuation funds; introduces a new registration regime for auditors and self-managed superannuation funds; expands reporting obligations for superannuation providers; and introduces new information exchange provisions for superannuation, particularly regarding the use of tax file numbers. The Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012 establishes the framework for a new registration regime for SMSF auditors.


As I am sure many members of this House will be aware, self-managed superannuation funds are the largest sector in the superannuation industry, worth $400 billion. Members of these funds are advised by a range of experts, including lawyers, financial planners and accountants.  The 11,000 or so SMSF auditors play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of a major sector of the superannuation system.


I cannot emphasise enough how important it is to those on this side of the House to ensure that this legislation is spot on the mark. The many people in my electorate who will be affected by this legislation will be bitterly disappointed. There are numerous self-funded retirees in my electorate of Wright and these additional changes to their superannuation make it harder and costlier for them to manage their retirement and thereby reduce the burden on the public purse. This is simply another demonstration that this Labor government has no economic strategy and will always put its own political survival ahead of the national interest. I cannot support imposing more red tape—this bill is a classic example of that.


This legislation is another grab which will affect the people who can least afford it. I do not have a self-managed super fund but a number of people in my electorate do. It disheartens me when they bring their statements to my office. The value of their funds is rapidly deteriorating. Early in 2007, the Labor government promised one in, one out, where every new regulation would be matched by repealing another piece of legislation or regulation. Latest figures show that since 2008 the Labor Party has introduced 18,089 new regulations and repealed 86—so 18,000 in and 86 out—an average of 11 new regulations added every single day since this government has come to power.


The first part of this bill looks at capital gains tax and how it affects those who choose to merge their funds from one to another. Let me state for the record that no problem has been identified that will be solved by these new requirements. It will merely make it more costly for Australians who wish to manage their own super fund to do so. 


It is well known that the coalition supports Australians who want to look after their own retirement. However this Labor government just looks on superannuation— particularly for those who manage their own super fund—as a source of tax revenue. There is a constant battle to fiddle the books, for Labor to get their hands into the pockets of mums and dads and into the funds of businesses in order to hang onto some type of political credibility and a wafer-thin surplus.


As many in this House will know, capital gains tax can be a barrier to the merging of superannuation funds. This is because whenever superannuation funds merge this will typically trigger a capital gains tax event, which leads to neither capital gains nor losses being applied to assets being transferred. When a merger takes place and the assets have been transferred, the merged fund is typically wound up. However, when the merged fund comes to an end, any previous capital or revenue losses that exist at that time will be forgone. The coalition supports that particular measure.


Due to the prevailing economic and financial market conditions in late 2008, a temporary taxation relief measure was passed in the form of 'loss relief' and 'asset rollover' to assist the superannuation industry and, through the industry, relevant fund members. However, the relief provided was limited to 1 October 2011.


At the time, those on this side of the House supported the tax relief for merging super funds as a sensible measure to ensure otherwise sensible mergers of superannuation funds were not prevented based on taxation considerations. That is because the coalition supports Australians who want to look after their own retirement. We will always support those Australians who want to do more to prepare for their own retirement.


This current bill is again, temporary; this time for mergers that occurs on or after 1 October 2011 and before 2 July 2017—and it has been made clear that that the coalition support capital gains relief for merging superannuation funds.


The next part of the bill introduces new registration regimes for auditors and self-managed superannuation funds. The recent super system review recommended that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission be appointed as the registration body for self-managed super funds approved auditors. The review found that not all approved auditors are subject to the same minimum competency standards nor are they subject to the same enforcement actions.


As some background information,  the practical experience that regulation will require at least 300 hours in auditing in the self-managed super funds in three years, immediately before applying for registration with the Australian Security and Investment Commission. An approved self-managed superannuation fund auditor will also need to undertake at least 120 hours of continuing professional development training every three years. This training must include 30 hours of training about superannuation, of which eight hours of training is SMSF auditing.


There are many other facts that I could add here, but I feel it is important to voice issues currently in this bill. Since 2008 Labor has added 18,089 regulations to the books. Back in 2007, the Labor government had promised that it would make no changes to superannuation laws—""not one jot, not one tittle"". That was the quote from back in 2007 that there would be no changes. However, that promise has been broken now on nine occasions so far, generating a total $7.8 billion in additional revenue. So here we have a government saying one thing and doing another. The Achilles heel of this government will always be the Prime Minister, four days before the election, standing and saying that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' And, of course, there were the Treasurer's comments that it is hysterical that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax.  This is just another piece of legislation where the government have said one thing and done another.


These changes are undermining the Australian people's confidence in the superannuation system, lowering the of contributions and consequently the level of savings available in their retirement. Voluntary superannuation contributions are down significantly in the context of a challenging market environment. It must be disheartening for people to receive their superannuation statements and see on those self-managed super funds that the value of those assets—through no fault of the own, but through world market pressures. It would be an enormous burden on families and retirees as they sit there and work out how are they going to survive in retirement and have this additional burden of knowing that there are additional costs that this government intend to apply to their savings. The last thing we need is more Labor taxes on voluntary savings making a bad situation even worse.


This bill also aims to expand the existing reporting obligations for superannuation providers. And yet again, we have a government doing everything it can to try and prevent the inevitable failure. A superannuation provider is currently only required to report about individual accounts, if they have received contributions throughout the year, and either the superannuation interest is held at the end of the period or the member received a benefit during the period. Effectively, no statement is required for inactive superannuation accounts. However, under the revised reporting obligations funds will be required to provide statements for all members, both active and inactive. This is to support the implementation of the Stronger Super package, in particular the measures designed to facilitate consolidation of superannuation funds and accounts.


Thankfully, I can report back to my constituents in Wright that the Coalition Deregulation Taskforce will continue to consult businesses and community organisations around the country looking to cut red-tape. The coalition has a clear road map for real deregulation by cutting $1 billion worth of red-tape out of the system. This is headed up by our Senator Arthur Sinodinos. He has been tasked with chopping out $1 billion worth of red tape—and I suggest that that task will not be too hard.


The last part of this bill amends the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993 and the Retirement Savings Account Act 1997 to improve the linking of tax file numbers to superannuation accounts thereby, the government claims, making accounts less likely to become inactive. The changes are another example of the red tape that is so very typical of this Labor government. It is well known to those on this side of the House that Labor has a terrible track record when it comes to decreasing red tape. Red tape does nothing to help the Australian people achieve a self-funded retirement.


In conclusion, it is obvious to those on this side of the House that every time Labor increases taxes on Australian super savers it reduces the incentive for people to do the right thing by saving for and achieving a self-funded retirement. Labor have an addiction to wasteful spending and instead of standing up for Australians doing the right thing by saving for their retirement, this government is hard at work making sure that money goes down the drain. This is a government who just do not know how to manage money and how to live within its means, which is why it has to keep making adjustments to its fiscal policies.


We need a government that will encourage mums and dads, students and young working class Australians to save so they can enjoy a comfortable retirement. Importantly, we need a government that spends less and lives within its means, and therefore can tax less, and that is focused on growing our productivity and our economy more strongly. Stronger growth would not only increase our prosperity; it would also improve superannuation returns and would lead to increased government revenue without the need for all these new and increased Labor Party taxes.


We will be moving an amendment in relation to schedule 2, and I commend that amendment to the House.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2012-10-29,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (12:41):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012. The coalition takes the issue of superannuation very seriously. It is vital for the retirement of countless millions of Australians that we have a superannuation industry that can meet the needs of an ageing population. We see investment returns challenged by a range of factors such as the global financial crisis and falling profits for a range of companies, so in recent time superannuation returns have been challenged but it is well known that you cannot look at the issue of superannuation returns over the short term. Superannuation is a lifelong investment, and if we can encourage young people to put more money into super at a young age, we can certainly ensure that Australians in their retirement years will have a much higher standard of living. 


Unfortunately it is very difficult to get that message through to young people at the age of 18 or 20 or 25 or whatever—retirement at the age of 65 seems a long way off. I think one of the challenges that we as legislators have, and the industry itself has, is to communicate to young people the benefits of investment in superannuation and the importance of investing at a young age. The dollar that is put in at an early stage in a worker's life yields a much higher return on retirement than dollars put in later in a person's life. The impact of compounding is immense. One of the key issues in ensuring that people have a comfortable retirement is that the dollars be put in as early as possible so that when the person comes to retire their superannuation balance is such that they are able to have the sort of retirement they want and expect. 


I turn to the legislation. Schedule 1 to the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 reinstates the temporary loss relief and asset rollover in division 310 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, with the following modifications: firstly, there will be an optimal asset rollover for capital gains and revenue gains; secondly, losses that are transferred to the receiving entity will be treated as having been made in the income year that they were transferred; and, thirdly, self-managed superannuation funds will be excluded.


Point 1.2 states:


The loss relief and asset-roll-over removes income tax impediments to mergers between complying superannuation funds by permitting the roll-over of both revenue gains or losses and capital gains or losses. This loss relief will be available for complying superannuation funds (other than self-managed … funds) and approved deposits funds … that merge with a complying superannuation fund with five or more members.


Point 1.3 states:


All references in this chapter are to the ITAA 1997 unless otherwise specified.


The context of these amendments is very important, because the capital gains tax is the primary code for calculating capital gains or losses of complying superannuation funds. There are certain gains and losses that are treated on the revenue account, such as those from a debenture stock or bond with regard to the relevant section here, which is section 295-85. The explanatory memorandum also notes:


The transfer of assets from one superannuation fund to another, under a merger between the two funds, will typically trigger CGT event A1 (about disposals of a CGT asset—section 104‑10 of the ITAA 1997) or may trigger CGT event E2 (about transferring a CGT asset to a trust—section 104-60 of the ITAA 1997). Therefore, the asset transfer will lead to the realisation of capital gains and/or capital losses for the transferring fund. Following this asset transfer and the transfer of members’ accounts to the receiving fund, the transferring fund will typically be wound up.


I note that the member for Throsby is in the chamber and is very keen to contribute in this debate. I would say that I reaffirm the coalition's belief that superannuation is a very important vehicle that should be supported. I note the fact that the coalition proposes some amendments to this legislation, and I certainly look forward to further contributions from members in this House in the ongoing debate.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (12:47):  I start by thanking the member for Cowper for both his contribution and his cooperation in this debate. The Stronger Super reforms introduced by this government are about improving the adequacy, the equity and the transparency of Australia's superannuation systems. These reforms underpin one of the most important Labor reforms, the introduction of our system of compulsory superannuation savings. This package of bills before the House today—the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012—is part of the Stronger Super reform process, and these new measures will further strengthen Australia's superannuation framework that has so well served working Australians in their retirement years. The government has, indeed, attempted to extend our early and revolutionary introduction of occupational superannuation during the period of the Hawke and Keating governments by introducing legislation to shift the compulsory contribution from nine to 12 per cent over a staggered period to ensure that future generations of Australians will have a more adequate retirement income.


Australia has high levels of national savings and even higher levels of national investment—that is to say, there is a gap between our level of savings and our level of investment. Compulsory superannuation, quite simply, is an important mechanism for closing that gap. Australian superannuation savings are currently worth around $1.4 trillion and are expected to reach $6 trillion by June 2035. For that reason, it is important that governance of superannuation is effective and is of the highest prudential standard.


I now turn to expand on some of the measures within these bills. The first measure, as set out in schedule 1, will remove income tax impediments to superannuation fund mergers by providing loss relief and asset rollover of both revenue gains or losses and capital gains or losses. The rationale for this amendment flows from the government's Stronger Super reforms, which have, quite simply, put pressure on superannuation funds to improve their competitiveness or reassess their viability in the absence of merging with another entity.


What we know in this area of investment is that, most often, bigger is better. The extinguishment of tax losses can be an impediment to fund mergers as trustees of superannuation funds are required to consider the adverse impacts in relation to tax on members' benefits of any fund merger. So this measure will apply to fund mergers that occurred on or after 1 October 2011 and before 2 July 2017, creating a window and an incentive within that window for funds to consider their size and consider the opportunities of merging with other funds with similar objectives.


Schedule 2 is about establishing auditor registration for self-managed superannuation funds, something that I and the member for Cunningham have a deep interest in because of the high number of constituents within our electorates who have lost significant amounts of money through the self-managed superannuation fund sector. I will have something to say about that.


Schedule 2 of the bill will establish an auditor registration for self-managed superannuation funds. Auditors play a critical role in the SMSF sector and, consequently, it is necessary that SMSF auditors have a high standard of competency. Many in this place know the high personal and financial cost that occurs when not only auditors but also regulators and corporate officers fail in their duty to investors, fail to pick up malfeasance, fail to pick up fraud and fail to pick up something that is within their statutory remit.


Unfortunately, as I said, the member for Cunningham and I know this situation all too well, with a large number of constituents in our electorates suffering enormous loss from the collapse of Trio Capital in 2009. This was a fraud committed on a grand scale, the biggest superannuation fraud in Australia's history. Around $176 million in members' funds were stolen through the fraud, money that belonged to hardworking Australians. Devastatingly, nearly half of these investors had directly invested in Trio through self-managed superannuation funds.


In the aftermath of the Trio disaster, considerable attention has been paid to the role of various regulatory gatekeepers in this fraud. Understandably for the Trio victims, the search for somebody to blame for this fraud is flavoured with strong emotion. If you put yourself in their position you would feel exactly the same. Every devastated investor who I have spoken to about the Trio collapse feels they took appropriate steps and, indeed, did everything successive governments have encouraged them to do—and that was to take control of their financial security in retirement by ensuring that they had a superannuation fund and to do that in a way that ensured that they did not take undue financial risks. Investors felt that they were acting responsibly and that Australia's strong financial system would ensure that they could rely on its regulatory systems. Fraud, by its very nature, is designed to get around those regulatory arrangements. It is designed to conceal and confuse.


KPMG and WHK, the auditors of Trio Capital, have come under considerable scrutiny since each year for six years they signed off on the financial statements of Trio and Astarra as being true and correct—and, quite plainly, this was not the case. These matters have been examined by the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the Trio collapse. WHK was the auditor at the time that Trio collapsed and gave evidence to the parliamentary committee that auditors take a risk based approach which is not designed to detect fraud.


This submission confirmed evidence presented to the committee in a submission by KPMG.


In its submission, KPMG outlined what it describes as the expectation gap, which is the difference between the public's expectation of the work of an auditor and what that work may disclose, and the auditor's own understanding of the work that is required to be done and reported upon in fulfilment of their duties. There is no doubt that, with regard to Trio, there is a clear gap between what investors perceived the role of auditors to be and the actual audit work that was done. The parliamentary report identified some key areas for further reform for ASIC to consider, including for more detail to be provided in compliance plans, for membership of compliance committees and related requirements.


It is important to note here that both the role of the Trio auditors and their evidence to the parliamentary committee was not of a high standard. Many issues remain with regard to the Trio collapse and the role of the auditors. Of great concern is that most self-managed superannuation fund investors appear to have had no idea that they were assuming the role of the trustee of their investment and thereby accepting a lower standard of prudential regulation. 


Unravelling the Trio disaster and the level of responsibility, accountability and blame for each participant and gatekeeper in the collapse of Trio is a complex task. In the meantime the SMSF auditor registration measures in the bill before the House today will raise the standard of SMSF auditor competency and ensure there is a minimum standard that applies across the entire sector. SMSF auditor registration will ensure that auditors of self-managed superannuation funds have a minimum standard of competency and knowledge of relevant laws and are able to detect and report contraventions by SMSF trustees. ASIC will be the registration body for SMSF auditors and will set competency standards that apply penalties to non-compliant auditors. The ATO will also have powers to monitor auditor compliance and be able to refer non-compliant auditors to ASIC for enforcement action. Reforms to our system of financial regulation are a series of small steps, like this one.


These reforms to the auditing arrangements are very important. A 2009 compliance audit by the Australian Taxation Office discovered that 29 per cent of the auditors of self-managed superannuation funds were the SMSF's accountant and that, in relation to 28 per cent of auditors, there appeared to have been some evidence of a relationship or a conflict of interest that might impact the auditor's ability to be independent, as would be required of an auditor of any corporation or any other fund in this country. For this reason alone and based on the experience that I have had in dealing with the victims of the Trio fraud, I commend this schedule of the bill to the House.


Amendments in schedule 3 of the bill will allow the ATO to display more comprehensive superannuation information to individuals and will facilitate the consolidation of inactive accounts with a low balance. They will also support the increased concessional contributions caps for members over 50 whose interests or accounts are valued at less than $500,000 from 1 July 2014. 


I turn to schedule 4. As part of the government's Strong Super package of reforms, a number of measures were announced to improve the efficiency of the superannuation system. These measures included the introduction of mandatory superannuation data and payment regulations and standards for eligible superannuation entities, RSA providers and employers, which were legislated in June 2012. It has been estimated that the Australian superannuation industry processes more than 100 million transactions annually. The potential gains to the system from improved efficiency in contribution management are significant.


This is one of those classic areas where more regulation leads to greater corporate efficiency—because when you are dealing with 100 million transactions annually, if you do not have standard protocols for the transmission, storage and reporting of that critical data, then a hell of a lot of extra work, duplication and inefficiency creeps into the system. In this particular area inefficiency means a cost to an employee or a member of a superannuation fund. So these measures are critically important. They will help to reduce the administration costs for the funds themselves but also, critically, they will help to ensure that we have a more efficient, effective and transparent system of superannuation administration in this country.


With around $1.4 trillion now invested in superannuation there is a strong public policy interest in having a safe, efficient and competitive superannuation sector to maximise the retirement incomes of all Australians. This Labor government, I am very proud to say, has focused on delivering superannuation and pension reforms for the long term. Australia's economy is growing and we have strong fundamentals such as low unemployment, contained inflation, low net debt and a record investment pipeline. It is critical that the superannuation system is designed to work for all members. It must work for those who take an active interest in their superannuation as well as for the majority of superannuation funds members who do not take a day-to-day interest.


As the collapse of Trio Capital amply demonstrates, we as parliamentarians have a duty to ensure that the laws that set out our system of financial regulation are robust, continually refined and keep pace with the increasingly sophisticated means of perpetuating fraud.


I commend this package of important bills to the House.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2012-10-29,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (13:02):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012. Along with the rest of the coalition, I am an avid advocate for reducing the burden of government on Australians. During the Howard years the burden of capital gains tax on individuals was reduced significantly—by over 50 per cent. This tax still places pressure on aspirational Territorians. In 2009-10, individuals in the Territory paid over $72 billion in capital gains tax.


The coalition supports reducing the burden of this tax on individuals and companies. The capital gains tax can be a large hurdle to the merging of superannuation funds. It can restrict mergers between funds even when, in the long run, it could be of benefit to members. Typically when funds merge we see either capital gains or losses in the transfer of assets. The merged fund is generally discontinued once the assets are transferred, and at this point any previous revenue and capital losses are forgone. This can be a disadvantage to the fund as capital losses can be used as offsets for present and future capital gains tax liabilities and revenue losses can be used as offsets against current year income.


I support schedule 1 as it will allow for the rollover of both revenue and capital losses. However, this is only relief legislation for superannuation funds during the prevailing economic times. This bill will cover all mergers that occur between 1 October 2011 to 2 July 2017. This relief legislation only brings further uncertainty to businesses and individuals. No-one is sure what will happen after 2 July 2017.


Schedule 2 places a higher burden on my constituents and other aspirational Australians. Self-funded retirees are some of the hardest hit by the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax through increasing grocery, electricity and petrol costs. The residents of Darwin and Palmerston already face huge costs and heightened cost-of-living pressures. By introducing the new registration regime for auditors of self-managed superannuation funds, self-managed retirees will have to deal with more red tape.


This bill will allow the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to become the registration body for the auditors of self-managed superannuation funds. ASIC will be given responsibility under this schedule to determine the eligibility of auditors, the competency standards they must meet and how this would be implemented. As my colleagues have raised before, we have concerns about this bill, which will give auditors very little time to meet new industry standards. It is typical of those opposite: policy on the run with no proper consultation period.


Registration of auditors will begin on 31 January 2013, and all auditors will need to be accredited by 1 July 2013 so that they can continue practising. Is this realistic? How much extra pressure will this place on businesses? It is typical of this government, which, as we know, is no friend of business. These changes will increase the burden on businesses if this bill is passed in its current form. The regulation to this bill states that the maximum fee an auditor can be charged for accreditation is around $1,000. This is a further cost to be borne by business at a time when many businesses are struggling. As the minister has stated, applicants will have to pay a $100 initial registration fee for an online application, a $100 fee to take a competency exam and an annual fee of around $50 for a statement from ASIC, which will be subject to an increase of approximately $14 a year.


This is just for starters. This is an additional cost to businesses, which will have a significant impact. We understand that the fees from this new scheme are expected to collect about $1 million over a five-year period from, say, 2011-12 to 2015-16. At the same time the implementation costs are expected to be around $29.7 million. So there is a $28 million gap there.


So I ask: where is the money coming from? Just last week we saw the Treasurer handing down a MYEFO built on uncertainty and instability. We see this government spending and promising money everywhere, but I ask you: where is this money coming from? In just four months we have seen the Gillard Labor government cut the size of their forecasted surplus by a third. Will we ever see a surplus from Labor? We know that Labor has a terrible track record. Just ask my colleague the member for Longman, who has never seen a Labor surplus in his lifetime. This Labor government also implemented a mining tax—a mining tax that has raised absolutely nothing in its first three months of existence. Maybe it never will. Now, I do not know about you, Deputy Speaker Rishworth, but I have never heard of a tax that does not raise money. But, in typical Labor fashion, the mining tax is just another example of economic mismanagement at its worst. We see them spending recklessly money that they just do not have.


Net interest repayments for this financial year are currently at around $20 million per day. Yes, $20 million per day, and that only covers the costed programs. We know that the Gillard Labor government has a $120 billion black hole of unfunded promises—$10.5 billion a year for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, once fully operational from 2018-19; $6.5 billion a year for the Gonski review; and $1.4 billion for an increased refugee intake to 20,000 over the forward estimates. With so many unfunded promises, how can they afford to implement the auditor registration regime as well? This is not the government's money they are spending, but that of aspirational Australians.


As a timely reminder to those opposite, I wish to quote the great Margaret Thatcher, an incredible woman who understood how important it was to reduce the burden government placed on the lives of individuals and businesses. Baroness Thatcher once said, 'There is no such thing as public money; there is only taxpayers' money.' I could not have said it better myself. Those opposite are spending taxpayers' money at unprecedented levels. You may be surprised to know that the spending of the Gillard Labor government is $90 billion more a year than the spending in the last year of the Howard government. Governments must live within their means. The government is putting everything on a giant credit card, and we all know Labor cannot be trusted with credit cards.


If the Treasurer wants advice on how to balance budgets, he needs to look no further than my electorate. Families in Darwin and Palmerston are masters of budget balancing. They have to be. The people of Solomon understand what it means to balance a budget. Struggling to manage a budget is part of their everyday lives—balancing school fees, mortgage repayments, grocery bills, electricity bills, rates and phone bills. These costs are only further compounded by the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax on everything. In the 2011-12 financial year Darwin experienced the largest housing price increases in the country, averaging 12.3 per cent. Darwin and Palmerston have the third highest median house prices in Australia, after Sydney and Melbourne, and the highest median weekly rent costs for a three-bedroom home, $542 a week, compared to the next closet city, Canberra, with a median price of $448 per week. This is absolutely outrageous. But this is indicative of a Territory Labor government, recently voted out after failing Territorians for 11 years. Territorians had had enough and voted them out. If the people of Darwin and Palmerston are so capable at managing a budget, why isn't the Treasurer?


I go back to the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012. We are deeply concerned that this bill will just increase the red tape burden on those Australians who wish to manage their own superannuation. Under Labor, the only certainty for Australians is more taxes, more debt and more pain. It is quite obvious that the Gillard Labor government have completely lost their way, and their only answer is to try and reignite a class war. As I have said many times in this place, small business is the backbone of the Northern Territory, and this government is punishing those people for nothing more than their own political gain, punishing these individuals for being aspirational and daring to dream.


In MYEFO last week we saw the Treasurer confirm that $390 million would be spent by the ATO to crack down on small businesses. Small businesses are being forced to pay as the Gillard Labor government look to every possible avenue to fund their spending addiction. We know that Labor is no friend of small business. Labor is no friend of the aspirational Australian.


I have some surprising statistics for you. Since Labor came to office in 2007, we have seen 18,089 new regulations introduced—that is 11 regulations a day—and only 86 have been repealed. This is a far cry from the election promise made in 2007 of 'one in, one out', where new regulations would only be brought in if they were matched by one that was repealed. So someone cannot count, because from my accounting there are about 18,000 extra regulations that need to be repealed. It is no wonder red tape is strangling individuals and business. The Gillard Labor government is built around policy on the run. There is a complete lack of understanding and appreciation for small business.


I ask you, Deputy Speaker, how many of the cabinet ministers have run a business? I suspect the number is very low, if any at all. This is in strong contrast to the coalition. We understand small business, we are the party of small business and we know that small business is the engine room of economic growth in Australia. We have a plan. Under an Abbott-led government the coalition will cut $1 billion worth of red tape. The coalition has never supported unnecessary red tape. The coalition does not support unnecessary red tape. Along with my colleagues I support Australians choosing whether or not they save for their own retirement. We will be putting forward an amendment to this bill, as we are opposed to the red tape inherent in the new audit regime for self-managed super funds.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (13:14):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012. I want to focus in particular on one of the principal measures in this bill, which is to provide capital gains and other tax relief for merging superannuation funds. The policy rationale for that, stated in the explanatory memorandum, is to encourage the merger of small superannuation funds and in turn deliver benefits to members through economies of scale.


In the time available to me today I want to make three points. Firstly, I want to make the point that capital gains tax relief for the merging of superannuation funds is a reasonable idea, as far as it goes. Secondly, I want to spend a moment speaking about the serious public policy problem which this bill is designed to address—namely, that there is a long tail of small superannuation funds. Thirdly, I want to make the point that we need to have a more comprehensive look at the issue of the long tail of small funds and ask whether the measures in this bill go far enough.


I turn firstly to the proposition that the measure to give tax relief contained in this bill is a sensible idea as far as it goes. I remind the House that superannuation is designed to be a tax advantaged vehicle for the accumulation of retirement savings. The ultimate policy intention is to allow as many Australians as possible to build up savings and hence provide, wholly or partly, for themselves in retirement rather than relying on the old-age pension. This year the old-age pension will comprise around $37 billion of Commonwealth expenditure, which is around 10 per cent of the entire Commonwealth government expenditure. So, clearly, the policy prize if we can reduce the reliance on the old-age pension is a very significant one.


The problem which this bill is specifically designed to address is that we have too many small, subscale, superannuation funds. Accordingly, anything which would act as an impediment to funds merging and therefore allowing average fund size to increase needs careful consideration. A factor which presently acts as an impediment today is that, if superannuation funds merge, there are adverse tax consequences for the members of the fund. First of all, the transfer of assets which typically occurs as part of a merger is a capital gains tax event. In the attractive jargon of the Income Tax Assessment Act, it might be a CGT event A1, the disposal of a capital gains tax asset, or it might be a CGT event E2, the transfer of a capital gains tax asset to a trust. In either event, it triggers an obligation to pay capital gains tax. Secondly, typically in such a transaction, one of the existing funds will be wound up. That means that any existing tax losses held within that fund can no longer be used. That, additionally, is a factor which negatively impacts on the net value of the assets in the fund and in turn on the value of the balances held by members.


Given that the very purpose of superannuation is to accumulate assets in a concessional tax environment, it is understandable that trustees would be wary of proceeding with a merger given the current tax consequences, where it is likely to reduce the value of members' balances. Accordingly, a change to the law which removes this impediment, this blocker, to mergers of superannuation funds, makes sense in principle. That is certainly the view of this side of the House.


Let me turn secondly to the underlying policy problem which this measure is designed to address. In the words of the explanatory memorandum, the intention is to:


… put pressure on superannuation funds to improve their competitiveness or reassess their viability in the absence of merging with another entity.


And it is to encourage: 


… increased size or scale of superannuation funds to enable funds to provide a range of benefits to members …


Let's be a bit clearer about what the problem is here: we have a long tail of small superannuation funds. We should also be clear that small funds are not of themselves a problem. It is certainly possible that a small fund might have superior investment skills such that it generates above normal returns and that those excess returns more than compensate for any extra costs which result from its smaller size. But, when the size and composition of a superannuation fund has been determined not on the basis of rational economic considerations but on quite different considerations, there is every possibility of a small fund delivering inadequate returns.


Our present superannuation system comprises many different funds, some small and some large. The particular basis on which the money has been divided up—and, hence, the basis on which an employee has his or her retirement savings allocated to any one fund—is driven quite heavily by the architecture of the union movement. This is a very important public policy question because the superannuation system has grown very large, with some $1.4 trillion of funds under management. Largely thanks to compulsory super contributions, in 2011-12, some $90 billion flowed into the sector. Of that, nearly two-thirds went into one of two kinds of funds: industry funds or public sector funds. Funds of this kind generally use the 'equal representation' model, with half of the directors appointed by a union and half by an employer association.


In the APRA statistics, for the 2010-11 financial year there were 76 funds listed as 'industry' or 'public sector'. An analysis of the annual reports of these funds shows that in 2010-11 there were a total of 575 directors on their boards, of whom 180 were appointed by unions. These funds had a total of $370 billion under management as at 30 June 2011, according to the APRA statistics, and the biggest 10 funds had around 63 per cent of this total. This leaves a long tail of much smaller funds. In fact, of the 76 funds, 57 are less than $5 billion in size, and at least 20 have assets of less than $1 billion.


Let me mention some examples. The Australian Meat Industry Superannuation Trust had net assets of $990 million as at 30 June 2011. The Health Industry Plan had net assets of $612 million. AUST(Q), otherwise known as the Allied Unions Superannuation Trust (Queensland), had net assets of $193 million. The Transport Industry Superannuation Fund had net assets of $84 million. I make no criticism of the specific managements of the funds I have mentioned, but I do raise the question of whether it best serves the interests of members to have a large number of quite small funds. That of course is the very question which the measures in this legislation are designed to address. I think we can see that there is an underlying public policy problem.


The real question, though, is whether the measures in this legislation will go far enough, and that is the third point I want to come to. How likely is it that desirable mergers will occur just because the tax impediments to such mergers are reduced, when we have the structural features of our superannuation system which I have described? The recent failure of the merger between Vision Super and Equipsuper in Victoria is not an encouraging precedent. Vision Super has four directors appointed by the Australian Services Union. The merged entity was supposed to have elected directors. It turned out that a member of the Equipsuper fund—somebody who happened to be a senior manager at a power company—chose to seek election as a board member of the merged super fund. This made the Australian Services Union very cross. In an email to Australian Services Union members, the state secretary of the union, Brian Parkinson, had this to say:


As expected, employers are seeking election to workers' positions. Indeed, one such individual … has exploited his senior management role to frustrate the election chances of ASU candidates … Management will pull out all the stops to see one of their own elected at the expense of workers.


At the time of sending this email, Mr Parkinson was also a director of Vision Super. He had duties to the members of that fund, and the transaction was conceived as being in the interests of those members. Yet, pretty clearly, when Mr Parkinson sent this email he was not giving much thought to the interests of members of Vision Super; what he was concerned about was the interests of the Australian Services Union.


We need to look very closely at whether the measures in this legislation will do much to assist the position when relatively small superannuation funds are very closely aligned with unions. It is quite easy to see how a governance problem in a union could infect an associated superannuation fund. We have seen such an example quite recently with the former Health Services Union boss Michael Williamson, until recently a union appointed director of First State Super, a fund with some $30 billion under management. Earlier this year, the chairman of First State Super complained that he had no power to remove Mr Williamson as a trustee of that fund, despite the serious allegations, at that point, which had been made about Mr Williamson's conduct. Of course, since that point he has been charged by the New South Wales police.


An equally troubling example of this phenomenon is a $30 million investment in the building company Austcorp by the Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund, almost all of which was lost following Austcorp's collapse in 2009. The Australian has reported that Mr Wally Curran, a long-time secretary of the Meatworkers Union and a long-serving director on the board of the fund, was paid significant consultancy fees by Austcorp. At the very least, this raises serious questions about whether Mr Curran had a conflict of interest and whether he was acting in the best interests of members of the fund. That $30 million, by the way, was a material proportion of the entire balance of the assets of the Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund.


Or we could consider the position of TWUSUPER, a fund with $2.6 billion under management and 130,000 members, with four directors appointed by the Transport Workers Union. The four directors appointed are the Transport Workers Union's federal secretary, Tony Sheldon, and three state secretaries: Wayne Forno, Wayne Mader and Jim McGiveron. Last year the Transport Workers Union vigorously attacked changes proposed by the management of Qantas to the operation of that company, changes that management said would improve the company's financial performance. How do the directors of TWUSUPER, who are also union officials, think about equity investments in Qantas or other companies in the transport sector? Members of TWUSUPER have a right to expect that the sole consideration exercising the minds of directors is how to maximise the financial returns generated by the fund. Indeed, under the sole purpose test in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, that is the duty of directors of that superannuation fund. 


So there is clearly a structural problem in the superannuation sector, particularly in relation to industry and public sector funds, where there is a long tail of small funds. As some of the instances I have cited highlight, this creates the potential for inadequate standards of governance, particularly amongst that long tail of smaller funds, which are not subject to the same degree of detailed public scrutiny as larger funds tend to be. The question I also want to raise for consideration by the House this afternoon is whether the well-intentioned measure in the legislation before the House today goes far enough to encourage the consolidation which it says is a desirable objective, when you consider some of the entrenched interests of directors of funds. I think the email that I cited from ASU state secretary Brian Parkinson is extremely relevant in that regard.


Let me conclude by noting that the measures in this bill are intended to assist in facilitating the mergers of superannuation funds by offering capital gains and other tax relief for such mergers and in turn to address the problem, which clearly exists, of a long tail of subscale funds. I hasten to add that the mere fact that a fund is small does not of itself indicate a problem, but we have seen that, where there are small funds, particularly ones closely associated with unions, that creates a culture in which governance problems appear to be more likely to materialise. The only way to get to grips with this issue is to seriously address the governance of superannuation funds and in particular the recommendations of the Cooper review in relation to ending the current form of the equal representation model. It is a matter for regret that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and former National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union has done nothing about that.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (12:04):  I rise to speak on the government's Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012. 


The Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 contains a range of measures implementing various changes to superannuation and income tax acts. The first schedule of this bill seeks to reinstate capital gains tax temporary loss relief and asset rollover for complying superannuation funds, other than self-managed superannuation funds, and approved deposit funds seeking to merge. These changes will see loss relief applied to transfers and from pool superannuation trusts and life insurance companies, as well as superannuation funds and approved deposit funds. This loss relief will be welcomed by some in the superannuation sector who missed the window when the opportunity for this relief was first granted in 2008 following the impact of the global financial crisis on equity markets and the impact that in turn had on the superannuation sector. The coalition supported the tax relief for merging super funds at the time as a sensible measure to ensure otherwise sensible mergers of superannuation funds were not prevented by taxation considerations. This bill seeks to again implement this measure on a temporary basis, this time for mergers that occur on or after 1 October 2011 and before 2July 2017. The coalition is supportive of this measure and understands the importance this has for the sector. 


Schedule 2 of the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 seeks to introduce a new registration regime for auditors of self-managed superannuation funds, SMSFs. While the government's Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012 establishes the framework of the new registration regime for SMSF auditors, some of the detail has been left to regulations. The coalition will be moving an amendment to excise schedule 2 from the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012. The coalition will be doing this on the grounds that we believe these provisions are yet another example of onerous regulation from a government addicted to applying red tape to the financial sector. No argument or evidence has been advanced by the government that current regulatory arrangements involving the tax office, the Tax Practitioners Board and the accounting professional bodies are failing or in some way deficient. I can state, however, that the coalition will not oppose this bill if our amendments are unsuccessful. We are doing this because we understand it is important to reinstate capital gains tax temporary loss relief and asset rollover for complying superannuation funds—and we would like to see these measures pass the parliament. The coalition will, however, use this opportunity to express our disappointment yet again at this government for the onerous regulatory impost it continues to impose on the superannuation sector.


The Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012 establishes the framework of the new registration regime for SMSF auditors, although some of the detail has been left to regulations. The bill lists a raft of new regulatory compliance measures on the sector such as the compulsory registration of self-managed superannuation fund auditor and the professional development requirements that will have to be met by self-managed superannuation fund auditors. Not only does the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012 set out a raft of new regulatory requirements but also it imposes a variety of new fees. One such detail is the fees to be charged. The legislation before the House seeks to allow a new application fee for registration as an approved SMSF auditor to be paid by the applicant; a new fee will be payable when an applicant is undertaking a competency examination; when a statement is made to ASIC in accordance with this new legislation a new fee will be payable, with a further fee payable if this statement was given one month after it fell due; and, a fee is also required to be paid when a person provides a change in particulars to ASIC in accordance with the legislation, with a further fee payable if this is given one month after such changes.


Under this new regime these fees are expected to not exceed a maximum of $1,000; however, there is no detail in the legislation, as it has been left to regulation. But there was a clue in the second reading speech from the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and the Minister for Workplace Relations. He indicated that self-managed superannuation fund orders will be subjected to a $100 initial registration fee for an online application, a $100 fee to take a competency exam in addition to a $50 fee for an annual statement to ASIC.


According to the regulatory impact statement, SMSF trustees will be subject to an approximate $14 increase in their SMSF levy, which will be paid annually. But how can those impacted by this legislation trust that the government will not increase these fees and charges, in light of what was handed down in MYEFO only last week? The government's early MYEFO, the one it handed down to avoid disclosing the true state of mining tax revenues, revealed a detraining budget position—yet, again the government chose to hit the self-managed superannuation sector by smacking it with higher fees. The increase to the SMSF fund levy from $191 to $259 will hit 480,000 self-managed superannuation funds and will raise $320 million over the forward estimates. This raid was also so the government could bolster its bottom line. Over half of the government's promised surplus in 2012-13 will be achieved through ripping even more money out of the superannuation system, a system already undermined by Labor's consistent tax grabs since coming to power.


As stated previously, the coalition will be opposing measures which impose further onerous regulatory requirements on self-managed superannuation funds. Schedule 3 of the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 aims to expand the reporting obligations for superannuation providers. Currently, a superannuation provider is only required to report about individual accounts if they have received contributions throughout the year and either the superannuation interest is held at the end of the period or the member received a benefit during the period. Effectively, no statement is requirement for inactive superannuation accounts. Under the revised reporting obligations funds will be required to provide statements for all members, both active and inactive. This is to support the implement the Stronger Future package, in particular the measures designed to facilitate consolidation of superannuation funds and accounts. The first member statements are due out by October 2013.


The changes contained within schedule 4 of the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 seek to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993  and the Retirement Savings Account Act 1997 to improve the linking of tax file numbers to superannuation accounts with the intended purpose of making them less likely to become inactive. These changes will enable the commissioner to keep a register containing information necessary to facilitate the transmission of information and electronic payments, and allow the commissioner to require information from an employer to determine whether regulations and standards are being met. The commissioner may disclose a member's tax file number to a superannuation fund only when the member has quoted their TFN in another superannuation fund with which they have an account. Trustees of eligible superannuation entities will the check the tax file number with the commission to ensure accurate information is being recorded, along with employers checking employees' tax file numbers. It should be noted that any member of a superannuation fund is not legally required to quote their tax file number. This legislation does not change that.


As stated at the outset on this debate on the bill, the coalition supports measures within the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 which seek to reinstate capital gains tax temporary loss relief and asset rollover for complying superannuation funds other than self-managed superannuation funds and for approved deposit funds seeking to merge. This measure will be welcome by those in the market who did not take advantage of this opportunity when it was originally offered back in 2008, during the heights of the global financial crisis. The coalition supports this measure.


However, as I have stated, the coalition does not approve of the additional regulatory burdens and fees that schedule 2 of the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief And Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012, imposed on the self-managed superannuation fund sector—particularly in light of the light of the increase charges the government handed down in it rushed MYEFO last week. The coalition will move detailed amendments to excise schedule 2 from the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief And Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012. If our amendments are unsuccessful then the coalition will not oppose this bill or the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2012-10-29,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (12:15):  I am very pleased to support the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012. These bills demonstrate the commitment of the government to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian superannuation system. The measures in these bills further the efforts of the government in its Stronger Super reform activities, about which I will say more in a moment. Australians can be confident that this Gillard Labor government is acting decisively in the present to ensure that every Australian can retire with dignity in the future.


I note the argument of the previous speaker, the member for Dunkley, that there was no evidence for the need to include provisions requiring further audit regulation. I suggest he take a look at the detailed findings of the Cooper Review into the Governance, Efficiency, Structure and Operation of Australia's Superannuation System and its specific consideration of these provisions. At page 16 of the Self-managed Super Solutions report, dated 29 April 2010, the Cooper review stated:


Submissions consistently supported the view that it was not the level of trustee knowledge, or compliance activity that needed to be increased; rather it was the qualifications, competency and professional standards of SMSF service providers. The theme of raising standards reverberated across all stakeholders groups (members, auditors, accountants, administrators and industry associations).


The Panel believes that the SMSF sector should be serviced by providers who are required to attain and maintain a minimum level of SMSF competency. Minimum standards would be aimed at greater consistency among service providers. More importantly, it would provide members with greater protection and reduce the risk of inappropriate advice.


So it is far from being something that was not carefully considered and based on evidence. Maybe in his own time the shadow minister can pick up and read the rest of the Cooper review. The provisions that the member specifically attacked are about increasing the integrity and probity of the explosion in the growth of SMSFs. By definition, self-managed super funds are those with four or less members. In Australia, there is over $400 billion in assets under self-management, which is about a third of total superannuation assets. SMSFs are promoted by entities such as accountants and financial planners, and in some cases the SMSF option may be ill-suited to a person or to a person's specific situation.


Given the exponential growth of SMSFs—which are regulated by the ATO and not APRA—it is important to have confidence in the audit process. I think it would be a good thing under the proposed reforms that a trustee must have an audit by an approved SMSF auditor. By any objective measure, it is better than having an accountant doing the books who is also signing off on the audit side. The clear intention arising from the recommendations in the Cooper review is to improve the integrity and probity of the process, enabling funds to do best what they are designed to do, which is to generate retirement savings and not lead to circumstances such as those experienced by victims of the Trio or Storm incidents.


I know from discussions with the sector that cases abound, for example in agribusiness schemes being promoted to SMSFs, where funds are ill-suited to the risks involved, and beneficiaries then wonder why they lose money. The predictable arguments of overregulation are not based in fact, are not based on inquiry, and in fact have no relevance to what we are discussing here today. Unfortunately that is not anything new—and I refer to some recent commentary on superannuation issues. Following the government's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, announced last week, the member for North Sydney made a number of outrageous statements suggesting that Australians with superannuation accounts that were dormant for 12 months would have their superannuation transferred to the ATO as lost accounts. He told Alan Jones on 2GB:


If your kids go overseas for 12 months or you're unemployed for 12 months and you don't access your superannuation account, then it's going to the tax office.


These statements are a total misrepresentation of the government's MYEFO measure in this area. Whether it is the result of intent or ignorance I do not know. Both the minister's press release and the MYEFO document make it perfectly clear that it is only the accounts of unidentifiable members that will be transferred to the ATO after 12 months of inactivity. If your contact details are known to the super fund, this measure has no impact on you whatsoever. 


It is absurd for the shadow Treasurer to repeatedly misrepresent the truth of this very important government measure. Of course, the member for North Sydney forgets that lost superannuation accounts can be claimed at any time through the ATO's SuperSeeker website. Furthermore, the relatively small number of Australians who will be impacted by this change will be better off in many instances. That is because they will not have their retirement savings chewed away by fees and costs charged by superannuation funds. 


If the member for North Sydney were so concerned about the entitlements of Australians, what prompted him in April this year to tell the Institute of Economic Affairs in London that the entitlement mentality was over and that bestowing entitlements on people placed future economic stability at risk? The hypocrisy of the member for North Sydney is staggering for those of us on this side of the House. His contribution to the debate in this area has been typical of the misinformed and false commentary that they have given on this government's important superannuation reform agenda.


As I mentioned earlier, the government is proud of its commitment to improving the Australian superannuation system and responding to industry needs. It is no secret that the rationale for reinstating the taxation relief foreshadowed in the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012, which I will refer to as the super CGT bill, is connected to the government's Stronger Super reform agenda. That agenda encourages increased size and scale of superannuation funds to provide a range of benefits to members, including enhanced product features, lower fees and greater potential for better investment returns from a larger pool of assets.


I have been fortunate to have had many discussions with members of the superannuation industry on this issue. A recurring theme with industry leaders is that tax considerations rank high for trustees of superannuation funds who are considering a merger. The value of a member's superannuation interest may include the tax benefit of unrealised net capital losses or revenue losses. In the absence of the optional loss relief and asset rollover contained in the super CGT bill, a merger may lead to a reduction in the value of the member's superannuation interest. In turn this can often act as a severe shackle on trustees of superannuation funds who are considering the merits of merging with one another. In fact, the trustees may decide to reject a merger proposal where there is a significant negative impact on member accounts.


The relief provided in the super CGT bill removes the obstacle to eligible funds merging that would otherwise exist because of the extinguishment of the tax losses. I note that the measures are designed to operate in respect of mergers that occur on or after 1 October 2011 and before 2 July 2017. These measures have been welcomed by the superannuation industry and there are some very recent examples of the benefits they will bring to the industry. Only last week two well-known industry funds—Asset Super and CareSuper—merged to create a fund with more than $6.5 billion under management and almost 270,000 members. In a press release dated 12 October 2012 from leading national law firm Corrs Chambers Westgarth, the legal counsel for Asset Super noted:


There is a great deal of merger activity in the superannuation industry at the moment and this is another example of the trend towards industry consolidation.


A key factor in the transaction was the availability of CGT relief for super fund mergers. The Government’s proposal to extend the availability of the CGT relief was critical in terms of enabling the merger to proceed.


In a joint release, dated 31 August 2012, from Asset Super and CareSuper regarding the merger, Julie Lander, CEO of CareSuper, commented:


… the estimated cost savings from merging are more than 15% per year just on business as usual activities. Looking ahead, further savings will be achieved with only one fund, rather than two, undertaking the significant amount of work needed to meet the new Stronger Super requirements.


The super CGT bill demonstrates this government's commitment to greater efficiency in the superannuation industry by providing for a reinstatement of the tax relief that the industry has been calling for. I am delighted to be part of a government that delivers such meaningful legislative responses to industry need.


I would now like to make some brief comments in relation to schedule 2 of the CGT bill and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012. They contain initiatives which are largely designed to introduce a new registration regime for auditors of SMSFs, or self-managed superannuation funds. APRA's latest quarterly superannuation performance statistics noted that at 30 June 2012 there were 478,263 SMSFs in Australia, compared to 442,987 as at 30 June 2011. The APRA statistics also revealed that these SMSFs have a total of $439 billion in assets under management, accounting for 31.3 per cent of all superannuation assets in Australia. So there are clearly a huge number of SMSFs in Australia, and their numbers are growing at an exponential rate. Ensuring their compliance with superannuation and tax laws and the accuracy of their financial statements is vitally important to the industry and this government.


As I mentioned earlier, the Cooper review identified a number of issues in the existing SMSF scheme for auditors. These issues include the lack of SMSF auditor independence, with a number of approved auditors also acting as the SMSFs' accountants, as I mentioned earlier; differences in minimum competency standards for approved auditors; and differences in the enforcement actions applicable to approved auditors. Consequently, the Cooper review made a number of recommendations to address these issues, including that ASIC be appointed the registration body for SMSF approved auditors, be responsible for determining eligibility requirements and setting competency standards, and determine and take appropriate enforcement action with the assistance of the ATO.


Schedule 2 of the CGT bill and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012 implement the government's response to those precise recommendations of the Cooper review in relation to auditor registration and independence. In essence, we have embraced the recommendations of the Cooper review in respect of SMSF auditor registration and independence. The government's objective in doing so is to raise the standard of SMSF audit competency and ensure there is a minimum set of standards that applies equally across the SMSF sector.


Those opposite may argue—as they have, indeed—that these are heavy burdens to place on the SMSF sector. The government flatly rejects such arguments. Given the size of the SMSF sector in the superannuation industry as reflected in the APRA data I referred to, it is critical to ensure that SMSF auditors are preparing high-quality audits and that any rogue elements of the sector are weeded out through appropriate enforcement action. Streamlining and strengthening superannuation are important matters for this government and feature strongly as part of our broader Stronger Super reform agenda.


There are several benefits associated with these bills. In the time available to me, I have sought to highlight some of them. It is evident that many working Australians will receive a tangible benefit from the measures being implemented by the passage of these bills. These actions are also a genuine reminder of the government's continued commitment to policy delivery and achieving its vision for the future of Australia in this regard. These bills are also another strong example of the government listening to the needs of the superannuation industry and responding to important policy issues rather than peddling untruths and seeking to alarm Australians about their superannuation savings, as some of those opposite have become accustomed to.


The superannuation framework under this Labor government has enabled Australia to amass a national savings pool in excess of $1.4 trillion, with estimates that this will grow to over $6 trillion by 2037. At a time when we all understand that we have an ageing population and the need to boost our national savings now, it is imperative for the reforms contained in bills such as these to be implemented in full. I urge all members to support these important reforms.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms O'Neill
):  Before the debate is resumed on the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this bill and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,9,2
"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (12:28):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012, which are currently before the House. The former bill provides capital gains tax relief for the merger of superannuation funds; introduces a new registration regime for auditors and self-managed superannuation funds; expands reporting obligations for superannuation providers; and introduces new information exchange provisions for superannuation, particularly regarding the use of tax file numbers. The Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012 establishes the framework for a new registration regime for SMSF auditors.


As I am sure many members of this House will be aware, self-managed superannuation funds are the largest sector in the superannuation industry, worth $400 billion. Members of these funds are advised by a range of experts, including lawyers, financial planners and accountants.  The 11,000 or so SMSF auditors play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of a major sector of the superannuation system.


I cannot emphasise enough how important it is to those on this side of the House to ensure that this legislation is spot on the mark. The many people in my electorate who will be affected by this legislation will be bitterly disappointed. There are numerous self-funded retirees in my electorate of Wright and these additional changes to their superannuation make it harder and costlier for them to manage their retirement and thereby reduce the burden on the public purse. This is simply another demonstration that this Labor government has no economic strategy and will always put its own political survival ahead of the national interest. I cannot support imposing more red tape—this bill is a classic example of that.


This legislation is another grab which will affect the people who can least afford it. I do not have a self-managed super fund but a number of people in my electorate do. It disheartens me when they bring their statements to my office. The value of their funds is rapidly deteriorating. Early in 2007, the Labor government promised one in, one out, where every new regulation would be matched by repealing another piece of legislation or regulation. Latest figures show that since 2008 the Labor Party has introduced 18,089 new regulations and repealed 86—so 18,000 in and 86 out—an average of 11 new regulations added every single day since this government has come to power.


The first part of this bill looks at capital gains tax and how it affects those who choose to merge their funds from one to another. Let me state for the record that no problem has been identified that will be solved by these new requirements. It will merely make it more costly for Australians who wish to manage their own super fund to do so. 


It is well known that the coalition supports Australians who want to look after their own retirement. However this Labor government just looks on superannuation— particularly for those who manage their own super fund—as a source of tax revenue. There is a constant battle to fiddle the books, for Labor to get their hands into the pockets of mums and dads and into the funds of businesses in order to hang onto some type of political credibility and a wafer-thin surplus.


As many in this House will know, capital gains tax can be a barrier to the merging of superannuation funds. This is because whenever superannuation funds merge this will typically trigger a capital gains tax event, which leads to neither capital gains nor losses being applied to assets being transferred. When a merger takes place and the assets have been transferred, the merged fund is typically wound up. However, when the merged fund comes to an end, any previous capital or revenue losses that exist at that time will be forgone. The coalition supports that particular measure.


Due to the prevailing economic and financial market conditions in late 2008, a temporary taxation relief measure was passed in the form of 'loss relief' and 'asset rollover' to assist the superannuation industry and, through the industry, relevant fund members. However, the relief provided was limited to 1 October 2011.


At the time, those on this side of the House supported the tax relief for merging super funds as a sensible measure to ensure otherwise sensible mergers of superannuation funds were not prevented based on taxation considerations. That is because the coalition supports Australians who want to look after their own retirement. We will always support those Australians who want to do more to prepare for their own retirement.


This current bill is again, temporary; this time for mergers that occurs on or after 1 October 2011 and before 2 July 2017—and it has been made clear that that the coalition support capital gains relief for merging superannuation funds.


The next part of the bill introduces new registration regimes for auditors and self-managed superannuation funds. The recent super system review recommended that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission be appointed as the registration body for self-managed super funds approved auditors. The review found that not all approved auditors are subject to the same minimum competency standards nor are they subject to the same enforcement actions.


As some background information,  the practical experience that regulation will require at least 300 hours in auditing in the self-managed super funds in three years, immediately before applying for registration with the Australian Security and Investment Commission. An approved self-managed superannuation fund auditor will also need to undertake at least 120 hours of continuing professional development training every three years. This training must include 30 hours of training about superannuation, of which eight hours of training is SMSF auditing.


There are many other facts that I could add here, but I feel it is important to voice issues currently in this bill. Since 2008 Labor has added 18,089 regulations to the books. Back in 2007, the Labor government had promised that it would make no changes to superannuation laws—""not one jot, not one tittle"". That was the quote from back in 2007 that there would be no changes. However, that promise has been broken now on nine occasions so far, generating a total $7.8 billion in additional revenue. So here we have a government saying one thing and doing another. The Achilles heel of this government will always be the Prime Minister, four days before the election, standing and saying that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' And, of course, there were the Treasurer's comments that it is hysterical that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax.  This is just another piece of legislation where the government have said one thing and done another.


These changes are undermining the Australian people's confidence in the superannuation system, lowering the of contributions and consequently the level of savings available in their retirement. Voluntary superannuation contributions are down significantly in the context of a challenging market environment. It must be disheartening for people to receive their superannuation statements and see on those self-managed super funds that the value of those assets—through no fault of the own, but through world market pressures. It would be an enormous burden on families and retirees as they sit there and work out how are they going to survive in retirement and have this additional burden of knowing that there are additional costs that this government intend to apply to their savings. The last thing we need is more Labor taxes on voluntary savings making a bad situation even worse.


This bill also aims to expand the existing reporting obligations for superannuation providers. And yet again, we have a government doing everything it can to try and prevent the inevitable failure. A superannuation provider is currently only required to report about individual accounts, if they have received contributions throughout the year, and either the superannuation interest is held at the end of the period or the member received a benefit during the period. Effectively, no statement is required for inactive superannuation accounts. However, under the revised reporting obligations funds will be required to provide statements for all members, both active and inactive. This is to support the implementation of the Stronger Super package, in particular the measures designed to facilitate consolidation of superannuation funds and accounts.


Thankfully, I can report back to my constituents in Wright that the Coalition Deregulation Taskforce will continue to consult businesses and community organisations around the country looking to cut red-tape. The coalition has a clear road map for real deregulation by cutting $1 billion worth of red-tape out of the system. This is headed up by our Senator Arthur Sinodinos. He has been tasked with chopping out $1 billion worth of red tape—and I suggest that that task will not be too hard.


The last part of this bill amends the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993 and the Retirement Savings Account Act 1997 to improve the linking of tax file numbers to superannuation accounts thereby, the government claims, making accounts less likely to become inactive. The changes are another example of the red tape that is so very typical of this Labor government. It is well known to those on this side of the House that Labor has a terrible track record when it comes to decreasing red tape. Red tape does nothing to help the Australian people achieve a self-funded retirement.


In conclusion, it is obvious to those on this side of the House that every time Labor increases taxes on Australian super savers it reduces the incentive for people to do the right thing by saving for and achieving a self-funded retirement. Labor have an addiction to wasteful spending and instead of standing up for Australians doing the right thing by saving for their retirement, this government is hard at work making sure that money goes down the drain. This is a government who just do not know how to manage money and how to live within its means, which is why it has to keep making adjustments to its fiscal policies.


We need a government that will encourage mums and dads, students and young working class Australians to save so they can enjoy a comfortable retirement. Importantly, we need a government that spends less and lives within its means, and therefore can tax less, and that is focused on growing our productivity and our economy more strongly. Stronger growth would not only increase our prosperity; it would also improve superannuation returns and would lead to increased government revenue without the need for all these new and increased Labor Party taxes.


We will be moving an amendment in relation to schedule 2, and I commend that amendment to the House.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2012-10-29,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (12:41):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012. The coalition takes the issue of superannuation very seriously. It is vital for the retirement of countless millions of Australians that we have a superannuation industry that can meet the needs of an ageing population. We see investment returns challenged by a range of factors such as the global financial crisis and falling profits for a range of companies, so in recent time superannuation returns have been challenged but it is well known that you cannot look at the issue of superannuation returns over the short term. Superannuation is a lifelong investment, and if we can encourage young people to put more money into super at a young age, we can certainly ensure that Australians in their retirement years will have a much higher standard of living. 


Unfortunately it is very difficult to get that message through to young people at the age of 18 or 20 or 25 or whatever—retirement at the age of 65 seems a long way off. I think one of the challenges that we as legislators have, and the industry itself has, is to communicate to young people the benefits of investment in superannuation and the importance of investing at a young age. The dollar that is put in at an early stage in a worker's life yields a much higher return on retirement than dollars put in later in a person's life. The impact of compounding is immense. One of the key issues in ensuring that people have a comfortable retirement is that the dollars be put in as early as possible so that when the person comes to retire their superannuation balance is such that they are able to have the sort of retirement they want and expect. 


I turn to the legislation. Schedule 1 to the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 reinstates the temporary loss relief and asset rollover in division 310 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, with the following modifications: firstly, there will be an optimal asset rollover for capital gains and revenue gains; secondly, losses that are transferred to the receiving entity will be treated as having been made in the income year that they were transferred; and, thirdly, self-managed superannuation funds will be excluded.


Point 1.2 states:


The loss relief and asset-roll-over removes income tax impediments to mergers between complying superannuation funds by permitting the roll-over of both revenue gains or losses and capital gains or losses. This loss relief will be available for complying superannuation funds (other than self-managed … funds) and approved deposits funds … that merge with a complying superannuation fund with five or more members.


Point 1.3 states:


All references in this chapter are to the ITAA 1997 unless otherwise specified.


The context of these amendments is very important, because the capital gains tax is the primary code for calculating capital gains or losses of complying superannuation funds. There are certain gains and losses that are treated on the revenue account, such as those from a debenture stock or bond with regard to the relevant section here, which is section 295-85. The explanatory memorandum also notes:


The transfer of assets from one superannuation fund to another, under a merger between the two funds, will typically trigger CGT event A1 (about disposals of a CGT asset—section 104‑10 of the ITAA 1997) or may trigger CGT event E2 (about transferring a CGT asset to a trust—section 104-60 of the ITAA 1997). Therefore, the asset transfer will lead to the realisation of capital gains and/or capital losses for the transferring fund. Following this asset transfer and the transfer of members’ accounts to the receiving fund, the transferring fund will typically be wound up.


I note that the member for Throsby is in the chamber and is very keen to contribute in this debate. I would say that I reaffirm the coalition's belief that superannuation is a very important vehicle that should be supported. I note the fact that the coalition proposes some amendments to this legislation, and I certainly look forward to further contributions from members in this House in the ongoing debate.

 (Throsby) (12:47):  I start by thanking the member for Cowper for both his contribution and his cooperation in this debate. The Stronger Super reforms introduced by this government are about improving the adequacy, the equity and the transparency of Australia's superannuation systems. These reforms underpin one of the most important Labor reforms, the introduction of our system of compulsory superannuation savings. This package of bills before the House today—the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012—is part of the Stronger Super reform process, and these new measures will further strengthen Australia's superannuation framework that has so well served working Australians in their retirement years. The government has, indeed, attempted to extend our early and revolutionary introduction of occupational superannuation during the period of the Hawke and Keating governments by introducing legislation to shift the compulsory contribution from nine to 12 per cent over a staggered period to ensure that future generations of Australians will have a more adequate retirement income.


Australia has high levels of national savings and even higher levels of national investment—that is to say, there is a gap between our level of savings and our level of investment. Compulsory superannuation, quite simply, is an important mechanism for closing that gap. Australian superannuation savings are currently worth around $1.4 trillion and are expected to reach $6 trillion by June 2035. For that reason, it is important that governance of superannuation is effective and is of the highest prudential standard.


I now turn to expand on some of the measures within these bills. The first measure, as set out in schedule 1, will remove income tax impediments to superannuation fund mergers by providing loss relief and asset rollover of both revenue gains or losses and capital gains or losses. The rationale for this amendment flows from the government's Stronger Super reforms, which have, quite simply, put pressure on superannuation funds to improve their competitiveness or reassess their viability in the absence of merging with another entity.


What we know in this area of investment is that, most often, bigger is better. The extinguishment of tax losses can be an impediment to fund mergers as trustees of superannuation funds are required to consider the adverse impacts in relation to tax on members' benefits of any fund merger. So this measure will apply to fund mergers that occurred on or after 1 October 2011 and before 2 July 2017, creating a window and an incentive within that window for funds to consider their size and consider the opportunities of merging with other funds with similar objectives.


Schedule 2 is about establishing auditor registration for self-managed superannuation funds, something that I and the member for Cunningham have a deep interest in because of the high number of constituents within our electorates who have lost significant amounts of money through the self-managed superannuation fund sector. I will have something to say about that.


Schedule 2 of the bill will establish an auditor registration for self-managed superannuation funds. Auditors play a critical role in the SMSF sector and, consequently, it is necessary that SMSF auditors have a high standard of competency. Many in this place know the high personal and financial cost that occurs when not only auditors but also regulators and corporate officers fail in their duty to investors, fail to pick up malfeasance, fail to pick up fraud and fail to pick up something that is within their statutory remit.


Unfortunately, as I said, the member for Cunningham and I know this situation all too well, with a large number of constituents in our electorates suffering enormous loss from the collapse of Trio Capital in 2009. This was a fraud committed on a grand scale, the biggest superannuation fraud in Australia's history. Around $176 million in members' funds were stolen through the fraud, money that belonged to hardworking Australians. Devastatingly, nearly half of these investors had directly invested in Trio through self-managed superannuation funds.


In the aftermath of the Trio disaster, considerable attention has been paid to the role of various regulatory gatekeepers in this fraud. Understandably for the Trio victims, the search for somebody to blame for this fraud is flavoured with strong emotion. If you put yourself in their position you would feel exactly the same. Every devastated investor who I have spoken to about the Trio collapse feels they took appropriate steps and, indeed, did everything successive governments have encouraged them to do—and that was to take control of their financial security in retirement by ensuring that they had a superannuation fund and to do that in a way that ensured that they did not take undue financial risks. Investors felt that they were acting responsibly and that Australia's strong financial system would ensure that they could rely on its regulatory systems. Fraud, by its very nature, is designed to get around those regulatory arrangements. It is designed to conceal and confuse.


KPMG and WHK, the auditors of Trio Capital, have come under considerable scrutiny since each year for six years they signed off on the financial statements of Trio and Astarra as being true and correct—and, quite plainly, this was not the case. These matters have been examined by the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the Trio collapse. WHK was the auditor at the time that Trio collapsed and gave evidence to the parliamentary committee that auditors take a risk based approach which is not designed to detect fraud.


This submission confirmed evidence presented to the committee in a submission by KPMG.


In its submission, KPMG outlined what it describes as the expectation gap, which is the difference between the public's expectation of the work of an auditor and what that work may disclose, and the auditor's own understanding of the work that is required to be done and reported upon in fulfilment of their duties. There is no doubt that, with regard to Trio, there is a clear gap between what investors perceived the role of auditors to be and the actual audit work that was done. The parliamentary report identified some key areas for further reform for ASIC to consider, including for more detail to be provided in compliance plans, for membership of compliance committees and related requirements.


It is important to note here that both the role of the Trio auditors and their evidence to the parliamentary committee was not of a high standard. Many issues remain with regard to the Trio collapse and the role of the auditors. Of great concern is that most self-managed superannuation fund investors appear to have had no idea that they were assuming the role of the trustee of their investment and thereby accepting a lower standard of prudential regulation. 


Unravelling the Trio disaster and the level of responsibility, accountability and blame for each participant and gatekeeper in the collapse of Trio is a complex task. In the meantime the SMSF auditor registration measures in the bill before the House today will raise the standard of SMSF auditor competency and ensure there is a minimum standard that applies across the entire sector. SMSF auditor registration will ensure that auditors of self-managed superannuation funds have a minimum standard of competency and knowledge of relevant laws and are able to detect and report contraventions by SMSF trustees. ASIC will be the registration body for SMSF auditors and will set competency standards that apply penalties to non-compliant auditors. The ATO will also have powers to monitor auditor compliance and be able to refer non-compliant auditors to ASIC for enforcement action. Reforms to our system of financial regulation are a series of small steps, like this one.


These reforms to the auditing arrangements are very important. A 2009 compliance audit by the Australian Taxation Office discovered that 29 per cent of the auditors of self-managed superannuation funds were the SMSF's accountant and that, in relation to 28 per cent of auditors, there appeared to have been some evidence of a relationship or a conflict of interest that might impact the auditor's ability to be independent, as would be required of an auditor of any corporation or any other fund in this country. For this reason alone and based on the experience that I have had in dealing with the victims of the Trio fraud, I commend this schedule of the bill to the House.


Amendments in schedule 3 of the bill will allow the ATO to display more comprehensive superannuation information to individuals and will facilitate the consolidation of inactive accounts with a low balance. They will also support the increased concessional contributions caps for members over 50 whose interests or accounts are valued at less than $500,000 from 1 July 2014. 


I turn to schedule 4. As part of the government's Strong Super package of reforms, a number of measures were announced to improve the efficiency of the superannuation system. These measures included the introduction of mandatory superannuation data and payment regulations and standards for eligible superannuation entities, RSA providers and employers, which were legislated in June 2012. It has been estimated that the Australian superannuation industry processes more than 100 million transactions annually. The potential gains to the system from improved efficiency in contribution management are significant.


This is one of those classic areas where more regulation leads to greater corporate efficiency—because when you are dealing with 100 million transactions annually, if you do not have standard protocols for the transmission, storage and reporting of that critical data, then a hell of a lot of extra work, duplication and inefficiency creeps into the system. In this particular area inefficiency means a cost to an employee or a member of a superannuation fund. So these measures are critically important. They will help to reduce the administration costs for the funds themselves but also, critically, they will help to ensure that we have a more efficient, effective and transparent system of superannuation administration in this country.


With around $1.4 trillion now invested in superannuation there is a strong public policy interest in having a safe, efficient and competitive superannuation sector to maximise the retirement incomes of all Australians. This Labor government, I am very proud to say, has focused on delivering superannuation and pension reforms for the long term. Australia's economy is growing and we have strong fundamentals such as low unemployment, contained inflation, low net debt and a record investment pipeline. It is critical that the superannuation system is designed to work for all members. It must work for those who take an active interest in their superannuation as well as for the majority of superannuation funds members who do not take a day-to-day interest.


As the collapse of Trio Capital amply demonstrates, we as parliamentarians have a duty to ensure that the laws that set out our system of financial regulation are robust, continually refined and keep pace with the increasingly sophisticated means of perpetuating fraud.


I commend this package of important bills to the House.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2012-10-29,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (13:02):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Auditor Registration Imposition Bill 2012. Along with the rest of the coalition, I am an avid advocate for reducing the burden of government on Australians. During the Howard years the burden of capital gains tax on individuals was reduced significantly—by over 50 per cent. This tax still places pressure on aspirational Territorians. In 2009-10, individuals in the Territory paid over $72 billion in capital gains tax.


The coalition supports reducing the burden of this tax on individuals and companies. The capital gains tax can be a large hurdle to the merging of superannuation funds. It can restrict mergers between funds even when, in the long run, it could be of benefit to members. Typically when funds merge we see either capital gains or losses in the transfer of assets. The merged fund is generally discontinued once the assets are transferred, and at this point any previous revenue and capital losses are forgone. This can be a disadvantage to the fund as capital losses can be used as offsets for present and future capital gains tax liabilities and revenue losses can be used as offsets against current year income.


I support schedule 1 as it will allow for the rollover of both revenue and capital losses. However, this is only relief legislation for superannuation funds during the prevailing economic times. This bill will cover all mergers that occur between 1 October 2011 to 2 July 2017. This relief legislation only brings further uncertainty to businesses and individuals. No-one is sure what will happen after 2 July 2017.


Schedule 2 places a higher burden on my constituents and other aspirational Australians. Self-funded retirees are some of the hardest hit by the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax through increasing grocery, electricity and petrol costs. The residents of Darwin and Palmerston already face huge costs and heightened cost-of-living pressures. By introducing the new registration regime for auditors of self-managed superannuation funds, self-managed retirees will have to deal with more red tape.


This bill will allow the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to become the registration body for the auditors of self-managed superannuation funds. ASIC will be given responsibility under this schedule to determine the eligibility of auditors, the competency standards they must meet and how this would be implemented. As my colleagues have raised before, we have concerns about this bill, which will give auditors very little time to meet new industry standards. It is typical of those opposite: policy on the run with no proper consultation period.


Registration of auditors will begin on 31 January 2013, and all auditors will need to be accredited by 1 July 2013 so that they can continue practising. Is this realistic? How much extra pressure will this place on businesses? It is typical of this government, which, as we know, is no friend of business. These changes will increase the burden on businesses if this bill is passed in its current form. The regulation to this bill states that the maximum fee an auditor can be charged for accreditation is around $1,000. This is a further cost to be borne by business at a time when many businesses are struggling. As the minister has stated, applicants will have to pay a $100 initial registration fee for an online application, a $100 fee to take a competency exam and an annual fee of around $50 for a statement from ASIC, which will be subject to an increase of approximately $14 a year.


This is just for starters. This is an additional cost to businesses, which will have a significant impact. We understand that the fees from this new scheme are expected to collect about $1 million over a five-year period from, say, 2011-12 to 2015-16. At the same time the implementation costs are expected to be around $29.7 million. So there is a $28 million gap there.


So I ask: where is the money coming from? Just last week we saw the Treasurer handing down a MYEFO built on uncertainty and instability. We see this government spending and promising money everywhere, but I ask you: where is this money coming from? In just four months we have seen the Gillard Labor government cut the size of their forecasted surplus by a third. Will we ever see a surplus from Labor? We know that Labor has a terrible track record. Just ask my colleague the member for Longman, who has never seen a Labor surplus in his lifetime. This Labor government also implemented a mining tax—a mining tax that has raised absolutely nothing in its first three months of existence. Maybe it never will. Now, I do not know about you, Deputy Speaker Rishworth, but I have never heard of a tax that does not raise money. But, in typical Labor fashion, the mining tax is just another example of economic mismanagement at its worst. We see them spending recklessly money that they just do not have.


Net interest repayments for this financial year are currently at around $20 million per day. Yes, $20 million per day, and that only covers the costed programs. We know that the Gillard Labor government has a $120 billion black hole of unfunded promises—$10.5 billion a year for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, once fully operational from 2018-19; $6.5 billion a year for the Gonski review; and $1.4 billion for an increased refugee intake to 20,000 over the forward estimates. With so many unfunded promises, how can they afford to implement the auditor registration regime as well? This is not the government's money they are spending, but that of aspirational Australians.


As a timely reminder to those opposite, I wish to quote the great Margaret Thatcher, an incredible woman who understood how important it was to reduce the burden government placed on the lives of individuals and businesses. Baroness Thatcher once said, 'There is no such thing as public money; there is only taxpayers' money.' I could not have said it better myself. Those opposite are spending taxpayers' money at unprecedented levels. You may be surprised to know that the spending of the Gillard Labor government is $90 billion more a year than the spending in the last year of the Howard government. Governments must live within their means. The government is putting everything on a giant credit card, and we all know Labor cannot be trusted with credit cards.


If the Treasurer wants advice on how to balance budgets, he needs to look no further than my electorate. Families in Darwin and Palmerston are masters of budget balancing. They have to be. The people of Solomon understand what it means to balance a budget. Struggling to manage a budget is part of their everyday lives—balancing school fees, mortgage repayments, grocery bills, electricity bills, rates and phone bills. These costs are only further compounded by the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax on everything. In the 2011-12 financial year Darwin experienced the largest housing price increases in the country, averaging 12.3 per cent. Darwin and Palmerston have the third highest median house prices in Australia, after Sydney and Melbourne, and the highest median weekly rent costs for a three-bedroom home, $542 a week, compared to the next closet city, Canberra, with a median price of $448 per week. This is absolutely outrageous. But this is indicative of a Territory Labor government, recently voted out after failing Territorians for 11 years. Territorians had had enough and voted them out. If the people of Darwin and Palmerston are so capable at managing a budget, why isn't the Treasurer?


I go back to the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012. We are deeply concerned that this bill will just increase the red tape burden on those Australians who wish to manage their own superannuation. Under Labor, the only certainty for Australians is more taxes, more debt and more pain. It is quite obvious that the Gillard Labor government have completely lost their way, and their only answer is to try and reignite a class war. As I have said many times in this place, small business is the backbone of the Northern Territory, and this government is punishing those people for nothing more than their own political gain, punishing these individuals for being aspirational and daring to dream.


In MYEFO last week we saw the Treasurer confirm that $390 million would be spent by the ATO to crack down on small businesses. Small businesses are being forced to pay as the Gillard Labor government look to every possible avenue to fund their spending addiction. We know that Labor is no friend of small business. Labor is no friend of the aspirational Australian.


I have some surprising statistics for you. Since Labor came to office in 2007, we have seen 18,089 new regulations introduced—that is 11 regulations a day—and only 86 have been repealed. This is a far cry from the election promise made in 2007 of 'one in, one out', where new regulations would only be brought in if they were matched by one that was repealed. So someone cannot count, because from my accounting there are about 18,000 extra regulations that need to be repealed. It is no wonder red tape is strangling individuals and business. The Gillard Labor government is built around policy on the run. There is a complete lack of understanding and appreciation for small business.


I ask you, Deputy Speaker, how many of the cabinet ministers have run a business? I suspect the number is very low, if any at all. This is in strong contrast to the coalition. We understand small business, we are the party of small business and we know that small business is the engine room of economic growth in Australia. We have a plan. Under an Abbott-led government the coalition will cut $1 billion worth of red tape. The coalition has never supported unnecessary red tape. The coalition does not support unnecessary red tape. Along with my colleagues I support Australians choosing whether or not they save for their own retirement. We will be putting forward an amendment to this bill, as we are opposed to the red tape inherent in the new audit regime for self-managed super funds.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (13:14):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012. I want to focus in particular on one of the principal measures in this bill, which is to provide capital gains and other tax relief for merging superannuation funds. The policy rationale for that, stated in the explanatory memorandum, is to encourage the merger of small superannuation funds and in turn deliver benefits to members through economies of scale.


In the time available to me today I want to make three points. Firstly, I want to make the point that capital gains tax relief for the merging of superannuation funds is a reasonable idea, as far as it goes. Secondly, I want to spend a moment speaking about the serious public policy problem which this bill is designed to address—namely, that there is a long tail of small superannuation funds. Thirdly, I want to make the point that we need to have a more comprehensive look at the issue of the long tail of small funds and ask whether the measures in this bill go far enough.


I turn firstly to the proposition that the measure to give tax relief contained in this bill is a sensible idea as far as it goes. I remind the House that superannuation is designed to be a tax advantaged vehicle for the accumulation of retirement savings. The ultimate policy intention is to allow as many Australians as possible to build up savings and hence provide, wholly or partly, for themselves in retirement rather than relying on the old-age pension. This year the old-age pension will comprise around $37 billion of Commonwealth expenditure, which is around 10 per cent of the entire Commonwealth government expenditure. So, clearly, the policy prize if we can reduce the reliance on the old-age pension is a very significant one.


The problem which this bill is specifically designed to address is that we have too many small, subscale, superannuation funds. Accordingly, anything which would act as an impediment to funds merging and therefore allowing average fund size to increase needs careful consideration. A factor which presently acts as an impediment today is that, if superannuation funds merge, there are adverse tax consequences for the members of the fund. First of all, the transfer of assets which typically occurs as part of a merger is a capital gains tax event. In the attractive jargon of the Income Tax Assessment Act, it might be a CGT event A1, the disposal of a capital gains tax asset, or it might be a CGT event E2, the transfer of a capital gains tax asset to a trust. In either event, it triggers an obligation to pay capital gains tax. Secondly, typically in such a transaction, one of the existing funds will be wound up. That means that any existing tax losses held within that fund can no longer be used. That, additionally, is a factor which negatively impacts on the net value of the assets in the fund and in turn on the value of the balances held by members.


Given that the very purpose of superannuation is to accumulate assets in a concessional tax environment, it is understandable that trustees would be wary of proceeding with a merger given the current tax consequences, where it is likely to reduce the value of members' balances. Accordingly, a change to the law which removes this impediment, this blocker, to mergers of superannuation funds, makes sense in principle. That is certainly the view of this side of the House.


Let me turn secondly to the underlying policy problem which this measure is designed to address. In the words of the explanatory memorandum, the intention is to:


… put pressure on superannuation funds to improve their competitiveness or reassess their viability in the absence of merging with another entity.


And it is to encourage: 


… increased size or scale of superannuation funds to enable funds to provide a range of benefits to members …


Let's be a bit clearer about what the problem is here: we have a long tail of small superannuation funds. We should also be clear that small funds are not of themselves a problem. It is certainly possible that a small fund might have superior investment skills such that it generates above normal returns and that those excess returns more than compensate for any extra costs which result from its smaller size. But, when the size and composition of a superannuation fund has been determined not on the basis of rational economic considerations but on quite different considerations, there is every possibility of a small fund delivering inadequate returns.


Our present superannuation system comprises many different funds, some small and some large. The particular basis on which the money has been divided up—and, hence, the basis on which an employee has his or her retirement savings allocated to any one fund—is driven quite heavily by the architecture of the union movement. This is a very important public policy question because the superannuation system has grown very large, with some $1.4 trillion of funds under management. Largely thanks to compulsory super contributions, in 2011-12, some $90 billion flowed into the sector. Of that, nearly two-thirds went into one of two kinds of funds: industry funds or public sector funds. Funds of this kind generally use the 'equal representation' model, with half of the directors appointed by a union and half by an employer association.


In the APRA statistics, for the 2010-11 financial year there were 76 funds listed as 'industry' or 'public sector'. An analysis of the annual reports of these funds shows that in 2010-11 there were a total of 575 directors on their boards, of whom 180 were appointed by unions. These funds had a total of $370 billion under management as at 30 June 2011, according to the APRA statistics, and the biggest 10 funds had around 63 per cent of this total. This leaves a long tail of much smaller funds. In fact, of the 76 funds, 57 are less than $5 billion in size, and at least 20 have assets of less than $1 billion.


Let me mention some examples. The Australian Meat Industry Superannuation Trust had net assets of $990 million as at 30 June 2011. The Health Industry Plan had net assets of $612 million. AUST(Q), otherwise known as the Allied Unions Superannuation Trust (Queensland), had net assets of $193 million. The Transport Industry Superannuation Fund had net assets of $84 million. I make no criticism of the specific managements of the funds I have mentioned, but I do raise the question of whether it best serves the interests of members to have a large number of quite small funds. That of course is the very question which the measures in this legislation are designed to address. I think we can see that there is an underlying public policy problem.


The real question, though, is whether the measures in this legislation will go far enough, and that is the third point I want to come to. How likely is it that desirable mergers will occur just because the tax impediments to such mergers are reduced, when we have the structural features of our superannuation system which I have described? The recent failure of the merger between Vision Super and Equipsuper in Victoria is not an encouraging precedent. Vision Super has four directors appointed by the Australian Services Union. The merged entity was supposed to have elected directors. It turned out that a member of the Equipsuper fund—somebody who happened to be a senior manager at a power company—chose to seek election as a board member of the merged super fund. This made the Australian Services Union very cross. In an email to Australian Services Union members, the state secretary of the union, Brian Parkinson, had this to say:


As expected, employers are seeking election to workers' positions. Indeed, one such individual … has exploited his senior management role to frustrate the election chances of ASU candidates … Management will pull out all the stops to see one of their own elected at the expense of workers.


At the time of sending this email, Mr Parkinson was also a director of Vision Super. He had duties to the members of that fund, and the transaction was conceived as being in the interests of those members. Yet, pretty clearly, when Mr Parkinson sent this email he was not giving much thought to the interests of members of Vision Super; what he was concerned about was the interests of the Australian Services Union.


We need to look very closely at whether the measures in this legislation will do much to assist the position when relatively small superannuation funds are very closely aligned with unions. It is quite easy to see how a governance problem in a union could infect an associated superannuation fund. We have seen such an example quite recently with the former Health Services Union boss Michael Williamson, until recently a union appointed director of First State Super, a fund with some $30 billion under management. Earlier this year, the chairman of First State Super complained that he had no power to remove Mr Williamson as a trustee of that fund, despite the serious allegations, at that point, which had been made about Mr Williamson's conduct. Of course, since that point he has been charged by the New South Wales police.


An equally troubling example of this phenomenon is a $30 million investment in the building company Austcorp by the Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund, almost all of which was lost following Austcorp's collapse in 2009. The Australian has reported that Mr Wally Curran, a long-time secretary of the Meatworkers Union and a long-serving director on the board of the fund, was paid significant consultancy fees by Austcorp. At the very least, this raises serious questions about whether Mr Curran had a conflict of interest and whether he was acting in the best interests of members of the fund. That $30 million, by the way, was a material proportion of the entire balance of the assets of the Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund.


Or we could consider the position of TWUSUPER, a fund with $2.6 billion under management and 130,000 members, with four directors appointed by the Transport Workers Union. The four directors appointed are the Transport Workers Union's federal secretary, Tony Sheldon, and three state secretaries: Wayne Forno, Wayne Mader and Jim McGiveron. Last year the Transport Workers Union vigorously attacked changes proposed by the management of Qantas to the operation of that company, changes that management said would improve the company's financial performance. How do the directors of TWUSUPER, who are also union officials, think about equity investments in Qantas or other companies in the transport sector? Members of TWUSUPER have a right to expect that the sole consideration exercising the minds of directors is how to maximise the financial returns generated by the fund. Indeed, under the sole purpose test in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, that is the duty of directors of that superannuation fund. 


So there is clearly a structural problem in the superannuation sector, particularly in relation to industry and public sector funds, where there is a long tail of small funds. As some of the instances I have cited highlight, this creates the potential for inadequate standards of governance, particularly amongst that long tail of smaller funds, which are not subject to the same degree of detailed public scrutiny as larger funds tend to be. The question I also want to raise for consideration by the House this afternoon is whether the well-intentioned measure in the legislation before the House today goes far enough to encourage the consolidation which it says is a desirable objective, when you consider some of the entrenched interests of directors of funds. I think the email that I cited from ASU state secretary Brian Parkinson is extremely relevant in that regard.


Let me conclude by noting that the measures in this bill are intended to assist in facilitating the mergers of superannuation funds by offering capital gains and other tax relief for such mergers and in turn to address the problem, which clearly exists, of a long tail of subscale funds. I hasten to add that the mere fact that a fund is small does not of itself indicate a problem, but we have seen that, where there are small funds, particularly ones closely associated with unions, that creates a culture in which governance problems appear to be more likely to materialise. The only way to get to grips with this issue is to seriously address the governance of superannuation funds and in particular the recommendations of the Cooper review in relation to ending the current form of the equal representation model. It is a matter for regret that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and former National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union has done nothing about that. 


Debate adjourned

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (13:30):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker Rishworth. Acknowledging your own position, I note that former South Australian minister Gordon Bilney has just passed away. He was known to me. His is a sad loss for his family, the parliament and you, who I understand had connections in that direction.


Let me address this bill in terms of a very simple proposition. The Water Amendment (Long-term Average Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2012 comes in a broader context. For all the recent talk, the coalition has been the real party of water reform, at the national level, over the last decade. There was firstly the tremendous work of John Anderson, the then Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party. This was followed by the work of Malcolm Turnbull and John Howard, the former in his role as Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and the latter as Prime Minister. They put in place a water market, a $10 billion program, a commitment to focus on infrastructure as the real means of improving productivity whilst gaining water for the environment. That was a genuine commitment of real meaning, major significance and absolute standing, and it has largely failed to be delivered through the means it was intended.


Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas—I notice you have now taken the chair—this bill comes in three elements. Firstly, there is the broader context of the water reform to which I just referred. Secondly, there is the issue of the adjustment mechanism and, in particular, the creation of an opportunity for counting genuine environmental works and measures towards achieving the great goal of helping the Murray-Darling Basin, at the same time preserving the rights and productivity of upstream users and communities and allowing us to feed our nation, to be a food bowl for Asia and to be a source of fibre for Australia and growing international demand. Thirdly, it is about an attempt to remove ministerial oversight and give untrammelled authority to an unelected body. It is a body for whom we have respect—but we are a parliament; we are the elected chamber of an elected parliament and we believe in parliamentary accountability and ministerial responsibility.


In addressing this bill, let me start with a simple proposition. The coalition is firstly the party of genuine, real water reform, having created the markets, having created the $10 billion plan and having created the focus on infrastructure as a critical means of improving productivity whilst allowing greater water to be returned to the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. Secondly, we support, in principle—and, in fact, we were the architects and authors of the principle—that environmental works and measures can and should be used to enhance the environment, in non-river-course channels and in river channels. Thirdly, we stand very strongly for the ability of the executive and the parliament to have a real and final say over fundamental policy matters that relate to equity and justice. We will not resile from being supportive of those elements.


It is a great way forward but, for ideological reasons, the government until now has stayed away from this. Just 12 per cent of the projects in New South Wales, or $159 million of $1.35 billion; only 16 per cent of the projects in Victoria, or $171 million of $1.05 billion; just 26 per cent of the projects in Queensland, or $21 million of $81 million of allocation to agricultural infrastructure savings, which would in turn return water to the river on a shared basis; and 40 per cent of the projects in South Australia, or $161 million of $420 million, have actually been delivered. So, against that background, for every one litre this government has saved through infrastructure it has bought back five litres. The government has spent just over $500 million on infrastructure projects yet almost $2 billion on buybacks.


Our approach has always been to support practical action which protects the environment and also protects Australia's food and productivity sectors that allow us to continue to develop our rural sector. Indeed, the Asian century white paper from yesterday talks specifically about expanding our agricultural production. But the way to do that is to be more efficient with our water, and that is why we have supported a once-in-a-century replumbing of rural Australia, not a buyout of our farmers, our rural communities and our farm productivity. That sets the background for where this bill arrives.


Let me turn to one of the two main elements of this bill. The first is to allow the use of environmental works and measures to be counted in the assessment of the sustainable diversions. What does that mean? It means in practice—and I will give an example—that the use of channels may allow more direct and efficient watering of an environmental asset. It could be Lindsay Island. That means, rather than having to use huge volumes of overbank flows in order to achieve an environmental outcome, we could use channelling or piping. This is exactly the same principle we have adopted in irrigation infrastructure instead of the open channels, which you see if you travel through Mildura or through areas such as Griffiths. It is about covering or piping the water which has formerly been in the open channels, and it is instead of rammed-earth channels which are subject to leaking. In many parts of north-west Victoria we engage in that modernisation. That is what we have all agreed upon as being the vital—although the government has not delivered upon it—and actual mechanism of irrigation for agriculture. Yet, until now, the same principle has not been adopted, has not been applied and has not been accepted in irrigation for environmental works and measures. So this is a positive step forward. It is an element of the bill and it is an element of the steps, which we have championed and encouraged, which were initially rejected and which now at the last minute have been accepted by the government. To the extent that the bill is confined to the extraordinary potential of practical environmental works and measures, then it is a good thing. We endorse and support that component of the bill which is allowing practical environmental works and measures.


However, there is another significant element of the bill which is not acceptable and which we will seek to improve and amend. It is the notion of removing ministerial oversight and veto in relation to changes to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Under this bill as it currently stands the authority could make changes to the amount of water recovered by up to 700 gigalitres up or down. This amounts to a massive 25 per cent change from what has until very recently been the accepted and understood figure for the river. There are no restrictions on whether that 700 gigalitres would come from one area. It could effectively take part of rural Australia completely out of production. Under this bill the minister has to adopt any changes proposed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. I respect the authority and I respect the individuals, but we are a parliament elected by the people and an executive appointed by the parliament. What that means is that final responsibility for decisions with a fundamental impact on food productivity, fibre productivity, the health of our rural communities, the ability of Australia to feed and clothe itself and to feed and clothe tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of people throughout South-East Asia, East Asia and North Asia, is lost to the parliament and to the minister to be determined. So, final determination in our view should and must rest with either the parliament directly or the parliament through the executive accountable to the parliament. These are fundamental decisions. It is right and proper that something as significant as recovering 700 gigalitres of water—which is more than the amount of water in Sydney Harbour—should be the decision of the government and the minister of the day in the end.


I want to give notice that we will move an amendment—and we have had discussions with the government and informed them of this—which will ensure that there is mandatory public consultation on adjustments, that there is ministerial discretion to adopt any amendments, and that the final decision ultimately rests with the parliament through the executive. Our support for this bill is conditional upon those elements being moved, and during the consideration in detail stage we will make a move to ensure that real accountability over the health of our river system rests with the elected government of the day. That is the right and proper thing. We would like the government to accept these amendments. Better still, I understand they are now, at our behest, considering their own amendments. If those amendments are put forward, and if they achieve what we seek in terms of preserving and protecting the accountability, then we will support them. That will allow us to support the bill because the bill contains a fundamental—

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (13:30):  Thank you, Deputy Speaker Rishworth. Acknowledging your own position, I note that former South Australian minister Gordon Bilney has just passed away. He was known to me. His is a sad loss for his family, the parliament and you, who I understand had connections in that direction.


Let me address this bill in terms of a very simple proposition. The Water Amendment (Long-term Average Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment) Bill 2012 comes in a broader context. For all the recent talk, the coalition has been the real party of water reform, at the national level, over the last decade. There was firstly the tremendous work of John Anderson, the then Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party. This was followed by the work of Malcolm Turnbull and John Howard, the former in his role as Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and the latter as Prime Minister. They put in place a water market, a $10 billion program, a commitment to focus on infrastructure as the real means of improving productivity whilst gaining water for the environment. That was a genuine commitment of real meaning, major significance and absolute standing, and it has largely failed to be delivered through the means it was intended.


Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas—I notice you have now taken the chair—this bill comes in three elements. Firstly, there is the broader context of the water reform to which I just referred. Secondly, there is the issue of the adjustment mechanism and, in particular, the creation of an opportunity for counting genuine environmental works and measures towards achieving the great goal of helping the Murray-Darling Basin, at the same time preserving the rights and productivity of upstream users and communities and allowing us to feed our nation, to be a food bowl for Asia and to be a source of fibre for Australia and growing international demand. Thirdly, it is about an attempt to remove ministerial oversight and give untrammelled authority to an unelected body. It is a body for whom we have respect—but we are a parliament; we are the elected chamber of an elected parliament and we believe in parliamentary accountability and ministerial responsibility.


In addressing this bill, let me start with a simple proposition. The coalition is firstly the party of genuine, real water reform, having created the markets, having created the $10 billion plan and having created the focus on infrastructure as a critical means of improving productivity whilst allowing greater water to be returned to the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. Secondly, we support, in principle—and, in fact, we were the architects and authors of the principle—that environmental works and measures can and should be used to enhance the environment, in non-river-course channels and in river channels. Thirdly, we stand very strongly for the ability of the executive and the parliament to have a real and final say over fundamental policy matters that relate to equity and justice. We will not resile from being supportive of those elements.


It is a great way forward but, for ideological reasons, the government until now has stayed away from this. Just 12 per cent of the projects in New South Wales, or $159 million of $1.35 billion; only 16 per cent of the projects in Victoria, or $171 million of $1.05 billion; just 26 per cent of the projects in Queensland, or $21 million of $81 million of allocation to agricultural infrastructure savings, which would in turn return water to the river on a shared basis; and 40 per cent of the projects in South Australia, or $161 million of $420 million, have actually been delivered.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (13:45):  It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak about a very brave young man from my electorate who is raising money and awareness for juvenile diabetes. Will Cullen, from Harrington Park, is seven years old and was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes five years ago. He is the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation New South Wales Young Ambassador of the Year for 2012 and the face of the foundation's Jelly Baby campaign.


When I met Will recently, I was inspired by his positive attitude and his dedication to raising awareness and money to help find a cure for diabetes. He showed me how to do a finger-prick blood test to check his sugar levels and shared his wish with me that one day there would be a cure for diabetes. When I asked Will's mum, Mel, if he would need to take medication and monitor his sugar levels for the rest of his life she said yes. But Will was quick to correct her. 'Not for the rest of my life, Mum,' he said, 'just until we find a cure.' He has such a positive attitude for such a young child. This is why I am very proud of Will and I think he is a fantastic ambassador for juvenile diabetes and for all the children and families in Macarthur who live with the condition.


Each year, Will and his family and friends take part in the Walk to Cure Diabetes and have raised more than $30,000 for the cause—a great achievement that they should all be very proud of. When Will comes to Canberra in November for the Kids in the House diabetes event, I hope to introduce him to my colleagues here in parliament. I am sure that he will touch their hearts just like he has mine and encourage all of us to do everything possible to support these brave young Australians living with diabetes. Keep up the good work, Will. You are an absolute champion.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I move:


That the House record its deep regret at the death on 21 October 2012, of Corporal Scott James Smith while on combat operations in Afghanistan, place on record its appreciation of his service to his country, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Only six weeks ago we gathered in this House to mourn the loss of Australians in Afghanistan. Tragically, today, we mourn another loss. Once again, the price of our commitment in Afghanistan has been made very real to us with the death of Corporal Scott Smith, whom we honour and remember today.


On Sunday, 21 October 2012, elements of the Special Operations Task Group were conducting a disruption operation against a network of insurgents in Helmand province. These insurgents manufacture improvised explosive devices and directly influence the security situation in Uruzgan province, where we work. Corporal Smith was involved in clearing a compound area when an improvised explosive device detonated, killing him instantly. He was a member of the Special Operations Engineer Regiment, a sapper, a combat engineer, a young man who died as he lived in front of the front line.


Corporal Scott's death brings to 39 the number of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. The roll of honour grows longer and our hearts grow heavier knowing the loss that has been visited upon so many homes and the possibility that there may be more before our work is done.


For the past week a loving family has been mourning his loss. Corporal Smith's partner, Liv; his mum and dad, Katrina and Murray; his sister, Roxanne; his extended family, whom I understand are very close; his many friends; and, especially, his comrades in the Special Operations Engineer Regiment are deeply in our thoughts today. We cannot imagine the heartache they are feeling and how empty their Christmas table will feel this year and in all the years to come.


When you look at the war graves overseas and attend the funerals here at home, the one thing that strikes you over and over again is just how young these men are. Corporal Smith was young, just 24 years of age, born in our bicentennial year. Yet by the time of his death he had already served in the Army for almost seven years, completed previous tours of Afghanistan and the Solomon Islands and earned a chest-full of medals. Corporal Smith has been described as an exceptional soldier, one of the best junior non-commissioned officers that the unit has seen. And remember that the world of special forces is intensively competitive, so these are truly the best of the best.


Scott's mates remember him as a genuine, honest and dedicated colleague. His family have spoken of a loveable character with a cheeky smile and a larrikin streak who lived life to the fullest. Perhaps most significantly, as we reflect on the wider meaning of Afghanistan, Corporal Smith himself believed that his work made a difference, as indeed it did.


We have lost a brave soldier who was going about difficult and dangerous work. He gave his best for our nation in life. He gave his all for our nation in death. Our deepest sympathies go to Corporal Smith's family and to his fellow service personnel. They are much in our thoughts and will continue to be so in the difficult days that lie ahead.

It is a just cause but a costly one. It is a worthwhile mission but an extremely dangerous one.


Corporal Smith was indeed a brave and dedicated soldier. We are proud of him as we are proud of all who wear a uniform and serve our country in combat. We especially honour his family as they grieve for someone they love, someone whose life was good but was tragically cut short. To his father, Murray, to his mother, Katrina, to his sister, Roxanne, to his partner, Liv, go our deepest condolences. Our thoughts and prayers are with you.

Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (14:05):  I rise to associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, both in expressing condolences to the family, friends and mates of Corporal Scott James Smith and also in expressing support for our mission in Afghanistan.


Scott Smith was born in the Barossa Valley in South Australia in 1988—as the Prime Minister said, our bicentennial year. He joined the Army in February 2006 and, following completion of his initial employment training, was posted to the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, Darwin. In 2008 Corporal Smith was posted to the then Incident Response Regiment, now the Special Operations Engineer Regiment, as a search operator. Corporal Smith was based with the Special Operations Engineer Regiment, at Holsworthy Barracks, near Sydney.


Corporal Smith is our 39th fatality overall in Afghanistan, and our seventh fatality this year. We have also suffered 242 wounded, in total, with 29 wounded this year. He is the 19th fatality from the Special Operations Task Group. This includes five members of the SAS—the Special Air Service Regiment—11 commandos and three members of the Special Operations Engineer Regiment, which, as I have indicated, was formerly known as the Incident Response Regiment.


Corporal Smith was on his second operational deployment to Afghanistan, following an earlier deployment to the Solomon Islands. He had received a number of awards, including the Australian Active Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Australian Service Medal and the NATO International Stabilisation Assistance Force Medal.


Corporal Smith's family described the Army as Scott's second home—as his family away from home. Corporal Smith's unit describes Scott as genuine, honest and dedicated. He was an exceptional young soldier, and that has been widely and broadly acknowledged. He possessed all the qualities and the charisma of a great junior leader. He was destined for a great Army career. His loss is and will be deeply felt.


At this terrible time we must continue to be clear sighted about our mission in Afghanistan. Our objective—our mission—is to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a safe haven for terrorists. We will not be in Afghanistan forever, and transition to Afghan-led security responsibility in Uruzgan has commenced and is on track. One of the four infantry kandaks, or battalions, that we are mentoring is now capable of independent operations, and there is an expectation that the remaining three will also commence independent operations by the end of this year.


Our condolences go to Corporal Scott Smith's family—his partner, Liv; his mother, Katrina; his sister, Roxanne; and his father, Murray. His contribution and his sacrifice will always be remembered. Lest we forget.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (14:08):  I join the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the defence minister to honour another fallen sapper, Corporal Scott Smith from the Special Operations Engineer Regiment, who was tragically killed in action while serving with the Special Operations Task Force in Afghanistan. I pass on my sympathies to: his partner, Liv; his parents, Katrina Paterson and Murray Smith; and his sister, Roxanne. Engineers, or sappers, have paid a heavy price in Afghanistan. Eight have been killed and numerous more wounded during this campaign. They have paid such an exacting price because their role is out front. They clear the path, they find and dismantle IEDs and they protect those who literally walk in their footsteps. As a Special Forces soldier, Corporal Smith was required to do all this plus hold his own in a fight.


I have said previously that there is something special about the men who protect the Special Forces—those sappers who lead out front. Their men and their mates describe them as men of insane courage, men capable of holding fear at bay a little longer than most and men who must deal with sophisticated explosives at night, under fire and in a hurry. Corporal Smith was such a man. His Special Ops commanding officer offered the highest praise when he said of him:


The type of physical and moral courage required of our special forces combat engineers is what we all hope for ourselves, but in the case of this man—


Corporal Smith—


he displayed it every time he deployed …


Corporal Smith was killed in a battle that destroyed an insurgent network that specialised in that horrific form of IED attacks. During that battle, SOTG subsequently removed over 100 IEDs from the battlefield. Australians and Afghans are safer because of this man's courage and daring. That is his legacy. He was the first through the door every time. That is his valour. It cannot be taken from him; he earned it, and he owns it. Such is the calibre of this man and of those engineers who will follow in his footsteps. Lest we forget.



The SPEAKER:  As a mark of respect I ask all present to signify their approval by rising in their places.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:12):  On 18 October Australia was elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for 2013 and 2014.



Honourable members:  Hear, hear!




Ms GILLARD:
  This is good news for our country and has been warmly welcomed, as it has just been welcomed in this House. It is the first time in 27 years that Australia will sit on the Security Council. That is too long for a country of Australia's size and influence on the world stage. I am proud that a strong commitment to the United Nations has been an enduring theme of foreign policy under successive Labor governments.


We have just had a motion of condolence on the loss of Corporal Smith and our mission in Afghanistan. For those Australians who ask themselves, 'Does the United Nations matter to us?' I say: of course the United Nations does matter to us. We are in Afghanistan in a mission with the UN involved. Our mission in East Timor has been one oversighted by the UN. Some of the most intractable and difficult problems facing our world—including the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea, the endeavours to stop the fighting in Syria and the continuing fight against terrorism and extremism—are being worked on by the UN. And the values of the UN are ones that we share: peace, security, human rights, equality and a fair go.


So, the United Nations does matter to Australia, and now a voice with an Australian accent will be heard at the table of the Security Council. This is a result that all Australians can be proud of. Our election to the Security Council shows that our standing at the UN is high and our bilateral relationships around the world are in good shape.


As I did on the day that the news came through that we had been elected to the Security Council, I would like to offer my thanks to those involved in the campaign: former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, for having the vision for launching Australia's bid and for his enthusiasm in following that vision as foreign minister; for the work undertaken by Stephen Smith as foreign minister; for the enthusiasm of Senator Bob Carr in pursuing this campaign in its final stages; for the relentless work of parliamentary secretary Richard Marles, who has been dispatched around the world on the Security Council campaign; and to the Minister for Trade, who has played a role in his international engagements in putting forward Australia's credentials for the campaign.


I would like, too, to thank our diplomats around the world for everything that they have done, particularly Gary Quinlan, our Ambassador to the United Nations. But I would particularly like to thank, in addition to our diplomats, the AusAID workers, Defence personnel and police of Australia, who go around the world. The reason our reputation is so high in so many nations around the world is that they have gone there and, with courage and with endeavour, they have helped—and I think this one's for them. Thank you very much.

Government members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Order ! The Leader of the Opposition has the call.




Mr ABBOTT:
  Let me say that, in any contest between Australia and other countries, the coalition is always on Australia's side. Australia's voice should always be heard in the councils of the world. Australia's voice should be heard because of our values, and we should always act in accordance with our values.


The coalition, like the Prime Minister, wants to congratulate everyone who has worked so hard to secure this seat. Yes, we obviously thank and congratulate those countless officials and soldiers who do so much to uphold our name and reputation right around the world. But it would be churlish of me not to give a special mention to the former Prime Minister, the former foreign minister, Kevin Rudd, whose original idea and inspiration it was and who did so much, so indefatigably, to bring it about; and I think this is a special day in the parliament for the former Prime Minister. I should also thank a former colleague, on the coalition side of the parliament, former Senator Russell Trood, who was also a key part of our bid. This is a good development for our country. The challenge now is to put this term to the best possible use, and I am confident we will.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (15:14):  by leave—The purpose of this statement is to:


re-affirm the Australian government's commitment to support and encourage investment in Australia's pulp and paper industry; and to


reinforce the government's view of the importance of the pulp and paper industry and its role in providing highly skilled jobs to Australians; strengthening regional communities; and contributing to environmental sustainability.


The pulp and paper industry makes an important social, environmental and economic contribution to this country. It produces a diverse range of products essential to modern living including printing and communications papers, security paper, newsprint, tissues, cardboard boxes and other forms of packaging. In financial year 2010-11 it created close to $11 billion in product and around $1.1 billion of this was exported. It has a highly skilled workforce and provides around 18,000 jobs, many of which are located in regional parts of the country. The industry is also a significant producer of renewable energy and a major consumer of recycled products. It contributes to environmental outcomes by using sustainably managed forestry resources and adds value through the manufacture of those resources into high-quality products.




Pulp and Paper Industry Strategy Group report



In 2009, the government convened the Pulp and Paper Industry Strategy Group to undertake a strategic review of Australia's pulp and paper industry. I would like to thank the group for its valuable work, in particular its deputy chairs, Michael O'Connor, National Secretary of the CFMEU, and Jim Henneberry, CEO of Australian Paper—both of whom I am very familiar with.


The strategy group's report included recommendations on the themes of innovation, investment, sustainability and productivity. The whole-of-government response to that review, which can be accessed at my department's website, addresses each of these themes and maps a way forward for the industry. The government's response affirms our commitment to work with Australia's pulp and paper industry to continue to build on its strengths and undertake the investment and develop the skills required to secure the industry's long-term sustainability and prosperity.


Australia's pulp and paper industry, like many other manufacturing industries, faces many challenges and structural change pressures, and the government is considering these issues in its response to the report of the non-government members of the Prime Minister's Taskforce on Manufacturing.


The government recently announced the establishment of a manufacturing leaders group to help progress some of the key issues affecting Australia's manufacturing industry. I announce today that representatives from the pulp and paper industry will form an advisory group to support the work of the manufacturing leaders group. This advisory group, to be chaired by Michael O'Connor and Jim Henneberry, will play a key role in ensuring the concerns of the pulp and paper industry are heard and considered in the development of our manufacturing industries.



Investment



Continued investment in manufacturing facilities is absolutely vital to maintaining industry competitiveness and to capturing new opportunities. While recent news that Gunns Limited has been placed in receivership is disappointing, there are nevertheless a number of encouraging examples of the willingness of industry players to embrace the future, supported by recent government announcements. My colleague Minister Crean recently announced that the government will provide up to $28 million towards an $84 million project at Norkse Skog's Boyer Mill in Tasmania to convert a newsprint machine to make coated catalogue paper instead. This grant will complement a $13 million loan from the Tasmanian government and will help secure over 300 existing jobs at the mill following recent declines in newsprint consumption. That is a very important joint investment in Tasmania.


Norske Skog Australasia has also recently established a joint venture with clean energy company Licella to work on second generation bio-crude oil production. This is a great example of the potential for pulp and paper manufacturers to diversify their business models through active engagement in new clean technologies.


I recently announced that the Australian government will also provide $9.5 million towards a $90 million project to install a de-inking pulp facility at Australian Paper's Maryvale mill in Victoria. Construction of the project, which is expected to create 140 construction jobs, should begin late this year. This investment will support the jobs of nearly 900 workers directly employed there and over 4,000 other indirect jobs which rely on the mill's operations. This is a very important part of the outer Melbourne and La Trobe Valley region. The project will enable Australian Paper to recycle paper to produce pulp used in the manufacture of printing and communication paper with recycled fibre content, reducing the need for around 80,000 tonnes per year of waste paper to otherwise go to landfill—all of which contribute also to our greenhouse gas emissions. This measure will reduce emissions.


The government is also providing the regulatory and business environment required to support the scale of investment required by the industry to establish new plant and make innovations at existing plant. Amcor is commissioning a new $550 million recycled packaging paper mill at Botany near Sydney. In June 2011, Visy completed a major expansion of its Tumut mill in New South Wales bringing its total investment there to nearly $1 billion, and opened a $50 million clean energy plant at Coolaroo in Victoria. Kimberly-Clark Australia is currently investing over $30 million to install a gas turbine and heat recovery process at its Millicent tissue mill in South Australia. All of these investments highlight that Australia's pulp and paper industry remains resilient and able to adapt to changing market conditions. They also show that global pulp and paper companies are committed to ensuring their Australian based operations meet world-class standards, particularly in relation to water and energy efficiency.




Conclusion



I conclude this statement by reaffirming this government's commitment to continue working with the pulp and paper industry to ensure its long-term viability.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Indi to speak for not more than seven minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr COMBET:

"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (15:22):  I welcome the opportunity to respond to the minister's statement. On behalf of the coalition, let me start by saying that there are some elements of the minister's remarks with which I agree, including his references to the significance of the pulp and paper industry in this country. This has long been a vitally important industry for Australia and for regional Australia and it needs to remain a vitally important industry long into the future. Of all our domestic industries, there are very few that have been subjected to the same intensity or combination of pressures as this one. But the minister's statement did not tell us anything that the industry and the public did not already know.


There were a number of elements in his statement with which I do not agree at all. If I was an employee of the forestry industry, with my job under a grave cloud, or one of the many thousands of former employees in the forestry industry who have recently lost their jobs then I would not be looking to this statement as representing any source of optimism or inspiration at all. I was waiting for something a bit more significant. But I think that I am right in saying that the only new announcement of any kind in that speech at all was that a new advisory group would be established to support another advisory group that was born from a taskforce that was created at a forum. If that is the case, that says pretty much everything about this government's lack of any fresh vision for Australian manufacturing, especially in relation to an industry under extraordinary and near unprecedented pressure. It also continues the near farcical charade of the Prime Minister's so-called manufacturing taskforce, which was just another excuse for more talk with no guarantee of or even prospect of any immediate or decisive action from Labor.


I recall what I interpreted as embarrassment on the minister's face at the press conference at which we heard that the conclusion of the task force made a clear statement that Australian manufactured mattered. Fancy that! The task force recommended commissioning an investigation of a sovereign wealth fund, committing to consulting with industry in the development of all regulation, initiating a dialogue on what it means to be 'downturn ready' and establishing an independent panel to advise on the changes needed to maximise the potential of design thinking. And it goes on and on along those lines. Needless to say, that task force was not even allowed to consider the impact of the Fair Work Act on manufacturing employment and it was not allowed to consider the impact of the carbon tax. You would think that they would have been allowed to consider the most significant government policies affecting inputs to the manufacturing sector, in which businesses are operating at very tight profit margins. But they were not allowed to consider them at all. Even then, they still pointed out that the carbon tax was a disaster and that the government's approach needed to be changed.


It was also confirmed this month by one of the task force members, the head of the CSIRO, that none of the task force members visited even so much as a single small- or medium-sized business in the manufacturing sector as part of their work. The government talking to real people out there in the real world of Australian manufacturing is not part of this government's approach to policy making.


Just for good measure—and in case there is still a single person left in the manufacturing sector who is not thoroughly sick of being misunderstood, ignored and patronised—it is also our understanding that yet another so-called industry and innovation statement underpinned by secretariat work and born out of a whole succession of interdepartmental meetings and discussions will be released by the government in mid-November. While all of this jawboning has been done over the course of the last five years, the government has presided over—or, more to the point, stood idly by while it happened—the loss of around 120,000 net jobs in Australian manufacturing. That is roughly one in every eight manufacturing jobs. From the time that the carbon tax was announced as policy in February 2011 to August 2012, around 33,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Australia. That equates to one job lost every 20 minutes.


Australian Paper, in their submission to the Victorian government's manufacturing inquiry, said that the pulp and paper industry is in crisis, with employment investment and exports all falling. It has not been a good time for the pulp and paper industry. There should have been a pulp mill built in Tasmania, but one has not been built. The Labor-Greens alliance has created uncertainty for the forestry industry, resulting in thousands of job losses. There should not have been years of delay in making the government's changes to the antidumping system, but there were, even after multiple submissions by the industry pointing to undue delays, costs and onerous administrative environments. In a highly competitive price sensitive environment, cost is everything. Companies like Australian Paper and Visy should not be subjected to an extremely damaging measure like the carbon tax. But they are. Australian Paper, I might add, is yet another one of the companies that has now received a new grant from the government in the past few months that only matches or partially matches the millions of dollars that they are losing thanks to the carbon tax.


Indeed, it was always the height of irony to see the climate change minister trying to take that hat off hastily and put the industry minister hat on. He is the chief architect of the carbon tax, and that role is utterly and hopelessly in conflict with his role as industry minister. His speech today was another one clearly pointing to that.


I want to use the opportunity of this ministerial response to draw attention once again to the sharp contrast between the government and the opposition when it comes to industry policy. We will start by abolishing the carbon tax. We have also announced our intention to change Australia's standards regime to ensure that imported products better comply with the same mandatory standards imposed on locally made goods. We have committed to reducing the costs of Commonwealth red tape to business by at least a billion dollars a year. We have announced a new coalition policy to adopt world's best practice in Australia's antidumping system. We will end government waste and reduce debt, which will take the pressure off interest rates and exert downward pressure on the dollar. And we will have a lot to say about these issues and other policies leading up to the next election.


Labor's approach is all about creating extra costs, taxes and regulations. They even try to throw money at problems to try and patch up the damage that their ad hoc policies have caused. Our approach is to reduce the harm to and the spiralling costs of making things in Australia. It is not enough to say nice words about how important the industry is. Supportive words undermined by damaging policy are a cruel hoax. (Time expired)

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (15:29):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services I present the committee's advisory reports on the committee's inquiries into the Tax Laws Amendment (Clean Building Managed Investment Trust) Bill 2012 and the Personal Liability for Corporate Fault Reform Bill 2012.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the reports were made parliamentary papers.




Ms O'NEILL:
  by leave—I present the committee's report into the provisions of the Personal Liability for Corporate Fault Reform Bill 2012. On 20 September 2012, the House of Representatives Selection of Bills Committee referred the bill to the joint committee for inquiry and report. The committee received four submissions and held a public hearing in Sydney on 22 October. At the hearing, the committee took evidence from the Law Council of Australia, Chartered Secretaries Australia, the Commonwealth Treasury and the New South Wales Department of Premier and Cabinet.


This bill implements the Council of Australian Governments' directors' liability reform, which aims to harmonise the imposition of personal criminal liability for corporate fault across Australian jurisdictions. The Directors' Liability Reform Project is part of the COAG National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy.


This bill commits all Australian jurisdictions to a nationally consistent and principled approach to the imposition of personal criminal liability on directors and corporate officers for corporate fault. It aims to remove regulatory burdens on directors and corporate officers that cannot be justified on public policy grounds and to minimise inconsistency between Australian jurisdictions in the way personal liability for corporate fault is imposed in Australian laws.


Accordingly, the bill proposes to amend a number of commonwealth acts: to remove personal criminal liability for corporate fault where such liability is not justified; to remove the 'reverse onus of proof', where the directors themselves must establish a defence to a charge; to replace personal criminal liability for corporate fault with civil liability where a non-criminal penalty is appropriate; and to clarify the circumstances where personal criminal liability is justified.


The reform in this bill is the culmination of earlier reviews into the area of personal liability of directors. These reviews noted an 'increasing tendency for personal liability provisions to be introduced in Australian law as a matter of course and without robust justification'. As a result, in some cases a director could face a criminal penalty for a breach of the law by a corporation when he or she had no knowledge of or control over the breach. Further, imposing personal liability without proper justification has been inefficient. The argument has been put that the threat of excessive risk of personal criminal liability has led directors to take a cautious approach to their strategic and entrepreneurial responsibilities.


All witnesses to this inquiry recognised that the bill's reform will reduce the level of risk for directors and the burden to corporate officers, while at the same time providing greater certainty. It will focus attention on key areas of liability laws, while reducing the burden of these laws to enable greater focus on corporate performance. When the reforms are implemented by all jurisdictions, the number of laws containing directors' liability provisions nationally will be significantly reduced. New South Wales, for example, anticipates that the number of its statutes with personal liability provisions will be reduced from 1,000, currently, to around 150. These are significant adaptations for improving productivity. Importantly, the reform will retain laws that are necessary to ensure that company directors and other corporate officers take reasonable steps to ensure that their companies comply with their obligations under the law.


The committee is confident that this bill—and the wider reform agenda—will provide greater certainty for company directors and will reduce red tape. A reduction in the number of offences that include directors' liability provisions will provide for a significant reduction in the legislative and regulatory burden, and it will focus directors' minds on those offences that do warrant personal liability.


The committee is satisfied that the bill fulfils the Commonwealth's obligations to the reform of personal liability for corporate fault. The COAG principles and guidelines have been developed through a comprehensive consultation process, the states and territories have thoroughly reaudited their legislation to ensure compliance with COAG principles, and the states and territories have begun passing legislation to reduce the number of personal liability provisions within their statutes and have put in place clear administrative arrangements for those rare cases where new personal liability provisions should carry a reverse onus of proof. I commend the report to the House.


On behalf of the committee I also report on the Tax Laws Amendment (Clean Building Managed Investment Trust) Bill 2012. I am pleased to report that the inquiry sent invitations to 36 organisations offering them the opportunity to make a submission by Wednesday 24 October 2012. The committee received six submissions.


This bill reduces the final rate of withholding tax on fund payments from Australian Clean Building Managed Investment Trusts made to foreign investors in 'information exchange countries'. For fund payments made to these investors, the bill cuts the withholding tax rate from the current rate of 15 per cent to 10 per cent. For the concessional 10 per cent rate to apply, the managed investment trust must invest in new energy-efficient office, hotel or retail buildings that commenced construction on or after 1 July 2012. The trusts may hold limited assets incidental to these buildings, such as car parking facilities, telecommunications infrastructure or advertising billboards. To be treated as an energy-efficient building, a building must obtain and maintain either a five-star Green Star rating or a 5½-star NABERS rating. The government has announced that these criteria will be reviewed after three years 'to ensure that the measure continues to apply to buildings that are above the average level of energy efficiency'.


Stakeholders strongly supported the incentive that this bill provides for foreign investors to invest in Australian clean buildings. Indeed, their main concern is that the bill is pitched too narrowly and that foreign investment in all Australian building stock should be subject to the same concessional 10 per cent withholding tax rate.


In its report the committee makes the following three points about the bill's clause limiting the concessional rate to buildings constructed on or after 1 July this year. First, the proposed legislation is only a disincentive in relative terms. Second, since 2008 the overall level of withholding tax for an investor in an information exchange country has been reduced from 30 per cent to 15 per cent. This is a proud and important achievement of this government. Third, the government is aware that the vast majority of building stock is comprised of existing older buildings and already has in place a suite of programs to promote retrofitting and more efficient energy use in established buildings.


The committee believes that the five per cent safe harbour is appropriate and that assets such as car parking facilities, telecommunications infrastructure and advertising infrastructure should fall within this safe harbour.


The committee strongly supports the provisions of the bill. It promotes Australia as a place that provides foreign investors with a tax based incentive to invest in energy-efficient commercial buildings. The bill is an excellent example of this government's determination to achieve a competitive taxation framework with beneficial environmental outcomes.


I conclude by noting the comments of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, which recently decided to invest in the Barangaroo South office development in Sydney:


We believe this Bill will provide investors the certainty they need when making decisions to invest in new Clean Buildings. In particular, we welcome changes in the Government's final Bill that:


•   clarify what constitutes a Clean Building;


•   allow Managed Investment Trusts to derive income incidental to the Clean Building; and


•   allow a holding trust to hold investments in both Clean Building Managed Investment Trusts and non-Clean Building Managed Investment Trusts.


I commend the bill to the House.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (20:00):  I move the motion relating to the victims of terrorism overseas in the terms in which it appears on the Notice Paper:


That this House: 


(1) notes that:


(a) since the devastating terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, over 100 Australians have died and many others have suffered injury as a result of terrorist attacks overseas;


(b) the victims of 'September 11', the two Bali bombings, the London and Jakarta bombings and the Mumbai terrorist attacks, were targeted because they were citizens of countries where people could choose how they lived and what faith they might follow; and


(c) 12 October 2012 will mark the tenth anniversary of the 2002 Bali bombings; 


(2) recognises that:


(a) many Australian families continue to suffer as a result of their loss and injury from overseas terrorist acts;


(b) victims of overseas terrorism have not been entitled to compensation such as that received by domestic victims of crime under the various State and Territory victims of crime schemes; and


(c) the Government did not support amendments to the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2012 which would have provided assistance for any action after 10 September 2001; and


(3) supports the Coalition's request that the Minister make the appropriate retrospective declarations so that all of the Australian victims of overseas terrorism acts since 10 September 2001, or their next of kin, can receive this important, but modest, help.


I do regret that the member for Hume has had his speech interrupted, because it sounded like it was going to be a very thoughtful contribution. I look forward to hearing more from the member for Hume when the debate is resumed.


For me, the matter now before the House is not political; it is personal. I am moving this way because I believe it is right and also because of the personal experience and the personal contact which I have had with some of the victims of terrorism arising from the happenstance of my being in Bali back in 2005 when the second bomb went off. I was the Minister for Health and Ageing at the time and it seemed to me that an Australian health minister in Bali at a time when Australians had been the victims of a terrorist atrocity could not just enjoy a holiday as usual. So I went to the Sanglah hospital, where the victims were being treated. I met up with a remarkable doctor, Dr Adam Frost, a Newcastle doctor who had been travelling with a party which included many of the victims. I spent the next 15 or so hours with Dr Frost and with the then Australian consul to Bali, Brian Diamond, who did a remarkable job, until all of the Australian victims had been safely evacuated either to Singapore or to Darwin.


For me, this is not just another matter before the parliament; it is something which I feel very deeply and very personally. In the course of that day I got to know some of those victims, and since then I have stayed in touch with some of those victims, in particular Mr Paul Anicich, who at that time was the Senior Partner of Sparke Helmore Lawyers, the well-known law firm. He has subsequently been largely unable to work. Paul Anicich is comfortably off, but many of the people who were caught up in that tragedy are not as financially secure as Paul and Penny Anicich. Sure, they have been able to access the Australian health system. Sure, where necessary, they have been able to access the Australian social security system. But many of them have suffered financially and all of them have suffered physically and psychologically, and I believe that we as a nation owe a debt to them, because they were targeted because they were Australian. They were targeted because they were citizens of a country where people are free to choose their own way of life and choose which god they wish to worship. That is why they were targeted. They suffered because they are Australian. I think we need to acknowledge the fact that they were targeted for that reason.


The proposal that evolved in my mind in discussions over many months with Paul Anicich was that we should have a federal scheme that would offer to the victims of terrorism overseas the same kind of financial assistance which is typically available to local victims of crime under the state and territory victims of crime schemes. Every state and territory has a victims of crime scheme, and people who have been the victims of crime can usually access up to $80,000 or thereabouts under those schemes. If I had been the victim of a savage assault, or some other crime of violence, typically, that is what would be available to me. It would not be to compensate for any specific thing; it would nevertheless be a recognition of the way I had suffered. Typically it is provided because the perpetrators of these crimes cannot be sued by victims in the way that others who have been damaged might be able to sue people. So all I have sought is assistance for the Australian victims of terrorist atrocities overseas which is entirely comparable to the assistance which is ordinarily available to the victims of domestic crime in Australia.


I moved this way before I was the Leader of the Opposition. I regret to say that the last parliament terminated before my private member's motion was able to be considered. So I have moved again in this parliament on this issue. I do not believe the government was particularly sympathetic towards it the first time, but, in fairness to the current government, I did raise this in the last year of the Howard government and the Howard government had a bit on its plate and nothing happened. So I do not want to be too hard on the present government for its dilatory approach to all of this.


But, to their credit, the crossbenchers were interested in my private member's bill, and, once it became apparent that the crossbenchers were going to support my bill, the then Attorney-General, Mr McClelland, the member for Barton, indicated that it would be adopted by the government. I thank and congratulate the member for Barton for his magnanimity in taking this approach. Unfortunately, while the government did substantially adopt my bill and incorporated it into a social security act, the whole point has been missed, because the declarations that my bill provided for—that would give this important but modest assistance to the actual, existing Australian victims of terrorism—were not made.


So we have this legislation on the books, we have the capacity for the relevant minister to make a declaration that a terrorist act overseas is a relevant act for the purposes of making these modest payments, and the government is refusing to make the declarations that would mean that the terrorist acts of September 11, Bali 1 and 2, Jakarta 1 and 2, Mumbai and London would attract, at least for the Australian victims, these modest but important payments. What is before the parliament tonight is a motion calling on the minister and the government to make such a declaration so that the 300 Australians killed or seriously injured in overseas terrorist acts can receive this modest help. The help will go to them or, if they are deceased, their next of kin.


We are talking about a quantum of money which would make a difference for the individuals and the families concerned. If all the 300 Australian victims thus far were to receive $80,000, we would be talking, with administrative costs, in the order of $30 million—not an insignificant amount of money but very modest in the scheme of Commonwealth government spending and, I would say, the least a decent nation can provide for people who have suffered in our name. They have suffered in our name: they were targeted because they are Australian.


I say to the government—and I say this free of any partisan rancour: do the right thing by those 300 Australians who have so far suffered as a result of overseas terrorism. If this is right for people who might suffer in the future, it is surely right for the people who have already suffered. I say to the crossbenchers: thank you for supporting the original legislation. Let us now finish the job we started and pass this motion, and then, I think, the government will have to make the relevant declarations. (Time expired)

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-10-29,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (20:10):  On 12 October 2012, we remembered the worst terrorist attack our nation has ever known. In 2002, 88 Australians died in Bali, along with 38 Indonesians and 76 others from various places around the world. Some 200 people were injured in that event, all as a result of violent terrorism, extremism of the worst kind. We struggle in Australia to understand what would cause someone to undertake that sort of action—needless, unnecessary. We resolve our disputes in an amiable way and we do it in courts. We do not resort to acts of violence in that way. We defend ourselves, but only when we are attacked. We do not understand the fundamentalism and extremism that motivate people to do these desperate acts. The people who did this are despised, not just in Australia but in Indonesia. The scenes in Bali were more akin to a war zone than anything else.


Today in this parliament we mourn the sad death of Corporal Scott Smith, the 39th Australian soldier killed in Afghanistan. The tragedy of those people who died in Bali is that they were not soldiers; they were holiday-makers, in the main. The Prime Minister compared the bombing in Bali—and the bombing in London, subsequently—to Gallipoli, where something of the Australian spirit dwells on another shore. There is nothing we can do as a parliament to make those people return to their loved ones or to end the suffering of those that still bear the scars and injuries. 


Many of us in this place, including me, have had the benefit of travelling to Indonesia and talking to the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian authorities about what happened in Bali. Many of us here in this place, me included, have been to the Middle East and seen the hostility and enmity between Jews and Arabs, seen the hostility between people who fight over water rights, religion, employment, opportunity, education, land, housing and hospitals. They fight over places of religious affiliation and devotion. We have witnessed the viciousness with which those beliefs are often held. But I am proud to be part of a government—and this is the third time I have spoken on these matters in this place—that is providing financial assistance to those Australians who are injured or who lose a close family member as a result of the wanton acts of violence which we call terrorism.


The Leader of the Opposition has raised the issue of compensation which would date from September 10, 2001. Since that time, there have been numerous acts of terrorism. I get it that acts of terrorism must have had a lasting and deep impact on the Leader of the Opposition, and I believe that in part he is sincere in what he has to say, but to criticise us for being dilatory in relation to this issue—and that is the word he used tonight in his speech—at a time when he was a senior cabinet minister in the Howard coalition government is simply appalling. It is a misuse of what he is talking about. It goes to show his bona fides in relation to this matter and that he is not as sincere as he made out when he made that speech tonight.


We have formalised assistance through a WorkCover style arrangement, but terrorism did not begin in Bali and it did not begin on September 11, 2001. Sadly, it has afflicted humanity for millennia. On 19 April 1995 Timothy McVeigh and some friends masterminded the worst act of terrorism on American soil—that is, until September 11. He was responsible for the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people, including 19 children aged under six, while injuring another 680 people. On 21 December 1988 Pan Am flight 103 was destroyed by a bomb, killing all 243 passengers and 16 crew members, and crashed into the town of Lockerbie in Scotland, killing a further 11 people.


On 13 February 1978 Australia experienced its own act of terrorism when a bomb exploded outside the Sydney Hilton, killing two garbage men and a police officer, and injuring others. So terrorism did not begin on 11 September 2001. That brand of terrorism caused by al-Qaeda has been etched firmly in our minds, but it has always been around. In fact, what we often call the Great War was formed by an act of terrorism and was initiated by someone who killed a member of the royal family in Austria-Hungary.


Terrorism is not limited to al-Qaeda or extreme Islamic fundamentalism. It has been used as a systematic form of violence for a long time, whether motivated by religion, political aspiration or ideological goals. It has always been around; sadly, it has afflicted us for a long time. The terrorism that occurred on 11 September was a defining moment for all of us and, just like people from generations before us remember where they were when World War II ended, we can remember where we were on 11 September. It was a time that brought everyone together and even, famously, French newspapers said that we were all Americans. Many of us signed cards and sent letters of condolence. 


It is really a shame to politicise this issue. We initiated legislation and it was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. It is the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011. I made a speech on that matter on 19 June 2012. In that legislation we established a WorkCover type of legislation that does take into consideration the nature, duration and impact of disease or injury, the future loss of earnings, the kinds of special injury or damage that people suffer and the circumstances in which that injury or disease was picked up. There are payments which go up to $75,000, exempt from GST and exempt from other aspects as well.


In the past there were ex gratia payments. The Howard coalition government provided these on a case-by-case basis to victims of terrorism, including those of Bali in 2002 and 2005, London in 2005, Mumbai in 2008—we did that—and Jakarta in 2009. These ex gratia packages included financial assistance for family support, funeral and bereavement costs, travel costs and recognition of foregone wages resulting from a terrorist act. So it is not that people in the past did not get that sort of assistance.


The Prime Minister has made it crystal clear to the Leader of the Opposition. If there are instances in which he feels people have not received the assistance they deserve or need he should raise it with her. She has made that clear. It would be unjust to those Australians maimed through acts of terrorism to retrospectively do that by supporting the Leader of the Opposition in his venture today. It is concerning that he did not raise this issue and act upon it when he was a senior cabinet minister in the Howard coalition government. In the past, compensation was ruled out by Prime Minister Howard—in the way that the Leader of the Opposition has now proposed—and by the then Minister for Justice and Customs. But that does not mean support has not been given.


I really do wonder what the Leader of the Opposition is on about with this. When he had an opportunity to put forward a private member's bill on this issue he called it the Assisting Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill 2010. It was extraordinarily vague. It was not a well-crafted piece of legislation. With words like 'scheme', 'plan', 'framework' and 'guidelines' it was vague and esoteric. It was not particularised. Even tonight, if you listened to his speech, it was not defined. It was again vague and esoteric.


On a case-by-case basis the Howard government did the right thing by providing ex gratia assistance in the way that it did. I would expect—and the Australian people would expect—all governments to do that. I baulk at saying this, but I am really disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition has in part, if not wholly, politicised this issue. If there are instances where, under former Prime Minister John Howard and the Leader of the Opposition when he was a cabinet minister, people did not get the help they needed or deserved then those things should have been raised directly with us when we came to government. They should have been looked at on a case-by-case basis. They should have been raised with Prime Minister Howard, Prime Minister Rudd or Prime Minister Gillard.


If this were truly bipartisan, the Leader of the Opposition would not have used some of the language he used tonight in his speech. In a spirit of bipartisanship we should be doing everything we can to support victims of terrorism. We should support the legislation that has provided the framework for a WorkCover style compensation to provide for those people. We will never provide for the loss but at least we can provide assistance for those people who are secondary victims as well as for those who are primary victims. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (20:21):  I rise this evening to support the Leader of the Opposition's private member's motion. With our nation pausing recently to reflect on the 10th anniversary of the 2002 Bali bombings it is appropriate that the House consider this important motion.


The Leader of the Opposition is to be commended for his tireless advocacy on behalf of the victims of overseas terrorism. Time after time, he has come into this House to draw attention to the challenges these Australians continue to face in their daily lives. Time after time, his request for assistance for the Australian victims of overseas terrorism, dating back to 2001, has been rejected by this government. As long as this issue remains unaddressed, the claim that this parliament stands in complete support with victims of terrorism will ring hollow.


As the motion notes, over 100 Australians have lost their lives to acts of terrorism since 11 September 2001, when people throughout the world recoiled in horror but with an overwhelming sense of sadness at the news of the attacks in the United States. 


For every Australian lost to terrorism even more have been injured. In New York, Bali, London, Jakarta and Mumbai terrorists, driven by hatred and intolerance, have struck out at men, women and children because of the values and freedoms that they cherished. These people committed no crime. They were targets because they were Australians and committed to our way of life. On each occasion the resolve of our country was tested and each time it has been shown to be true.


Few events have been etched more deeply in our nation's mind or shaped our view of the world as much as the 2002 terrorist attack in the tourist district of Kuta in Bali. On that night this island paradise was shown not to be as immune from the horrors of this world as we had hoped. The attack killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and 240 people were injured. For many this attack brought to an end Australia's age of innocence in the way the fall of Singapore and the battle for Darwin did for the previous generations of Australians. That such an act could occur so close to our shores in a place that we loved, amongst a people who had shown us nothing but kindness and hospitality, was a shock on a great scale. In the days and weeks that followed we stood together in tribute to the men and women who risked their lives not just for their loved ones but for complete strangers. We applauded the doctors and nurses who fought off exhaustion to remain at the sides of their patients and our diplomats and police officers who worked with their Indonesian counterparts to bring the perpetrators to justice. In times of greatest need the best in human nature rises to the top.


While 10 years has passed since that terrible time many of the Australians that were there continue to bear physical, mental and emotional scars. They relive the terrorist attack every day of their lives. In this cruel twist of fate their hopes and dreams have been replaced by something that once would have seemed unimaginable. Most of us will never be able to completely comprehend the fullness of their suffering. What we can do, however, is help ease the burden that they have been forced to bear.


In supporting this motion members of parliament will send an important message to the victims of overseas terrorism since 10 September 2001 that they are not forgotten, that our nation stands with them in their time of need and, in a modest but important way, will act to ease their pain. For the many Australians that have suffered a lasting injury this assistance will offer relief from the ongoing pressure of medical bills and other costs. While nothing this parliament does will ever be enough to compensate for the loss of a loved one, this assistance offers hope of a brighter, more secure future.


During the time that the coalition has pushed the government to adopt this initiative other countries have acted. For example, earlier this year the United Kingdom government established a scheme to assist victims of terrorist incidents outside of that country on or after 1 January 2002. Its list of designated incidents includes both the terrorist attacks in Bali in 2002 and Mumbai. The United Kingdom justice minister stated that Britain:


… should support and compensate those people who sadly have been injured in overseas terrorist atrocities.


While we will never be able to put right the harm victims of terrorism suffer, we hope this scheme will go some way towards helping them rebuild their lives.


That the British government is able to find the resources needed to pay victims up to 500,000 pounds despite the financial difficulties Great Britain faces, while the Gillard government rejects the modest payment of $75,000, says a lot about this government's values and its priorities.


For the Leader of the Opposition, obtaining government support for the victims of overseas terrorism has been a personal campaign dating back to the 2005 Bali bombing. Holidaying in Bali at the time of the attack, the Leader of the Opposition spent time at the Sengla Hospital working with others to ensure that all Australians had been evacuated. His deep commitment to this cause has grown from a promise that he would seek to see that the victims of overseas terrorism received the same support as the victims of crime in Australia, to legislation that he introduced in 2009 that would enable victims of terrorism to receive similar payments to those received by domestic victims of crime through state based schemes. While the government adopted part of the bill to compensate future victims of terrorism, no provisions were made for past victims. In fact the Labor government voted down an amendment that would have extended this assistance to the Australian victims of terrorism incidents dating back to the September 11 attacks on the United States. How they could do that is beyond comprehension. While we cannot guarantee the safety of Australians overseas, we can make sure that our citizens and their families are looked after in the case of a terrorist attack.


In my electorate in Perth in Kings Park tree lined avenues pay respect to the men and women of our armed forces who have fought and died defending Australia. Kings Park is home to the state war memorial. It is a sacred place, offering comfort to those impacted by the horrors of war. Such was the grief felt by the people of Western Australia following the attack on Bali in 2002 that a memorial was established in Kings Park for the 16 Western Australian victims. As I stated in my address at the recent Bali memorial service at Parliament House, so keenly did we share the pain of those who were injured, so aware were we of the loss suffered by their families and friends, such was the outpouring of grief, that a monument was erected in their memory within the same revered patch of earth reserved to honour our fallen soldiers.


I join with the Leader of the Opposition in calling on the House to support the coalition's request that the minister make the appropriate retrospective declarations so that all of the Australian victims of overseas terrorism acts since 10 September 2001 or their next of kin can receive this much needed assistance. There can be no more pathetic excuses from this government. This government must act. The Australian people and this parliament demand it of this government.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-10-29,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (20:29):  Sadly, terrorism has become a fact of life throughout the world. Hardly a day passes without a report from some part of the world about an act of terrorism. Terrorism has become the new method of fighting wars by those who do not have the military might to engage in conventional warfare. Until terrorism acts directly affected us, they were just seen as another news report and another statistic. For those affected, however, each report meant lives lost or injured and families left mourning and grieving. The attacks on the twin towers in the US and the bombing in Bali changed all of that because for the first time the American and Australian people were the direct target of a major act of terrorism that had been carefully planned and executed.


For the US, the attack on the twin towers sent shock waves throughout the country and throughout the world because this was the first successful attack against the US on its mainland. That anyone would ever dare to commit such an act was previously unthinkable. That it was possible left people stunned. Yet it was committed and it left New York physically and psychologically devastated. Almost 3,000 lives were lost and a towering physical structure was razed to the ground. The world has been a much different place ever since. I recall a few years ago I listened to an address from Rudy Giuliani, who was the mayor of New York at the time. He talked about his leadership role in that crisis. It provided a terrific insight into just what happened in New York and the response at the time. Sadly the focus on security has by necessity been stepped up to the point that it has become a major cost and inconvenience to society across the world. For Australia, the bombings in Bali sent out a very clear warning: that Australians were not immune from terrorism.


As I am speaking about this motion tonight—and I have not chosen to speak on the motion in remembrance of the 10th anniversary of the Bali bombings—I take this opportunity to acknowledge the families of the 202 people killed in Bali on 12 October as they mark the 10th anniversary of their loss. On 12 October I attended the 10th anniversary service of the Bali bombings here in the Great Hall of Parliament House. It was a very emotional service. As I sat in the service, I reflected back to 10 years ago, reliving my recollection of events at the time. I also tried to imagine what it must have been like for those caught in the bombing and how it must have been for their families then and over the past ten years. As the images were shown on the screen of so many people looking so happy and full of life, I thought about Angela Golotta. Angela was one of the three South Australians killed in Bali with Josh Deegan and Bob Marshall being the other two. She was in Bali with her parents, Tracey and John, and with her brother, Michael. I have known the family for a long time. Angela was five days short of her 20th birthday when she was killed. For her family, the 10th anniversary would have been a very difficult time. I quote from a memorial about her from her grandparents that was published in the Advertiser on 12October. It said:


She was ambitious, energetic and with a loving and caring nature. A passionate animal lover. The years have passed but our grief remains. However, we still hold in our hearts happy memories of the most loving and generously caring of girls, an innocent victim who did not deserve to die in this tragic manner.


I have also spoken at length to John Golotta, her father, about events in Bali and for his family since. John, Tracey and Michael had been at the Sari Club with Angela. They left shortly before the blast. Angela said she would stay on a little longer. The family went back to their hotel not far away. They heard the blast from the hotel and John and Michael raced back to the Sari Club. They were, in fact, the first people to enter what was left of the building. What they saw, what they were confronted with and what they have described to me is, quite frankly, unimaginable. I certainly will not go into it in detail.


I spoke to John earlier today and told him I would be speaking tonight, which brings me to the motion before us. He said to me, 'You never get over what happened. You just learn to live with it.' But he also made a second point. It took a long time before any help arrived at the Sari Club and there was not very much help for the families in the days after the event. His plea to parliament was this: if there was to be a similar event in the future to ensure that we can provide assistance as quickly as possible to those affected. He has little doubt that others would have survived had assistance been made available at the time. But it was not.


Regrettably, no amount of monetary compensation will restore or lessen the loss, pain and suffering caused. I accept, however, that when these tragedies occur, as they did for the Golotta family, it can also create a very serious financial burden on them as well. I understand the purpose of victims of crime compensation. My concern with the motion, however, as it presently stands is twofold. Firstly, picking an event, in this case the September 11 attacks, and backdating the compensation to a fixed date without any rational reason for choosing that period in time, I find difficult to justify. Secondly, as the member for Blair quite rightly pointed out, it makes no provision for assistance already provided, assistance quite rightly provided by this government and the previous government to many of the families on an individual case-by-case basis. Those are matters that need to be incorporated in the consideration of this kind of motion.


I also note that the attack in Bali and the Twin Towers attack occurred during the time of the previous government. I listened to the Leader of the Opposition as he explained his reasoning as to why nothing was done in terms of providing backdated compensation during that time. I accept that he was genuine in his remarks to the House about that. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the previous government chose not to provide that compensation and perhaps chose not to do so for the reasons that I outlined earlier and which the member for Blair outlined in his remarks to the chamber. Those reasons include that there was assistance provided on a case-by-case basis. I also accept that victims of crime compensation is nothing new.


The states have indeed been providing it for some time throughout Australia and for quite proper reasons. I am aware of that and in fact I have been involved in some cases in which I have tried to assist people to secure some of that compensation. I am also aware that other countries provide victims of crime compensation and compensation directly related to terrorism, including the UK. I heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition talking about the UK experience. My understanding is—and I stand to be corrected—that it is specific to six particular incidents. Some will argue that that is not right, either. Each jurisdiction will make their own determination about all of these matters, as the US did. Their legislation dates back to 1984, I believe.


These are sensitive matters. We need to ensure that all people are treated equally. They have suffered and grieved enough. Adding to their heartache by having some kind of system in place that does not treat people equally is something that we need to be very sensitive to when we consider motions like the one before the House. I have no doubt that the minister will consider this motion and take on board what the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have said. But, as I have made clear in my remarks, it is a matter that we need to deal with very sensitively.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (20:39):  I rise to speak in support of the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. As we discuss this tonight, it is natural for us to think back and reflect on the history of the Bali bombings and September 11. If we go back a bit further, on 23 February 1998 an obscure organisation headed by an even more obscure individual published an open manifesto. The declaration featured a list of signatories whose names would soon emerge from anonymity to infamy. The leader of the pack was the late and unlamented Osama bin Laden. The manifesto's signatories also included Ayman al-Zawahari, who moved up to head the organisation once bin Laden was consigned to the depths of the Indian Ocean following his demise at the hands of US Navy SEALs. Entitled Jihad against the Jews and the crusaders, this document was published by a movement calling itself the World Islamic Front. Over the last decade-plus we have come to know this crew of mass-murdering terrorists by another name: al Qaeda.


While bin Laden is rightly condemned for his homicidal barbarism, he could not be faulted on his awful clarify. His 1998 manifesto made his agenda perfectly clear by declaring:


… in compliance with God's order, we issue the following fatwa to all Muslims:


The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies—civilians and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it …


Within months, bin Laden's terrorist foot soldiers put words into practice, killing over 200 people by blowing up three embassies in Africa that September.


Throughout the 15 years that have followed, as we know, thousands of innocents have been slaughtered by al Qaeda in New York office buildings, Bali nightclubs, London subways, Madrid commuter railcars, Jakarta hotels, Mumbai hospitals and a synagogue in Ghriba. That tragic roll of terror victims includes over 100 Australian names. Yet our presence on al Qaeda's target list should come as no surprise. After all, Australia exemplifies all of the things jihadi Islam so dearly loves to hate: religious tolerance, gender equality, freedom of expression and government by the ballot, not the bullet. It only stands to reason that a movement seeking to impose a resurrected Caliphate upon the world does not look kindly upon free minds and free markets.


But it was not just our democratic values that aroused the ire of Osama bin Laden; it was our democratic actions as well. In 1999, Australia intervened militarily in East Timor, playing a leading role in the birth of Timor Leste as a free and independent nation. To al Qaeda, this was an unforgiveable sin. Clear evidence to that effect emerged in November 2001 when the BBC published a new bin Laden manifesto. There, amidst the long laundry list of jihadi complaints, was a paragraph denouncing 'crusader Australian forces … landed to separate East Timor, which is part of the Islamic World.' The bombing attacks in Bali that claimed 88 Australian lives took place less than a year later. The liberation of Timor Leste, continued bin Laden, was part of a 'war of annihilation in the true sense of the word.'


We have for a long period of time been at war with a totalitarian ideology that believes that the destruction of our civilisation is a prerequisite for the construction of theirs. This is the same totalitarian ideology that last month motivated Taliban assassins to shoot a 14-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl in the head for the crime of advocating female education. This war was started by jihadi Islam but must be ended by us because the consequences of defeat are too horrible to contemplate.


In this war, Australians who have been killed or wounded by enemy action deserve to be treated as well as possible. That treatment includes support for the innocent non-combatants who have fallen victim abroad to acts of terrorism, and for their families.


The Leader of the Opposition was advocating for this cause even before he was Leader of the Opposition. In November 2009 he introduced a private member's bill to provide this sorely needed financial assistance. In his second reading speech he gave a telling description of precisely what was at stake and why, but I will not recount it again tonight.


At the time, the Member for Warringah pointed out the difference between the level of support available to those who suffer from criminal violence at home, and he has done so again tonight. The legislation he has pushed for is aimed at rectifying that disparity. He outlined how it took a long period of time for this to get movement in this parliament, and he also candidly outlined his efforts in 2007, when we were in government.


The legislation to date has not gone far enough, as far as concerns those important declarations that would relate back to the day before September 11. It has the capacity to deal with future atrocities, but not the past, and it does not have the capacity to cover those Australians who have fallen victim to jihadi war against Australia and the West since 11 September 2001.


The Attorney-General has attempted to justify the government's unwillingness by arguing that 'retrospective legislation is not appropriate here'. This has been addressed by those opposite again tonight. I say a number of things about this. With the history I have just recounted, the time frame is very specific for Australia. If there were ever a case for retrospective legislation it is here. The Leader of the Opposition has been careful to limit the application both in time and in scope, back to 10 September 2001. Its fiscal impact is finite.


Another philosophical objection to retrospective legislation derives from the unfairness of imposing penalties after the fact. I have certainly argued against retrospective legislation in this parliament. But this legislation does no such thing. It does not contain punitive provisions, it bestows a benefit to a targeted group of people over a defined period of time.


I call on the government to reconsider its opposition to this today and to consider doing what this parliament feels is the right thing to do. And I say: if not here, where? Certainly, the innocent Australians who suffered in life and limb at the murderous hands of al-Qaeda are deserving of our positive consideration of this motion, here and now.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-10-29,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (20:49):  In speaking on this motion tonight I want to pay tribute to some of the brave Australians who have been honoured for their outstanding service following the tragic Bali terrorist attacks on 12 October 2002. But first I want to acknowledge those Australians who lost a family member or friend in the attacks on America in September 2001. Even today the images of that day are frightening and horrific. They are images of terrorism and a barbaric disregard for the lives of innocent people, and they will haunt us forever. Australia has historically close ties to the United States. We have stood together to face global threats through many years and through many wars. Just as the footage and stories from the conflict in the Pacific are ingrained in our psyche, so too are the events of 9/11.


Our then Prime Minister, John Howard, was in Washington when the Pentagon was attacked. Journalist Denis Atkins's account of the situation that confronted Mr Howard, his family, Australian diplomats and the travelling media is compelling. He writes about being 'shocked' and 'amazed' as people in Washington wondered what was going on. He describes the impact on the travelling media and the Australian diplomatic corps as events unfolded.


Mr Howard was actually the first leader to call the 9/11 attacks an act of war, and in many ways he was right to say this. There can never be any justification and there can never be any excuse or reason for the mass murder of civilians. The attack on America, like the attacks on London and Madrid, represent the most frightening element of extremism and the use of terror purely to kill.


As someone who has lived and worked in India as part of Australia's diplomatic mission, I know that the terrorist attacks in Mumbai were felt closely here in Australia. Australians were caught up in that evil act of terror, but many Australians have family and friends in Mumbai and they too have been affected by this act of terrorism. To see these attacks in India was deeply affecting. I love India and the Indian people and, having travelled as well to Pakistan and Afghanistan, I know the everyday people of this region want peace and stability.


Terrorism is designed to cause fear and chaos. Extremists use terror. Extremists use terror to bring instability and anarchy, and that is why we always stand firm in the way we deal with terrorist organisations. Ten years ago the unimaginable nightmare of terrorism was experienced by hundreds of Australians. On that fateful night in October, 202 people were killed, 88 of whom were Australian; 240 people were injured, many of them seriously. I had the privilege and the honour to represent the Speaker at the recent Bali memorial service here in Canberra, in the Great Hall. Senator Stephen Parry was there representing the President of the Senate, and the Governor-General was there. It was an incredibly moving and deeply mournful experience. There wasn't a dry eye in the house by the end of the session. But what I really enjoyed about it was the fact that it was incredibly respectful and also acknowledged the lives lost in this tragedy. It was also, in a way, uplifting in that the families and friends were there to honour those who died on that dreadful night in those dreadful circumstances. Photos were shown of a number of individuals, and that is what really brought the house undone. It was mournful, as I said, but also respectful and in many ways uplifting.


Particularly moving was the fact that the Governor-General wore a beautiful brooch—a dove—on her lapel. I think that sent many messages, but essentially one of peace—hopefully world peace in our lifetimes. It was also wonderful to speak to the families and friends after the ceremony and to hear of their experiences and their tragic loss, as well as how they were rebuilding their lives and at the same time respecting and honouring those they had lost.


In the aftermath of this horrific terror attack, brave and wonderful Australians stepped up to help the many survivors and the families and friends of those who lost loved ones. Many of them were public servants, and I also spoke to a number of them at that Bali memorial service here in Canberra just recently. A total of 199 people were recognised for their efforts. These were people who rescued and helped family members, friends and people they had never met before. Some helped survivors from the burning nightclubs. Others spent hours, days, weeks and months helping survivors. These people are heroes in the true sense of the word. Heroes are people we admire because they have performed a brave act. Heroes are people who have acted above and beyond what is normally expected. They have done something bold or altruistic or they have performed heroic deeds.


After the Bali bombing, almost 200 Australians were honoured for being heroes, many of them silent heroes. These special honours were bestowed for acts of bravery in hazardous circumstances; for acts of bravery considered worthy of recognition; for the provision of assistance to victims and to their families; for service in co-ordinating the crisis response for immediate evacuation of Australians from Bali; for assisting in victim identification procedures following the bombings; to members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Bali crisis task force; to members of the Australian Federal Police and Operation Alliance; to those involved in DNA identification procedures for the victims of the Bali bombings; for providing counselling services for victims, their families, and members of the DFAT Bali crisis task force; and for the provision of medical assistance to victims of the Bali bombings.


Many of these people are from Canberra. They were recognised on the Bali honours list, and tonight I would like to pay tribute to them again. Many of them I know from my time in DFAT. I pay tribute to Ross Tysoe; David Chaplin; Ian Kemish; John McAnulty; Timothy Morris; Colin Rigby, who was the DFAT psychologist and who went out on his own after some time in DFAT, providing a wonderful service in Bali and for all the DFAT employees throughout the world over many years; Alex Bartlem; Julie Brownrigg; Robert Cameron; Stephen Candotti; Craig Chittick, who I know well, a wonderful man living in Sydney; Susan Cobley; Kirk Coningham, a very good friend of mine; Susan Cox; Christopher De Cure, another friend of mine; Donald Evans; Francis Evatt; Mark Fraser; John Godwin; Brent Hall; Rebecca Hamon; John Janssen; Kim Lamb; Janette Lynagh; Elizabeth Morris, who I also worked with in DFAT; Charles Muller; Mark Pearson; Tracy Reid; Jeffrey Roach; David Royds; Thomas Sinkovits; Donald Smith; Ruth Stone; Lorenzo Strano, who I was on a short-term mission with in Indonesia; Timothy Toomey; Edwin White; Linzi Wilson-Wilde; Kenneth Hood; William Jackson; Lisa Paul; Richard Smith; Colonel Neil Thompson; Warrant Officer Julie-Anne Willes; and, finally, my beloved and dear friend Liz O'Neill, who is no longer with us; she was, unfortunately, killed in the Garuda fire many years ago, and I have spoken about that in the House many times. So, to all those fabulous public servants, who are quite often silent heroes, I pay tribute. I also pay tribute to those families and friends who lost loved ones in the Bali bombings, and anyone who has lost a loved one through an act of terrorism.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (20:58):  I rise to support the motion by the Leader of the Opposition regarding Australian victims of terrorism attacks overseas. The Leader of the Opposition first introduced a private member's bill in February 2011 and has since attempted to amend the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2012 to provide assistance to all Australians who have suffered at the hands of terrorism since 10 September 2001. They reflect the importance of supporting the struggles that such victims face in putting their life back together. As the motion notes, these victims have not been entitled to the same compensation that domestic victims of crime receive under state and territory victims-of-crime schemes. Since that fateful day of September 11, 2001, some 300 Australians have been killed or injured in terrorist attacks. Most notably, 88 Australians were killed on 12 0ctober 2002 in attacks that overall killed more than 200 people in Bali's nightclub district. This year hundreds of Australians joined the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to remember those who died.


Although terrorism has seen the murder of thousands across the globe, as Prime Minister John Howard often remarked ultimately what unites us as Australians is more important than anything that might divide us. As I have remarked previously in this House, the aim of terrorism is simple: it is to destroy people's pursuit of a peaceful life. In order to achieve this, terrorists have engaged in horrific acts of violence and manipulation at unexpected times, and, particularly over the past decade, they have shifted society's mindset toward the security of everyday life in unimaginable ways.


As a nation, we must never forget the high price innocent Australians have paid at the hands of terrorists. Although terrorists' actions are aimed to send a message to the state and its leaders, it is the innocent individuals within these states who are targeted. However, because of the nature of terrorist attacks, victims can often be left feeling like just another statistic. The numbers of people who are killed or injured in terrorist attacks are what make the news—the statistics, not the names. Whilst no-one would deny the empathy felt for these victims within our society, news is reported through statistics and through the place of an attack, which, whilst shocking, in a way desensitises us to the suffering and experiences of those who actually lived through the attack. Terrorists attack en masse; yet, at the end of the day, it is the individual and their families who must pick up the pieces.


The motion before us today, as with many motions and bills introduced by the Leader of the Opposition previously, recognises the very real consequences of terrorism, and will go some way toward helping individual victims of overseas terrorist attacks. For many there is no going back to the way things were; they must rebuild a life for themselves after losing what is perhaps the last bastion of innocence—the belief that you are safe. For a terrorism victim and their family, the fact that they were part of an attack when simply going about their own business, and the knowledge that these terrorist groups, and terrorist mentality in general, are still out there, would be almost crippling.


These victims need to know that their government supports them—not just on a global stage and not just as a nation opposed to terrorism, but supports them personally and individually, and that is what the Leader of the Opposition's motion is all about. We have all stood in this chamber and spoken about the importance of supporting Australian victims of terrorism. Yet this Labor government continues to say that, as a nation, we are not willing to help those who have suffered in some of the worst terrorist attacks the world has experienced.


It continues to make no sense that the government has not made this positive, helpful and necessary legislation retrospective in order to support victims of past terrorist attacks while it has introduced other retrospective legislation that has had a negative impact on our society and economy. Here we are today, more than 10 years on from the Bali bombings, with this Labor government introducing taxes such as the Minerals Resource Rent Tax—a tax designed to raise billions of dollars a year from mining companies but which to date has raised zero dollars—and yet not supporting this inexpensive but very important and significant measure.


The victims of past terrorist attacks need our support just as much as future ones will. I implore the government to give them hope, and support the Leader of the Opposition's motion.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (21:03):  I rise in support of this most important motion. It is often said that the world is a different place since September 11, 2001, and in many ways it is, although terrorism has been used as a political weapon across the ages. Who can forget the victims of violent political activism such as the Munich 11 or those lost in the genocidal acts in Western Africa or Eastern Europe? From Mumbai to Chechnya, Sharm el-Sheikh to Dublin, terrorism has been used to instil fear and terror into the innocent civilians who are unfortunate enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Terrorist attacks are designed to target the innocent in an attempt to shatter civilisation as we know it and implant fear to a degree not otherwise imaginable. Terrorism is the personification of evil. It is as low an act as one human can carry out against another.


As the member for Higgins, it is my solemn duty to remember Leanne Whiteside, a lawyer from Prahran who perished in the South Tower in the 9-11 terrorist attacks. Leanne's story is not too dissimilar from my own, as a young, female lawyer trying to forge a professional career. Accepting the opportunity of a lifetime, Leanne moved to New York, only to become the victim of a deliberate attack, a deliberate act of violence and extremism. This event horrified us.


Of course, things really struck home when, on 12 October 2002, three separate bombs were detonated in a coordinated attack throughout Kuta in Bali. In what was—and, to this day, still is—the worst terrorist attack in our short history, 88 Australians were slain in the most random and brutal way. A total of 202 people lost their lives on that day. On 12 October 2002, Australia lost innocence. We, as a nation, realised that we were not immune from extremism and from some of the more horrific aspects of human nature.


The pain and mental anguish of those that survived the horror is immense and enduring. I would like to tell you the story of Mr Lawrence Kerr. Mr Kerr is a constituent of mine but was originally from Perth. Mr Kerr travelled to Bali with his local football team, the Kingsley football club, on an end-of-season trip. This was meant to be a jubilant time of year, a team- and morale-building exercise. But the decision to go to the Sari Club on that night changed everything. Nineteen men embarked on that trip; only 13 returned.


Since he returned from Bali, Mr Kerr has suffered from not only his physical injuries but mental ones as well. He has suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and the eventual loss of his business, which he had been running for 10 years. Mr Kerr's ambition to seek employment means that he will not take the disability pension that he is entitled to, rather opting for the Newstart program so that he can still be part of the workforce. Mr Kerr feels that he has been badly let down and that other people who are also victims of terror have been badly let down.


As a member of the coalition, I am proud to support the Leader of the Opposition in supporting a compensation package for domestic victims of terrorism overseas. It is inconsistent logic to say that an Australian is not entitled to compensation as a victim of violence purely because the incident occurred abroad as opposed to in Australia, and insincere not to include those that have been the victims of some of the worst attacks on the Australian people—namely, September 11, the Bali bombings, the London and Jakarta bombings, and the Mumbai terrorist attacks. The announcement that the Leader of the Opposition has made brings into line the level of assistance provided to domestic victims of violent crime for both future and past victims.


The government recently spent $75,000 on coffee machines. This is one part of compensation that could be paid to victims of terror. One has to wonder about the priorities of this government.


Although no level of compensation could adequately compensate for the trauma that victims of terror endure, hopefully this gesture will provide just a little bit of hope that these people so desperately deserve. That is why I support this motion.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-10-29,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (21:08):  To some it might appear a little bit shabby that we are engaged or enjoined in a debate over whether or how we provide assistance to those families of people who have been touched by the tragedy of being a victim of a terrorist incident. But the truth is that the debate we are engaged in is not about whether we provide assistance but how. Tragically, since 11 September, 2001, over 200 Australians have been injured and more than 100 killed in overseas terrorist incidents.


Significant targeted assistance has been provided to victims of those events, including through the Disaster Health Care Assistance Scheme, by way of ex gratia assistance, consular and repatriation assistance, and immediate short-term financial assistance through the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment.


It is true that, until the government moved legislation through this House a few weeks ago, our response as a nation in providing assistance to these victims has been somewhat ad hoc—and I make no criticism of either those members opposite or those members on this side of the House. I believe that, when we see the images of terrorism and victims of terrorism brought home to us, into our lounge rooms via television screens, it is only then that we start to focus on the issues that are subject to the legislation, which was moved by the government a few weeks ago.


It is true that, under the previous government and for several years under this government, there have been ad hoc approaches. That does not mean that that side of the House or this side of the House is any less caring or any less genuine about its sympathy for the victims. What it does mean is that we now have a process through the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, and through other areas of assistance, to provide generous financial assistance to those injured and the next of kin of those who were killed in the 9/11 attacks, including Australians.


Under that compensation fund, payments of between $250,000 and $7.1 million were made to the next of kin of six Australians killed in those terrible attacks. Retrospective application of the scheme would effectively duplicate assistance that has already been given through that compensation fund and through the other areas of assistance that I have already alluded to. Calls by the Leader of the Opposition, however genuine—and I believe they are genuine—to apply the government's financial assistance for victims of terrorism scheme to victims of past incidents are inconsistent with the position the coalition took when they were in government. In relation to September 11 and the Bali bombings, those opposite made decisions about support and assistance for those victims. I can only assume they made those decisions based on the best information that was available to them at the time.


The support provided to past victims drew on a number of existing measures, including the Disaster Health Care Assistance Scheme, ex gratia payments, consular and repatriation assistance, and immediate short-term financial assistance through the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment.


This government has taken action by implementing a scheme which will ensure that assistance and support provided to Australians affected by terrorism overseas or who are victims of any future attacks is appropriate and sufficient. The Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Act 2012 was enacted for that purpose. It provides for financial assistance of up to $75,000 to Australians who are harmed by an overseas terrorist act and to Australians whose close family member or members have died in an overseas terrorist act.


As has been mentioned by previous speakers in this debate, there is nothing that we can do by way of financial payments which will serve to ease the pain and suffering of those families and those close to the victims of these terrible attacks. The $75,000 or the payments through this scheme of up to $75,000 are designed to provide some financial assistance in their hours of need. (Time expired)

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (21:13):  Australians and our interests overseas have been targeted by terrorists on more than one occasion. I remind the House that 11 Australians were killed in the September 11 2001 attacks in the US. In fact, earlier today we offered our condolences on the commemoration of the 10-year anniversary of the Bali bombings where 202 people were killed, 88 of whom were Australians. What that means is that, regardless of what is happening in the world, regardless of our foreign policy decisions, there are going to be terrorists that see value in attacking Australians. While I say value, some of them may see political or publicity value in killing Australians, but others may just have a pathological hatred of anyone who could be seen as representing western liberalism.


The reality is that terrorism is now almost exclusively the practice of radical Islamic groups or Islamists. They seek to expand a way of life and the political system of a religion that degrades the place and opportunities of women, that promotes medieval laws and that restricts freedoms that we hold dear. These Islamists are offended by our actions in Afghanistan, by our support for Israel and of course by our alliance with the US. Regardless of any of those foreign policy matters, they are offended by our refusal to become Muslim, by our consumption of alcohol and probably countless other sins.


While the apologists on the Left in this country may rationalise and even excuse terrorist attacks on Australians as resulting from our 'terrible' actions in places like Afghanistan, the reality is that the Islamists find fault with anyone who does not adhere to the same religious fanaticism that they do and anyone who lives in the decadent West. The truth is that Australians will be targeted in the future by these enemies; and turning the other cheek or embracing them, out of some misplaced view of seeking empathy and understanding, is pointless and a betrayal of this nation. The point is that while there are Islamists there will be terrorism and while there is terrorism Australians and all people from liberal Western democracies will be targeted. The outstanding efforts of ASIO here and the security agencies of other nations combine to help detect the threats, but overseas we cannot always expect the terrorists to be stopped and therefore we cannot rule out that there will be more Australians killed or injured such as at the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta.


Beyond countering the threats, it is therefore important that we have had the capacity to respond when they have taken place. I am talking about not just the highly successful efforts of the Howard government in 2002 but now also the ability to provide financial support for the victims. In June 2012 the House debated the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2012. The government brought that bill in to counter the private member's bill of the Hon. Tony Abbott. The trouble with the government's bill was that it was not retrospective and therefore would not assist those that had been in previous attacks. I of course hope that every future attempt by terrorists to hurt Australians will be interdicted by security forces and stopped; but, just as has been the case with the attacks in Bali, Australians affected have been left with having to deal with the effects for the rest of their lives. That should be acknowledged and retrospectivity applied for these past victims.


The government's attempt at social security for victims of terrorism overseas excluded one of the most important aspects: declarations to give assistance to actual existing victims of terrorism. I join with the Leader of the Opposition to call on the government and the minister to make a declaration so that the families of the 300 Australians killed can get this modest but important payment. As said earlier, we are talking about only $30 million, which is fairly modest in the scheme of Commonwealth government spending. This is the least a decent nation can do for the people who have suffered. Many victims and family members of victims of overseas terrorism have suffered not only financially but also, in a large number of cases, physically and mentally.


This private member's motion is in response to the coalition's recognition of the need for a federal scheme to offer financial assistance similar to that which is currently available to local victims of crime under state and territory schemes. This financial assistance is usually up to $80,000 and, as we heard from the Leader of the Opposition, it is not specifically to compensate but, rather, to recognise the suffering that the victims have incurred. As I stated, the Australian victims of overseas terrorism suffered because they were Australians; they were targeted because they were Australians. This is not a political issue, it is a personal issue. If financial assistance is okay for those who will suffer from terrorism overseas in the future then it should be right for those who have suffered from overseas terrorism in the past, and continue to suffer, to also be provided for. 


Debate adjourned.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (21:19):  It is indeed an honour to stand here in this House as a federal member of parliament; it gives me the opportunity to represent my electorate on so many issues. But each member's family pays an enormous sacrifice for the service we members give to this place. The strength that families give us is testament to who we are. My family, and the strength of the family unit, is what makes me who I am. I am very proud of the family unit that I have at home. I do not think I would be a federal member of parliament if it were not for my wife's strength of character. Being a politician gives me the opportunity to speak on numerous topics and to thank and give accolades to those in my electorate who deserve praise. But as politicians we often overlook the humble simplicity of the family unit that we have at home. You do not realise what you have got until it has nearly gone. My wife had a bit of an accident, and it made me think about what life would be like without her.


My wife and I have a daughter, Grace, who is 16. She is a great kid. Don't get me wrong, some days you could tie them to a post and throw rocks at them—anyway, she is a good kid. She is heavily involved in the equestrian arena. She competes in the Olympic discipline of the three-day event, which is show jumping, dressage and cross-country. She was fortunate enough recently to make the Queensland squad for that event and a couple of other events. She competed against the best riders from all around Australia, from every state in our nation—for example, Western Australia sent a delegation of 40 riders. I am a proud father because my daughter competed against the best of the best and came first in the nation for the event called the three-phase, for which I am eternally proud. Subsequent to that, she also came third in the nation for her pet event, the three-day event, the Olympic discipline that she competes in. I hope that one day soon she will give it away. I would like her to take up hockey—because the capital outlay for hockey is about $15 for the stick, while the outlay for equestrian sport, her chosen discipline, is far more expensive.


In getting here in my business career my wife was a tower of strength to me—not a tower of strength with corporate knowledge or direction, but every time we grew our business, from a mum-and-dad show through to having 14 depots around the state and over 105 permanent staff and contractors, each time I would go home and say, 'Right, it's time to pack up. We've grown this. We need to move on and build in another town,' I never got any heat or static from her. It was, 'Yep,' she would pack up the house and onward we would move. I never want to take for granted the capital that my family have in this game as well.


For all of the parliamentarians that are in here I would suggest that it would be advantageous for all of us to recognise the contributions and the sacrifice that each of our families make that make us who we are. We spend 20 weeks a year, plus our committee work, down here. Ultimately, our families pay the ultimate sacrifice for the time that we forgo being with them so that we can represent the members of our electorate and their values. Tonight I would just like to dedicate this speech to Australian families and the strength of the family unit and to encourage each of you to acknowledge your families from time to time, because they do pay the ultimate price.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (10:30):  Since my election in 2010, I have had the privilege to meet a variety of community groups and their members. There are hundreds of community groups throughout my electorate of McPherson, and each does a wonderful job in representing the community and fostering the community spirit that is alive and well on the southern Gold Coast. It is what makes the southern Gold Coast such a wonderful place to live.


Arguably, one of the most prominent groups in any community is the local bowls club. Lawn bowls is, most certainly, a popular sport throughout Australia with over 830,000 bowlers in 2010 of all ages and from all backgrounds. In my electorate alone, we have five bowls clubs: the Coolangatta Bowls Club, Tugun Bowls Club, Burleigh Heads Bowls Club, Mudgeeraba Bowls Club and Robina Bowls Club. Each of these clubs has a very special place in the local community. Today I would like to speak about two in particular—firstly, the Tugun Bowls Club and, secondly, then the Burleigh Heads Bowls Club.


The Tugun Bowls Club was founded in 1967 and this year it celebrates its 55th anniversary. To date, the Tugun Bowls Club has over 1,100 playing and social members. I recently had the privilege of joining the club to celebrate the birthdays of a few very special members. Any member who reaches the age of 80 is given the title 'super veteran'. Those over the age of 90 become 'patriarchs' of the club. Last week, it was certainly my privilege to present Don Oake, Herbert 'Herbie' Wood and Brian Stewart with their super veteran's badges to commemorate their 80th birthdays. I was also there to congratulate Vic Groves on his 90th birthday and on becoming a club patriarch. Vic joins Ollie Hackel, Boyd Richards, Jack Harrison and Les Commino as active patriarchs of the club. I would like to congratulate each of these people on reaching that fantastic milestone and I wish them many more happy years of bowling to come. 


The second club I wish to speak about today is the Burleigh Heads Bowls Club, which is located in James Street in Burleigh Heads. Many on the southern Gold Coast—and many visitors to the Gold Coast—would be very familiar with the club, which has a prime position opposite the beautiful Burleigh Beach. This club recently celebrated its 75th anniversary. It was founded in 1937 and it is certainly an iconic landmark in the area. I wish the club, and all of its members, all the very best. I look forward to being there to celebrate their 100th anniversary. Both of the clubs certainly have the support of the community, they regularly contribute, and I commend them for their work.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-10-29,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (11:00):  The science and research community have been holding their breath recently. Numerous programs were paused as the government looked around for ways to achieve a politically motivated surplus. This comes on the back of previous years where there were threats to health and medical research grants, in particular, that would have disproportionately impacted on my home state of Victoria, and the electorate of Melbourne, which is home to some world-leading health and medical research facilities, as well as generally excellent research institutions. 


Unfortunately, as we have seen recently from MYEFO, a deep cut was made to research funding for universities—$499 million from the Sustainable Research Excellence in Universities scheme over the next four years. That is half a billion dollars. The SRE scheme was announced in 2009, and is designed to help universities pay for costs associated with doing research: water, electricity, property costs, IT and other infrastructure. These cuts will come into effect almost immediately, with a $79 million decrease in payments in 2013. This approach from Labor to funding research in Australia is short-sighted. While the money for research grants that directly supports people and projects has been maintained, the funding for the infrastructure that enables this research has been slashed. 


When you talk to researchers, they will tell you that this infrastructure funding is critical. It is what keeps the researchers in their job, and able to do their job. When one goes to the private sector or to philanthropists to ask for money, researchers will tell you that it can be notoriously difficult to get funding for this kind of infrastructure, perhaps because it is not as attractive or sexy as funding a direct research cure, but it is essential, because, without it, the research does not take place. 


The Group of Eight, which represents some of Australia's leading universities, believes the research cuts will result in the loss of around 1,450 job opportunities. The University of Melbourne, one of the most research intensive institutions in the country, will lose between $90 million and $100 million over the next four years, and 200 planned jobs may have to be abandoned. This is coming straight from the people who are directly affected. As the University of Melbourne Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research, Jim McCluskey said: 'Victoria is a very research intensive state. We are disproportionately hit.' 


Professor Hilmer has said, 'These short-sighted decisions will have adverse long-term consequences for Australia’s performance internationally in research, and will also adversely impact on Australia’s economic capacity and make our universities less attractive to international students and researchers'.


Professor Daine Alcorn, Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Vice-President, Research and Innovation at RMIT, said that the cuts were 'devastating':


This is what provides support for the overheads – the electricity, the water, the space you live on – for all of these programs. Cutting $499 million over the next four years is really taking back a promise the government gave to actually fund this kind of research in an appropriate way. It will have a devastating effect.


Research is an investment, not a cost. There are serious economic, environmental and social benefits that come from investing in Australian research. Every dollar that goes towards health and medical research, for example, results in more than two dollars in health benefits. The economic benefit of government investment in the cooperative research centres has exceeded a return ratio of three to one. When the government paused all grant funding, many researchers worried about their jobs and the future of their work. The situation has been particularly discouraging for young researchers who are struggling to establish their careers, and many have already begun to look overseas for more attractive job offers.


If we treat research in this country as a funding tap that can be turned on and off, then the benefits will not grow and our best and brightest will not stay. And if we treat it as a honeypot to be raided every time we need to find money to bring forward a political surplus, then confidence in the sector will suffer. We have seen today the welcome release of the government's Asian century white paper, which has references all through it to innovation and research and how we are going to position ourselves over the next 20 years. But we will not do that unless there is secure funding that researchers can rely on, not just from year to year but from three years to three years and five years to five years. If we are put in this position, where every time there is a need to come back to a politically motivated surplus it puts researchers at risk, then we as a country, and especially as a state in Victoria and a city in Melbourne, will suffer.


The Greens value research. The Greens will defend research. I am pleased that this motion will attract the support of others in the parliament. The government should quarantine research from cuts over the next few years.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (11:05):  I rise to second this excellent motion and concur with what my colleague from Melbourne has said in his speech. In this country we have three choices. First, we can provide the right research framework that will encourage talented researchers and innovators who are home-grown, as well as those from overseas, to work in Australia delivering economic benefits for Australia and better healthcare for Australians. Second, we can bury our heads in the sand and pretend that we do not need a plan or additional funding to keep the research sector punching above its weight and globally competitive. Or, third, we can threaten to cut funding to the health and medical research sector on a regular basis, creating uncertainty and insecurity for jobs in the investment; we can play games with existing funding by freezing and unfreezing funding for such things as the NHMRC grants; we can add layer upon layer of additional red tape to the already significant regulatory burden, as evidenced by the increased time and money required to implement a clinical trial in Australia. Sadly, the government has taken the third approach.


Research, and in particular health and medical research, is, as the McKeon consultation paper so accurately puts it:


… vital to support innovation, performance improvement, and curtail escalating healthcare costs.


This consultation paper goes on to point out that the economic benefits also flow from:


… productivity gains that accrue from having healthier people in the workforce and community, and wealth creation from research commercialisation and associated employment.


The coalition understands the importance of this. There was a fivefold increase in funding committed to health and medical research under the previous coalition government.


According to the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes we are currently ranked as one of the top countries in the world in biomedical research, producing three per cent of the world's published research, but this is all now at risk. At a time when the McKeon consultation paper states that within the next 10 years we ought to be investing $2 billion to $3 billion more per annum in research, the government has just ripped an additional $1 billion out of research and university funding. I would like to quote from one university, which has written to me and said:


The effects for the university sector however are alarming as the reduction in money available for research will have downstream effects on our campus, which is an integrated health research precinct consisting of a hospital, a medical research institute and a university department—all working together to improve health outcomes for children.


In addition, we rely heavily on research higher degree students and the reduction of funding to students will be detrimental to the research outcomes of our campus. We are very concerned about how this reduction in funding for research will play out, especially in light of the recent McKeon review calling for a massive increase in health and medical research funding.


I have also received correspondence from other research institutes and medical research bodies and I quote from another:


We are concerned that the $1 billion cuts to projected research and university funding announced by the Australian government in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook statement will affect the maintenance of the excellent standards of medical research in Australia.


This is just a small sample.


Addressing the Australian Innovation Festival, the Prime Minister talked up innovation as being one of the keys to increasing productivity, sustaining our international competitiveness and improving our standard of living. I agree with her on this. She went on to say:


The tertiary education system has a central role in the Australian innovation system; Universities, the CSIRO and Cooperative Research Centres have a dual function of knowledge creation through research, and knowledge diffusion through teaching or consulting to business.


The question then has to be asked: why has the Prime Minister ripped out $1 billion from universities in the latest MYEFO update?


How does the Prime Minister reconcile her actions with her words? Without medical research, we would not have such lifesaving innovations as penicillin, first used as a medicine by the Australian Nobel Laureate Howard Walter Florey. Nor would we have the bionic ear, the cervical cancer vaccine or spray-on skin for burns—just to name a few.


It is a shame that this motion was not able to be brought before the House prior to last week, prior to the release of MYEFO, prior to the $1 billion of cuts that this government has announced to try and paper over the economic incompetence that has led to over $150 billion in net debt. 


Medical health and research, and Australians for generations to come, should not have to pay the price for such incompetence. Research is critical to our future in this country; it is critical to innovation. In Victoria, we are very fortunate to have such a hub of institutes focused on doing this important research, and that needs to continue.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2012-10-29,"



Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (11:11):  It is a privilege and a pleasure to stand in the chamber today to speak about an area of government endeavour that I think is incredibly important to the future of our nation, and that is science and research. It is unfortunate that we are in a situation where the arguments being put are going to be at loggerheads, but the fact is that it is an area about which there should be more debate in this parliament. 


Scientific research involves endeavours that try to create an economy that is smart, that provides jobs for the future, that provides jobs which are of high quality, that provides the opportunity for people to realise their capacity and that ensures Australia remains at the forefront of research internationally. These are all important goals. I guess the question is: how do we get there? And I think there are other questions, such as: where have we been, and what does that say about the way forward into the future? 


In terms of the motion moved by the member for Melbourne, I cannot do anything other than agree wholeheartedly with his point (1), which:


… affirms that science is central to our economy and prosperity and that government investment in research is central to maintaining and growing Australia’s scientific capacity;


That is an absolutely central part of what needs to occur with respect to scientific research and investment into the future. But I guess this is where we will start to differ. The questions then are: how do we do it, and what has actually been done? When we talk about the question of what will be occurring into the future—and mention was made of MYEFO and the announcement made by the government at that time—we can say that there have been some adjustments and that some of those adjustments have led to, if you like, cuts into the future with respect to what was projected to be expenditure in some of these areas. What we firstly need to understand is: let us not gild the lily here. 


Scientific research is expensive. It is expensive because it is important, and it is expensive because it goes to the question of expending now in order to make excellent and important discoveries into the future. Sometimes that expenditure will, on the face of it, be large; but it is important. On the question of what has been occurring around funding—and here I pick up on points made by the member for Higgins—I will go to a recent press release from the minister responsible, Senator Chris Evans, where he says: 


This Government has invested more than $43.2 billion in core university funding from 2008 to 2011—that's a 50 per cent increase on the previous four years under the Howard government.


In the four years from 2012 to 2015 we will invest a further $58.9 billion—that's $30.1 billion in additional funding for universities, more than double the level of funding under the last four years of the Howard government. 


So when we look to the question of what has been done in this area, we can say firstly that this government has an exceptional record with respect to funding for the university sector. It has an exceptional record in terms of supporting research. Is there more that can be done? There will always be more that can be done in this area. Frankly, from my point of view, there will always be more that should be done. But I think we also have to acknowledge what has been done and what is being done. And so, from that, I again quote the minister: 


Close to $880 million in ARC Discovery and Linkage grants and $154 million in CRC grants will support the research effort, ensuring continuity for ongoing projects as well as new investment in key scientific and research priorities. 


The perceived problems in the motion which relate to aspects of what was being talked about as to what might happen have largely not come to pass. With respect to some of the issues around grants being frozen, and the funding for this year and the future has largely been maintained, and that has occurred in very difficult budget conditions. When we look at Sustainable Research Excellence funding—which was mentioned—this year's SRE funding has not changed. SRE funding will be indexed from the 2012 level of $163 million dollars and adjusted upwards to achieve the government's objective of $300 million in 2016. 


The move is forward, the move is upward and the move is onward to ensure that we do put significant support into the scientific and research sector. Can more be done? Yes. Should more be done? Yes. When will that be done? In the years ahead. But there is absolutely no doubt that the commitment of this government with respect to the scientific and research sector is there for all to see. When we look at the record of the previous government, we can show that in fact what they did then was nothing like what they said they would do.

"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Dr WASHER
 (Moore) (11:16):  I rise to speak on Labor's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook decision to freeze funding for vital Australian university research and development. I particularly draw attention to the short-sighted, cynical political decision to withdraw or freeze funding for university, medical and academic research on which this country totally depends to underscore its reputation as a bright country, not just a lucky country. 


This government tries to justify huge undisclosed taxpayer subsidies to the motor vehicle industry as it throws away a smart future for this country. The car industry here is no longer viable and needs to reform itself to reflect the reality of global economic conditions and trends, but not at taxpayers' expense. Now this government has ripped $1 billion out of university research and student support funding in a desperate attempt to fill its budget black hole. 


The latest victim of these cuts is the world's leading cutting-edge solar cell technology project at the University of New South Wales. A total of $24 million allocated to this vital new research area has been put on hold indefinitely thanks to the Labor government's obsession with a worthless surplus. This decision to kill university research funding for the vital research on which this country depends for its economic future means the future of hundreds of thousands of young careers are on the chopping block and the birthright of a younger generation who will rely on the jobs that would have been created has been stolen. 


The Labor debt pile is mounting by $100 million a day, excusing the $2.4 billion that has been cut from education and training funding, of which $1 billion comes from university's research and student support. Australia has a unique skills set and is world class in innovation across biotechnology. This field includes therapeutics, devices and diagnostics for human and agricultural use, as well as industrial and environmental technology. 


We excel in engineering, nanotechnologies, IT, telecommunications and manufacturing. Continuity of government funding is an absolute prerequisite because of the high risks and length of time to market. Those options are now being denied to start up, and early stage companies are facing increasing scarce venture capital at early development stage. Fund freezing will delay major programs that are potentially huge revenue winners domestically and at export level. Previous coalition and Labor federal government programs such as the Innovation Investment Fund, R&D Start, Commercial Ready, COMET, Biotechnology Innovation Fund and now Commercialisation Australia have been welcomed by the biotech sector, as well as all areas of innovation. They have played a vital and significant role in ensuring the continuation of innovation in this country. 


The sudden closure of Commercial Ready in May 2008 left the biotech sector—indeed all areas of innovation—without a program for nearly two years, until the Commercialisation Australia program commenced in January 2010. More than six months were wasted because of the funding delay in bringing this program back up to speed. Some companies shut down as a direct result and many jobs were lost. The impact on the sector was significant and damaging. This government has taken from universities and research institutions vital programs such as the Sustainable Research Excellence program, worth $498.8 million. Also, the facilitation performance funding from 2014, worth $270.1 million, will be deferred; student support for masters research degrees at $167 million will be deferred; and start-up scholarships, worth $82.3 million, will be frozen.


Australia's pharmaceutical sector, dependent on institutional or clinical research in this country, is another vital sector affected by these cuts. In 2011-12, exports of pharmaceutical and medicinal products totalled $4.1 billion, up from $3.7 billion the year before. Pharmaceuticals are now firmly established as a high-level export earner, about four times the value of motor vehicle export sales, which continue to fall. Asia takes half of Australia's exports, and industry believes there are opportunities to multiply exports five-fold by 2020. Investment in research has underpinned the improved quality of health care for Australians over the past 50 years and has a fundamental role in improving the future effectiveness and efficiency of the $130 billion health system. An additional dollar spent on research has a multiplier effect by driving efficiency and new practices, compared with an additional dollar spent on general health care. Investment of an additional $2 billion to $3 billion a year on research for the health system is required within 10 years— (Time expired)

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-10-29,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:21):  As my colleague the member for Bruce said a few moments ago, this government has a very credible track record in supporting science and research investment in Australia. The member for Bruce quite properly referred to a media release of 22 October, just over a week ago, from Senator Chris Evans which pointed out that funding to universities has increased by 50 per cent compared to the last four years of the Howard government. In four years, from 2012 to 2015, the government will invest a further $58.9 billion in university funding. I think the statistics tell the real story. Those statistics are indisputable.


Speaking to this motion, moved by the member for Melbourne, I too share the view that science is central to our economy and our prosperity. As a participant of the Science Meets Parliament program each year, and as a frequent attendee of scientific briefings by the CSIRO and other similar scientific institutions here in Australia, I well understand the importance of research and how it is, indeed, a wise investment into our future. Having mentioned the Science Meets Parliament program, I take the opportunity to thank and commend four young scientists—namely, Stephanie Kermode, Sondos El Safar, Lyndsey Vivian and Declan Clausen—for taking the time to meet with me earlier this year and explain to me the scientific work each of them are engaged in. What particularly impressed me was the passion and commitment each of them had for their fields of science.


The motion also refers to medical research. I also take this opportunity to speak about the new South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute complex being constructed adjacent to the new Royal Adelaide Hospital. On 3 August 2012, I represented the federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, in joining South Australian Premier Jay Wetherill and South Australian health minister John Hill for the tree-topping ceremony, marking a significant point in the construction of the building which will be the new home to the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute. Having been given a full briefing and tour of the partially constructed building, it is clear that this will be a state-of-the-art medical research centre that will engage in world-leading research, with the capacity to employ up to 600 researchers. That facility is only possible because of $200 million of federal government funding. That facility will be, I believe, a leading facility throughout the world for research. In speaking to some of the researchers that are going to be working within the building, I know of their excitement and their appreciation of the federal government support for that new facility.


Another similar research facility—again funded by this government to the tune of $40 million—is the new Materials and Minerals Science Building at the University of South Australia in my electorate at Mawson Lakes. The new facility, which Minister Chris Evans opened on 6 August, sets new benchmarks for collaborative learning, research, innovation, sustainability and excellence, and it will complement the globally recognised work of the Wark Research Institute and the Mawson Institute.


Those are two very clear examples of direct funding by this government into research facilities that will be of huge benefit to Australians into the future. Again, they are facilities that would not have been possible were it not for the commitment of this government to research and science.


The third area I want to very briefly touch on is the investment made by this government in many of the science facilities in secondary schools. I can talk about, within my own electorate of Makin, the new science facilities at Para Hills High School, Scoresby East High School, Banksia Park High School, Valley View Secondary School and the Golden Grove joint campus facility shared by Golden Grove High School, Gleeson College and Pedare Christian College. I have been to all of those facilities and I note all of them have multimillion-dollar additions to their schools which will enable science based learning for their students, which is an investment in the future scientific research that will be undertaken here in Australia. In fact, only last week I was at Valley View Secondary School's new electronic technology facility opening where I saw for myself how that school is working very closely, as many of the other schools are, with both the industry sector and the universities in terms of developing science based careers in this country. The member for Bruce outlined some of the contributions made by the government to research but I am aware that more broadly, when it comes to health and medical research, the government is, in fact, maintaining all-time-high levels of funding to the National Health and Medical Research Council in the 2012-13 budget and that the budget commits $771 million to the NHMRC for health and medical research.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (11:26):  I rise to speak on the member for Melbourne's motion. I congratulate him on the words that he has put together in this motion, calling on the Treasurer to 'guarantee that science and research funding will be protected this financial year' and calling on the Treasurer to 'rule out any attempt to defer, freeze or pause' research grants for our science and medical facilities. The problem is that the member for Melbourne has been gazumped by the Treasurer. Only last week we had released the MYEFO, in which we have seen $500 million worth of cuts to our research funding, and it goes further than that. With the freezes taken in, we are looking at about $1 billion worth of cuts that this government has made. Universities Australia have said the research freezes and other cuts would slash $1 billion from our universities. Is this the time when we should be cutting funding given the need for our research and development? I have an interesting quote from Universities Australia chief executive Belinda Robertson:


By reducing research funding we are cutting the very area that provides us with the greatest hope of underpinning long-term industrial diversification and economic transformation.


The chief executive is right. This is not the time for us to cut funding for our research. Why are we cutting it? As the member for Melbourne notes in his motion, it is 'an attempt to achieve a budget surplus'. Those on the other side of this House have not delivered a budget surplus for over 21 years. An entire generation of Australians have not seen a single budget surplus from those on that side. In fact, what they have seen over the last four years are combined deficits of no less than $174 billion—and here we have this latest attempt to achieve a budget surplus which we all know is nothing other than a political charade, a fix, an accounting fudge and a money shuffle by transferring money from one year to the other to come up with what they expect as a $1.1 billion surplus.


What if they were even to achieve this $1.1 billion surplus? We know, following the brilliantly designed mining tax which has failed to raise even one single cent, that they have already spent the money, so we know the surplus has gone and we know it is a fudge but let us take them at their word that they do achieve this $1.1 billion surplus. To undo the damage of the last four years with the $174 billion in deficits they have run up it is going to take us over 120 years to repay, so that is for that $1.1 billion surplus, just to undo the damage of the last four years.


Although government funded research is important, we must make sure that it is targeted to improve the productivity of the nation and to improve health outcomes. We must make sure this research is not wasted. Unfortunately, one of the reasons we are in the budgetary mess that this government has made is the great waste created from their grants program. In the time remaining, I would like to go through a few of the grants that this government has handed out over recent years. We have seen this government hand out a grant for $85,000 for a study of garden statues in Renaissance gardens. We have seen this government hand out a grant for $185,000 to produce a biography on Labor opposition leader Doc Evatt during the 1950s and how his life resonates with modern challenges in a time of global warming. I am not sure what Doc Evatt's life has to do with global warming. We have also seen a grant of $65,000 for a study of who reads books by Thomas Keneally. I myself have read books by Thomas Keneally, but do we really need to spend our research grant money, taking away money from cancer research and from other important areas of research that our economy relies on, on a study of who reads books by Thomas Keneally? And then there is my favourite: a grant of $60,000 for the study of Marxism and religion and the relationship between theology and politics. We need to get rid of these grants and get the focus back on the things that are important to our economy.


Debate adjourned.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (16:06):  I rise to speak on the Law Enforcement Integrity Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Crimes Act 1914, the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, the Customs Administration Act 1985 as well as the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. I wish to note at this point that the overwhelming majority of Commonwealth law enforcement officers are honest, hardworking, good Australians who are dedicated to protecting our communities. However, it is a fact that criminals do target law enforcement officers due to the nature of their work, as they often have access to sensitive information. 


Corrupt conduct can take many forms, including improper association, conflict of interest, abuse of power, fabrication or destruction of evidence, inappropriate disclosure of information, theft and fraud. Some crimes of corrupt behaviour involve committing a criminal offence. However, other kinds of corruption, while not criminal, may still undermine the integrity of the Commonwealth law enforcement agency an officer works for. The coalition firmly believes there should be zero tolerance for corruption in the public sector and we urge the government to take steps towards eradicating corruption, which undermines the integrity of our agencies and their ability to achieve their missions to protect our communities or our borders and as consistent with the high expectations that our community has in these agencies.


Integrity tests are operations designed to test whether a public official will respond to a simulated or controlled situation in a manner that is illegal or that would contravene an agency's standard of integrity. An example of integrity testing includes leaving valuable goods or money at a simulated crime scene to test whether an official officer steals the item. Often false information is put into a database to catch an officer suspected of unlawfully disclosing information. It is important to note that integrity testing is not entrapment or inducement. Entrapment is where an officer is induced to commit an offence they would not otherwise have committed, whereas the aim of integrity testing is to give an individual clear and equal opportunities to pass a test or fail a test. It has been reassured to the coalition that the tests will be carefully designed and will be carried out in a way which upholds this distinction. 


The introduction of integrity testing at the Commonwealth level was recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity on 21 November 2011. In evidence provided to the PJCACLEI inquiry, a number of issues associated with integrity testing were raised, including cost, impact on morale, legal issues such as inducement, and the effectiveness of integrity testing as an integrity measure.


The bill also makes significant changes to ACLEI's jurisdiction. Consequently, increased powers need to be thoroughly examined to ensure any privacy or use and disclosure information issues are addressed appropriately. The Australian Federal Police Association noted in their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, who is conducting an inquiry into this bill, as follows: 


It is commendable that the AFP executive is considering the implementation of an integrity testing regime at a time where there is no known widespread corruption in the organisation. This provides a stark contrast to the oft-cited example of widespread corruption in New York City during the 1980s and 1990s which led Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to commission the Mollen Report. The results of that report led to targeted testing being adopted, and soon thereafter it was consequently in every Australian state jurisdiction including the Northern Territory.


The coalition is off the firm view that for the most part our agencies are not plagued with widespread corruption; however, it is important to ensure that Australia never approaches anything like the levels of corruption seen in New York and other jurisdictions around the world. Eternal vigilance on these matters is what is necessary in our view. 


I now turn to the amendments contained within the bill. The amendment contained in schedule 1will introduce targeted integrity testing for staff members of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service suspected of corrupt conduct. It will increase the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to include CrimTrac, Austrack and other prescribed staff in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The purpose of schedule 2 is to enhance the powers of the CEO of Customs to deal with suspected corrupt conduct and bring those powers into line with powers currently available to the AFP Commissioner and the ACCC CEO. 


I wish to expand upon the amendments in schedule 1, which is to introduce integrity testing for Customs. In their submission to the Senate committee, Customs said that, having regard to the significant consequences of Customs and Border Protections role at the border and controlling the import of prohibited items, including weapons and drugs, access to highly sensitive and classified information and working closely with other law enforcement agencies, the consequences of corruption or misconduct in connection with the service's law enforcement role are very serious. 


It is a shame that this Labor government has not seen fit to couple this legislation with an increase in funding for Customs to help it perform these integral duties, such as a controlling the import of illicit goods. In the 2008-09 budget, Labor cut $58.1 million in funding for Customs cargo inspections. As a result, Customs has been placed under greater pressure and been asked to do more with less, putting Customs officers at risk of being vulnerable to being used by organised criminal syndicates. This year in March, Customs was unable to detect 220 guns which were smuggled into Sydney through the Sylvania Waters Post Office, which is in my electorate of Cook. New Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione called this alleged smuggling operation perhaps the biggest illegal syndicate doing this type of illegal gun trafficking that Australia has seen. However, this Labor government refused to refer this incident to a specific inquiry into Customs or Australia Post, independent of these organisations. Labor refused to ask itself the hard questions about the effects its damaging budget cuts have had on our border and law enforcement agencies. 


How can the Minister for Home Affairs continue to deny that the $58.1 million in funding that Labor stripped from air and sea cargo screening has not contributed to the problems which have been outlined in this place and many others when it comes to goods and other matters being smuggled across our border and into our communities? Air cargo inspections have dropped from 60 per cent under the Howard government to a dismal 8.3 per cent under this government. With these kinds of drastic cuts to cargo screening, illicit drugs and weapons are flowing through with ease onto our streets and into the hands of organised criminal syndicates. The only thing better than an old gun is a new gun. 


Customs in their submission to the Senate committee also noted that this measure was formerly referred to as 'loss of confidence'. This terminology has been changed to better reflect the intent of the legislation and provide assurance to workers and the community as to how this power will be implemented. If Labor were serious about the integrity of our borders, they would stop the spin and look to reinstate the damaging funding cuts they have made to Customs and reinstate integrity to our borders. We take issues of corruption very seriously and support efforts to prevent corruption in Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. Corruption and abuse of power not only threatens Australia's national security but also compromises the trust that the community has in their role. 


The coalition supports this bill in principle and supports measures to eradicate corruption in the public sector. Due to the nature of the wide-ranging amendments, the Senate committee is currently inquiring into this bill and is not due to report until 20 November 2012. The coalition reserves the right to move amendments in the Senate, pending the recommendations of the Senate committee when it hands down its report.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (16:14):  I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution today on the Law Enforcement Integrity Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. This legislation is of particular interest to me due to my membership of the Parliamentary Joint Committee into the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, or ACLEI, and my background in the Australian Federal Police and also the military police. The purpose of this amendment legislation is to add three new aspects to the act. It introduces targeted integrity testing for staff members of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service Officers suspected of corrupt conduct. It increases the jurisdiction of ACLEI to include CrimTrac, AUSTRAC and prescribed staff of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Also, it enhances the powers of the CEO of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to deal with suspected corrupt conduct and to bring those powers into line with the powers currently available to the AFP commissioner and the Australian Crime Commission's CEO.


I have great confidence in the professional standards of the AFP, the Crime Commission and Customs and the ability of ACLEI to control and to be appropriately involved in integrity testing on behalf of and together with those agencies. Given this, I do not think that we have a significant problem in this country but the reality is that where there is information about crime, drugs and government and defence contracts there will always be the opportunity for someone to make money by acquiring that information.


I will start with the integrity testing component of this legislation, which I note was recommended by the parliamentary committee on 21 November 2011. While the majority of Commonwealth law enforcement officers are trustworthy, honest people who take their role of protecting our community seriously, it is a reality that criminals will target law enforcement officers. That is largely due to their access to sensitive information. So there will always be someone who will try to reach out to officers of the Commonwealth to try to subvert them and get them to acquire information for them. Obviously, no-one joins the Public Service or a law enforcement agency such as the AFP with the intention to become wealthy or to seek out opportunities for corruption, but the trouble is there are times when frustration and other pressures might lead somebody to become vulnerable in their employment and it is then that they might be subject to being subverted by criminals.


Corruption can occur in many forms, including improper association, a conflict of interest, abuse of office or power, fabrication of or destruction of evidence, inappropriate disclosure of information, theft and fraud. While not all of these kinds of corruption are illegal, they still have the power to undermine the integrity of the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies and their employees. The definition of integrity testing, according to the Attorney General's Department, is this:


… integrity testing refers to the act of covertly placing an officer in a simulated situation designed to test whether they will respond in a manner that is illegal, unethical or otherwise in contravention of the required standard of integrity. The test must provide the subject with an equal opportunity to pass or fail the test. Depending on its severity, the consequences of failing integrity tests can include disciplinary action, termination of employment or criminal charges.


The joint committee's inquiry received a number of submissions and heard evidence directly from those involved or those who are or will be affected by integrity testing. During hearings, we heard about the classic or baseline integrity test which usually involves a scenario of a lost wallet being handed in to a particular officer and a check to see whether that officer then follows the correct procedures. That is without doubt an example of the baseline of integrity testing. However, throughout the inquiry process the committee truly embraced integrity testing as we moved through our examinations of the Commonwealth law enforcement environment. Employees in this area are exposed to information about criminal matters and a range of other things. Criminal organisations such as bikie gangs would see great value in trying to subvert an officer of the Crown within one of these agencies to try and acquire information from them. It is particularly in the area of information security that integrity testing is going to be required in the future. It is my belief that any person who has the opportunity to access information should, under the right circumstances, have their integrity tested. The Joint Committee on the ACLEI was very fond of the notion of targeted integrity testing, which is when there is reason to look at a person's behaviour and to place in front of them opportunities to make that positive or negative decision. Targeted integrity testing is certainly what the committee was most keen on.


In evidence provided to the inquiry, a number of issues regarding integrity testing were raised, including the associated cost, the impact on morale, legal issues such as inducement, and the effectiveness of integrity testing as a measure of integrity. In reference to the cost, the introduction of integrity testing and enhanced power for the CEO of Customs to deal with corruption will have no financial impact, as the agencies will meet costs from within their existing budgets. It was proposed that ACLEI be provided with additional funding of $1.5 million over two years to support that expanded jurisdiction.


I reiterate that I have great confidence in the professional standards of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission, and Customs, and in the ability of ACLEI to control and be appropriately involved in integrity testing on behalf of and together with those agencies. I do not think that we have a significant problem in this country, but the reality is that where there is information about crimes, drugs, the government and defence contracts, where there is money to be made, there will always be someone who will try to seek that information and thereby gain financial reward. People will always try to reach out to officers of the Commonwealth to try to subvert them and get them to acquire the information for them. That is why we need to have this integrity measures in place—to make sure that action can be taken when there is suspicion of such actions. Similarly, the coalition firmly believe that there should be zero tolerance of corruption in the public sector and we urge the government to take steps towards eradicating such corruption, which undermines the integrity of our agencies in achieving their missions to protect our communities and our borders.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (16:22):  I rise to support the Law Enforcement Integrity Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. As Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement and a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I am very proud that the government has picked up these recommendations that were made unanimously by the committee, as referred to by the member for Cowan. One thing about this committee, at least as long I have been associated with it, is that it has always acted in very much a bipartisan fashion and its recommendations are carefully crafted, as is the case here with regard to strengthening anticorruption and integrity measures within its jurisdiction.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement's jurisdiction initially covered the National Crime Authority, which became the Australian Crime Commission, and the Australian Federal Police. With the changing pattern of activity, the committee has been of a mind for some time that that should be widened to encompass other jurisdictions that equally have access to either sensitive or specific information about operations that could be affected by serious and organised crime. And that is what the bill does; it responds very positively to those recommendations and enacts them—maybe not in full but certainly enough to satisfy the committee that the government is acting to do something specific to give greater confidence in the integrity of our law enforcement agencies.


Part 1 of the bill enables targeted integrity testing. That is something that I know now exists in state and territory police jurisdictions but to date has been foreign to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission.


After having discussions with the various organisations representing police officers, including the Police Federation of Australia as well as the Australian Federal Police Association, their issue was not about targeted integrity testing; their issue was more associated with, if this was just going to be at random, it could be tantamount to entrapment, et cetera, and also it was a reflection on the level of confidence we had in the officers of those authorities. Each of the organisations representing police officers were in favour of targeted integrity testing because, as they indicated, the thing they value more than anything is the preservation of integrity within their profession 


This legislation is not something that contravenes the application of employee rights; it is not something that is seen to be calling into question the integrity of specific officers, other than those who are suspected of acting in such a way that those actions could amount to a criminal charge attracting a sentence of I think it is more than 12 months. This is where the professional standards organisations of the law enforcement bodies already have good reasons to suspect criminal activity is at play, that this would enable senior officers of professional standards sections to go out and target and test the integrity of suspected officers. For those who represent the police profession, this is seen to be a good thing. It is seen to further support the preservation of integrity within law enforcement and also the integrity of all those officers who serve.


There was also a recommendation to expand the jurisdictions that could be subject to ACLEI oversight. Part 2 of the bill deals with that. The recommendation was to extend ACLEI oversight to AUSTRAC, which is the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre; to CrimTrac, which is doing vital criminal mapping as well as computer work which is being used by all states and territories at the moment; and also to Customs and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. These are certainly major changes, and with them obviously there is a change in the work of the Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity in respect of his staffing and also the ability to conduct investigations amongst those wider based agencies.


As I say, this measure will extend ACLEI's jurisdiction, which was previously limited only to the AFP, the ACC and Customs. It is designed to extend the reach of ACLEI to those areas where there is what would be regarded as a potential high level of risk by infiltration of organised crime groups and ensuring that ACLEI is in a position to make all possible endeavours to prevent, detect and investigate suspected instances of corruption.


Part 3 of the bill will also make amendments to the Crime Commission Act 2002, the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. Again, these are vital in terms of implementing the integrity testing regime. The variation of the ACC's act will enable them to now have targeted integrity testing within that organisation.


Earlier this year the government took steps to ensure that ACLEI's jurisdiction was extended to Customs and its staff, and this legislation will now extend that much more broadly. From talking to officers of the AFP, they see this as extending the jurisdiction to all those who naturally fit in what would be considered a law enforcement role. All those organisations which will now, under this bill, be covered by ACLEI undertake, in their own way, law enforcement activity on behalf of the Commonwealth. 


Further adjustments will be made to the Customs Act to allow various activities which are similar to what occurs in the AFP and the Australian Crime Commission—that is, to rules relating to drug and alcohol testing of staff. Further, if a police officer is suspected of a serious breach of integrity, clearly there is no point in having the person wait around—retaining access to vital and sensitive information which could corruptly be spirited off to other areas. So in each state and territory jurisdiction there is what is known as a commissioner's confidence arrangement. This arrangement was also extended to the Australian Crime Commission last year in light of certain activities which occurred there. The government considers it appropriate for the CEO of Customs, in ensuring the integrity of his organisation, to have a similar confidence provision. The bill does not do anything to circumvent the normal industrial rights available to a staff member aggrieved by the employer standing them down. But the arrangement ensures the integrity of the operations of these organisations by ensuring that the person can be denied access to sensitive information by the commissioner—or, in this case, the Customs CEO.


As the minister is here, I will conclude by saying, on behalf of the committee, that it is very gratifying the government has acted so swiftly to pick up our recommendations. It shows that this government is concerned to do everything possible to ensure the integrity of our law enforcement agencies.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (16:32):  I thank all members for their contribution to this debate and for their support for this important legislation. As all members have said in their contributions, the overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers are good, honest, hard-working people—but it is a fact that, because of the nature of the work they do, they can be targeted by organised crime. Because this is a fact, we need to ensure that we have the right legislation and the right frameworks in place to identify corruption where it occurs and weed it out—and to prevent it in the first place. That is why I have brought this legislation before the parliament. 


The bill contains important amendments to give our law enforcement agencies the power to prevent corruption and the tools and powers to weed it out. It contains three key measures. The first is the introduction of targeted integrity testing of Federal Police, officers of the Crime Commission and officers of the Customs and Border Protection Service who are suspected of corruption. Secondly, it doubles the number of law enforcement agencies covered by ACLEI. Thirdly, it strengthens the powers of the chief executive officer of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to deal with suspected corruption. 


This strengthening of the powers of the CEO of Customs includes three things. The first is the power to authorise drug and alcohol testing. The second is the power to issue orders, including mandatory reporting requirements where staff will be required to report suspected misconduct. The third is the power for the Customs CEO to make an order declaring that the termination of an employee was for serious misconduct. I will expand on that third point just for a moment, because I know there have been some concerns raised about the power and whether an appeal right should exist. This is a power which will not be exercised lightly and will be reserved for the most serious cases of misconduct, corrupt conduct or criminal activity. An advisory panel will be established to consider whether the criteria set out in this legislation for the making of a declaration of serious misconduct has been met. 


The panel will then consider and advise the chief executive officer as to whether there is a reasonable basis to terminate employment, and that will include consideration of the following: (1) satisfying itself that the definition of 'serious misconduct' for the purposes of the declaration that has been made; and, (2), if it is having or is likely to have a damaging effect on either the professional self-respect or morale of staff or the reputation of the agency.


Customs and Border Protection Services is continuing to undertake consultation with unions and staff on the administration of this provision. A dismissed employee will be able to seek review of the decision in the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. They will also be able to pursue other claims in connection with their employment or their dismissal, such as unlawful discrimination.


As I said in my second reading speech a few weeks ago, this is the first tranche of reforms that I will bring forward. They are the sorts of things that the former government should have done but did not. More work needs to be done to make our law enforcement agencies more corruption resistant, and I am working on those reforms now and will bring them forward when they are finalised. I commend this important legislation to the House.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (16:06):  I rise to speak on the Law Enforcement Integrity Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Crimes Act 1914, the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, the Customs Administration Act 1985 as well as the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. I wish to note at this point that the overwhelming majority of Commonwealth law enforcement officers are honest, hardworking, good Australians who are dedicated to protecting our communities. However, it is a fact that criminals do target law enforcement officers due to the nature of their work, as they often have access to sensitive information. 


Corrupt conduct can take many forms, including improper association, conflict of interest, abuse of power, fabrication or destruction of evidence, inappropriate disclosure of information, theft and fraud. Some crimes of corrupt behaviour involve committing a criminal offence. However, other kinds of corruption, while not criminal, may still undermine the integrity of the Commonwealth law enforcement agency an officer works for. The coalition firmly believes there should be zero tolerance for corruption in the public sector and we urge the government to take steps towards eradicating corruption, which undermines the integrity of our agencies and their ability to achieve their missions to protect our communities or our borders and as consistent with the high expectations that our community has in these agencies.


Integrity tests are operations designed to test whether a public official will respond to a simulated or controlled situation in a manner that is illegal or that would contravene an agency's standard of integrity. An example of integrity testing includes leaving valuable goods or money at a simulated crime scene to test whether an official officer steals the item. Often false information is put into a database to catch an officer suspected of unlawfully disclosing information. It is important to note that integrity testing is not entrapment or inducement. Entrapment is where an officer is induced to commit an offence they would not otherwise have committed, whereas the aim of integrity testing is to give an individual clear and equal opportunities to pass a test or fail a test. It has been reassured to the coalition that the tests will be carefully designed and will be carried out in a way which upholds this distinction. 


The introduction of integrity testing at the Commonwealth level was recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity on 21 November 2011. In evidence provided to the PJCACLEI inquiry, a number of issues associated with integrity testing were raised, including cost, impact on morale, legal issues such as inducement, and the effectiveness of integrity testing as an integrity measure.


The bill also makes significant changes to ACLEI's jurisdiction. Consequently, increased powers need to be thoroughly examined to ensure any privacy or use and disclosure information issues are addressed appropriately. The Australian Federal Police Association noted in their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, who is conducting an inquiry into this bill, as follows: 


It is commendable that the AFP executive is considering the implementation of an integrity testing regime at a time where there is no known widespread corruption in the organisation. This provides a stark contrast to the oft-cited example of widespread corruption in New York City during the 1980s and 1990s which led Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to commission the Mollen Report. The results of that report led to targeted testing being adopted, and soon thereafter it was consequently in every Australian state jurisdiction including the Northern Territory.


The coalition is off the firm view that for the most part our agencies are not plagued with widespread corruption; however, it is important to ensure that Australia never approaches anything like the levels of corruption seen in New York and other jurisdictions around the world. Eternal vigilance on these matters is what is necessary in our view. 


I now turn to the amendments contained within the bill. The amendment contained in schedule 1will introduce targeted integrity testing for staff members of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service suspected of corrupt conduct. It will increase the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to include CrimTrac, Austrack and other prescribed staff in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The purpose of schedule 2 is to enhance the powers of the CEO of Customs to deal with suspected corrupt conduct and bring those powers into line with powers currently available to the AFP Commissioner and the ACCC CEO. 


I wish to expand upon the amendments in schedule 1, which is to introduce integrity testing for Customs. In their submission to the Senate committee, Customs said that, having regard to the significant consequences of Customs and Border Protections role at the border and controlling the import of prohibited items, including weapons and drugs, access to highly sensitive and classified information and working closely with other law enforcement agencies, the consequences of corruption or misconduct in connection with the service's law enforcement role are very serious. 


It is a shame that this Labor government has not seen fit to couple this legislation with an increase in funding for Customs to help it perform these integral duties, such as a controlling the import of illicit goods. In the 2008-09 budget, Labor cut $58.1 million in funding for Customs cargo inspections. As a result, Customs has been placed under greater pressure and been asked to do more with less, putting Customs officers at risk of being vulnerable to being used by organised criminal syndicates. This year in March, Customs was unable to detect 220 guns which were smuggled into Sydney through the Sylvania Waters Post Office, which is in my electorate of Cook. New Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione called this alleged smuggling operation perhaps the biggest illegal syndicate doing this type of illegal gun trafficking that Australia has seen. However, this Labor government refused to refer this incident to a specific inquiry into Customs or Australia Post, independent of these organisations. Labor refused to ask itself the hard questions about the effects its damaging budget cuts have had on our border and law enforcement agencies. 


How can the Minister for Home Affairs continue to deny that the $58.1 million in funding that Labor stripped from air and sea cargo screening has not contributed to the problems which have been outlined in this place and many others when it comes to goods and other matters being smuggled across our border and into our communities? Air cargo inspections have dropped from 60 per cent under the Howard government to a dismal 8.3 per cent under this government. With these kinds of drastic cuts to cargo screening, illicit drugs and weapons are flowing through with ease onto our streets and into the hands of organised criminal syndicates. The only thing better than an old gun is a new gun. 


Customs in their submission to the Senate committee also noted that this measure was formerly referred to as 'loss of confidence'. This terminology has been changed to better reflect the intent of the legislation and provide assurance to workers and the community as to how this power will be implemented. If Labor were serious about the integrity of our borders, they would stop the spin and look to reinstate the damaging funding cuts they have made to Customs and reinstate integrity to our borders. We take issues of corruption very seriously and support efforts to prevent corruption in Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. Corruption and abuse of power not only threatens Australia's national security but also compromises the trust that the community has in their role. 


The coalition supports this bill in principle and supports measures to eradicate corruption in the public sector. Due to the nature of the wide-ranging amendments, the Senate committee is currently inquiring into this bill and is not due to report until 20 November 2012. The coalition reserves the right to move amendments in the Senate, pending the recommendations of the Senate committee when it hands down its report.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (16:14):  I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution today on the Law Enforcement Integrity Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. This legislation is of particular interest to me due to my membership of the Parliamentary Joint Committee into the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, or ACLEI, and my background in the Australian Federal Police and also the military police. The purpose of this amendment legislation is to add three new aspects to the act. It introduces targeted integrity testing for staff members of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service Officers suspected of corrupt conduct. It increases the jurisdiction of ACLEI to include CrimTrac, AUSTRAC and prescribed staff of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Also, it enhances the powers of the CEO of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to deal with suspected corrupt conduct and to bring those powers into line with the powers currently available to the AFP commissioner and the Australian Crime Commission's CEO.


I have great confidence in the professional standards of the AFP, the Crime Commission and Customs and the ability of ACLEI to control and to be appropriately involved in integrity testing on behalf of and together with those agencies. Given this, I do not think that we have a significant problem in this country but the reality is that where there is information about crime, drugs and government and defence contracts there will always be the opportunity for someone to make money by acquiring that information.


I will start with the integrity testing component of this legislation, which I note was recommended by the parliamentary committee on 21 November 2011. While the majority of Commonwealth law enforcement officers are trustworthy, honest people who take their role of protecting our community seriously, it is a reality that criminals will target law enforcement officers. That is largely due to their access to sensitive information. So there will always be someone who will try to reach out to officers of the Commonwealth to try to subvert them and get them to acquire information for them. Obviously, no-one joins the Public Service or a law enforcement agency such as the AFP with the intention to become wealthy or to seek out opportunities for corruption, but the trouble is there are times when frustration and other pressures might lead somebody to become vulnerable in their employment and it is then that they might be subject to being subverted by criminals.


Corruption can occur in many forms, including improper association, a conflict of interest, abuse of office or power, fabrication of or destruction of evidence, inappropriate disclosure of information, theft and fraud. While not all of these kinds of corruption are illegal, they still have the power to undermine the integrity of the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies and their employees. The definition of integrity testing, according to the Attorney General's Department, is this:


… integrity testing refers to the act of covertly placing an officer in a simulated situation designed to test whether they will respond in a manner that is illegal, unethical or otherwise in contravention of the required standard of integrity. The test must provide the subject with an equal opportunity to pass or fail the test. Depending on its severity, the consequences of failing integrity tests can include disciplinary action, termination of employment or criminal charges.


The joint committee's inquiry received a number of submissions and heard evidence directly from those involved or those who are or will be affected by integrity testing. During hearings, we heard about the classic or baseline integrity test which usually involves a scenario of a lost wallet being handed in to a particular officer and a check to see whether that officer then follows the correct procedures. That is without doubt an example of the baseline of integrity testing. However, throughout the inquiry process the committee truly embraced integrity testing as we moved through our examinations of the Commonwealth law enforcement environment. Employees in this area are exposed to information about criminal matters and a range of other things. Criminal organisations such as bikie gangs would see great value in trying to subvert an officer of the Crown within one of these agencies to try and acquire information from them. It is particularly in the area of information security that integrity testing is going to be required in the future. It is my belief that any person who has the opportunity to access information should, under the right circumstances, have their integrity tested. The Joint Committee on the ACLEI was very fond of the notion of targeted integrity testing, which is when there is reason to look at a person's behaviour and to place in front of them opportunities to make that positive or negative decision. Targeted integrity testing is certainly what the committee was most keen on.


In evidence provided to the inquiry, a number of issues regarding integrity testing were raised, including the associated cost, the impact on morale, legal issues such as inducement, and the effectiveness of integrity testing as a measure of integrity. In reference to the cost, the introduction of integrity testing and enhanced power for the CEO of Customs to deal with corruption will have no financial impact, as the agencies will meet costs from within their existing budgets. It was proposed that ACLEI be provided with additional funding of $1.5 million over two years to support that expanded jurisdiction.


I reiterate that I have great confidence in the professional standards of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission, and Customs, and in the ability of ACLEI to control and be appropriately involved in integrity testing on behalf of and together with those agencies. I do not think that we have a significant problem in this country, but the reality is that where there is information about crimes, drugs, the government and defence contracts, where there is money to be made, there will always be someone who will try to seek that information and thereby gain financial reward. People will always try to reach out to officers of the Commonwealth to try to subvert them and get them to acquire the information for them. That is why we need to have this integrity measures in place—to make sure that action can be taken when there is suspicion of such actions. Similarly, the coalition firmly believe that there should be zero tolerance of corruption in the public sector and we urge the government to take steps towards eradicating such corruption, which undermines the integrity of our agencies in achieving their missions to protect our communities and our borders.


The coalition support this bill in principle; however, we reserve the right to move amendments in the Senate, pending the recommendations of the Senate committee when they hand down their report.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (16:36):  It is with a very and genuinely heavy heart that I speak to give the condolences of the people of Flinders to the family of Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze. Jordan was 22 years of age when he passed away on 11 October. It was after a vehicle accident on the Holsworthy range on 8 October. His family lives in not just the electorate of Flinders but my hometown. His mother, Kathleen, and his father, Daryl, and his grandmother, Shirley Blundell. I know from one of Jordan's close schoolfriends, Riley Gay, who works in my office, that the family has obviously been devastated and deeply affected by this loss. Riley himself was a close personal friend of Jordan's, and much of what I know about Jordan, who, as I say, grew up on the Mornington Peninsula, comes from Riley.


Sapper Penpraze enlisted in the regular Army on 3 April this year, and he completed his initial recruit training. He commenced his Royal Australian Engineer Initial Employment Training on 11 July. He was training to do some of the toughest things that Australian soldiers can do. Jordan had always dreamed of following in his grandfather's footsteps to join the Army and to become a combat engineer. He was due to graduate and, as I am advised, was living his dream. He was born at Mornington on 15 August 1990. He was a young man. Prior to enlisting in the Army, he lived with his family in Mount Martha and worked with his father. He was educated just down the road at Dromana Secondary College, where he made lifelong friendships and met his partner, Jacinta, with whom he remained until his death. Jacinta, we pass on our deep awareness of the sadness you must be facing.


Jordan enjoyed spending time with Jacinta, with whom he had been for four years. Jordan's partner, Jacinta, said that she and Jordan were planning to move to Townsville together after his graduation. He enjoyed his time in the outdoors. He was an outdoors man, with hobbies that included baseball, scuba diving and motorbike riding. He had a keen interest in technology and computers. His was the youth of a young man on the Mornington Peninsula who enjoyed life, who lived life and who was being his best self.


Most importantly, he looked out for his family and his friends. His quality as a person is exemplified by a very significant event in Sydney while on local leave in Liverpool. Sapper Penpraze and another soldier successfully resuscitated an elderly citizen. Jordan remained with the elderly citizen, maintaining CPR until the ambulance arrived. That was an act of great confidence and great generosity. He had a deep sense of purpose about his role. Although he knew of the dangers, he aspired to become a sapper and to defend Australia. As we know from the latest tragic events in Afghanistan reported just today in the House, this is the most dangerous of occupations; the most confronting of occupations. These are the people who keep our special forces troops safe; that is, they watch the watchers. They keep safe those who keep safe.


He had a deep respect for Australia, for the Australian flag and for Australia Day. He took enormous pride in his country. Jordan was a well-liked and well-respected member of No. 3 Troop. As in all other aspects of his life, he held this stoic determination to achieve what he had set out to do and was constantly involved in self-improvement. That is the story from Riley and from those who knew him.


He excelled at watermanship. He demonstrated the appreciation of watercraft he gained from years spent on the bay at Mount Martha with his family and in his training, he took on a leadership role in this element of his course. Jordan's motto was: 'Do what you want to do and be what you want to be.' He lived this motto as he overcame many obstacles to achieve his goal of becoming a sapper. He was a young man, but he was a wonderfully successful young man. He was training to be an even better young man, serving Australia in the most significant, important, dangerous and courageous of tasks.


Jordan spread his optimism to his partner and to his siblings. He gave them support when they needed it and he encouraged them never to give up. Today, as Kathleen, Daryl, his siblings, and his grandmother Shirley Blundell are all feeling his loss, there is nothing that can replace the gap—there is nothing that can fill that hole. We simply say to you, on behalf of everybody else in Australia, that Jordan was one of so many young soldiers who help to protect us and his story, sadly, has come to pass all too early. We grieve with you, we thank you and we offer you our deepest support.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (16:43):  I acknowledge the words of my colleague, the member for Flinders, who has acknowledged and detailed the concern and the feelings of the general community in Flinders for the loss of a proud son. Certainly, our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers go out to Daryl and Kathleen Penpraze, and of course to his younger brothers, the twins Dan and Jesse, aged 17, and sister Lily, aged 15, and to his girlfriend, the lady who he was in a relationship with, Jacinta Thomas. They will all be trying to come to grips with this loss of a dear and beloved member of their community and their family.


Certainly, they should take pride in the fact that this young man was a high achiever. He had already taken on a challenge that many Australian citizens would shirk at—would blink at, would not be up to or would simply not be interested in because it involves such a hard task, such physical challenges and such risks—just the process of being in a position to wear the proud uniform of the Australian Army and the proud lanyard of the engineers: the black lanyard.


Certainly there is a lot of focus on the casualties that occur in Afghanistan—as there rightly should be—but becoming a member of the Australian Defence Force and acquiring the competencies that are necessary to achieve your professional proficiency carries with it great risk at all times. You strive always to minimise those risks but there is a limit to how much you can do to achieve that. We must prepare our people for the harshest of conditions. We must enable them to survive in the harshest of conditions and to succeed in the nation's endeavours in uniform in combat operations and in some of the most challenging environments on the planet. It would be negligent if we were not trying to make their training and development as realistic as possible while at the same time trying to get the balance of safety right in delivering that professional competency.


Certainly Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze was a high achiever in getting through the difficult training at Kapooka and through his initial employment training as an engineer at the School of Military Engineering in Holdfast Troop—'Holdfast' being the call sign of the engineers. As has been outlined by the member for Flinders, not only was he a high achiever in the courses he conducted as an engineer and through Kapooka but obviously he was someone with a high sense of community commitment and community service, as was evidenced by his rescuing of the elderly citizen. He was able to maintain his skills in first aid. The CPR that was applied actually saved the life of that elderly citizen. We have seen lots of evidence of the capability and achievements of this young man who was community minded. At the service were broader members of the community and the nation at large.


Training is risky. We do lose people. People do suffer injuries. I think about 1,400 incidents and injuries occurred in the last financial year. I saw many of these circumstances through my own career. I have been involved in the aftermath of them and investigations of vehicles that have turned over and helicopters that have crashed—we lost many members in some of those occurrences. Live-firing ranges by their very nature are enormously risky. Over time we have had incidences at pistol ranges, rifle ranges, grenade ranges and the like. I think it is not well appreciated just how many risks there are and how dangerous the very act of being in uniform is for a member of the Defence Force.


I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to not only Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze but also his brothers and sisters of the engineers of the black lanyard fraternity. We should highlight their service at the present time. At probably no other time in history have we relied so much on the engineers to deliver national interests. The engineers have been very hard at work in the north of Australia delivering outcomes and betterment to Indigenous communities. They have been heavily engaged up there. They have also been hard at work in preparing facilities on Nauru and Manus islands in relation to our asylum seeker challenge. As we all well know and we reflected upon this morning in the chamber, they are heavily engaged in combat operations and in the delivery of national objectives in Afghanistan. The risks involved in delivering that outcome have been well canvassed.


They put themselves in harm's way above all others in delivering a safe operating environment for those who follow in their footsteps. It would have been highly likely that Sapper Penpraze would have ended up in the ongoing operations in Afghanistan in the not too distant future. Our engineers are also playing a very significant role in the planning for the draw down of our operations in Afghanistan and will be heavily involved in the execution of that draw down. We rely very heavily in this country on both our construction engineers and our combat engineers, who are second to none in this world in terms of their professionalism, proficiency and courage and what they deliver in terms of outcomes to this nation. I do not think the full story of what they have done, both domestically and in the broader range of national interests that they have been serving, has yet been told or acknowledged.


Today I salute Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze. My heart goes out to his family and we offer our condolences to all those members that I listed. I also acknowledge the wonderful men and women who serve us in the Royal Australian Engineers of the Australian Army.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (16:50):  I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the parliamentary secretary and the member for Flinders. It is indeed a very sad duty to stand in this place to speak on a condolence motion for yet another soldier who has died. 


Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze was prepared to risk his life for his countrymen. This was evident when he joined the armed forces. Sapper Penpraze had only recently enlisted in the Army and completed his Army recruiting training course. He had just embarked on his initial employment training in the engineers. It has been said that Sapper Penpraze had already committed himself to a lifelong career in the Army, with aspirations of reaching the highest ranks. Tragically, this will not be the case.


During a training exercise a truck overturned, injuring 18 soldiers. Sapper Penpraze sustained critical injuries and was transferred to Liverpool Hospital; however, his condition, sadly, did not improve. When it became apparent that Sapper Penpraze would not recover from his injuries, in what must be the most painstaking and difficult decision any family must make, they made the decision to take him off life support. At only 22, his is a life cut short in its prime, another dedicated soldier lost. 


Our nation stands as one as we remember Sapper Penpraze. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family as they console each other in their time of tragedy. We respect their privacy, as they have wished, and let them know here today that the whole nation owes them a debt of gratitude for the sacrifice their family has made.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (16:52):  I rise to pay my respects to Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze in this condolence motion and follow the passionate speeches of my colleagues the member for Higgins and the member for Flinders. Sapper Penpraze was born in Mornington on 15 August 1990. He was educated at Dromana Secondary College. He enlisted in the Army only in April this year. He tragically died in a vehicle accident at the Holsworthy range. He was one of 18 members from the Army school of engineering who was injured in that terrible accident. 


Sapper Penpraze was training to be a combat engineer. He was only 22 years old and he had completed the Army recruit course at Kapooka. In the statement issued by the Australian Defence Force about Sapper Penpraze they said he was well liked, he was well respected and he had a demonstrated commitment to helping others. In their words: '… they saw him complete his work with no reservations or complaints. He would rather take the hard job or the heavy load to spare a mate that was doing it tough.' According to Chaplain Michael Pocklington, Jordan's motto was 'do what you want to do and be what you want to be'. Sapper Penpraze's life is a testament to this motto. 


Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, particularly his mother, Kathleen, his father, Daryl and his partner of the last four years, Jacinta. He never had a chance to live his life to the fullest. But by enlisting in the Australian Army and giving his life in this way, we know that Sapper Penpraze displayed all the characteristics of what is good and great about Australia and our men and women in uniform. Lest we forget.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (16:54):  I rise on behalf of the people of Ryan to join with my colleagues to recognise and remember Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze who tragically lost his life last month. He is one of 18 members of the Army who were involved in a vehicle accident on the Holsworthy range on Monday, 8 October this year. Jordan Ronald Penpraze was born in Mornington, Victoria on 15 August 1990, a short 22 years ago. He enlisted in the Australian Regular Army on 3 April 2012 and on completion of his army recruit training at Kapooka he marched in to the Holdfast Troop initial employment training squadron at the School of Military Engineering on 26 June. On 11 July he commenced his Royal Australian Engineer initial employment training. During his time in Holdfast Troop, Sapper Penpraze demonstrated his quick thinking when he and another soldier successfully resuscitated an elderly citizen while on local leave in Liverpool. Sapper Penpraze remained with the elderly citizen, maintaining CPR until the ambulance arrived.


Sapper Penpraze was a respected and very well liked member of the troop. He was a quiet and stoic sapper who possessed a determination to perform to the best of his ability. He took on all lesson immediately with maturity and a strong desire for self-improvement. His commitment to his section and his mates saw him complete his work with no reservations or complaints. He would rather take the hard job or the heavy load to spare a mate who was doing it tough. It was this selfless commitment to his mates that made him such a respected member of 3 troop. 


Sapper Penpraze was just days away from graduating from the Australian Army School of Military Engineering before the fatal accident at Holsworthy barracks. He was training to go into an engineering division that has paid a heavy price in Afghanistan. He had signed up to defend our country. I acknowledge the support the Defence Force, through the Defence Community Organisation, has provided to Sapper Penpraze's family through this difficult time. I ask them to continue to support his family, friends and colleagues.


Sapper Penpraze's death at Holsworthy is no less tragic than if he had died in action on overseas deployment. This young man signed on in the full knowledge that in serving his country he would be putting his life on the line. Indeed, Sapper Penpraze's untimely death is a sad reminder to us all of the dangerous job the members of our Defence Force undertake, whether on deployment in a war zone or in training at home. To Sapper Penpraze's family, friends and colleagues on behalf of the people of Ryan I extend my sincere condolences. Lest we forget.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (16:57):  Twenty-two-year-old Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze was in a truck which rolled down a steep hill returning from a training exercise. On behalf of the people of Herbert and the people of Townsville I would like to extend my sincere sympathies to his family, his teammates, his unit mates and comrades in Townsville, where there is only one degree of separation—and with Sapper Penpraze this is no different. Our Mayor, Jenny Hill, has a son in the Army who went through basic training with Jordan. Whilst all deaths are a terrible thing, especially that of a young man, to his parents and his family we extend our heartfelt condolences. We know that he chose to go in to a field of service and anyone who puts on a uniform knows that there are inherent risks in that. No doubt his parents were very proud of him as he stood there looking good in green.


To be brave is something I do not know too much about, but he obviously was brave. To be a sapper he would have gone into clear the path for commandoes and this takes a very brave person. As the member for Fadden said, he would go where others literally would walk in his footsteps and this is an act of true bravery and true courage. It is something that should never be diminished. He will be missed, his mates will raise a glass and he will always have a place in the history of our ADF. 


As a representative of the garrison city, I know that Townsville takes its responsibilities very seriously when it comes to the men and women of our ADF. We have a very proud tradition. Recently I hosted the shadow defence minister, Senator David Johnston from Western Australia, at Lavarack Barracks and at RAAF Base Garbutt. To be able to sit down and talk to the guys who have been to Afghanistan and have been to Somalia and to Timor Leste, who have been to the Solomon Islands, to be places where your life is at risk, to be places where your training is taking you there and your training is there to be done. We are the deployable forces for Australia in Townsville. We are the cutting edge. Our training is all about getting to that place. Sapper Jordan Penpraze was not in Townsville, he was at Holsworthy, but his training would have been as pointed and as spot-on as the rest of them. Having spoken to now Major-General Stuart Smith, in training they must get into muscle memory so that when they get into a position where they are under stress it is not so much you have to think, they train until it becomes instinct. When you are a sapper that is what you must do as well. You must jump in there, you must know in advance what you are going to do, where you are going to go, what your actions will be, what your field of vision will be. With those words I say again that Jordan Penpraze will not be forgotten. Another brave man has fallen for the service of his country.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:59):  I rise to add my voice to those who have spoken before me and to pay my respects to Sapper Jordan Penpraze, who sadly passed on 11 October 2012 at Liverpool Hospital from injuries he sustained in a vehicle accident in Holsworthy Army Base. The training incident on 8 October in the rugged bushland of Holsworthy struck home the dangerous conditions our soldiers face at home as well as abroad. As someone who knows from experience, my colleague the member for Fadden described the rigorous training undertaken by members of the Defence Force. This tragic accident brings to the fore the risks associated with the high levels of training our soldiers undertake in preparation for overseas deployment. As the member for Fadden noted, freedom is never free. 


Sapper Penpraze enlisted in the regular Army in April before commencing initial deployment training in July at the School of Military Engineering at Moorebank. At the time of his death he was a trainee combat engineer who was about to qualify as a sapper in the Australian Army. No stranger to hard work, a younger Jordan spent several years labouring as a plumber alongside his father before fulfilling a dream to serve as a sapper in the Australian Army. Sapper Penpraze exemplified all the very best qualities of a young Australian today: hard-working, dedicated to pursuing his dreams of service and service to his country. He was young man devoted to family and his mates. He is now and always will be a member of the Australian Defence Force family. Speaking at his funeral the commanding officer of the School of Military Engineering, Lieutenant-Colonel Alan Hollink, said: 


When Jordan enlisted into the Army he not only commenced a new career, he became part of the Army family. This is a close family with strong bonds, and while Jordan will remain in our hearts and our prayers his parents and partner remain part of our family and you will always be welcome with us at the home of the sapper.


It takes a special kind of devotion to embark upon a career in Australia's armed forces. I remain eternally humbled and grateful for both their service and my responsibility of representing the Defence community of Hughes. They are the bravest of all of us and we in the south-west of Sydney in the seat of Hughes respect their service with great pride. We feel their loss with the heaviest of hearts. Lest we forget.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (17:05):  I rise to offer my condolences to the family and friends of Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze, who died on 11 October 2012 as a result of the injuries he sustained in an accident at Holsworthy Army Base on 8 October. This tragedy is a reminder that service in the uniform of this country carries with it risk. The risk is not only in the terrain of Afghanistan but also in the wide variety of training conducted to develop our military capacities. It is also, as in the case today, when being transported as part of that training.


A Victorian from Mornington, Jordan Penpraze was born on 15 August 1990 and enlisted in the ARA, the Australian Regular Army, on 3 April this year. Having completed his recruit training at Kapooka, he became an engineer and went off to the School of Military Engineering at Casula in western Sydney. It was on 11 July 2012 that he commenced his IETs, as we called it in the Army, or initial employment training. IET is the first specialist training that a soldier gets for the corps to which they have been allocated. In the case of Jordan Penpraze, this was the Royal Australian Corps of Engineers.


The task of the engineers on the battlefield is varied and there is no doubt it can be highly dangerous. These are the soldiers who build and clear. When I was training as a commissioned military police officer in Sydney in 1990, we visited the School of Military Engineering while the IETs were in training there. People like Sapper Penpraze were there building a bridge across the big creek just near the school. It was impressive but clearly dangerous work. Similarly, during the 2000 Olympics the engineers were involved with the searches and were prepared to deal with the nuclear, radiological, biological and chemical threats that might have faced the games. Again, it was high-risk and potentially deadly work. Of course in Afghanistan the threats they have to deal with are the highly dangerous IEDs, or improvised explosive devices, that have sadly claimed so many of our soldiers' lives.


It was therefore into that sort of life of potential threat that Sapper Jordan Penpraze was heading, and enthusiastically. One sometimes wonders why a person would embrace those sorts of threats when one is aware of the risk. The engineer officers I knew did of course look forward to blowing things up. I know that a fun day as an engineer was clearing obstacles or blowing up suspect objects. They also enjoyed building things or, in the case of soldiers, driving the bulldozers. In the case of Sapper Penpraze, we know he specifically liked operating boats and the water based activities.


I would imagine that the thought of these sorts of activities would have been quite an incentive for a young man like Jordan, along with the belief of doing something significant for his nation. In any case, my point is that he knew that his chosen vocation carried with it a level of excitement along with significant danger and risk. He would have known that he would probably have served in Afghanistan before too long. He probably would not have considered that riding in the back of a Unimog truck or a Range Rover at Holsworthy would be the circumstance that would cost him his life but, as we know, any military training comes with risk. I am not aware of any results yet of the investigations being carried out by Defence, Comcare or the New South Wales Police, but the tragic death of this young man should serve as a reminder that care and attention is warranted during all activities and not just on the explosives range, in the operation of plant or equipment or even in the construction of bridges.


In conclusion, I once again offer my condolences to the family and friends of Sapper Penpraze. His death was a tragedy. He is now forever lost to his family and friends. It is also a tragedy in terms of his being unable to graduate from SME and serve his country as a fully qualified engineer. He would have been magnificent, from all reports. Before concluding, I would add that it was in some way fortunate that this terrible accident did not happen earlier in his time at SME, because then he would not have been in Liverpool on local leave when he helped resuscitate a collapsed elderly person. I would like to thank his family again for providing their son in the great and important service of our nation and for raising the sort of person who would, as we know, never walk past those in need. Although he was just 22 years old, he made a significant impact on those in his troop, his friends, family and, as we now know, even strangers. In every way he was the sort of Australian that we should all be proud of. May he rest in peace.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (17:09):  It seems that there have been too many of these condolence motions lately. It is all too recently that we spoke in this place about five young military men who gave their lives in Afghanistan. Despite the fact that we have had many such motions before, it does not diminish the great sadness over loss of life that we share today as we mourn the loss of Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze. So I too rise to offer condolences over the loss of Sapper Jordan Ronald Penpraze, who tragically died from injuries sustained in a vehicle accident on the Holsworthy range on Monday, 8 October 2012. We mourn with his family, his friends and his partner, Jacinta.


Jordan's father, Daryl, said he could not have been more proud of a son who achieved everything he had ever wanted. Mr Penpraze said Jordan had matured greatly during the last six months and grown into a strong young man. Daryl described his son as a 'a good mate' with 'a great sense of humour' who 'never whinged about a hard days work' and said:


… He put his head down and got on with the job.


So that is what his proud dad said. Jordan's grandmother, Lavina Penpraze, said her grandson had been determined to establish his career and had been looking forward to moving to Townsville with partner Jacinta. Jordan had recently told his grandmother, Lavina, that he had never worked so hard in his life. She added:


But he really enjoyed it and decided it was what he wanted to.


She described him as 'a gentle person and a very caring and sensible young lad'. Jordan was from Mornington in Victoria. He had enlisted in the Australian Regular Army as recently as April of this year. Poignantly, he had just completed his final field assessment and had been only days away from graduation as a sapper in Royal Australian Engineer Corps initial employment training when the accident occurred. Sapper Penpraze was described as a promising young soldier who excelled in his training at the Australian Army School of Military Engineering and looked forward to deployment in Afghanistan or beyond, helping soldiers on the move by building bridges and clearing roads of improvised explosive devices and minefields. Jordan had his heart set on a lifelong career in the armed forces. He was, from all reports, exactly the sort of soldier this country needs to defend our nation and support peace and safety around the world.


Jordan maintained his enthusiasm during field training exercises, receiving excellent reports in all field activities. He had a leadership role during this phase of the course on the basis of his previous experience in watermanship. A homegrown hero already, the determined 22-year-old had recently been hailed for quick thinking that helped save a life. While they were on local leave in Liverpool, he and another soldier successfully resuscitated an elderly citizen, Jordan maintaining CPR until an ambulance arrived. Friends and colleagues described Sapper Penpraze as a respected and very well liked member of his troop. A quiet and stoic sapper intent on performing to the best of his ability, he took on all lessons immediately with maturity and a strong desire for self-improvement. Sapper Penpraze's commitment to his section and his mates saw him complete his work with no reservations or complaints. He is described as one who would rather take the hard job or the heavy load to spare a mate who was doing it tough, and it was his selfless commitment to his mates that made him such a respected member of 3 Troop. Sapper Penpraze completed everything he did to a high standard. He excelled at his beloved watermanship, showing his skills with watercraft and a passion for boats.


As a Victorian and an Australian, I want to add that our state and our nation share his family's and the community's deep sorrow at the tragic and untimely loss of a fine young soldier. Our support and our prayers go to his friends, his partner, Jacinta, and his family. Lest we forget.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:14):  It is a tragically sad turn of events that we again stand here to acknowledge the loss of another fine Australian soldier, a soldier who was in training to join his comrades in the fight against terrorism and the pursuit of freedom. A tough price was paid in his training, and that was his life.


Jordan Ronald Penpraze was born in Mornington, Victoria, on 15 August 1990. It does not seem that long ago. He enlisted in the Australian regular Army on 3 April 2012 and completed his Army recruit training at the Army Recruit Training Centre Kapooka; 80 days later marching out, on 22 June 2012. He then moved into Holdfast Troop, Initial Employment Training Squadron, at the School of Military Engineering on 26 June.


Sapper Penpraze died not at war but in training. On 8 October a truck carrying Army personnel rolled during an exercise at Holsworthy Army Barracks. Eighteen men were injured when the multipurpose truck careered off the side of the road and rolled several times, throwing all on board from the vehicle. Sadly, Sapper Penpraze passed away in a Sydney hospital just three days after that tragic accident.


Sapper Jordon Penpraze was a 22-year-old digger training to be a combat engineer, and we heard from the member for Fadden what a great role the engineers do, the sappers do, at times of crisis. They lead from the front. They clear a path so that those who follow can have safety and security. They are the bravest of the brave; the best of the best. Sapper Penpraze was just days away from graduating from his latest round of training and was a respected and very well-liked member of the troop. He was a quiet and stoic sapper who possessed a determination to perform to the very best of his ability. His death is a sad reminder of the hard work and dedication our troops must endure before they face the real conflict on the front line, in the trenches.


Sapper Penpraze's funeral was held on 23 October, a very sad occasion. The military funeral was attended by hundreds of hundreds of family, friends, and colleagues, who came to support Jordan's parents and his partner, Jacinta, and to farewell a good friend, a good friend gone far too soon. Having never reached his goal of a long career in the armed forces, he will be remembered as a fine soldier and a young man who gave his life while in training to prepare to defend our nation and our right of freedom and the freedom of others. And given that he died in training, I think the words of Colonel David Hay, the commandant of Kapooka at the latest march-out, which was held on 13 October, are well worth recounting here in this chamber:


It is an important occasion for all concerned, and I extend a warm welcome to parents, relatives and friends, many of whom have travelled significant distances to be with us—


and that is the Kapooka family: people travel from all over Australia to go to these march-outs, to go and support their loved ones, to go and support Australia's newest recruits. And this occasion was just one of those. Colonel Hay said:


During the past 80 days these soldiers have been trained, led nurtured and encouraged by the staff. Kapooka's long record of achievement is measured by the quality of those who have marched out our gates to become Australian soldiers—


just like Sapper Penpraze—


Our reputation and success rest firmly on the soldiers, the people who fill the positions of instructors and support staff. I acknowledge that, though your efforts come at a personal cost to your families, I thank them too for their enduring support to the recruits.


Today belongs to Army's newest soldiers: and let me focus on you. You now have a title that no-one can ever take away from you. You are a soldier. An Australian soldier. You are the latest to take your place at that long khaki line that stretches forward from Gallipoli, to Kokoda, through Korea to Vietnam, to our current operations in our region and the Middle East, a proud tradition of excellence and success—one that accepts no compromise, one that demands your absolute commitment. So today is a very special day for you: it celebrates continuity as well as change. It is a time to reflect on the achievements of those who have gone before us, who have honoured  the uniform that we wear today—resplendent, with its rising sun badge and slouch hat. They are two of the most revered icons of the Australian nation.


And indeed they are. They are revered, just as is the service of our brave men and women who wear the uniform, whether it be the Army, the Air Force or the Navy uniform. We honour them; we praise them. We should always remember the sacrifices they make. Unfortunately, Sapper Penpraze has made the ultimate sacrifice, in training. May he rest in peace. God rest his soul. Lest we forget. Thank you.

 (Fadden) (18:30):  I rise to honour the service and sacrifices of those Indigenous Australians who served us in past conflicts. In 1985 I was in year 10 at Rockhampton Grammar School and the school sergeant was a man named Jim Gredrick, Warrant Officer Class 1. Jim was an Aboriginal and a proud man. It turned out Jim also fought in World War II, fought in Malaya, fought in the confrontation, was part of the Australian Army training team in Vietnam and of course served with the 3rd Battalion in Korea. He was one of the most highly decorated men I have met and I have known, this great Aboriginal Australian.


Indigenous servicemen and women have made an enormous contribution to our Defence Force, having first been involved in the Boer War as early as 1899. In fact, several Indigenous Australians participated in the Boer War, serving as trackers with mounted infantry units. In the first half of the 20th century non-Europeans were officially barred from serving in our Defence Force, yet in World War I over 500 Aboriginals and a number of Torres Strait Islanders still managed to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force. Indeed, one of my postings in 1994 was on Thursday Island with Charlie Company 51st Battalion Far North Queensland regiment helping to train the largest Indigenous Army unit, 130 Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal soldiers. It was one of the great delights of my life working up there and training those soldiers and leading them on operations. They were first class, they were second to none.


Some might find it strange that prior to 1967, when Aboriginals were officially recorded in the census, many of them served, but they did, and they served well with a great tradition of loyalty and patriotism that all Australians can be proud of. Indigenous Australians have been present in every major fight we have had since the campaigns of World War I. Colour knows no difference in the heat of battle. Having served on operations myself, it does not make any difference what colour the bloke next to you or the lady is; what matters is their capacity to fight, their loyalty, their toughness, their fitness, their capacity to look out for one another. I have served with Tongans, with Fijians, with Kiwis, with Maoris and with Aboriginal soldiers and I am proud to say I have served with some of the finest soldiers I have seen on Earth. White and black Australian soldiers have formed great partnerships as Australians for over 100 years. Many have been decorated for outstanding bravery. Corporal Albert Knight of the 43rd Battalion and Private William Irwin 33rd Battalion were each awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. Others received the Military Medal. Private William Rawlings, 29th Battalion, was awarded his medal for rare bravery in the performance of his duty in July 1917. He was killed the following year.


Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians made an even more significant contribution to Australia's defence in World War II, including my good colleague, our school sergeant Jim Gredrick. Many travelled enormous distances to enlist. Torres Strait Islanders Charles Mene and Victor Blanco joined the militia in September 1939 and transferred to the Second AIF for service overseas, Mene 2/33 Battalion and Blanco 2/31 Battalion and served right through the war including on the Kokoda Trail. 


Reg Saunders, perhaps the best-known Indigenous servicemen, joined up in 1940 and served in the 2/7 Battalion in Libya, Greece and Crete, spending a year on the run after the Germans captured the island. He would later serve in New Guinea when the 7th and 9th Divisions returned home. His story is well known. He proved himself an exceptional junior leader. He was sent to an officer training course and commissioned in November 1944. He was Australia's first Indigenous military officer. 


He enlisted again in 1950 to serve in the Korean War. Captain Saunders, as he was then, led a company of the 3rd Battalion the Royal Australian Regiment in the Battle of Kapyong. He fought beside my good friend Jim Geedrick. With the advance of the Japanese in the Pacific, Indigenous Australians and Torres Strait Islanders found themselves literally in the front line against those who would seek harm upon our nation. It is no surprise as great Australians they served with honour, dignity and great valour. They were extremely important to our success in the Pacific.


The Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion was formed in 1943 to provide additional protection to the powerful invasion opening to the north during World War II. It had some 700 members with the majority being Indigenous Torres Strait Islanders. Indeed, Charlie Company 51st Battalion, the Far North Queensland Regiment that I served with as an officer, draws its strength, calibre, capacity and character from that great light infantry battalion. 


These men made use of their tradition as warriors to make a unique and vital contribution to the war effort. Their knowledge of local reefs and waters proved invaluable to the 2nd Australian Water Transport Unit, as their knowledge proves invaluable to us today. Indigenous Australians continue to make a substantial contribution to the Defence Force. They continue to serve our nation with great distinction. Programs exist now to make greater use of young Indigenous Australians.


We encourage and welcome all who seek a great career in our Defence Force. They have served with great distinction in the past. They have been and are great Australians. It is with great pride that I honour their service and their sacrifice here this evening.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:36):  For most of our nation's history our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been ineligible to vote; however, that has not stopped us allowing them to die for their country. On 29 September 2012 I attended the memorial service at Ipswich Cemetery in Raceview in Ipswich, recognising the service of Aboriginal soldier Trooper Horace Dalton some 56 years after his death. I thank the Ipswich City Council for organising the wonderful service.


Horace Dalton was a trooper in the 11th Light Horse Regiment in World War I in the Middle East. Whilst he fought for the freedom of all Australians he did not enjoy the same rights as other Australians. He was not even considered an Australian citizen. Like many of his military cohort he had to be economical with the truth to enlist—only, at 19, he did not lie about his age, rather, he lied to satisfy the requirement that service people be of substantially European origin.


He served in Egypt from 1918 to 1919 and died in Ipswich in 1956. There was no military funeral for Trooper Dalton. When he returned from war he was not even allowed to attend reunions. I was proud to be part of that memorial service and dedication of his grave which finally recognised his service to his country. The Ipswich City Council, the local RSL, serving military personnel, clergy and members of the Ipswich and wider community came to show their respects. 


Trooper Dalton's 73-year-old son Ken said his father had been a staunch patriot who had felt a duty to defend Australia. In other words, he felt compelled to fight for the rights of Australians that he himself did not enjoy. Ken said his father had been like any young guy who wanted to sign up and help his country. Even though his country had treated him shamefully, he was a proud Australian who was proud of his service. 


Ken gave a very moving speech. He did not pull any punches about what his father had to endure and the depth of the institutional racism in Australia at the time of World War I and in subsequent years. But now his children and grandchildren are seeing the benefits and they are enjoying the rights that he himself did not enjoy. 


The irony was that Trooper Dalton had to sign a statutory declaration saying he had the correct heritage to be an Australian soldier when he was one of the true owners of the land. Mabo would come many decades later. There was a referendum in 1967 and in 1962 they got the right to vote for the first time—six years after he died. 


The recognition of Trooper Dalton is in large part due to the work of Ipswich RSL member Matt Rennie. I thank Matt for his work. Matt had worked to ensure that Trooper Dalton was honoured properly after discovering his grave seven years ago. Trooper Dalton had been buried in an unmarked grave along with 72 other former soldiers at Ipswich Cemetery. His grave now bears a plaque detailing his service. 


It is a shameful part of our history that Indigenous Australians were not recognised for the significant role they played in our armed forces. In spite of the restrictions on non-Europeans entering the war, about 1,000 Indigenous Australians fought in World War I. By World War II there were over 3,000 Indigenous Australians in the armed forces of our country, and many of those people lost their lives. However, it may be the opportunity we have now to recognise the bigotry and racism of mainstream Australia in those days, and to recognise what these men had to endure to fight for the country which treated them so shamefully after they came home.


Serving in the trenches was the first time many non-Indigenous Australians had even encountered Indigenous Australians. This had been a time when Indigenous Australians could not enter a public bar, own property or even vote in an election. The beginning of the end of this electoral and economic segregation did not happen until 1962 and 1967, when we recognised Indigenous Australians as citizens and gave them the right to vote. The Australian Defence Force gave these Indigenous servicemen an opportunity to earn a decent wage. 


Gary Oakley, a curator in Indigenous liaison with the Australian War Memorial, has noted that the ADF was the first equal opportunity employer of Indigenous Australians. When they came home, like Trooper Dalton, they could not attend reunions or share a beer with their mates. Yet Indigenous Australians have participated in every war and peacekeeping mission since this country has been involved. Today, there are 800 Indigenous Australians serving in the ADF and we should be proud of their service historically and contemporaneously.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mr SECKER
 (Barker—Opposition Whip) (18:40):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and may I congratulate you on your exultation for this honoured job that you have had. It is the first time I have actually had the opportunity to be speaking when you have been in the chair.


The 11th of November 1998, one of the Remembrance Days we are talking about, was very special for me, because on that day I had the honour of seconding the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General in my maiden speech to parliament—we had only been sworn in the day before. The former member for Blair, Cameron Thompson, moved that debate before 11 am and, appropriately, the former member for Cowan, Graham Edwards, a Vietnam veteran who lost his legs in action, was given the honour of speaking after the one minute silence. I thought that was very appropriate and I had the privilege to follow Graham Edwards in that speech on that day.


Remembrance Day is a time to pause and reflect on the significant sacrifices made by those men and women who have served Australia in past conflicts. It is a time to honour those who have fallen and to acknowledge that our country is the vibrant democracy it is today as a result of men and women who were prepared to sacrifice everything in order to serve in our armed forces and defend our country on the battlefield. 


Recently we learnt of the very sad and tragic death of Corporal Scott James Smith. Corporal Smith was born in the Barossa Valley in my electorate of Barker. He joined the Army in 2006, was a member of the Special Operations Task Group and was from the Special Operations Engineer Regiment based at Holsworthy Barracks in New South Wales—they are affectionately known as 'sappers'. I take this opportunity to once again extend my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Corporal Smith. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and his fellow soldiers who served alongside him in Afghanistan.


So let us recognise the contributions of our servicemen and women and let us also remember the contributions made by many Indigenous servicemen and women, and that is what this motion seeks to do. It highlights their involvement and ensures that their contributions are fully acknowledged and recognised, because in the past this has not been the case. This motion is also about uncovering the hidden histories of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ex-service men and women, ensuring that their legacy is no longer a silent one. 


It is important that we recognise the contributions of servicemen and servicewomen, Indigenous and non-Indigenous. Some years ago, when I served on the Joint Standing Committee on Native Title, I personally saw on their islands many of their memorials for Torres Strait Islanders who had served in conflicts, which is when I first became aware of their valiant efforts.


As Australians, we have a lot to be thankful for. So much is owed to the good work of our military personnel, from World War I, when, of course, November 11 originated, and World War II to Vietnam, Korea and, more recently, Afghanistan and Iraq. Australia has stood up for freedom and democracy and our military personnel have done, and continue to do, what needs to be done to ensure that Australia and its interests are protected from external threats. Australia is also a country that punches above its weight when it comes to our contribution to defending these principles, and that is worth noting as well. That is a reflection of the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our serving forces. Part of honouring our servicemen and servicewomen involves expressing our gratitude for their service and, on behalf of my electorate of Barker, I say thank you. There are many ways that we can say thank you. We should remember what we have been silent about with our Indigenous servicemen and we say thank you by remembering their stories, we say thank you by maintaining war memorials and we say thank you by ensuring that when our veterans return we see that they are treated with respect and given every support that a nation should provide.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2012-10-29,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (18:46):  I thank the member for Parkes for bringing this motion before us. With Remembrance Day coming up on 11 November, it is a very fitting time for us to acknowledge and honour the contribution of all brave Australians who have sacrificed or are still sacrificing their lives on behalf of our nation. This year I will have the honour of attending two Remembrance Day services in my electorate, one at the regional war memorial in Bigge Park, Liverpool, organised by the Liverpool sub-branch of the RSL. On the same day I will be participate in the Vietnam Remembrance Day Unveiling and Dedication Ceremony at Cabra-Vale Memorial Park. This event is organised by the Vietnamese Community in Australia—with President Thang Nguyen—and the Vietnam Veterans Associations of Australia. While Remembrance Day is a day that we acknowledge and honour all soldiers who served and continue to serve our nation, I am particularly glad that the member for Parkes has specifically acknowledged the contribution of our Indigenous servicemen and servicewomen. Their contribution is great but I am afraid it has gone largely unrecognised over many years. Aboriginal members have played a significant role in the Australian Defence Force but their contribution would have undoubtedly been even greater had those with Aboriginal background not have had to deal with issues of enrolment due to their race. Despite these difficulties and unclear historical records, we know that at least 400 Aboriginal soldiers served in World War I while a much larger group, up to somewhere around 6,000, were involved in World War II. Today, as I know because I checked with the minister's office, there are 550 Indigenous personnel enrolled at the moment with the Australian Defence Force.


A few months ago I attended the official opening of and a smoking ceremony at the Dreaming Gardens at the Middleton Grange Public School located adjacent to the old Hoxton Park airfield. The school has proudly named one of their sports houses after a guy called Len Waters, who was the first Aboriginal fighter pilot for the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II. Principal Hallie-Ann Baxter and the school should be praised for their recognition of this hero. I was personally moved by Len's history of overcoming very difficult beginnings and obstacles to achieve something extraordinary. Len Waters worked as a shearer before joining the RAAF in 1942. He initially trained as a mechanic but, due to the shortage of pilots, volunteered for flying duties and graduated as a sergeant pilot in 1944. He completed 95 missions while flying in the Pacific theatre, rising to the rank of warrant officer by the end of the war. Clearly he was a man of great courage, fortitude and tremendous skills. Unfortunately, in an era of continued discrimination and despite his heroic service on behalf of our nation, following his discharge in 1946 he was left with little choice other than to return to shearing to support his family, which he did.


Together with the late Senator Judith Adams and the member for Forrest, I had the opportunity a couple of years ago to spend time with NORFORCE in Alice Springs as part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. NORFORCE was raised in 1981 and its primary role is surveillance and reconnaissance in the northern regions of Australia, and draws the majority of its personnel from the local Indigenous population. The skills of these Aboriginal soldiers play a significant and vital role in this regiment. The pride in the uniform of these men and women is absolutely palpable. We are very fortunate for their commitment. As a nation we have progressed far since the first and second world wars. The Defence Force is doing much to ensure that we not only recognise our Indigenous population but that we also do much to avail ourselves of their skills and their talents. We have done much in the way of creating an inclusive, fair society, but, in my humble opinion, there is still much more to be done. I congratulate the member for Parkes for bringing this motion forward.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (18:51):  I too commend the member for Parkes for this very important motion. Indigenous Australians have served in virtually every conflict and peacekeeping mission in which Australia has participated since the start of the last century—from the Boer War through to East Timor—but it is difficult to give an exact number for those who served because we have been quite inconsistent in Australia in recognising the Indigenous status of those who volunteered to serve. Section 61H of the Defence Act 1910 exempted from service in time of war persons who are 'not substantially of European origin or descent'. Although the Defence Act initially frustrated Aboriginal attempts to enlist, recruitment policies were relaxed after the heavy losses in 1916 and 1917. Men who claimed one European parent were sometimes accepted for overseas service. However, Commonwealth and state governments still consistently underestimated Aboriginal contributions because of these definition issues.


At the start of World War II, the Defence Act barred the conscription of full-blooded Indigenous people because it was held that since they were not enfranchised citizens, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders should not be compelled to defend Australia. The Indigenous status of service personnel was not recorded on ADF enlistment forms because, quite simply, those forms did not allow it, and so Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders were not able to state their heritage until well after 1980.


There are currently about 820 people in the permanent ADF who identify as being of Indigenous origin. We know however that the families of all of those who have served are well aware of their contributions and we need to share their pride. I am particularly proud of the Aboriginal servicemen from the electorate of Murray who served whenever their country called, including the first and second world wars, despite the fact that when they came back it was without being recognised as full Australian citizens. Certainly they were not allowed to put their hands up for solider settlement support.


Private Daniel Cooper was born in Barmah, which is right next door to Cummeragunja, the mission on the Murray River. He was born in 1895. He enlisted in the AIF at Broadmeadows on 23 July 1915 and trained in Egypt. He joined the 24th Battalion on the Western Front in June 1916. This was just before the 24th Battalion fought in its first major battles in France—Pozieres in July and Mouquet Farm in August. Daniel went to England briefly with health problems. He returned and rejoined the 24th Battalion. We believe he was with this unit when he was killed in action on 20 September 1917. We think it was 20 September, because there is also an entry that he was killed on 29 September 1917. However, the official record of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission states Daniel's death was on 20 September. At the time, the 2nd Australian Division was fighting in the Battle of Menin Road. It could be assumed that Private Cooper died on the first day of the battle. He is buried at the Perth Cemetery, China Wall, in Belgium, along with 2,007 of his fellow Commonwealth servicemen.


Private Arthur Charles Nelson was born at Cummeragunja mission in April 1894. He enlisted in the AIF at Echuca in June 1918, giving his address as Barmah. Because he enlisted so late, however, he was recalled to Australia before reaching Europe. 


Andrew Cooper was born in Echuca in 1896. He enlisted in the AIF in June 1917. He was discharged as medically unfit before he was sent overseas, but he was there to serve, and he would have done so with great distinction, I know, on behalf of his family, because he felt he was an Australian and he needed to defend his nation. On his enlistment form it states that he was a 'half-caste'. 


I want to particularly acknowledge other Victorian Aboriginal soldiers of World War I who were killed in action: Laurence Henry Booth from Orbost; Daniel Cooper of Barmah, son of the legendary William Cooper; William Alexander Egan from Warrnambool; James Gordon Harris from Healesville; William Fredrick Murray from Orbost; William Reginald Rawlings, also a military medal winner, from Warrnambool; Gilbert Theo Stephen; and Harry Thorpe from Lakes Entrance, who was also a military medal winner.


I want to also mention the Cummeragunja Government Mission women, who did a fantastic job knitting socks, jumpers and balaclavas for the World War II effort. There are some wonderful photos of them, sitting out in the open, all with their knitting—socks and scarves—draped over their knees, and of course the family names of these women are the same as those of the men who put up their hands to serve. Lest we ever forget.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2012-10-29,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (18:56):  There is a man in my electorate named David Williams. He is the New South Wales President of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Veterans and Services Association. Twenty-seven members of David's family have served in the Australia military and he himself has served in the Navy for 30 years. He is an extraordinary man. If all he had managed to do with his life is raise the amazing children he has raised, that would be enough, but he has also served our country for 30 years. 


David joined the military at a time when you could join as an Aboriginal Australian. He has been a proud Aboriginal serviceman ever since, but he spends considerable time reminding me and anyone else who he can find that many, many Aboriginal servicemen have not received the appropriate recognition for the service they gave to their country and were in fact appallingly treated on their return to Australia. Like many servicemen, he also points out that, while serving, they were well treated by their fellow soldiers. It was their return and the conditions of their enlistment which are a stain on our society still today. 


We know that Aboriginal Australians served in the first Boer War right back in 1880, the second Boer War, World War I, World War II, the occupation of Japan, the Korean War, the Malayan emergency, the Indonesian confrontation and the Vietnam war. We also know that it was in the Vietnam War itself that they actually became citizens and were entitled to call themselves Australians—that late. Many, many Aboriginal people had served this country before they were given that right. But they served in the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, Afghanistan, the second Gulf War and in peacekeeping in East Timor and the Solomon's. An extraordinary record of contribution.


We know that there were at least 500 Aboriginal servicemen in World War I and maybe 5,000 in World War II, but we do not know the numbers because Aboriginal Australians were restricted by the Defence Act 1903 from joining. In order to join, they had to deny their Aboriginality. Many pretended to be Maoris or Indians to join our services. Again, that is something that must have been difficult for them to do and it indicates an extraordinary commitment to serving this country. We know that over 95 per cent of the entire male Torres Strait Islander population of age served in uniform during World War II. I will repeat that number: 95 per cent of the population of age. They served in either the Torres Strait Island Light Infantry Battalion, the Torres Strait Island coastal artillery or Army small boats units. It was the largest volunteer group from any Australian community. They are known, but what is less known is that they were only paid about one-third of the wages of their white counterpart soldiers and that wrong was only addressed when additional compensation was paid in the early 1980s. Again, it was an extraordinary contribution by the male Torres Strait Islander population at that time.


The government has taken steps so that we can know the stories of our Aboriginal veterans. We do not know all their names; we certainly do not know their tribal names or what tribes they came from. I know from talking to the Aboriginal Australian veterans in my area that knowing the tribal names and the tribe they came from is equally important to knowing when they served. In July, we committed more than $1 million to a major new research project as part of the Australian Research Council's Linkage Projects funding. The project is titled 'Serving our country: a history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the defence of Australia'. It is a four-year project that will be led by researchers from the Australian National University, with partners from the Department of Defence, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, the National Archives of Australia, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Australian War Memorial. It will commence in 2013 and it will take four years—a massive research undertaking to identify the names and backgrounds of thousands of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who served this country before they were legally allowed to do so in 1949. It is a remarkable project that will help us understand the full contribution and pay respect that is due to these remarkable Australians.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (19:02):  I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Parkes to recognise the contribution that Indigenous service men and women have made to the Australian Defence Force and, indeed, to the defence of our nation. As we approach Remembrance Day on 11 November, when we reflect every year on the contribution made by thousands of Australians who have died in the defence of our nation, we should take this opportunity to also reflect on the often unnoticed or undocumented contribution of Indigenous Australians to our defence forces.


It is a blight on the history of this nation that Indigenous Australians were not granted citizenship and, indeed, were not recognised as Australians until 1967. Worse than that, even Indigenous troops from both World War I and World War II came from a section of society with very low wages and with little likelihood of moving up the social ladder. In all areas, from education and employment to civil liberties, discrimination against Indigenous Australians was rampant. Regretfully, even in 2012, we continue to associate Indigenous communities with discrimination and disadvantage.


While we continue to lament the fact that military superannuation for all troops under the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Scheme and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme have not been fairly indexed, thousands of Indigenous troops also experienced firsthand discrimination not just from Australians but from the Australian government. Only in 1992 did the Australian federal government grant monetary back pay and recognition in the form of service medals. When times became tough in World War I, the defence forces eased their restrictions on Indigenous Australians joining the military. In October 1917, a military order stated:


Half-castes may be enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force provided that the examining Medical Officers are satisfied that one of the parents is of European origin.


Yet, after World War I, the restrictions on enlistment for Indigenous Australians were reimposed.


Upon returning to Australia after World War II, many Indigenous troops, even while still in their defence uniforms, experienced prejudice and discrimination. Many were refused service in bars or were the victims of racial slurs from their fellow soldiers. During World War II, it is estimated that some 3,000 Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders served in the armed forces, many in specially raised Indigenous units including the Torres Strait Island Light Infantry Battalion. During that time, an Indigenous Australian serving in an Indigenous unit was paid significantly less—approximately half—than their fellow soldiers and, worse, did not have any access to entitlements as veterans. It took a two-day 'mutiny' in December 1943 for their pay to be raised to two-thirds that of a regular soldier. When they returned home, as I have mentioned, they experienced further discrimination. Most were barred from Returned and Services League clubs, except on Anzac Day.


Sadly, to this day, we still do not have a full record of the contribution of Indigenous Australians to the defence of our nation. As this motion notes, at least 400 Indigenous troops served in World War I and somewhere between 3,000 and 6,000 Indigenous troops served under our flag in World War II. Important work is being undertaken by the Australian War Memorial, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the ANU and other organisations to recover and document information about the contribution of these Indigenous troops.


They are uncovering stories of contributions from Indigenous troops such as Private Timothy Hughes, who served in the 2nd/10th Battalion, a proud rat of Tobruk who won the Military Medal for bravery under fire while in Buna, Papua. We now know stories from the Queensland 2nd/26th Battalion which included many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, such as Private John Knox, who died in Changi in August 1942, and Private George Cubby, who died on the infamous Burma-Thailand Railway.


According to Australian Geographic, more than 800 Indigenous Australians are currently serving in the Australian Defence Force, and I welcome their contribution as Australians. Many are serving in our ongoing efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Like their predecessors, they continue to defend the land on which all Australians live.


Indigenous Australians today serve in the regular and reserve forces, and we recognise the three regional force surveillance units based in northern Australia. Many reserve and regular troops from Indigenous communities currently serve in the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment, the Pilbara regiment in Western Australia and the North-West Mobile Force, NORFORCE, which is based in north-east Western Australia and the Northern Territory. I welcome these contributions, and I thank the member for Parkes for his motion today which reflects the contribution of thousands of Indigenous Australians for more than a century to the defence of our nation.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2012-10-29,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (19:06):  I would like to congratulate the member for Parkes for bringing this motion into the parliament too. I believe it is a very important motion and one that moves towards greater recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in our country because not only does it look to what they have achieved in the past; it shows where we have been and where we need to go. I would like to also congratulate the members for Ryan and Parramatta on the excellent contributions that they have made to this debate because I think they really highlighted the issues that are so important.


Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have served alongside non-Indigenous Australians since the Boer War at the turn of the 20th century. As there was no requirement at that stage for recruits to list their ethnic background on their enlistment papers, there are no accurate figures on how many Indigenous personnel served. There was also a disincentive to list that they were Indigenous because Indigenous people were not welcome in the armed services.


Several Indigenous personnel have ranked among the most well known of Australian service men and women. At the moment, as the member for Parramatta highlighted, there is a project that has been funded to develop a complete picture of the contribution of Indigenous men and women have made to Australia's military history. There is $1 million over four years. That project commences in 2013. That will list the names and the backgrounds of those Indigenous Australians who served their country so bravely and so well alongside non-Indigenous Australians and were accepted and welcomed. Their contribution was appreciated by all other service men and women.


Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander service personnel served in the Army or whatever division of the defence services they chose. But, once they had finished their service, they went back into their communities and they did not receive the same benefits or the same support that non-Indigenous Australians received. I think that goes along with the fact that it is really difficult to ascertain the history of Indigenous Australians and their contribution to the war effort. 


Once they left the Army they went back to a life where they were not given special treatment in relation to housing and jobs, and they had to struggle in a way that non-Indigenous servicemen did not. For instance, approximately 500 Aboriginal men served in World War I. They did that because they wanted the experience and the opportunity and sometimes to escape the life on the missions. They hoped that by fighting for Australia they would get recognition and be treated in the same way that non-Aboriginal or non-Indigenous Australians were treated. They thought it would provide them with better economic, social and political opportunities upon their return, but unfortunately that did not happen. Several Aboriginal reserves such as Lake Condah in western Victoria were broken up for housing for ex-servicemen and then given to only non-Indigenous ex-servicemen. I think this really highlights some of the issues. When the war was over their life continued to be marked by discrimination in employment, education and living conditions. 


In 2007, 1.4 per cent of ADF members were identified as Indigenous servicemen. Today we recognise and appreciate the role that Indigenous servicemen played. As part of NAIDOC Week, the Chief of the Defence Force, General David Hurley, laid a wreath in honour of Indigenous service men and women past and present. He said of those Aboriginal and Torres Strait island people who championed change within the defence services, 'They dared to challenge.'

Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (19:12):  I would like to speak today in support of the motion moved by the member for Parkes, which states: 


That this House: 


(1) acknowledges the sacrifices made by those who have served Australia in past and present wars and conflicts and the importance of Remembrance Day in honouring those who have fallen; and


(2) notes that many Indigenous servicemen and women have also made valuable contributions to the Australian Defence Force, and that:


(a) in the past these contributions have not been fully acknowledged and recognised;


(b) historically many people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background experienced difficulties in enlisting due to their race;


(c) the full extent of the contribution of Indigenous peoples to past wars and conflicts is a subject that is still being researched today—


There are very few records and of the records that we do have some of them could be a bit flimsy. The motion continues:


(d) more information will only add to the valuable wealth of knowledge that informs Australia's commemoration ceremonies and enriches the historic record;


(e) it is estimated that at least 1,000 Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders served in the First World War …


Prior to them enlisting, they had very few rights. They had no land ownership, they had no voting rights and they of course were not allowed alcohol. They had low wages, if they had any wages at all, and their living conditions were very poor. A lot of them worked on cattle properties. A lot of them had no jobs whatsoever. However, thankfully, once they were in the AIF they were generally befriended and treated equally and paid the same as Australians. It was pleasing that once they were in the Army they were generally accepted well by the other Australian troops. In 1914, many Aboriginals were rejected on race grounds but by 1917 the recruits were drying up from the ordinary Australian population and more Indigenous people were then enlisted. However, there was a military law that stated that to be enlisted they must have one parent of European origin.


Why did the Aborigines enlist in the first place? They were loyal to their country, they had patriotism, they wanted to prove themselves and they wanted to push for better treatment and recognition after World War I. They were paid six shillings a day, the same as the other troops, and that was classed as good money. But, after the war had finished, they were offered very little support—there were no soldier settlement blocks offered to the Aborigines.


It is estimated that there were 3,000 to 6,000 Aboriginal servicemen in the Second World War, but the limited historical records indicate that these figures could have been much higher than this. Initially, Indigenous recruits were not considered and were deemed necessary or not desirable. However, when the Japanese entered World War II, enlistment by Torres Strait Islanders and Aborigines rose dramatically. They became front-line soldiers. Many were killed on the frontline, and many died in POW camps. Those that survived were full of pride and confidence. By 1949, there were no race restrictions on recruits. This was a great achievement for our nation. Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have served in all major conflicts since those days—in the Air Force, in the Navy and in the Army. They also performed other duties during World War II. The RAAF depended heavily on Aboriginal labour in Northern Australia during the Second World War. Aborigines helped out in camps, they helped out in butchers shops and they helped out by providing services to the men who were out there fighting—and they themselves fought too.


Today the NORFORCE regiment still operates in Northern Australia. Only last week I had the pleasure of meeting some of those reserve army guys up there who are doing a great job protecting our northern borders. They are great Australians and great troops. Lest we forget. (Time expired)

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (19:17):  It is my great pleasure to speak on this motion, which recognises the service of Indigenous servicemen and women in our military forces in defence of the Australian people. Over 400 Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders served in the First World War, and in excess of 5,000 of them served in the Second World War and have served since then. During my contribution to this debate I will talk about Private Frank Archibald, who was born in Walcha, New South Wales, on 17 February, 1915.


Frank's military service began on 17 May 1940 when, at the age of 25, he enlisted in the AIF along with his younger brother Ron and his uncle Richard Archibald Sr. Frank sailed out of Sydney on 30 August and arrived in Palestine, where he joined his unit, on 30 September. He served in the Battle of Bardia, then in Tobruk, then in Benghazi and then in Crete and Greece. After a short period of leave back in Australia, Frank's unit, 2/2nd Battalion AIF, left Brisbane on 12 September, 1942. They were bound for Port Moresby and the desperate defence of Australia from the northern onslaught of the imperial Japanese forces. Tragically, on 24 November, Frank was killed in action on the Kokoda Track during the Siege of Buna while trying to save a mate of his. His mate survived; he did not.


Sadly, in some ways this is not a remarkable story; many joined our armed forces and served Australia during this time, and too many of them lost their lives in battle as a result. The story is made remarkable by the fact that Frank Archibald was an Indigenous Australian. Hundreds of Indigenous Australians served in the second AIF and the militia under the same conditions as non-Indigenous Australians, in most cases with the promise of full citizenship and rights after the war.


As a good mate of mine, Freddy Moore, tells me, they could not even get a beer in the front bar of a pub. They had to watch as all their mates who were demobbed at the same time as them walked into the front bar and had a beer, and sometimes if their mates were feeling generous they would pony one out the back door for them. They had to sit under a gum tree out the back—a tragic story, repeated hundreds and hundreds of times around the country. These young boys and men risked their lives—in Frank's case, he gave his life—to serve their country.


Since Frank's death in New Guinea in 1942, the Archibald family has felt great sadness that Private Frank, an Indigenous Australian, has been buried away from his traditional country without the necessary Aboriginal traditional rites having been performed to bring his spirit to rest. I am pleased to advise the House today that on Anzac Day this year 12 members of the Archibald family, including members of his family from my electorate, including his only surviving sibling, Grace Gordon, travelled to Kokoda and performed this ceremony. I was very pleased to be able to assist them. I have to pay tribute to the many corporations and individuals, including Qantas, who funded the trip to ensure that this was a successful ceremony.


This Saturday the Kokoda Aboriginal Servicemen's Campaign Committee is holding a special event to the celebrate the 70th anniversary of Kokoda Day at the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway in Concord. This event will highlight the journey to the war cemetery at Bomana on Anzac Day 2012 to visit the graves of six Aboriginal diggers and bring their spirits home to country, and that will be followed by the unveiling of a memorial plaque commemorating Aboriginal servicemen who fought in the Battle of Kokoda. I wish the organisers all the very best for a successful commemoration of a special chapter of Australia's military history and our Indigenous service. In the spirit of reconciliation, I think it is quite proper that we respect their memories; that we do whatever we can to support the families and their ancestors to ensure that they receive the proper rites, as indeed the Archibald family did. I commend the member for Parkes for bringing this matter before the House.


Debate adjourned.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2012-10-29,"



Mr SECKER
 (Barker—Opposition Whip) (21:00):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I take this opportunity to officially congratulate you on your honoured position in a very unusual situation and I think we are all very thankful that you have been able to take the official Deputy Speaker's position. As I said, it is my first opportunity to speak in the chamber since then and congratulate you.


I rise tonight to express my deep disappointment at the border protection mess—and it can only be described as a mess that Julia Gillard's Labor government has created for this country. The boats keep coming and coming and coming and the government is struggling to keep up, all because Julia Gillard, the Prime Minister, and her cabinet and her Labor Party members are too stubborn to admit that Labor got it wrong. The latest Customs annual report reveals that they are struggling to crew boats and planes and that they have actually had to divert patrols off the Southern Ocean to send them to northern waters. This would not happen if we actually had a border protection system that worked.


In 2010-11 the average boat contained 53 passengers. Now it is up to 73 and each illegal boat costs Australians an average of $12.8 million given all the processing and bringing them in, so it is a lot of money for each boat. What have we had this month? In October we have already seen a record for the number of boats to illegally enter Australia in a month—the third such record in three successive months. With arrivals this financial year running at an average of 2,000 people a month, it is no wonder that there has been a $1.2 billion budget blow-out for this year alone and we are only a few months into it. So $1.2 billion is the price of Labor's vanity on this issue. It is the price of Labor's lack of resolve.


John Howard found a solution; he found a problem and created a solution. Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard found a solution and created a problem and, as the boats keep coming and coming and coming, billions of dollars will continue to be wasted for no good reason. We know that John Howard's policies have worked before and we know that they will work again.


There is no point in being half-hearted about this issue. An effective border protection policy requires a full suite of effective measures to stop the boats. This includes the reintroduction of temporary protection visas and turning the boats around where it is safe to do so. The problem is that the Labor government and the Prime Minister just do not get it, and she is too proud to admit that she got it wrong. Instead of swallowing her pride and admitting that she got it wrong, the Prime Minister has resorted to the politics of smear and distraction. The only problem with this strategy is that there is no substance to back it up and the public knows that Julia Gillard simply cannot be trusted when it comes to telling the truth on this point. Remember that Julia Gillard promised to stop the boats and she has not. She promised to fix the mining tax and it has not raised a cent. And, of course, she said that 'there would be no carbon tax under the government I lead'.


The Australian people simply cannot trust the Gillard Labor government and—guess what?—Kevin Rudd could not trust Julia Gillard either. Two years ago when the faceless man took the prime ministership off Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard said Labor had lost its way. Two years on, as Labor continues to fight its history wars, this government is still lost. The boats still keep coming, the budget is in worse shape, the debt keeps rising and the carbon tax keeps damaging the economy.


Guess what? The faceless men are at it again—just ask Penny Wong. The faceless men giveth and the faceless men taketh away. Julia Gillard absolutely depends on them to remain Prime Minister. That is why she will not take them on. This is a weak Prime Minister and a weak government. It is a government that has sold its soul to the Greens and is held captive by the faceless man.


The only way to fix the problem is to get rid of this government. The Labor Party needs a stint in opposition and, hopefully, a very long one. Australia cannot afford to have government that is at war with itself, because every day Labor spends obsessing about itself is another day that it is not focused on the real concerns of the Australian people.


The coalition have a better way. The coalition under the leadership of Tony Abbott will provide hope, reward and opportunity. We know that Australians want a government that will abolish the carbon tax. We know that Australians want a government that can stop the boats. We know that Australians want a government that keeps its word, lives within its means and helps Australia get ahead. That is what will happen should Tony Abbott become Australia's Prime Minister at the next election.


Very recently we have had this so-called misogyny debate. We know that Tony Abbott is not a misogynist. He does not hate women. He has three daughters. He has a loving wife. I have met his loving mother. He does not hate women. But this is the Labor way. They have tried to distract from their own inadequacies through this so-called misogyny debate. We all know it has been led by John McTernan, who is infamous for what he did during the Tony Blair years in the UK.


But we also know that this government is addicted to debt. That is the Labor Party history. If we look back at what happened in the first 90 years of this Federation, from 1901 to 1991, in that time we actually had to fund two world wars and a few other skirmishes in Malaysia, Korea and Vietnam—and those sorts of wars are very expensive to run and fund. We also know that we had to build a new capital city and all the bureaucracies that came with it. We had to fund the universities at a higher rate than had ever happened before, and we thank Robert Menzies for that. In those 90 years, this country accumulated $16 billion worth of debt. It was just $16 billion worth of debt in those 90 years. But for the next five years, the Hawke-Keating government actually increased that 90 years worth of debt by the same amount each year for the next five years. So we went from $16 billion in 1991 to $96 billion in 1996. So what took us 90 years to achieve, the Hawke-Keating government increased the debt by that amount every year for the next five years.


Of course, then we were elected. We had to take the hard decisions when we were elected to government in 1996, just as Campbell Newman has got to take the tough decisions in Queensland and just as New South Wales have had to take the tough decisions. We will have to do it again because not only have we passed the $96 billion that Labor left us when we took government; we have actually gone to $167 billion, and our debt is going up by about $100 million every day.


I know a lot of people get confused and do not really understand the difference between a million and a billion. We all know it has three extra noughts, but, as I like to say to people, the difference between a million and a billion can be shown by this equation: a million seconds is 12 days but a billion seconds is 34 years. That is the difference. So a billion dollars is certainly worth a lot more than a million dollars.


But this government do not seem to understand the difference. They continue to run up debt and they continue to hold out to us this idea that somehow they are going to deliver a surplus. They have not delivered a surplus in 25 years—for the last 25 years no Labor government has delivered a surplus. I have my doubts that they will do it this time around.
