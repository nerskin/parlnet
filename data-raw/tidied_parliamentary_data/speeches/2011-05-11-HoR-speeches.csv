Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (09:25):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report entitled Report 116: Treaties tabled on 24 and 25 November 2010, 9 February and 1 March 2011 and Treaties referred on 16 November 2010 (Part 3), incorporating a dissenting report. 


Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.




Mr KELVIN THOMSON:
  by leave—The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties Report 116 contains the committee's views on 15 treaties ranging from amendments to CITES and the Australian-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement to ILO conventions on the working conditions of sailors, the treatment of asbestos and occupational health and safety. I am happy to advise that this report deals with the last of the treaties for which consideration was delayed by the 2010 federal election. It is a credit to the committee's members that it has been able to consider and report on no less than 55 treaties since the election and has met the agreed reporting deadline for each one of them. In addition, for many of the treaties the committee not only issued invitations to participate to its regular stakeholders, including government agencies and state and territory governments, but was able to take evidence from a range of other interested parties. For example, the committee's consideration of amendments to the Australian-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement involved a visit to suiting manufacturers the Stafford Group, whose plant is in North Melbourne. The Stafford Group retails it suits under the brands Anthony Squires, Giotto and 1096. 


Anthony Squires is the only retailer of high-quality suits still manufacturing in Australia. The Stafford Group is concerned that this arrangement will be placed at risk by the amendments proposed to the Australian-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement. The committee has been assured by the government that it is aware of the Stafford Group's tenuous position and that it is working to ameliorate the impact of the treaty amendments on that organisation. 


I also draw the parliament's attention to the participation of the seafaring community in the inquiry into the ILO Maritime Labour Convention. This convention is intended to provide a set of basic working conditions for seafarers employed in international commercial shipping. The convention requires, amongst other things, that seafarers be properly trained, have written legally enforceable pay and conditions, have appropriate living conditions and have access to medical care. Crucially, the convention will ensure that the conditions extend to ships registered in countries that are not party to the convention. International shipping that does not meet these conditions will face severe penalties when it enters the ports of convention signatories. The penalties will remove any shipping cost advantages attributable to poor working and living conditions for seafarers. Amongst those who have already ratified the convention are the flag of convenience states of Liberia, Panama and the Bahamas. The convention has been well received by the seafaring community in Australia. Amongst those expressing support for Australia's ratification of the convention are peak employer organisations, Shipping Australia Ltd and the Australian Ship Owners Association; seafarers representatives, the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers and the Maritime Union of Australia; and representatives of charities supporting seafarers, the Australian Council of the Mission to Seafarers and the Sydney Seafarers Centre. All of these organisations had useful suggestions about how the convention is implemented, and the committee commends their suggestions to the government for consideration.


It is remarkable, therefore, given the high degree of across-the-board support for this convention, that coalition members and senators could not see their way clear to support it and have issued a dissenting report. It shows how deeply ideological they still are concerning industrial relations questions, how hostile they are to the work of the ILO, the International Labour Organisation. And it shows that, when you scratch below the surface, they have learnt nothing from the 2007 Work Choices debacle which led to their election defeat.


Finally, report No. 116 expresses the committee's frustration about treaties amended without ratification that come into force before they are scrutinised by the committee or the public. For example, the treaty amending the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships was tabled in parliament in November 2010, after having come into force some five months earlier. This does not need to happen. Changes to treaties amended without ratification are provided to signatory countries for consideration up to 12 months before they come into effect. This period allows signatory countries that do not agree to the changes to either opt out of the changes or attempt to have the changes removed. In the case of the treaty amending the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, the amendments were provided to Australia in mid-2009 and the period for objecting to the treaty ended in June 2010. There is enough time in this 12-month period for parliament and the public to make a material contribution to the outcome. So our report recommends that amendments to treaties of this sort be referred to the parliament for consideration at the time they are first provided to Australia so that the parliament can have a say before the changes come into force. I commend the report to the House.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"




Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (09:41):  The Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011 is a step forward in ensuring that shareholders and Australians generally have faith in the accountability of directors and senior executives of Australian companies and, most importantly, in the fairness of their pay. It does this not by regulation but by an approach that respects the need for firms to operate freely in the market, at the same time giving shareholders the power they need to make sure that senior executives truly earn their pay.


This is far from the only area in which this government shows a decisive preference for market based solutions over regulation, a preference one would hope would be more widely shared and appreciated by those opposite. I say 'appreciated' because, just listening to this debate in the last few days and last night particularly, my colleagues in the Labor government were portrayed as crazy red raggers living in some socialist nirvana: every morning we leap out of bed, flick through our copy of the little red book, read out our favourite passages, sing a few rounds of The Internationale and then march off to work under the fluttering banner of the Soviet flag.




Mr Husic:
  That is what I do!




Ms BRODTMANN:
  Is that what you do? Was that this morning? Okay! I remind those opposite of what the Labor government—not just this Labor government but also Labor governments in the past—has done in introducing market based solutions for this country. In the 1980s we opened up the economy, we opened up markets, we opened up banks and we opened up the country, particularly to the Asia-Pacific. We cut protection. Most recently, since 2007 we have saved this economy from the global financial crisis. I hardly regard that as some sort of mad, red-ragging socialist bunch of people crazily singing The Internationale every morning.


The issue of remuneration has been at the forefront of the minds of shareholders and the Australian community for some time, an issue more pressing following the corporate collapses associated with the global financial crisis. People around the world were rightly outraged that senior executives continued to receive large pay packages—so-called performance bonuses and golden parachutes—at a time when their companies were failing, leaving many average employees without jobs and their homes at risk. We in this country were spared the full extent of the effects of the global financial crisis thanks to the quick actions of the Labor government. But Australians remain highly concerned about the rates of executive pay. This concern is sharpened by the disparity between the pay packets of senior executives and those of average Australian working families. I am struck by the Productivity Commission's findings on this. The Productivity Commission reports that the top CEOs of Australian public companies receive pay some 110 times average Australian weekly earnings. This compares with the earnings of the CEOs of Australia's smallest companies of just four times average Australian weekly earnings. In some cases, CEO remuneration grew by as much as 300 per cent in real terms between 1993 and 2007.


Australians do not have a problem with other hardworking individuals earning more pay than they do. But they do have a problem with these remuneration packages, bonus schemes and golden parachutes being bestowed regardless of the actual performance of the individual. Given this, it is easy to understand why these packages are so hard for people to accept. We should not be surprised at the level of anger and mistrust that exists over this issue. Such mistrust is not healthy, as it undermines the basic strong sense of fairness that Australians have and the trust that is needed for a society based on the free market to function.


There have been efforts in the past to ensure that management teams look after the best interests of shareholders, principally by linking performance to share value. This worked up to a point. But research shows that this linkage has been distorted. It has emerged that there are a number of factors that go into the calculation of remuneration, some of which are reasonable, some of which are the result of what can only be described as gaming. As the Productivity Commission mentioned, while local shareholder value plummeted in 2008 as the result of the GFC, the imported crisis, with some countries and sectors being propped up by taxpayers, executive pay seemed to emerge unscathed, crystallising a view that executives were being rewarded for failure after having been rewarded for success.


The argument that these packages are required to acquire and keep the best talent is also not supported by available evidence. One journal article notes that there is a turnover rate for senior executives of between four per cent and six per cent. The article states that it is a matter of judgment whether a turnover rate of five per cent is sufficient to create market pressure to raise levels of compensation by itself. It is also questionable whether independent remuneration committees are by themselves capable of better linking performance with reward, given some of the biases and conflicts of interest that may result. In fact, Jennifer Hill and Charles Yablon, who are regular commentators on this issue, have noted that even carefully constructed remuneration packages will frequently provide corporate manager with incentives to use their strategic advantage within the company to prefer their own interests over those of the shareholders.


This bill seeks to address these problems and allay the concerns of shareholders and Australians as a whole by implementing changes to the Corporations Act recommended by the Productivity Commission. It seeks to address the imbalance between shareholders and management and provide some much-needed help to ensure that boards are responsive to the concerns of shareholders. But rather than imposing a government limit on remuneration this bill seeks to make boards more accountable for their decisions on pay, improve the manner in which conflicts are dealt with and increase transparency and accountability in executive remuneration matters.


It achieves these things by introducing the so-called three-strikes test. This test creates a process by which directors will face a spill motion on their position if over two consecutive years a company's remuneration report has been rejected by 25 per cent or more of the votes. Should this spill motion be passed, directors will need to seek re-election at a spill meeting within 90 days of the AGM. This will make directors accountable for their decisions and responsive to their shareholders.


This bill also seeks to bring greater transparency to the role of remuneration consultants. This measure reflects the concern expressed by some shareholders that remuneration consultants are placed in a potential conflict situation when they have to provide their advice, in the first instance, to the very managers who are responsible for signing off on their services in the future. Obviously, this has the potential to create a situation whereby the consultant may feel constrained in what advice they can provide. To counter this potential conflict, this legislation will require that the reports of independent consultants go first to the non-executive directors or a remuneration committee rather than company executives.


This bill also seeks to eliminate situations where key management personnel or closely related parties are voting on pay issues. The bill will prohibit such parties from voting on non-binding remuneration votes, which otherwise may distort the results and diminish their effectiveness as a feedback mechanism.


The government is also committed to strengthening the link between performance and remuneration. That is a really important point to make. This bill will prohibit directors and senior executives from hedging their incentive remuneration. It is currently possible for a director or senior executive to hedge their exposure to incentive remuneration, thereby effectively bypassing the link between performance and pay. This is not consistent with the principles underlying a remuneration framework that seeks to ensure pay is fairly linked to achievement. I do not think that that is too much to ask.


This bill is a comprehensive approach to the issues of remuneration of Australian boards and senior executives. It seeks to answer the questions and concerns of the community and shareholders over the issues of excessive executive pay, particularly in the light of poor performance. It does this without placing restrictive or draconian regulation on companies or by interfering drastically in the marketplace. I want to underscore that point, because from the way that the people opposite have been talking it seems that they view it as quite the contrary. It does not interfere in the marketplace. This bill enhances Australia's corporate governance framework, particularly transparency. It provides shareholders with the power they need to effectively monitor their own companies to ensure that boards and senior executives are delivering on the organisational outcomes and are rewarded accordingly. It gives shareholders the power to say no to packages that reward failure or poor performance, and it improves the governance of companies to ensure better reward for good performance and no reward for failure. Most importantly, it benefits not only shareholders but the economy as a whole. The benefits of this legislation are clear, and I commend it to the House.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (09:52):  I rise today to talk on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. The coalition will not oppose this bill but we will seek to make an important amendment to it. We will do that to make sure that we get the balance right in this bill. While we are broadly supportive of the objective to achieve better alignment between shareholders and boards on the issue of executive remuneration, we are concerned about the potential for unintended consequences which can flow from excessive and overly prescriptive regulation in this area—and, sadly, the Labor government have a strong history of excessive and overly prescriptive regulation. They continue to want to throttle the life out of business in Australia, and that is why we have to make sure that we get the balance right in this bill.


This bill implements recommendations of the Productivity Commission in its recent inquiry into executive remuneration in Australia, which reported on 4 January 2010. Concern around the issue of executive remuneration led to the review by the Productivity Commission. The review commenced in 2009 and received 170 submissions, showing that this is an issue which the community and the business community take incredibly seriously. The final report was provided to the Australian government on 19 December 2009.


An exposure draft elicited further comment and changes to the proposed legislation. The bill's main provisions include requiring a vote for directors to stand for re-election if they do not adequately address shareholder concerns on remuneration issues over two consecutive years, the so-called two-strikes rule; changing regulation with respect to the use of remuneration consultants; prohibiting directors and executives from voting their shares on remuneration resolutions; prohibiting the hedging of incentive remuneration; requiring shareholder approval for declarations of 'no vacancy' at an annual general meeting; requiring that any directed proxies are voted and voted as directed; and reducing the complexity of the remuneration report by confining disclosures in the report to the key management personnel.


Change to voting arrangements must be careful not to distort the wishes of the majority of shareholders. The views of a minority should not too easily hold the majority hostage. When it comes to the level of support required to reject a remuneration report, a process that can lead to a spill of the board, we believe the bar has been set too low. We believe that an active minority could disrupt company proceedings if this bill is passed as it is.


We will be moving an amendment in relation to the threshold for rejecting the remuneration report. As currently proposed, the threshold for the two-strikes rule is 25 per cent of votes cast. The coalition will be moving an amendment to require the threshold to be 25 per cent of the total votes available to be cast, and this is an important amendment. Twenty-five per cent of the votes cast means that you could have seven per cent of company shareholders voting to remove a board. This is dangerous because, if you had an active minority wanting to disrupt the ongoing proceedings of a company, with this threshold they could do just that. We want to introduce an amendment which provides a sensible safeguard. Moving to a threshold of 25 per cent of the total votes available to be cast seems to me a very sensible proposition and one which the House and the parliament should be able to agree on. As I have said, this will prevent a small number of shareholders dictating a result which is not shared by a majority of the passive non-voting shareholders. We will not oppose this bill but we want to make a sensible amendment which provides balance to it. I urge the House and the parliament to support our amendment.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (09:58):  I am very pleased to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2010, which strikes such a sensible balance in the community debate around director and executive salaries, bonuses and incentives. I am also pleased to see that the opposition will ultimately be supporting the bulk of this legislation, although, given the remarks of some of those speakers during the course of this debate, it has obviously been quite a struggle to reach that very reasonable view. I have been particularly interested to hear remarks from opposition members in the debate about overregulation, which is quite a curious line of argument for a group of people who are ultimately going to support this bill. I really have to admire the ability of those members opposite who ran that line of argument with no shame. It is quite a balancing act and quite a skill. Some of those opposite seem to think that the coalition had a marvellous track record in minimising regulation when in government. I suspect that those members were possibly harking back to the wafer-thin volume of Work Choices regulations, or possibly the mere pamphlet that was John Howard's GST legislation. I really have a feeling that, during the break, some members opposite have been passing around old Family Ties DVDs, because there is more than a little bit of Alex P Keaton in the debate we have seen from the other side of the chamber, both in this session and at the end of the last. They seem to still be convinced by a curious and entirely fictional notion that they stand for small government and lessening regulation—and, suddenly, Reagan is back in the White House. They may want to have a quick recap on some of the regulatory interventions of the Howard government during its decade and more in office to perhaps disabuse themselves of that view. In any event, it is more than a little disingenuous to come to this place and masquerade as a free marketeer and then proceed to support the legislation with little more than a fig leaf amendment. But I will leave all that aside now because, as with so many other things, the opposition's views on this legislation ultimately will not rate, even as a footnote.


This legislation developed by the government is a timely and even-handed regulatory response to genuine community concerns about executive remuneration. Those concerns came to the fore during the global financial crisis. Members of the opposition have said that we should not try to drag down people who have done well for themselves—that is, executives who have been paid significant sums—as though that was the intention of the legislation. No, it is about making sure that mums and dads, self-funded retirees and all others who invest in shares directly and indirectly can be confident that the savings they have scraped together to buy a few shares are not being squandered and that the companies they invest in are being managed sensibly and prudently.


Obviously this legislation will have consequences for remuneration itself. But, more importantly, the legislation is focused on ensuring the confidence of the community generally, and investors in equities in particular, in the prudent management of the companies in which so many Australians invest their earnings. The bill responds to both the matters raised during the Productivity Commission inquiry on this issue and the findings of the commission. The commission took into account very wide-ranging submissions from the community, after extensive consultation. It noted in its report that the prime motivation for its enquiry was a 'widespread perception that executives have been rewarded for failure or simply good luck'. The report goes on to say that 'certainly in some periods and for some CEOs, pay outcomes appear inconsistent with a reasonably efficient executive labour market'. This is reflected in the submission made to the enquiry by Professor David Peetz, of Griffith University. Professor Peetz's submission notes that the growth rate of CEO pay between 1971 and 2008 was around 470 per cent, while for the same period average weekly earnings growth was around 54per cent. On any sensible view, members will certainly realise that that is out of kilter with community expectations about what are reasonable levels of pay for CEOs.


The Productivity Commission noted:


If the community came to regard executive pay as the product of poor corporate governance or weak regulation, this could undermine public confidence in the corporate sector itself, potentially detracting from the ability to raise equity capital and distorting the allocation in investment funds.


This is a genuinely held concern about maintaining public confidence in our companies. It goes to whether people will believe that putting their money into shares is a good prospect, whether it will generate a good return or whether it will simply prop up inefficient and overpaid executives. These are reasons why a regulatory response of a balanced and reasonable kind that is being presented here today is responsible and timely.


The Productivity Commission considered that certain trends in executive and director remuneration in Australia were inconsistent with effective executive labour markets and may actually have had the effect of weakening company performance. In particular, it cited incentive payments and termination payments as examples of such trends, noting that certain executive incentive payments may have delivered an unintended upside and that some termination payments considered by the Productivity Commission seemed excessive. Although the commission ultimately found that Australia's existing corporate governance and remuneration framework does rank highly internationally, it made various recommendations to improve that framework; many of those recommendations are reflected in the bill before us.


Members will recall that, in early 2009, this government announced reforms to limit excessive termination benefits given to outgoing directors and executives. This was the beginning of reform in this area and we are now taking the next steps. My own experience in working with boards, and in relation to corporate governance, does lead me to expect that most company boards will act appropriately in relation to director and executive pay and that they will and do give due regard to the expectations of shareholders. We know that many boards are already very mindful of their responsibilities and community expectations in this regard. We also know that they take very seriously their commitments to corporate social responsibility. It will be only those boards which are out of step with the kinds of shareholder expectations and community standards which are likely to be subject to the two strikes provisions of the bill. So I do consider that the bill reaches a very sensible balance between the interests of shareholders, the expectations of the wider community and the desire of businesses to give incentives to their executives to generate growth.


Importantly, this bill will enable shareholders to hold directors to account for their decisions on executive salaries. It will better enable conflicts of interest in the remuneration-setting process to be addressed. It will increase transparency and accountability in matters of executive pay. It is appropriate that shareholders, who ultimately bear the risk associated with the performance of companies in which they hold equity, have an opportunity to thoroughly scrutinise remuneration packages. The bill does this and provides for those safeguards and balancing measures through a variety of means. Speakers on this side in the debate have already referred to the two-strikes test, which would arise in the context of a company putting its remuneration to shareholder vote. It is a measure that is consistent with the underlying expectations in the Corporations Act that directors will be responsible for, and accountable to, shareholders in relation to all aspects of the management of a company, including executive remuneration.


As we have heard, the bill also includes measures relating to remuneration consultants, which will deliver greater transparency for shareholders as they will be in a position to assess potential conflicts of interest in a more successful way. The bill will help to prevent conflicts of interest by prohibiting key management personnel and their related shareholding entities from voting on remuneration related resolutions. The bill also seeks to ensure that the link between remuneration and performance is maintained by prohibiting directors and executives from hedging any incentive remuneration afforded to them. Finally, the bill contains measures to limit the remuneration details required to be disclosed in the remuneration report to the key management personnel of the consolidated entity. This simplifies the disclosures in the remuneration report to enable shareholders to better assess and understand the company's remuneration arrangements. It is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on companies, while maintaining an appropriate level of accountability.


In conclusion, despite the observations made by those on-again off-again free marketeers on the opposition benches about overregulation, members should understand that this bill strikes a balance between the interests of shareholders, the expectations of the wider community and a desire of business to give appropriate incentives to their executives to generate growth. It goes no further in amending the Corporations Act than is necessary to achieve those very eminently sensible aims.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2011-05-11,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (10:08):   I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill arises out of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission report into executive remuneration. It reported on 4 January 2010, and this bill aims to implement its recommendations. We on this side of the House support the intent of this bill, and the coalition will not be opposing the bill. However, I have some reservations in relation to it which I would like to outline today. Some of the measures are overly prescriptive and I am not convinced they will actually be effective in addressing the particular problem which we are concerned about.


To properly assess this bill, there are three questions that we should be asking. First, what are the problems that we are trying to fix? Second, are the existing mechanisms sufficient to fix those problems? Third, will the proposals that are on the table in this bill work to fix the problems? I would like to go through each of those three questions in turn.


First of all, what are the problems that this bill is trying to fix? There is a community concern with executive salaries, particularly those for publicly listed companies. There are many senior executives in this country who are earning very large amounts of money on an annual basis. There are about nine people in the banking sector, I understand, who earn above $5 million per annum. In the mining sector, there are people earning up to $15 million or $16 million per annum who are heading up publicly listed companies. The managing director of Coles apparently earns in excess of $8 million.


These are extraordinary amounts of money by anyone's measure. I personally struggle to see how anyone is worth that amount of money, but a high salary alone does not necessarily mean there is a problem. The owners of a company should be able to pay whatever they believe is appropriate to their executives. After all, it is their company. If the owners of the company believe that their CEO should be paid $500,000, that is their decision. It should not be the job of the government to interfere with those decisions of the owners of companies to determine what the appropriate remuneration is for their executives. A problem only exists if the board, which sets the salary on behalf of the owners of the company, the shareholders, is not acting in the best interests of the shareholders in setting that remuneration—that is, there is an agency problem there or a conflict of interest arises.


The government has not presented coherent evidence that directors of Australian companies are indeed acting against the interests of their shareholders when setting executive remuneration. However, there is certainly a belief that sometimes this is the case, and I believe that it is sometimes the case, particularly when executives are remunerated very highly despite the fact that a business might be collapsing, or when an executive receives a large bonus when that executive may not have had much to do with the performance of a company but rather it is due to, for example, commodity prices increasing or due to a government regulation which has underpinned the performance of that particular company.


That brings me to my second question: are the existing mechanisms available to fix the problem sufficient? As parliamentarians, we need to ensure that shareholders have appropriate degrees of protection and appropriate regulations to ensure that their interests and the interests of directors and executives are aligned. Shareholders need to be properly informed and properly empowered. But what are the existing mechanisms and are they sufficient? Already in the Corporations Act there are several mechanisms. There are the fiduciary duties. Directors have a legal obligation to act in the best interests of their shareholders, and there are some quite significant penalties if they do not do that. Second, there are some protections for minority interests in the Corporations Law. Finally, there is the ability for shareholders to sack directors if they do not believe that the directors are adequately representing their interests or if they have any concern in relation to the actions of the directors.



All of those are available presently. However, for small shareholders I understand that it is difficult to access some of those provisions. However, those provisions in the Corporations Law are the basic building blocks of the law that exist presently. What the Productivity Commission says is that, despite the presence of those existing protections, there is at least the opportunity for perception of conflicts of interest to arise and that this should be addressed directly. I support those intentions. That brings me to my third question: will the proposals on the table in the form of this bill actually fix the problem? There are seven measures in this bill and, while some of them are worthwhile, I do have reservations about whether they will make a decisive impact and I do believe that there will be some negative impacts associated with some of the provisions. The seven measures, all up, are intended to empower shareholders and prevent any real or perceived conflicts of interest. That intent is a good one, but we need to look at the details to determine whether or not that intent is actually delivered upon and whether or not the downsides of being overly prescriptive will outweigh the benefits.


Some of the seven measures do seem immediately sensible, in fact so sensible that it is surprising that some companies are not enacting these measures already. For example, one of the measures prevents key management personnel and parties closely related to them from participating in non-binding shareholder votes on remuneration and on spill resolutions. Clearly there would be a perception of a conflict of interest if the beneficiaries of the remuneration report were to vote on that remuneration report. So this seems to be a sensible provision.


Second, the bill will prohibit an executive hedging his or her executive remuneration. These days, executive remuneration is structured so that the interests of the executive are very closely aligned with the interests of the shareholders—so, if shareholders do well, the executive should be better remunerated. But there have been instances where some executives have taken hedges on the side such that their interests are less aligned, meaning that a change in shareholder interests will not have the same impact on the remuneration of those individuals. This particular measure will outlaw executives hedging against their remuneration structure. Again that seems like a reasonable and sensible thing to do and again I am surprised that directors would indeed today allow their executives to hedge against the executive remuneration incentives.


I think the cherry-picking rules included in this bill are also sensible as they also will empower shareholders. With some of the other measures, however, I question the impact. I have reservations about whether they will make a significant difference in addressing the problem of unaligned interests between shareholders and directors and I do not think that executive remuneration as a whole will come down as a result of this bill.


There are also some potential downsides to this bill. Overall it does add to the regulatory burden and the measures are very prescriptive. Joe Hockey, when introducing the coalition's response to this bill, said:


The best way to support business is often for the government to get out of the way.


I think we should always be very careful when introducing new regulations on top of all the existing regulations that companies have to abide by. When you look at some of the measures in this bill, they do appear to be very prescriptive. For example, one of the measures dictates how a company is to engage remuneration consultants. It seems to me that for this parliament to be determining how a company should engage remuneration consultants, or any other consultants, is very prescriptive. Surely it is up to the company to determine how it will engage consultants and the terms on which it will engage them? In relation to that provision, the president of the Business Council of Australia pointed out:


This is inevitably going to distract directors from their most important roles, which are not the minutiae of supervising remuneration consultants, but much more important roles of making wise decisions about business direction, major investments and the like.


The no vacancy rule, one of the seven measures of this bill, also has potential downsides. The principle inherent in that provision is again sound, but there are potential downsides in that it will reduce flexibility in how boards operate. Again referring to the Business Council of Australia, they point out that sometimes there are very good reasons to appoint fewer than the maximum number of directors at a particular time—the board may want to limit expenses, the maximum number may be too large to enable effective decision making or the board may be deliberately waiting for someone with a particular specialist expertise to go onto the board. This measure in the bill is going to force the board to make a rapid decision about a vacancy. I also have some concerns in relation to the two-strikes test and how it will operate. Indeed, the coalition will be moving amendments in this regard.


In summary, having gone through the three questions I think we should be asking ourselves to properly assess this bill—is there a problem; are the existing mechanisms sufficient; and will the proposal fix the problems?—I come down marginally in favour of the bill. I hope it will have the impact intended, but I have my doubts. If it achieves nothing else, however, this bill should send a clear message to corporate Australia that the Australian people and its representatives in this parliament are concerned about excessive executive remuneration and that we do want corporations to be responsible in this regard. If corporations get that message and act upon that message, I think that will have more impact on this issue than any regulations we might introduce in this House.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (10:23):  We are here today speaking on this bill for some important policy reasons that have a deep impact on our nation's character and Australia's egalitarian culture and traditions. Executive pay has seen some exceptional growth since the 1990s—around 13 per cent per year in real terms for the top 100 companies and 16 per cent for companies in the ASX top 50. In 2008-09, the estimated total remuneration for CEOs of the top 20 companies was around $7.2 million, or 110 times the average wage. This rapid growth in executive pay has been occurring at the very same time that these companies have been calling for wage restraint for their own employees and in the economy at large and opposition has been expressed to even modest increases in the minimum wage, while their peak organisation, the Business Council of Australia, was barracking for the coalition's unfair Work Choices legislation, which had, as its sole objective, the driving down of wages for ordinary Australian families.


While we are talking about the salaries of the very wealthy in our society, I want to state that I do not think that it is in Australia's national interest for the gap between top-income earners and low- and average-income earners to continue to increase at the rapid pace that we have seen in recent decades.


The bill before the House may go some way towards reigning in the excesses of executive remuneration, but it will not fix the structural problems arising from the existing income divide in Australia. I do not see how it is in anyone's interest if low-income earners are forced to struggle to feed, clothe, house and transport themselves and their families, despite being in full-time paid employment.


As has been noted recently by the Secretary of United Voice, Louise Tarrant, the recent history of Australia's economic development has seen a seen a restructuring of our economy so that risk has increasingly shifted from business and government to individual workers. This shift of risk has occurred through the loss of security of employment and the erosion of workplace protections such as sick leave, minimum hours and penalties.


Indeed, the coalition's Work Choices laws were designed to accelerate that shift of risk even further on to workers. Yet this transfer of risk has occurred at the very same time as corporate executives have increasingly been rewarding themselves for high-risk strategies, in particular through skyrocketing performance pay. That is why improving the accountability and transparency of executive remuneration is a welcome reform to Australia's framework of corporate governance systems for those of us on this side of the House and the constituencies that we represent. We believe that governments have an important role to play to ensure that our market based economy functions efficiently and effectively. That is because we believe that corporations are created by government, not by god, and the laws under which they operate are the laws created by people in this place and not the laws of nature.


Government regulation ensures that our economy works in the way that best reflects the interests of the broader community, of our interests as a society at large. In Australia we are fortunate to have a robust system of regulation in the corporate and financial sector and the measures in this bill represent further sensible and rational reforms to the corporate sector.


The reforms being put forward in this legislation have come about following a thoroughgoing review by the Productivity Commission. I commend the Productivity Commission for their informative report and their contribution to knowledge in this subject area. In their report on executive remuneration, the Productivity Commission noted that Australia's corporate governance and remuneration framework is highly rated internationally.


Our strong system of corporate governance served Australians well through the global financial crisis and it made the difference between the situation we faced in Australia and that faced by other countries in our region and in the Western world. But it is not the nature of a reformist government like ours merely to be complacent and to rest on our laurels. That is why the Gillard government and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the member for Lindsay, have brought this legislation before the House. It is Labor's view that the marketplace in relation to the remuneration of directors and executives is not working effectively as it could or should be. We believe that the appropriate mechanism to redress this is to increase the accountability of boards to the owners of companies—that is, their shareholders.


The measures in the bill before the House contain a number of provisions that will strengthen the accountability of boards and executives to their shareholders. First, the bill introduces a two-strikes rule that will require a board to better respond to shareholder concerns on remuneration issues. The mechanism for this two-strikes rule will be triggered where a company faces a 'no' vote by 25 per cent or more on its remuneration report for two years running. Where this occurs, and the board has not satisfactorily responded to shareholder concerns, that board will be subject to a 'spill' resolution. If more than 50 per cent of eligible shareholders vote to spill the board, there will be a requirement for the directors to stand for re-election at a subsequent meeting within 90 days.


This bill also contains important measures regarding the treatment of remuneration consultants to ensure better accountability and transparency in their role regarding remuneration matters. Transparency will be enhanced because companies will be required to disclose details relating to the use of remunerations consultants, including the consultant used and the payment made to that consultant for the advice or any other advice provided to the company. I fail to see, as the member for Aston said previously, how this is some form or onerous or burdensome regulation on boards, shareholders or companies at large.


In addition, boards will be required to approve the engagement of remuneration consultants and these consultants will be required to report their remuneration recommendation to the non-executive directors of the remuneration committee of the company concerned. Directors and executives will no longer be able to participate in the non-binding shareholder vote on their own remuneration or on the spill motions. This measure will remove a significant conflict of interest—which has been described by members opposite as completely obvious—between directors, executives and their votes in regard to remuneration matters, and it will also extend to votes by key management personnel and their closely related parties in regard to their undirected proxies.


Another common criticism made of executive remuneration is that it has focused too much on rewarding risk and short-term results rather than the long-term performance of the company. This situation was a particular characteristic of corporate behaviour in the United States in the lead-up to the global financial crisis and, regrettably, I believe it has yet to be satisfactorily resolved there, much to the detriment of American civil society. While the situation in Australia does not approach the level of corporate scandal in the United States, it is nevertheless critical to continue to be vigilant about defending the integrity of our system of corporate governance and to ensure that government regulation is working effectively to achieve its aims.


I think the bill before the House today demonstrates that where a system of self-regulation does not work then further regulatory steps need to be taken to guide market mechanisms towards better outcomes. It is a matter of public record that the existing system of non-binding votes has not had the desired effect on the actions of some boards in regards to the remuneration matters in their companies.


The standout example that I am very familiar with here is Telstra, which notoriously in 2007 was repudiated by an outstanding 66 per cent of shareholders for its handling of remuneration matters. The board at the time blithely ignored the vote and shareholders were powerless to do anything about it. The arrogance of the Telstra board in 2007 was shocking and was rightly condemned by many in the financial media and more broadly. It was ironic that at the very same time that this company was taking a very harsh attitude towards the treatment of remuneration for its own employees and their own workplace rights it was operating with complete disregard to community norms, as expressed by its shareholders, in relation to its own executive pay. I know that the current executive team at Telstra are working hard to redress the toxic culture that had developed as a result of previous management regimes and employment practices, and the blithe disrespect and disregard for community values, and everybody welcomes any move towards a more civilised and mutually respectful corporate culture in that company and elsewhere. I can only wish it well in this regard.


There are alternative proposals that have been talked about in this area. Some say that this regulation does not go far enough, and I must say that at times I have had sympathy with that view. The alternative proposal put by members opposite and foreshadowed in their amendment is that we should lift the bar even higher for shareholders—that is, the triggering of the two-strikes rule should not be based on 25 per cent of the votes cast, which would trigger the spill motion and the requisite action of the shareholders, but that it should be based on 25 per cent of the votes that are eligible to be cast at an annual general meeting of a company. Anybody who has had any experience of the practical operation of annual general meetings of most companies, particularly large companies with a large share registry, will know that this lifts the bar to an almost impossible level because it would be a very rare event indeed where 25 per cent of the eligible votes would be cast in a vote on a matter such as this.


While many of those opposite have risen to speak in favour of the sentiment and the intent behind this bill—to put more regulation and give more control to the shareholders to address outrageous remuneration packages by executives—their proposed amendment to this regulation will have quite the opposite effect. It would neuter the effect of the bill and neuter the ability of shareholders to have any real say in controlling the remuneration packages of their directors and executives.


The social contract in Australia that was the bedrock of our culture and our values has been severely challenged as executive pay has skyrocketed in recent decades. We cannot sit by and wring our hands each time we hear of multi-million dollar salaries being paid to corporate executives which are seemingly unrelated to the performance of their companies and the returns to shareholders. That is why I support the sensible measures in the bill before the House today, and that is also why I support the voices of others within the community in their continued campaigns to ensure fairness, security and dignity for all Australian workers, and that we do everything we can to narrow the gaps between the wealthy, the average Australians and the poor in this country.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2011-05-11,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:36):  The health and success of a society is best judged by the level of  equality between its citizens. The gap between the rich and poor, the extent to which someone profits from the labour of others and the capacity of someone to reap enormous wealth at the expense of the Commonwealth have always been a measure of a sustainable and stable society. During the first three-quarters of the 20th century, Australia, like much of the developed world, was narrowing the gap between the highest and lowest incomes. The 1970s were the high point with the gap between rich and poor at its smallest perhaps in centuries, but since then the gap has been growing again, with most of the positive trends of the 20th century wiped out.


Using the Australian Bureau of Statistics we can examine the income distribution between households. If disposable income was equally distributed between households, the bottom 20 per cent of households would have 20 per cent of total income and the top 20 per cent of households would also have 20 per cent of total income. In fact, the latest ABS figures show that the bottom fifth has just seven per cent of the income, whereas the top fifth has more than 40 per cent. And in the four years to 2010, the shares of the four bottom-fifths fell by about 0.5 a percentage point each, allowing the share of the top fifth to rise by two per cent. So why, under both Liberal and Labor governments, has there been this marked increase in inequality?


Economic writer Ross Gittins in last year's ACTU Whitlam lecture outlined this recent data and attempted to answer the question. He said:


No one can say with any certainly. Various factors could have contributed: the resources boom and the booming sharemarket before the global financial crisis, the continued rise in executive and finance-sector salaries and maybe the succession of income-tax cuts that benefited people on high incomes.


But he went on to say:


It would be a mistake to conclude, however, that all families with income sufficient to put them in the top 20 per cent have benefited equally. It’s far more likely that the closer you are to the top of that 20 per cent the better you’ve done. It’s even possible that the share of people in the second-top 10 per cent has declined, as have the shares of the bottom 80 per cent of households.


But it gets worse. According to Gittins, research using income tax statistics show that the top 120th of a per cent of individual taxpayers account for about two per cent of total taxable income. Let's just reflect on that. Someone in the top 0.05 per cent of taxpayers has income about 40 times their proportionate share. Gittins also says:


The top 10th of a per cent accounts for 3 per cent, the top half a per cent for 6 per cent, the top 1 per cent for 9 per cent, the top 5 per cent for 21 per cent and the top 10 per cent for 31 per cent


So in fact it is the growth in income of the very top group of people in the wealthiest 20 per cent of the income band that is driving this growth in inequality. According to Gittins this means:


The shares of these top earners were declining until the early 1980s, but have increased since then, with the share of the top 10 per cent growing from 25 per cent to 31 per cent. Why has this happened? I think it would have to do mainly with the explosion in executive salaries and the phenomenal expansion of the phenomenally paid financial services industry.


While experiencing a short dip post the global financial crisis, executive salaries are continuing to soar, driving up this inequality in Australia. This skyrocketing of executive pay is based on the obscene levels of incentives and bonuses for company executives and has fuelled unsustainable business practices that resulted in the loss of jobs and shareholder wealth. Let's look again at the figures. 


The average total remuneration of a chief executive of a top-50 company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2010 was $6.4 million. This makes the average CEO's total pay packet almost 100 times that of the average worker. This is an obscene difference in remuneration. Why should anyone earn 100 times more than the average worker? Do they work 100 times as hard? Are they carrying out work that is a hundred times more risky, or difficult or dangerous? The reality is executives are being paid this amount because they are able to get away with it and they have been allowed to get away with it.


We can get a greater sense of how unfair this difference is by looking at the increases in executive pay over last financial year. Executive pay rose by an average of almost $1 million, the equivalent of an extra $18,000 per week. Over the same period, the annual average wage for a full-time worker rose by just $3,200, or $62 a week—$18,000 a week compared with $62 dollars a week. Yet we are constantly hearing lectures about the importance of wage restraint and the worry of a wages break-out amongst working people. What does one even do with an extra $18,000 a week? 


This has been a problem for some time with base pay for executives rising by 130 per cent from 2001-2010, while in the same period average weekly earnings only rose by 52 per cent. Inflation over the same period was just 28.6 per cent. Again, we see this incredible difference with average workers gaining modest increases in their pay just keeping above inflation, while the top end of town is raking it in, with a whopping doubling of their pay over the last decade.


Over the previous financial year across the economy, profits also soared by 27.5 per cent. This imbalance is even greater in selected industries. Gross operating profits in mining have risen by 60.6 per cent, while wages grew by just 3.8 per cent. Construction profits rose by 55.5 per cent, but wages by just 2.9 per cent. And profits in the information, media and telecommunications sector grew by 10 per cent—five times more than wages. Company profits as a share of national income are now back to the record levels of 2008, while the wages share is the lowest since 1964. So there has been no shortage of funds to fund wage increases for workers, but corporations have instead funded executive salaries. This is unfair and unsustainable, and it is little wonder that the community is angry when they are doing it tough and being asked to engage in wage restraint when corporate leaders are filling their own pockets.


Here are some examples from last year of incredible increases in CEO pay from 2009 to 2010. Tom Albanese, CEO of Rio Tinto, got $9,039,000, an increase of 328 per cent. Don Voelte from Woodside Petroleum is on $8,343,339—also a huge increase. Ralph Norris, CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, modest but still a nice little earner, is on $16,157,746, an increase of 75 per cent. And the list goes on: David Knox at Santos, $5 million, an increase of 63 per cent; Marius Kloppers on $11 million, and so on. Something needs to be done to rein in these fat-cat salaries and excessive profits. Something needs to be done to address this growing inequality. The Greens have been seeking action on executive remuneration for some time. We have proposed real and practical measures to limit executive pay. We have moved a number of amendments to the Corporations Act in the past to implement our proposals. The most recent was at the end of 2009 to the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Termination Payment) Bill.


The measures we have proposed include: a cap on total executive remuneration of $5 million to stop the excesses of the past decade but also to ensure that the majority of executives continue to enjoy attractive remuneration packages. The limit that we have proposed is more than 10 times the Prime Minister's salary. We have also proposed: a remuneration formula to set executive pay at 30 times the average employee's wage; a top marginal tax rate of 50 per cent for incomes over $1 million a year; and a binding shareholder vote on company remuneration policy. The policy would set minimum standards to be included in remuneration packages which would, in turn, place limits on the size of remuneration packages covering base salaries, performance and termination pay and non-cash rewards. We believe that these measures are sensible and, if implemented, would have already started to rein in excessive executive salaries.


Unfortunately, the government and the opposition have not had the courage to take strong action on this problem and support our measures. Instead, we have before us this bill today. The bill implements a number of the recommendations from the Productivity Commission's report from 2009on executive remuneration. The key measure in the bill is the two strike non-binding vote of shareholders on the remuneration report leading to a spill of the board.


The first strike will occur when a company's remuneration report receives a no vote of 25 per cent or more. When this occurs, the company's subsequent remuneration report, the next year, must include an explanation of the board's proposed actions in response to the no vote or an explanation of why no action has been taken.


The second strike occurs when a company's subsequent remuneration report receives a no vote of 25 per cent or more. When this occurs, shareholders will vote at the same AGM to determine whether the directors will need to stand for re-election. If this spill resolution passes with 50 per cent or more of eligible votes cast, then the spill meeting will take place within 90 days.


While this is a step forward from where we are now, the Greens would prefer a binding vote of shareholders on remuneration policy which would set limits and give the shareholders that ability to configure payments in accordance with common sense. Under the provisions in the bill the potential for a spill of the board takes two votes at subsequent annual general meetings of shareholders expressing their concern with the remuneration of executives. There is, therefore, a significant amount of time between shareholders expressing displeasure and being in a position to act. During this time CEOs can continue to be paid obscene salaries.


We understand the arguments put by the Productivity Commission against a binding vote, including that a binding vote would provide significant practical difficulties such as companies not being able to finalise a contract with an executive until shareholder approval was obtained, and could result in a deadlock arising between shareholders and the board regarding the appropriate levels of executive remuneration. We appreciate that the government's position is to encourage cultural change in large corporations regarding executive remuneration. However, we continue to hold reservations that these measures will in practical terms work to stop the excessive salaries that I have outlined today. We will be watching carefully how this process works in practice and the extent to which it does create cultural change and rein in executive remuneration packages.


The Greens support the other measures in the bill to increase transparency with regard to executive remuneration. These include: increasing transparency and accountability with respect to the use of remuneration consultants, in particular, that remuneration consultants report to non-executive directors or the remuneration committee; addressing conflicts of interests that exist with directors and executives voting their shares on remuneration resolutions. We agree that directors and executives with voting shares should not be allowed to vote on the remuneration reports. We also support: ensuring that remuneration remains linked to performance by prohibiting hedging of incentive remuneration; requiring shareholder approval for declarations of no vacancy at an annual general meeting; prohibiting proxy holders from cherry-picking the proxies they exercise by requiring that any directed proxies that are not voted default to the chair, who is required to vote the proxies as directed; and reducing the complexity of the remuneration report by confining disclosures in the report to the key management personnel.


These measures also go to implementing some of the principles of executive remuneration agreed to by the G20 in September 2009. They will improve the way companies go about determining remuneration for executives, and the increased transparency of these measures is to be welcomed. However, this must be just the first step. Unless we move to serious caps and stronger regulation of executive salaries we will not begin to address the growing inequality we are experiencing in this country.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:50):  I rise to support the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. The global financial crisis around the world put a spotlight on and exposed some of the excessive remuneration packages of company directors and executives.


In Australia in the last 30 years the relativities between the average wage and executive pay have grown exponentially. In fact, CEO salaries of Australia's largest 300 listed companies rose by 28 per cent in 2006-07. This is compared to the average full-time income growth of 3.4 per cent over the same period. So there is a significant difference between the rise in CEO salaries and income growth. The community in Australia has registered its concern about this increase in disparity between the average wage income earner and the rise in CEO salaries.


In the financial year just passed, companies on the S&P ASX 100 that filed remuneration reports revealed an average executive salary rise of 12 per cent with the highest being 93 per cent. These pay rises have all occurred despite difficult times and under difficult conditions, with CEOs, at the same time, calling for wage constraint for ordinary workers. It is important that the community is listened to when it comes to executive remuneration and that steps are taken to ensure that these salaries do get recognised. We need to ensure that regulation is made to make sure that they are fair and right and that shareholders get their voices listened to. I am also certain that members of the House will recall the exposure of unreasonable termination benefits being afforded to departing directors of companies not long after the global financial crisis. The government addressed this issue in its 2009 announcement of reforms aimed at curbing these excessive golden handshake payments. The bill before the House seeks to build on those reforms by further strengthening Australia's remuneration framework. It is disappointing that while the opposition state that they agree with the government their amendments effectively aim to keep the status quo. I do hope that the opposition comes to their senses, listen to community expectations and support the bill before the House.


The bill will amend current limitations in order to provide shareholders with more control over the pay of directors. Shareholders are the legal owners of a company in which they invest. In doing so, they take ownership of the company's risk and also share in the company's profit and loss. Shareholders therefore deserve more control over how the pay of company executives is decided. This bill seeks to empower shareholders to influence their company's remuneration decisions by, firstly, introducing a two-strikes test.


The current Corporations Act requires listed companies to put their remuneration report to a non-binding shareholder vote at an annual general meeting. However, shareholders have no means of recourse should they implement a strong 'no' vote which is then ignored by the company board. Under the bill before the House, the first strike will be initiated in the instance where a company's remuneration report receives a 'no' vote of 25 per cent or more. This results in the company being required to provide direct evidence of the shareholders' concerns having been addressed or an outline as to why they have not. If shareholders remain dissatisfied and another vote results in a 'no' vote of 25 per cent or more then the second strike is triggered. The second strike gives shareholders the opportunity to vote on a resolution to spill the board and subject directors to re-election. If the spill resolution is passed by more than 50 per cent then a spill meeting will provide shareholders with the opportunity to vote on the re-election of each director. The two-strikes test is an important measure that finally holds unresponsive directors accountable for the decisions they make on executive remuneration.


This bill also seeks to ensure that consultation between remuneration consultants and company executives remains transparent. A company's remuneration consultant will be required to declare that their recommendations are free from undue influence. As a means of ensuring further transparency, these recommendations will be provided to non-executive directors or the remuneration committee, rather than to the company's executive directors. The company will also be required to disclose details regarding the consultant used and the amount they were paid. These measures are focused on ensuring accountability and transparency within the remuneration framework. Shareholders have a right to be in a position to assess any potential conflict of interest, and this bill takes important steps towards ensuring that this remains the case.


As a means of further reducing conflicts of interest, this bill also prohibits company directors and executives from voting on the remuneration report or the spill resolution. Directors and executives no doubt have an interest in approving their own remuneration agreements. Doing so affords them a considerable amount of power concerning their company's remuneration framework. This clearly represents a conflict of interest, and the measures proposed in this bill seek to remove that conflict.


In line with the government's reforms to termination benefits, this bill also seeks to ensure that executive remuneration remains linked to performance. Incentive remuneration is designed to align directors' and executives' interests with those of shareholders; however, the hedging of incentive payments can severely skew this relationship. Directors and executives are currently able to hedge their exposure to incentive remuneration by entering into third-party contracts and effectively mitigating their personal financial interest in their company's success. The use of hedging is completely inconsistent with the values of Australia's remuneration framework. However, perhaps more concerning is the real, as well as the perceived, conflict of interest that arises when a director or executive enters into hedging arrangements. Such an arrangement may stand to see the director or executive benefit from a fall in their company's share price. Hedging by directors or executives distorts their responsibilities to their shareholders. The measures in this bill will ensure that the interests of shareholders and of the company's directors and executives remain synchronised.


The bill also introduces a measure that prevents boards from announcing 'no vacancy' without the approval of its shareholders. This is an important step towards transferring company decision-making power back to shareholders. The no vacancy rule currently allows boards to govern the composition of the board and makes it difficult, if not impossible, for non-board-endorsed candidates to be elected. This promotes unaccountability from directors and executives and leaves shareholders without a voice, given that any candidate seeking to promote change within a company can essentially be prevented from reaching a board position that would allow them to instigate such change.


The bill also introduces an amendment which will ensure the enfranchisement of every shareholder who chooses to vote at an annual general meeting. Currently, all directors except for the chair have the ability to disregard proxy votes that do not align with their personal views regarding a resolution. Indeed, annual general meetings can be held at times or locations that are not convenient for all shareholders. As such, many shareholders who are unable to attend in person are able to indicate their position by a proxy vote. These votes should be given just as much weighting as a vote from a shareholder present at the meeting. However, instead, these votes can currently be disregarded at a director's discretion. This cherry picking of votes from shareholders who have made specific declarations concerning their vote inevitably results in outcomes that by no means clearly represent the sentiment of shareholders. This bill will ensure that the outcome of a resolution vote reflects shareholder views rather than the cherry picked views of directors. In conclusion, under request from the government, the Productivity Commission undertook a broad review of Australia's remuneration framework. The nine-month review process, which included a total of 170 submissions and a series of public hearings, revealed that Australia's corporate governance and remuneration framework are ranked highly on an international scale. However, it also recommended a range of reforms to further strengthen Australia's remuneration framework.


The bill before the House today effectively responds to these recommendations. It will provide shareholders with a new level of power and ultimately improve the transparency and accountability of company directors and executives. It addresses the conflicts of interest that arise throughout the remuneration process and ensures that the sentiments of shareholders are appropriately represented by directors and executives.


While Australia's remuneration framework is certainly strong, these innovative reforms will eliminate complacency and ensure that it remains effective well into the future. It will better reflect community standards when it comes to remuneration and pay of company executives, and I therefore commend the bill to the House.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:01):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011, and I commend the member for Kingston for the remarks she has just made on the bill in this place.


In recent years public anger about excessive salaries and executive payouts has been widespread. Whilst the spotlight has been taken off executive salaries in recent times there is little, if any, justification for some of the remuneration we are still seeing. Nor is this issue just a matter for company shareholders. It is a matter that the wider community has a right to take an interest in, because in most cases the remuneration packages for senior executives have direct implications for the broader community. That is why this is a public interest issue, and why those people who argue that private sector remuneration is a matter for the private sector and not the business of government are wrong. It is the argument about why this is a matter of public interest that I will address in my remarks on this bill.


Possibly every senior management appointment today is tied to performance, either by way of a performance bonus or simply because renewal of the employment contract is directly tied to performance. In the private sector the most used measure of performance and certainly the most persuasive is the annual profit or loss statement. Generally, the higher the profits the better the performance is considered. That is what most company owners and shareholders are driven by. Profit can be and usually is made from a range of actions, but when any of those actions are extreme or irresponsible it is the public that inevitably ends up paying one way or another. And therein lies the public interest test—a test that could be applied time and again, using many examples in numerous industry sectors over recent years.


We have seen farmers being squeezed by monopoly retailers, manufacturers transferring their operations overseas, high-risk loan arrangements or investment schemes, construction shortcuts where safety standards are not complied with, transport industry drivers placed under unreasonable delivery deadlines, and collusion or similar practices and possibly corruption creeping into industry practices. Cutting costs and increasing sales are strategies almost universally implemented in business to increase profits—and I will speak more about both these matters. Cutting costs and reducing overheads can be achieved by investing in modernisation strategies, upskilling the workforce, streamlining production and other forward-thinking responsible strategies. The alternatives are reducing labour costs, not complying with regulatory standards, using inferior componentry, taking extreme risks and other irresponsible measures—all of which appear to have become commonplace in business.


I turn now to labour costs. Labour costs are frequently cut by placing unreasonable demands on workers, including longer working hours, which are often unpaid; by reducing the workforce numbers and working employees harder; by paying workers less than fair wages; by subcontracting work out; and by taking work offshore. It is all about squeezing more out of the labour force. The social costs of unemployment, housing, health and family breakdown, which inevitably follow when operations are transferred offshore, workers are placed under unreasonable work pressure, or work is subcontracted out so employers are no longer responsible for work conditions are all examples of where the consequences are inevitably paid for by the rest of society.


We saw the collapse of the financial system because of high-risk lending practices or high-risk investment schemes. This was driven by executives who were in turn motivated by increased profits. Hardworking people lost their homes, their health, their savings and sometimes their lives because of the decisions of highly remunerated executives. In the five years prior to the 2008 global financial crisis, senior executives of the five largest financial institutions in Wall Street were paid $3.6 billion in remuneration. They profited whilst others lost everything. They were rewarded for their failure.


I turn now to the transport sector. Each year around 300 lives are lost and about 5,500 are injured because of cost-cutting in the transport sector. I quote from a submission from the Transport Workers Union from February this year on this very matter:


Each road death costs $1.7 million. Each injury in an incident costs $408 000. When the non-monetised social impact of road deaths, injuries and illness, family breakdown, pain and suffering is included in the measurement of what road deaths and injuries cost the community—


The damages bill is immeasurable. The report attributes the cause of the road transport safety crisis to economic factors; namely, the low level of driver remuneration and their methods of payment. As made clear in the NTC report, the high level of control exercised by clients over price, timing, destination and route causes operators to bear the costs that, ordinarily, are borne by customers. Denied a proper return, let alone a margin that exceeds the cost of capital, operators undercut each other, bid the price of transport down and attempt to recoup the losses caused by clients from drivers by not paying them for all work performed and by paying them through incentive rates. It says:


Because employment is too often conditional on strict compliance with an operator's direction and client deadlines, drivers are prone to drive while fatigued, to speed, to take drugs and to skimp on maintenance.


All of that arises because someone is trying to make a profit. Usually the CEO or an executive is the person driving that to the point that they do.


Mining and construction workers' lives have been put at risk and lives lost or injured because of work practices imposed by employers. The recent spate of mining tragedies exposes some of these practices. In the building and construction sector, each year around 50 lives are lost and around 75,000 workers are injured through accidents, which in most cases are foreseeable and avoidable and which can be attributed to cost cutting. Yet people like Ark Tribe were taken to court for standing up for their right to a safe work environment.


In food production, farm producers are squeezed for lower prices by the major grocery retailers in turn placing hardship and stress on farming families. The current milk price war has been linked to the executive remuneration of the Coles CEO with allegations that the Coles CEO will be paid millions of dollars if he increases the Coles profit. Discounting milk is a strategy currently being employed by Coles to increase market share of grocery sales and ultimately the Coles profit. The Australian dairy farmers say the discounted milk is already reducing the income of dairy farmers and threatens their ongoing viability. This is a claim that Coles is disputing of course. We have also seen farm products being sourced from overseas where production standards do not meet Australian standards, which in turn leads to health impacts on Australian consumers and a demise of Australian food production. Again these are decisions made by executives whose primary interest is profit. The impact on Australian farmers and the health impacts on Australian consumers are ultimately borne by governments.


Another of the very concerning trends in recent times has been the use of overseas registered shipping and crews. We have now had several cases of extensive environmental disasters that have been attributed to cost-cutting decisions made by executives who are driven by profit. The environmental disaster on the Great Barrier Reef when a Chinese coal carrier ran aground, spilling about four tonnes of heavy fuel oil from a perforated fuel tank, has been attributed to a seaman being fatigued, having managed only 2½ hours of sleep in the previous 38½ hours. In February this year there was another shipping incident. It was associated with the multi-cat vessel Boskalis BKM 102 whilst working on the Gorgon project off Barrow Island. The four MUA crew members were put at risk and the pristine environment was badly polluted, because of the shoddy practices of the overseas shipping company. In addition, there was the Montara oil spill, which occurred in the Timor Sea on 21 August 2009 and continued right up until November 2009. I understand that Indonesia and East Timor are now seeking compensation for the extensive environmental damage done. Even if they are successful as to compensation and even if penalties are imposed, the reality is that the bulk of the environmental damage cost inevitably will fall onto governments and society.


The measures in this bill provide increased accountability by CEOs to shareholders and conversely give shareholders more control over executive remuneration, and they will be welcomed by many Australians. It is my view that most shareholders do not endorse the kinds of practices that I have alluded to in my remarks. It is my view that most shareholders want to see their executives acting responsibly. Time will enable us to determine whether the measures in this bill are sufficient to ensure the right level of accountability by CEOs. It is my view that many CEOs are still grossly overremunerated and I would consider supporting additional measures that I believe could be taken to curb excessive CEO remuneration packages. I note the comments of members opposite and I understand that they intend moving an amendment. I also note comments they believe that essentially the government should not meddle in private enterprise. These comments were made by a number of these speakers. I reject that proposition. I believe that this legislation is a step in the right direction, and I commend it to the House.


Debate adjourned.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"




Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (09:41):  The Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011 is a step forward in ensuring that shareholders and Australians generally have faith in the accountability of directors and senior executives of Australian companies and, most importantly, in the fairness of their pay. It does this not by regulation but by an approach that respects the need for firms to operate freely in the market, at the same time giving shareholders the power they need to make sure that senior executives truly earn their pay.


This is far from the only area in which this government shows a decisive preference for market based solutions over regulation, a preference one would hope would be more widely shared and appreciated by those opposite. I say 'appreciated' because, just listening to this debate in the last few days and last night particularly, my colleagues in the Labor government were portrayed as crazy red raggers living in some socialist nirvana: every morning we leap out of bed, flick through our copy of the little red book, read out our favourite passages, sing a few rounds of The Internationale and then march off to work under the fluttering banner of the Soviet flag.




Mr Husic:
  That is what I do!




Ms BRODTMANN:
  Is that what you do? Was that this morning? Okay! I remind those opposite of what the Labor government—not just this Labor government but also Labor governments in the past—has done in introducing market based solutions for this country. In the 1980s we opened up the economy, we opened up markets, we opened up banks and we opened up the country, particularly to the Asia-Pacific. We cut protection. Most recently, since 2007 we have saved this economy from the global financial crisis. I hardly regard that as some sort of mad, red-ragging socialist bunch of people crazily singing The Internationale every morning.


The issue of remuneration has been at the forefront of the minds of shareholders and the Australian community for some time, an issue more pressing following the corporate collapses associated with the global financial crisis. People around the world were rightly outraged that senior executives continued to receive large pay packages—so-called performance bonuses and golden parachutes—at a time when their companies were failing, leaving many average employees without jobs and their homes at risk. We in this country were spared the full extent of the effects of the global financial crisis thanks to the quick actions of the Labor government. But Australians remain highly concerned about the rates of executive pay. This concern is sharpened by the disparity between the pay packets of senior executives and those of average Australian working families. I am struck by the Productivity Commission's findings on this. The Productivity Commission reports that the top CEOs of Australian public companies receive pay some 110 times average Australian weekly earnings. This compares with the earnings of the CEOs of Australia's smallest companies of just four times average Australian weekly earnings. In some cases, CEO remuneration grew by as much as 300 per cent in real terms between 1993 and 2007.


Australians do not have a problem with other hardworking individuals earning more pay than they do. But they do have a problem with these remuneration packages, bonus schemes and golden parachutes being bestowed regardless of the actual performance of the individual. Given this, it is easy to understand why these packages are so hard for people to accept. We should not be surprised at the level of anger and mistrust that exists over this issue. Such mistrust is not healthy, as it undermines the basic strong sense of fairness that Australians have and the trust that is needed for a society based on the free market to function.


There have been efforts in the past to ensure that management teams look after the best interests of shareholders, principally by linking performance to share value. This worked up to a point. But research shows that this linkage has been distorted. It has emerged that there are a number of factors that go into the calculation of remuneration, some of which are reasonable, some of which are the result of what can only be described as gaming. As the Productivity Commission mentioned, while local shareholder value plummeted in 2008 as the result of the GFC, the imported crisis, with some countries and sectors being propped up by taxpayers, executive pay seemed to emerge unscathed, crystallising a view that executives were being rewarded for failure after having been rewarded for success.


The argument that these packages are required to acquire and keep the best talent is also not supported by available evidence. One journal article notes that there is a turnover rate for senior executives of between four per cent and six per cent. The article states that it is a matter of judgment whether a turnover rate of five per cent is sufficient to create market pressure to raise levels of compensation by itself. It is also questionable whether independent remuneration committees are by themselves capable of better linking performance with reward, given some of the biases and conflicts of interest that may result. In fact, Jennifer Hill and Charles Yablon, who are regular commentators on this issue, have noted that even carefully constructed remuneration packages will frequently provide corporate manager with incentives to use their strategic advantage within the company to prefer their own interests over those of the shareholders.


This bill seeks to address these problems and allay the concerns of shareholders and Australians as a whole by implementing changes to the Corporations Act recommended by the Productivity Commission. It seeks to address the imbalance between shareholders and management and provide some much-needed help to ensure that boards are responsive to the concerns of shareholders. But rather than imposing a government limit on remuneration this bill seeks to make boards more accountable for their decisions on pay, improve the manner in which conflicts are dealt with and increase transparency and accountability in executive remuneration matters.


It achieves these things by introducing the so-called three-strikes test. This test creates a process by which directors will face a spill motion on their position if over two consecutive years a company's remuneration report has been rejected by 25 per cent or more of the votes. Should this spill motion be passed, directors will need to seek re-election at a spill meeting within 90 days of the AGM. This will make directors accountable for their decisions and responsive to their shareholders.


This bill also seeks to bring greater transparency to the role of remuneration consultants. This measure reflects the concern expressed by some shareholders that remuneration consultants are placed in a potential conflict situation when they have to provide their advice, in the first instance, to the very managers who are responsible for signing off on their services in the future. Obviously, this has the potential to create a situation whereby the consultant may feel constrained in what advice they can provide. To counter this potential conflict, this legislation will require that the reports of independent consultants go first to the non-executive directors or a remuneration committee rather than company executives.


This bill also seeks to eliminate situations where key management personnel or closely related parties are voting on pay issues. The bill will prohibit such parties from voting on non-binding remuneration votes, which otherwise may distort the results and diminish their effectiveness as a feedback mechanism.


The government is also committed to strengthening the link between performance and remuneration. That is a really important point to make. This bill will prohibit directors and senior executives from hedging their incentive remuneration. It is currently possible for a director or senior executive to hedge their exposure to incentive remuneration, thereby effectively bypassing the link between performance and pay. This is not consistent with the principles underlying a remuneration framework that seeks to ensure pay is fairly linked to achievement. I do not think that that is too much to ask.


This bill is a comprehensive approach to the issues of remuneration of Australian boards and senior executives. It seeks to answer the questions and concerns of the community and shareholders over the issues of excessive executive pay, particularly in the light of poor performance. It does this without placing restrictive or draconian regulation on companies or by interfering drastically in the marketplace. I want to underscore that point, because from the way that the people opposite have been talking it seems that they view it as quite the contrary. It does not interfere in the marketplace. This bill enhances Australia's corporate governance framework, particularly transparency. It provides shareholders with the power they need to effectively monitor their own companies to ensure that boards and senior executives are delivering on the organisational outcomes and are rewarded accordingly. It gives shareholders the power to say no to packages that reward failure or poor performance, and it improves the governance of companies to ensure better reward for good performance and no reward for failure. Most importantly, it benefits not only shareholders but the economy as a whole. The benefits of this legislation are clear, and I commend it to the House.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (09:52):  I rise today to talk on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. The coalition will not oppose this bill but we will seek to make an important amendment to it. We will do that to make sure that we get the balance right in this bill. While we are broadly supportive of the objective to achieve better alignment between shareholders and boards on the issue of executive remuneration, we are concerned about the potential for unintended consequences which can flow from excessive and overly prescriptive regulation in this area—and, sadly, the Labor government have a strong history of excessive and overly prescriptive regulation. They continue to want to throttle the life out of business in Australia, and that is why we have to make sure that we get the balance right in this bill.


This bill implements recommendations of the Productivity Commission in its recent inquiry into executive remuneration in Australia, which reported on 4 January 2010. Concern around the issue of executive remuneration led to the review by the Productivity Commission. The review commenced in 2009 and received 170 submissions, showing that this is an issue which the community and the business community take incredibly seriously. The final report was provided to the Australian government on 19 December 2009.


An exposure draft elicited further comment and changes to the proposed legislation. The bill's main provisions include requiring a vote for directors to stand for re-election if they do not adequately address shareholder concerns on remuneration issues over two consecutive years, the so-called two-strikes rule; changing regulation with respect to the use of remuneration consultants; prohibiting directors and executives from voting their shares on remuneration resolutions; prohibiting the hedging of incentive remuneration; requiring shareholder approval for declarations of 'no vacancy' at an annual general meeting; requiring that any directed proxies are voted and voted as directed; and reducing the complexity of the remuneration report by confining disclosures in the report to the key management personnel.


Change to voting arrangements must be careful not to distort the wishes of the majority of shareholders. The views of a minority should not too easily hold the majority hostage. When it comes to the level of support required to reject a remuneration report, a process that can lead to a spill of the board, we believe the bar has been set too low. We believe that an active minority could disrupt company proceedings if this bill is passed as it is.


We will be moving an amendment in relation to the threshold for rejecting the remuneration report. As currently proposed, the threshold for the two-strikes rule is 25 per cent of votes cast. The coalition will be moving an amendment to require the threshold to be 25 per cent of the total votes available to be cast, and this is an important amendment. Twenty-five per cent of the votes cast means that you could have seven per cent of company shareholders voting to remove a board. This is dangerous because, if you had an active minority wanting to disrupt the ongoing proceedings of a company, with this threshold they could do just that. We want to introduce an amendment which provides a sensible safeguard. Moving to a threshold of 25 per cent of the total votes available to be cast seems to me a very sensible proposition and one which the House and the parliament should be able to agree on. As I have said, this will prevent a small number of shareholders dictating a result which is not shared by a majority of the passive non-voting shareholders. We will not oppose this bill but we want to make a sensible amendment which provides balance to it. I urge the House and the parliament to support our amendment.

"Smyth, Laura, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (09:58):  I am very pleased to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2010, which strikes such a sensible balance in the community debate around director and executive salaries, bonuses and incentives. I am also pleased to see that the opposition will ultimately be supporting the bulk of this legislation, although, given the remarks of some of those speakers during the course of this debate, it has obviously been quite a struggle to reach that very reasonable view. I have been particularly interested to hear remarks from opposition members in the debate about overregulation, which is quite a curious line of argument for a group of people who are ultimately going to support this bill. I really have to admire the ability of those members opposite who ran that line of argument with no shame. It is quite a balancing act and quite a skill. Some of those opposite seem to think that the coalition had a marvellous track record in minimising regulation when in government. I suspect that those members were possibly harking back to the wafer-thin volume of Work Choices regulations, or possibly the mere pamphlet that was John Howard's GST legislation. I really have a feeling that, during the break, some members opposite have been passing around old Family Ties DVDs, because there is more than a little bit of Alex P Keaton in the debate we have seen from the other side of the chamber, both in this session and at the end of the last. They seem to still be convinced by a curious and entirely fictional notion that they stand for small government and lessening regulation—and, suddenly, Reagan is back in the White House. They may want to have a quick recap on some of the regulatory interventions of the Howard government during its decade and more in office to perhaps disabuse themselves of that view. In any event, it is more than a little disingenuous to come to this place and masquerade as a free marketeer and then proceed to support the legislation with little more than a fig leaf amendment. But I will leave all that aside now because, as with so many other things, the opposition's views on this legislation ultimately will not rate, even as a footnote.


This legislation developed by the government is a timely and even-handed regulatory response to genuine community concerns about executive remuneration. Those concerns came to the fore during the global financial crisis. Members of the opposition have said that we should not try to drag down people who have done well for themselves—that is, executives who have been paid significant sums—as though that was the intention of the legislation. No, it is about making sure that mums and dads, self-funded retirees and all others who invest in shares directly and indirectly can be confident that the savings they have scraped together to buy a few shares are not being squandered and that the companies they invest in are being managed sensibly and prudently.


Obviously this legislation will have consequences for remuneration itself. But, more importantly, the legislation is focused on ensuring the confidence of the community generally, and investors in equities in particular, in the prudent management of the companies in which so many Australians invest their earnings. The bill responds to both the matters raised during the Productivity Commission inquiry on this issue and the findings of the commission. The commission took into account very wide-ranging submissions from the community, after extensive consultation. It noted in its report that the prime motivation for its enquiry was a 'widespread perception that executives have been rewarded for failure or simply good luck'. The report goes on to say that 'certainly in some periods and for some CEOs, pay outcomes appear inconsistent with a reasonably efficient executive labour market'. This is reflected in the submission made to the enquiry by Professor David Peetz, of Griffith University. Professor Peetz's submission notes that the growth rate of CEO pay between 1971 and 2008 was around 470 per cent, while for the same period average weekly earnings growth was around 54per cent. On any sensible view, members will certainly realise that that is out of kilter with community expectations about what are reasonable levels of pay for CEOs.


The Productivity Commission noted:


If the community came to regard executive pay as the product of poor corporate governance or weak regulation, this could undermine public confidence in the corporate sector itself, potentially detracting from the ability to raise equity capital and distorting the allocation in investment funds.


This is a genuinely held concern about maintaining public confidence in our companies. It goes to whether people will believe that putting their money into shares is a good prospect, whether it will generate a good return or whether it will simply prop up inefficient and overpaid executives. These are reasons why a regulatory response of a balanced and reasonable kind that is being presented here today is responsible and timely.


The Productivity Commission considered that certain trends in executive and director remuneration in Australia were inconsistent with effective executive labour markets and may actually have had the effect of weakening company performance. In particular, it cited incentive payments and termination payments as examples of such trends, noting that certain executive incentive payments may have delivered an unintended upside and that some termination payments considered by the Productivity Commission seemed excessive. Although the commission ultimately found that Australia's existing corporate governance and remuneration framework does rank highly internationally, it made various recommendations to improve that framework; many of those recommendations are reflected in the bill before us.


Members will recall that, in early 2009, this government announced reforms to limit excessive termination benefits given to outgoing directors and executives. This was the beginning of reform in this area and we are now taking the next steps. My own experience in working with boards, and in relation to corporate governance, does lead me to expect that most company boards will act appropriately in relation to director and executive pay and that they will and do give due regard to the expectations of shareholders. We know that many boards are already very mindful of their responsibilities and community expectations in this regard. We also know that they take very seriously their commitments to corporate social responsibility. It will be only those boards which are out of step with the kinds of shareholder expectations and community standards which are likely to be subject to the two strikes provisions of the bill. So I do consider that the bill reaches a very sensible balance between the interests of shareholders, the expectations of the wider community and the desire of businesses to give incentives to their executives to generate growth.


Importantly, this bill will enable shareholders to hold directors to account for their decisions on executive salaries. It will better enable conflicts of interest in the remuneration-setting process to be addressed. It will increase transparency and accountability in matters of executive pay. It is appropriate that shareholders, who ultimately bear the risk associated with the performance of companies in which they hold equity, have an opportunity to thoroughly scrutinise remuneration packages. The bill does this and provides for those safeguards and balancing measures through a variety of means. Speakers on this side in the debate have already referred to the two-strikes test, which would arise in the context of a company putting its remuneration to shareholder vote. It is a measure that is consistent with the underlying expectations in the Corporations Act that directors will be responsible for, and accountable to, shareholders in relation to all aspects of the management of a company, including executive remuneration.


As we have heard, the bill also includes measures relating to remuneration consultants, which will deliver greater transparency for shareholders as they will be in a position to assess potential conflicts of interest in a more successful way. The bill will help to prevent conflicts of interest by prohibiting key management personnel and their related shareholding entities from voting on remuneration related resolutions. The bill also seeks to ensure that the link between remuneration and performance is maintained by prohibiting directors and executives from hedging any incentive remuneration afforded to them. Finally, the bill contains measures to limit the remuneration details required to be disclosed in the remuneration report to the key management personnel of the consolidated entity. This simplifies the disclosures in the remuneration report to enable shareholders to better assess and understand the company's remuneration arrangements. It is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on companies, while maintaining an appropriate level of accountability.


In conclusion, despite the observations made by those on-again off-again free marketeers on the opposition benches about overregulation, members should understand that this bill strikes a balance between the interests of shareholders, the expectations of the wider community and a desire of business to give appropriate incentives to their executives to generate growth. It goes no further in amending the Corporations Act than is necessary to achieve those very eminently sensible aims.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2011-05-11,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (10:08):   I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill arises out of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission report into executive remuneration. It reported on 4 January 2010, and this bill aims to implement its recommendations. We on this side of the House support the intent of this bill, and the coalition will not be opposing the bill. However, I have some reservations in relation to it which I would like to outline today. Some of the measures are overly prescriptive and I am not convinced they will actually be effective in addressing the particular problem which we are concerned about.


To properly assess this bill, there are three questions that we should be asking. First, what are the problems that we are trying to fix? Second, are the existing mechanisms sufficient to fix those problems? Third, will the proposals that are on the table in this bill work to fix the problems? I would like to go through each of those three questions in turn.


First of all, what are the problems that this bill is trying to fix? There is a community concern with executive salaries, particularly those for publicly listed companies. There are many senior executives in this country who are earning very large amounts of money on an annual basis. There are about nine people in the banking sector, I understand, who earn above $5 million per annum. In the mining sector, there are people earning up to $15 million or $16 million per annum who are heading up publicly listed companies. The managing director of Coles apparently earns in excess of $8 million.


These are extraordinary amounts of money by anyone's measure. I personally struggle to see how anyone is worth that amount of money, but a high salary alone does not necessarily mean there is a problem. The owners of a company should be able to pay whatever they believe is appropriate to their executives. After all, it is their company. If the owners of the company believe that their CEO should be paid $500,000, that is their decision. It should not be the job of the government to interfere with those decisions of the owners of companies to determine what the appropriate remuneration is for their executives. A problem only exists if the board, which sets the salary on behalf of the owners of the company, the shareholders, is not acting in the best interests of the shareholders in setting that remuneration—that is, there is an agency problem there or a conflict of interest arises.


The government has not presented coherent evidence that directors of Australian companies are indeed acting against the interests of their shareholders when setting executive remuneration. However, there is certainly a belief that sometimes this is the case, and I believe that it is sometimes the case, particularly when executives are remunerated very highly despite the fact that a business might be collapsing, or when an executive receives a large bonus when that executive may not have had much to do with the performance of a company but rather it is due to, for example, commodity prices increasing or due to a government regulation which has underpinned the performance of that particular company.


That brings me to my second question: are the existing mechanisms available to fix the problem sufficient? As parliamentarians, we need to ensure that shareholders have appropriate degrees of protection and appropriate regulations to ensure that their interests and the interests of directors and executives are aligned. Shareholders need to be properly informed and properly empowered. But what are the existing mechanisms and are they sufficient? Already in the Corporations Act there are several mechanisms. There are the fiduciary duties. Directors have a legal obligation to act in the best interests of their shareholders, and there are some quite significant penalties if they do not do that. Second, there are some protections for minority interests in the Corporations Law. Finally, there is the ability for shareholders to sack directors if they do not believe that the directors are adequately representing their interests or if they have any concern in relation to the actions of the directors.



All of those are available presently. However, for small shareholders I understand that it is difficult to access some of those provisions. However, those provisions in the Corporations Law are the basic building blocks of the law that exist presently. What the Productivity Commission says is that, despite the presence of those existing protections, there is at least the opportunity for perception of conflicts of interest to arise and that this should be addressed directly. I support those intentions. That brings me to my third question: will the proposals on the table in the form of this bill actually fix the problem? There are seven measures in this bill and, while some of them are worthwhile, I do have reservations about whether they will make a decisive impact and I do believe that there will be some negative impacts associated with some of the provisions. The seven measures, all up, are intended to empower shareholders and prevent any real or perceived conflicts of interest. That intent is a good one, but we need to look at the details to determine whether or not that intent is actually delivered upon and whether or not the downsides of being overly prescriptive will outweigh the benefits.


Some of the seven measures do seem immediately sensible, in fact so sensible that it is surprising that some companies are not enacting these measures already. For example, one of the measures prevents key management personnel and parties closely related to them from participating in non-binding shareholder votes on remuneration and on spill resolutions. Clearly there would be a perception of a conflict of interest if the beneficiaries of the remuneration report were to vote on that remuneration report. So this seems to be a sensible provision.


Second, the bill will prohibit an executive hedging his or her executive remuneration. These days, executive remuneration is structured so that the interests of the executive are very closely aligned with the interests of the shareholders—so, if shareholders do well, the executive should be better remunerated. But there have been instances where some executives have taken hedges on the side such that their interests are less aligned, meaning that a change in shareholder interests will not have the same impact on the remuneration of those individuals. This particular measure will outlaw executives hedging against their remuneration structure. Again that seems like a reasonable and sensible thing to do and again I am surprised that directors would indeed today allow their executives to hedge against the executive remuneration incentives.


I think the cherry-picking rules included in this bill are also sensible as they also will empower shareholders. With some of the other measures, however, I question the impact. I have reservations about whether they will make a significant difference in addressing the problem of unaligned interests between shareholders and directors and I do not think that executive remuneration as a whole will come down as a result of this bill.


There are also some potential downsides to this bill. Overall it does add to the regulatory burden and the measures are very prescriptive. Joe Hockey, when introducing the coalition's response to this bill, said:


The best way to support business is often for the government to get out of the way.


I think we should always be very careful when introducing new regulations on top of all the existing regulations that companies have to abide by. When you look at some of the measures in this bill, they do appear to be very prescriptive. For example, one of the measures dictates how a company is to engage remuneration consultants. It seems to me that for this parliament to be determining how a company should engage remuneration consultants, or any other consultants, is very prescriptive. Surely it is up to the company to determine how it will engage consultants and the terms on which it will engage them? In relation to that provision, the president of the Business Council of Australia pointed out:


This is inevitably going to distract directors from their most important roles, which are not the minutiae of supervising remuneration consultants, but much more important roles of making wise decisions about business direction, major investments and the like.


The no vacancy rule, one of the seven measures of this bill, also has potential downsides. The principle inherent in that provision is again sound, but there are potential downsides in that it will reduce flexibility in how boards operate. Again referring to the Business Council of Australia, they point out that sometimes there are very good reasons to appoint fewer than the maximum number of directors at a particular time—the board may want to limit expenses, the maximum number may be too large to enable effective decision making or the board may be deliberately waiting for someone with a particular specialist expertise to go onto the board. This measure in the bill is going to force the board to make a rapid decision about a vacancy. I also have some concerns in relation to the two-strikes test and how it will operate. Indeed, the coalition will be moving amendments in this regard.


In summary, having gone through the three questions I think we should be asking ourselves to properly assess this bill—is there a problem; are the existing mechanisms sufficient; and will the proposal fix the problems?—I come down marginally in favour of the bill. I hope it will have the impact intended, but I have my doubts. If it achieves nothing else, however, this bill should send a clear message to corporate Australia that the Australian people and its representatives in this parliament are concerned about excessive executive remuneration and that we do want corporations to be responsible in this regard. If corporations get that message and act upon that message, I think that will have more impact on this issue than any regulations we might introduce in this House.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (10:23):  We are here today speaking on this bill for some important policy reasons that have a deep impact on our nation's character and Australia's egalitarian culture and traditions. Executive pay has seen some exceptional growth since the 1990s—around 13 per cent per year in real terms for the top 100 companies and 16 per cent for companies in the ASX top 50. In 2008-09, the estimated total remuneration for CEOs of the top 20 companies was around $7.2 million, or 110 times the average wage. This rapid growth in executive pay has been occurring at the very same time that these companies have been calling for wage restraint for their own employees and in the economy at large and opposition has been expressed to even modest increases in the minimum wage, while their peak organisation, the Business Council of Australia, was barracking for the coalition's unfair Work Choices legislation, which had, as its sole objective, the driving down of wages for ordinary Australian families.


While we are talking about the salaries of the very wealthy in our society, I want to state that I do not think that it is in Australia's national interest for the gap between top-income earners and low- and average-income earners to continue to increase at the rapid pace that we have seen in recent decades.


The bill before the House may go some way towards reigning in the excesses of executive remuneration, but it will not fix the structural problems arising from the existing income divide in Australia. I do not see how it is in anyone's interest if low-income earners are forced to struggle to feed, clothe, house and transport themselves and their families, despite being in full-time paid employment.


As has been noted recently by the Secretary of United Voice, Louise Tarrant, the recent history of Australia's economic development has seen a seen a restructuring of our economy so that risk has increasingly shifted from business and government to individual workers. This shift of risk has occurred through the loss of security of employment and the erosion of workplace protections such as sick leave, minimum hours and penalties.


Indeed, the coalition's Work Choices laws were designed to accelerate that shift of risk even further on to workers. Yet this transfer of risk has occurred at the very same time as corporate executives have increasingly been rewarding themselves for high-risk strategies, in particular through skyrocketing performance pay. That is why improving the accountability and transparency of executive remuneration is a welcome reform to Australia's framework of corporate governance systems for those of us on this side of the House and the constituencies that we represent. We believe that governments have an important role to play to ensure that our market based economy functions efficiently and effectively. That is because we believe that corporations are created by government, not by god, and the laws under which they operate are the laws created by people in this place and not the laws of nature.


Government regulation ensures that our economy works in the way that best reflects the interests of the broader community, of our interests as a society at large. In Australia we are fortunate to have a robust system of regulation in the corporate and financial sector and the measures in this bill represent further sensible and rational reforms to the corporate sector.


The reforms being put forward in this legislation have come about following a thoroughgoing review by the Productivity Commission. I commend the Productivity Commission for their informative report and their contribution to knowledge in this subject area. In their report on executive remuneration, the Productivity Commission noted that Australia's corporate governance and remuneration framework is highly rated internationally.


Our strong system of corporate governance served Australians well through the global financial crisis and it made the difference between the situation we faced in Australia and that faced by other countries in our region and in the Western world. But it is not the nature of a reformist government like ours merely to be complacent and to rest on our laurels. That is why the Gillard government and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the member for Lindsay, have brought this legislation before the House. It is Labor's view that the marketplace in relation to the remuneration of directors and executives is not working effectively as it could or should be. We believe that the appropriate mechanism to redress this is to increase the accountability of boards to the owners of companies—that is, their shareholders.


The measures in the bill before the House contain a number of provisions that will strengthen the accountability of boards and executives to their shareholders. First, the bill introduces a two-strikes rule that will require a board to better respond to shareholder concerns on remuneration issues. The mechanism for this two-strikes rule will be triggered where a company faces a 'no' vote by 25 per cent or more on its remuneration report for two years running. Where this occurs, and the board has not satisfactorily responded to shareholder concerns, that board will be subject to a 'spill' resolution. If more than 50 per cent of eligible shareholders vote to spill the board, there will be a requirement for the directors to stand for re-election at a subsequent meeting within 90 days.


This bill also contains important measures regarding the treatment of remuneration consultants to ensure better accountability and transparency in their role regarding remuneration matters. Transparency will be enhanced because companies will be required to disclose details relating to the use of remunerations consultants, including the consultant used and the payment made to that consultant for the advice or any other advice provided to the company. I fail to see, as the member for Aston said previously, how this is some form or onerous or burdensome regulation on boards, shareholders or companies at large.


In addition, boards will be required to approve the engagement of remuneration consultants and these consultants will be required to report their remuneration recommendation to the non-executive directors of the remuneration committee of the company concerned. Directors and executives will no longer be able to participate in the non-binding shareholder vote on their own remuneration or on the spill motions. This measure will remove a significant conflict of interest—which has been described by members opposite as completely obvious—between directors, executives and their votes in regard to remuneration matters, and it will also extend to votes by key management personnel and their closely related parties in regard to their undirected proxies.


Another common criticism made of executive remuneration is that it has focused too much on rewarding risk and short-term results rather than the long-term performance of the company. This situation was a particular characteristic of corporate behaviour in the United States in the lead-up to the global financial crisis and, regrettably, I believe it has yet to be satisfactorily resolved there, much to the detriment of American civil society. While the situation in Australia does not approach the level of corporate scandal in the United States, it is nevertheless critical to continue to be vigilant about defending the integrity of our system of corporate governance and to ensure that government regulation is working effectively to achieve its aims.


I think the bill before the House today demonstrates that where a system of self-regulation does not work then further regulatory steps need to be taken to guide market mechanisms towards better outcomes. It is a matter of public record that the existing system of non-binding votes has not had the desired effect on the actions of some boards in regards to the remuneration matters in their companies.


The standout example that I am very familiar with here is Telstra, which notoriously in 2007 was repudiated by an outstanding 66 per cent of shareholders for its handling of remuneration matters. The board at the time blithely ignored the vote and shareholders were powerless to do anything about it. The arrogance of the Telstra board in 2007 was shocking and was rightly condemned by many in the financial media and more broadly. It was ironic that at the very same time that this company was taking a very harsh attitude towards the treatment of remuneration for its own employees and their own workplace rights it was operating with complete disregard to community norms, as expressed by its shareholders, in relation to its own executive pay. I know that the current executive team at Telstra are working hard to redress the toxic culture that had developed as a result of previous management regimes and employment practices, and the blithe disrespect and disregard for community values, and everybody welcomes any move towards a more civilised and mutually respectful corporate culture in that company and elsewhere. I can only wish it well in this regard.


There are alternative proposals that have been talked about in this area. Some say that this regulation does not go far enough, and I must say that at times I have had sympathy with that view. The alternative proposal put by members opposite and foreshadowed in their amendment is that we should lift the bar even higher for shareholders—that is, the triggering of the two-strikes rule should not be based on 25 per cent of the votes cast, which would trigger the spill motion and the requisite action of the shareholders, but that it should be based on 25 per cent of the votes that are eligible to be cast at an annual general meeting of a company. Anybody who has had any experience of the practical operation of annual general meetings of most companies, particularly large companies with a large share registry, will know that this lifts the bar to an almost impossible level because it would be a very rare event indeed where 25 per cent of the eligible votes would be cast in a vote on a matter such as this.


While many of those opposite have risen to speak in favour of the sentiment and the intent behind this bill—to put more regulation and give more control to the shareholders to address outrageous remuneration packages by executives—their proposed amendment to this regulation will have quite the opposite effect. It would neuter the effect of the bill and neuter the ability of shareholders to have any real say in controlling the remuneration packages of their directors and executives.


The social contract in Australia that was the bedrock of our culture and our values has been severely challenged as executive pay has skyrocketed in recent decades. We cannot sit by and wring our hands each time we hear of multi-million dollar salaries being paid to corporate executives which are seemingly unrelated to the performance of their companies and the returns to shareholders. That is why I support the sensible measures in the bill before the House today, and that is also why I support the voices of others within the community in their continued campaigns to ensure fairness, security and dignity for all Australian workers, and that we do everything we can to narrow the gaps between the wealthy, the average Australians and the poor in this country.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2011-05-11,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:36):  The health and success of a society is best judged by the level of  equality between its citizens. The gap between the rich and poor, the extent to which someone profits from the labour of others and the capacity of someone to reap enormous wealth at the expense of the Commonwealth have always been a measure of a sustainable and stable society. During the first three-quarters of the 20th century, Australia, like much of the developed world, was narrowing the gap between the highest and lowest incomes. The 1970s were the high point with the gap between rich and poor at its smallest perhaps in centuries, but since then the gap has been growing again, with most of the positive trends of the 20th century wiped out.


Using the Australian Bureau of Statistics we can examine the income distribution between households. If disposable income was equally distributed between households, the bottom 20 per cent of households would have 20 per cent of total income and the top 20 per cent of households would also have 20 per cent of total income. In fact, the latest ABS figures show that the bottom fifth has just seven per cent of the income, whereas the top fifth has more than 40 per cent. And in the four years to 2010, the shares of the four bottom-fifths fell by about 0.5 a percentage point each, allowing the share of the top fifth to rise by two per cent. So why, under both Liberal and Labor governments, has there been this marked increase in inequality?


Economic writer Ross Gittins in last year's ACTU Whitlam lecture outlined this recent data and attempted to answer the question. He said:


No one can say with any certainly. Various factors could have contributed: the resources boom and the booming sharemarket before the global financial crisis, the continued rise in executive and finance-sector salaries and maybe the succession of income-tax cuts that benefited people on high incomes.


But he went on to say:


It would be a mistake to conclude, however, that all families with income sufficient to put them in the top 20 per cent have benefited equally. It’s far more likely that the closer you are to the top of that 20 per cent the better you’ve done. It’s even possible that the share of people in the second-top 10 per cent has declined, as have the shares of the bottom 80 per cent of households.


But it gets worse. According to Gittins, research using income tax statistics show that the top 120th of a per cent of individual taxpayers account for about two per cent of total taxable income. Let's just reflect on that. Someone in the top 0.05 per cent of taxpayers has income about 40 times their proportionate share. Gittins also says:


The top 10th of a per cent accounts for 3 per cent, the top half a per cent for 6 per cent, the top 1 per cent for 9 per cent, the top 5 per cent for 21 per cent and the top 10 per cent for 31 per cent


So in fact it is the growth in income of the very top group of people in the wealthiest 20 per cent of the income band that is driving this growth in inequality. According to Gittins this means:


The shares of these top earners were declining until the early 1980s, but have increased since then, with the share of the top 10 per cent growing from 25 per cent to 31 per cent. Why has this happened? I think it would have to do mainly with the explosion in executive salaries and the phenomenal expansion of the phenomenally paid financial services industry.


While experiencing a short dip post the global financial crisis, executive salaries are continuing to soar, driving up this inequality in Australia. This skyrocketing of executive pay is based on the obscene levels of incentives and bonuses for company executives and has fuelled unsustainable business practices that resulted in the loss of jobs and shareholder wealth. Let's look again at the figures. 


The average total remuneration of a chief executive of a top-50 company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2010 was $6.4 million. This makes the average CEO's total pay packet almost 100 times that of the average worker. This is an obscene difference in remuneration. Why should anyone earn 100 times more than the average worker? Do they work 100 times as hard? Are they carrying out work that is a hundred times more risky, or difficult or dangerous? The reality is executives are being paid this amount because they are able to get away with it and they have been allowed to get away with it.


We can get a greater sense of how unfair this difference is by looking at the increases in executive pay over last financial year. Executive pay rose by an average of almost $1 million, the equivalent of an extra $18,000 per week. Over the same period, the annual average wage for a full-time worker rose by just $3,200, or $62 a week—$18,000 a week compared with $62 dollars a week. Yet we are constantly hearing lectures about the importance of wage restraint and the worry of a wages break-out amongst working people. What does one even do with an extra $18,000 a week? 


This has been a problem for some time with base pay for executives rising by 130 per cent from 2001-2010, while in the same period average weekly earnings only rose by 52 per cent. Inflation over the same period was just 28.6 per cent. Again, we see this incredible difference with average workers gaining modest increases in their pay just keeping above inflation, while the top end of town is raking it in, with a whopping doubling of their pay over the last decade.


Over the previous financial year across the economy, profits also soared by 27.5 per cent. This imbalance is even greater in selected industries. Gross operating profits in mining have risen by 60.6 per cent, while wages grew by just 3.8 per cent. Construction profits rose by 55.5 per cent, but wages by just 2.9 per cent. And profits in the information, media and telecommunications sector grew by 10 per cent—five times more than wages. Company profits as a share of national income are now back to the record levels of 2008, while the wages share is the lowest since 1964. So there has been no shortage of funds to fund wage increases for workers, but corporations have instead funded executive salaries. This is unfair and unsustainable, and it is little wonder that the community is angry when they are doing it tough and being asked to engage in wage restraint when corporate leaders are filling their own pockets.


Here are some examples from last year of incredible increases in CEO pay from 2009 to 2010. Tom Albanese, CEO of Rio Tinto, got $9,039,000, an increase of 328 per cent. Don Voelte from Woodside Petroleum is on $8,343,339—also a huge increase. Ralph Norris, CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, modest but still a nice little earner, is on $16,157,746, an increase of 75 per cent. And the list goes on: David Knox at Santos, $5 million, an increase of 63 per cent; Marius Kloppers on $11 million, and so on. Something needs to be done to rein in these fat-cat salaries and excessive profits. Something needs to be done to address this growing inequality. The Greens have been seeking action on executive remuneration for some time. We have proposed real and practical measures to limit executive pay. We have moved a number of amendments to the Corporations Act in the past to implement our proposals. The most recent was at the end of 2009 to the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Termination Payment) Bill.


The measures we have proposed include: a cap on total executive remuneration of $5 million to stop the excesses of the past decade but also to ensure that the majority of executives continue to enjoy attractive remuneration packages. The limit that we have proposed is more than 10 times the Prime Minister's salary. We have also proposed: a remuneration formula to set executive pay at 30 times the average employee's wage; a top marginal tax rate of 50 per cent for incomes over $1 million a year; and a binding shareholder vote on company remuneration policy. The policy would set minimum standards to be included in remuneration packages which would, in turn, place limits on the size of remuneration packages covering base salaries, performance and termination pay and non-cash rewards. We believe that these measures are sensible and, if implemented, would have already started to rein in excessive executive salaries.


Unfortunately, the government and the opposition have not had the courage to take strong action on this problem and support our measures. Instead, we have before us this bill today. The bill implements a number of the recommendations from the Productivity Commission's report from 2009on executive remuneration. The key measure in the bill is the two strike non-binding vote of shareholders on the remuneration report leading to a spill of the board.


The first strike will occur when a company's remuneration report receives a no vote of 25 per cent or more. When this occurs, the company's subsequent remuneration report, the next year, must include an explanation of the board's proposed actions in response to the no vote or an explanation of why no action has been taken.


The second strike occurs when a company's subsequent remuneration report receives a no vote of 25 per cent or more. When this occurs, shareholders will vote at the same AGM to determine whether the directors will need to stand for re-election. If this spill resolution passes with 50 per cent or more of eligible votes cast, then the spill meeting will take place within 90 days.


While this is a step forward from where we are now, the Greens would prefer a binding vote of shareholders on remuneration policy which would set limits and give the shareholders that ability to configure payments in accordance with common sense. Under the provisions in the bill the potential for a spill of the board takes two votes at subsequent annual general meetings of shareholders expressing their concern with the remuneration of executives. There is, therefore, a significant amount of time between shareholders expressing displeasure and being in a position to act. During this time CEOs can continue to be paid obscene salaries.


We understand the arguments put by the Productivity Commission against a binding vote, including that a binding vote would provide significant practical difficulties such as companies not being able to finalise a contract with an executive until shareholder approval was obtained, and could result in a deadlock arising between shareholders and the board regarding the appropriate levels of executive remuneration. We appreciate that the government's position is to encourage cultural change in large corporations regarding executive remuneration. However, we continue to hold reservations that these measures will in practical terms work to stop the excessive salaries that I have outlined today. We will be watching carefully how this process works in practice and the extent to which it does create cultural change and rein in executive remuneration packages.


The Greens support the other measures in the bill to increase transparency with regard to executive remuneration. These include: increasing transparency and accountability with respect to the use of remuneration consultants, in particular, that remuneration consultants report to non-executive directors or the remuneration committee; addressing conflicts of interests that exist with directors and executives voting their shares on remuneration resolutions. We agree that directors and executives with voting shares should not be allowed to vote on the remuneration reports. We also support: ensuring that remuneration remains linked to performance by prohibiting hedging of incentive remuneration; requiring shareholder approval for declarations of no vacancy at an annual general meeting; prohibiting proxy holders from cherry-picking the proxies they exercise by requiring that any directed proxies that are not voted default to the chair, who is required to vote the proxies as directed; and reducing the complexity of the remuneration report by confining disclosures in the report to the key management personnel.


These measures also go to implementing some of the principles of executive remuneration agreed to by the G20 in September 2009. They will improve the way companies go about determining remuneration for executives, and the increased transparency of these measures is to be welcomed. However, this must be just the first step. Unless we move to serious caps and stronger regulation of executive salaries we will not begin to address the growing inequality we are experiencing in this country.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:50):  I rise to support the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. The global financial crisis around the world put a spotlight on and exposed some of the excessive remuneration packages of company directors and executives.


In Australia in the last 30 years the relativities between the average wage and executive pay have grown exponentially. In fact, CEO salaries of Australia's largest 300 listed companies rose by 28 per cent in 2006-07. This is compared to the average full-time income growth of 3.4 per cent over the same period. So there is a significant difference between the rise in CEO salaries and income growth. The community in Australia has registered its concern about this increase in disparity between the average wage income earner and the rise in CEO salaries.


In the financial year just passed, companies on the S&P ASX 100 that filed remuneration reports revealed an average executive salary rise of 12 per cent with the highest being 93 per cent. These pay rises have all occurred despite difficult times and under difficult conditions, with CEOs, at the same time, calling for wage constraint for ordinary workers. It is important that the community is listened to when it comes to executive remuneration and that steps are taken to ensure that these salaries do get recognised. We need to ensure that regulation is made to make sure that they are fair and right and that shareholders get their voices listened to. I am also certain that members of the House will recall the exposure of unreasonable termination benefits being afforded to departing directors of companies not long after the global financial crisis. The government addressed this issue in its 2009 announcement of reforms aimed at curbing these excessive golden handshake payments. The bill before the House seeks to build on those reforms by further strengthening Australia's remuneration framework. It is disappointing that while the opposition state that they agree with the government their amendments effectively aim to keep the status quo. I do hope that the opposition comes to their senses, listen to community expectations and support the bill before the House.


The bill will amend current limitations in order to provide shareholders with more control over the pay of directors. Shareholders are the legal owners of a company in which they invest. In doing so, they take ownership of the company's risk and also share in the company's profit and loss. Shareholders therefore deserve more control over how the pay of company executives is decided. This bill seeks to empower shareholders to influence their company's remuneration decisions by, firstly, introducing a two-strikes test.


The current Corporations Act requires listed companies to put their remuneration report to a non-binding shareholder vote at an annual general meeting. However, shareholders have no means of recourse should they implement a strong 'no' vote which is then ignored by the company board. Under the bill before the House, the first strike will be initiated in the instance where a company's remuneration report receives a 'no' vote of 25 per cent or more. This results in the company being required to provide direct evidence of the shareholders' concerns having been addressed or an outline as to why they have not. If shareholders remain dissatisfied and another vote results in a 'no' vote of 25 per cent or more then the second strike is triggered. The second strike gives shareholders the opportunity to vote on a resolution to spill the board and subject directors to re-election. If the spill resolution is passed by more than 50 per cent then a spill meeting will provide shareholders with the opportunity to vote on the re-election of each director. The two-strikes test is an important measure that finally holds unresponsive directors accountable for the decisions they make on executive remuneration.


This bill also seeks to ensure that consultation between remuneration consultants and company executives remains transparent. A company's remuneration consultant will be required to declare that their recommendations are free from undue influence. As a means of ensuring further transparency, these recommendations will be provided to non-executive directors or the remuneration committee, rather than to the company's executive directors. The company will also be required to disclose details regarding the consultant used and the amount they were paid. These measures are focused on ensuring accountability and transparency within the remuneration framework. Shareholders have a right to be in a position to assess any potential conflict of interest, and this bill takes important steps towards ensuring that this remains the case.


As a means of further reducing conflicts of interest, this bill also prohibits company directors and executives from voting on the remuneration report or the spill resolution. Directors and executives no doubt have an interest in approving their own remuneration agreements. Doing so affords them a considerable amount of power concerning their company's remuneration framework. This clearly represents a conflict of interest, and the measures proposed in this bill seek to remove that conflict.


In line with the government's reforms to termination benefits, this bill also seeks to ensure that executive remuneration remains linked to performance. Incentive remuneration is designed to align directors' and executives' interests with those of shareholders; however, the hedging of incentive payments can severely skew this relationship. Directors and executives are currently able to hedge their exposure to incentive remuneration by entering into third-party contracts and effectively mitigating their personal financial interest in their company's success. The use of hedging is completely inconsistent with the values of Australia's remuneration framework. However, perhaps more concerning is the real, as well as the perceived, conflict of interest that arises when a director or executive enters into hedging arrangements. Such an arrangement may stand to see the director or executive benefit from a fall in their company's share price. Hedging by directors or executives distorts their responsibilities to their shareholders. The measures in this bill will ensure that the interests of shareholders and of the company's directors and executives remain synchronised.


The bill also introduces a measure that prevents boards from announcing 'no vacancy' without the approval of its shareholders. This is an important step towards transferring company decision-making power back to shareholders. The no vacancy rule currently allows boards to govern the composition of the board and makes it difficult, if not impossible, for non-board-endorsed candidates to be elected. This promotes unaccountability from directors and executives and leaves shareholders without a voice, given that any candidate seeking to promote change within a company can essentially be prevented from reaching a board position that would allow them to instigate such change.


The bill also introduces an amendment which will ensure the enfranchisement of every shareholder who chooses to vote at an annual general meeting. Currently, all directors except for the chair have the ability to disregard proxy votes that do not align with their personal views regarding a resolution. Indeed, annual general meetings can be held at times or locations that are not convenient for all shareholders. As such, many shareholders who are unable to attend in person are able to indicate their position by a proxy vote. These votes should be given just as much weighting as a vote from a shareholder present at the meeting. However, instead, these votes can currently be disregarded at a director's discretion. This cherry picking of votes from shareholders who have made specific declarations concerning their vote inevitably results in outcomes that by no means clearly represent the sentiment of shareholders. This bill will ensure that the outcome of a resolution vote reflects shareholder views rather than the cherry picked views of directors. In conclusion, under request from the government, the Productivity Commission undertook a broad review of Australia's remuneration framework. The nine-month review process, which included a total of 170 submissions and a series of public hearings, revealed that Australia's corporate governance and remuneration framework are ranked highly on an international scale. However, it also recommended a range of reforms to further strengthen Australia's remuneration framework.


The bill before the House today effectively responds to these recommendations. It will provide shareholders with a new level of power and ultimately improve the transparency and accountability of company directors and executives. It addresses the conflicts of interest that arise throughout the remuneration process and ensures that the sentiments of shareholders are appropriately represented by directors and executives.


While Australia's remuneration framework is certainly strong, these innovative reforms will eliminate complacency and ensure that it remains effective well into the future. It will better reflect community standards when it comes to remuneration and pay of company executives, and I therefore commend the bill to the House.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:01):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011, and I commend the member for Kingston for the remarks she has just made on the bill in this place.


In recent years public anger about excessive salaries and executive payouts has been widespread. Whilst the spotlight has been taken off executive salaries in recent times there is little, if any, justification for some of the remuneration we are still seeing. Nor is this issue just a matter for company shareholders. It is a matter that the wider community has a right to take an interest in, because in most cases the remuneration packages for senior executives have direct implications for the broader community. That is why this is a public interest issue, and why those people who argue that private sector remuneration is a matter for the private sector and not the business of government are wrong. It is the argument about why this is a matter of public interest that I will address in my remarks on this bill.


Possibly every senior management appointment today is tied to performance, either by way of a performance bonus or simply because renewal of the employment contract is directly tied to performance. In the private sector the most used measure of performance and certainly the most persuasive is the annual profit or loss statement. Generally, the higher the profits the better the performance is considered. That is what most company owners and shareholders are driven by. Profit can be and usually is made from a range of actions, but when any of those actions are extreme or irresponsible it is the public that inevitably ends up paying one way or another. And therein lies the public interest test—a test that could be applied time and again, using many examples in numerous industry sectors over recent years.


We have seen farmers being squeezed by monopoly retailers, manufacturers transferring their operations overseas, high-risk loan arrangements or investment schemes, construction shortcuts where safety standards are not complied with, transport industry drivers placed under unreasonable delivery deadlines, and collusion or similar practices and possibly corruption creeping into industry practices. Cutting costs and increasing sales are strategies almost universally implemented in business to increase profits—and I will speak more about both these matters. Cutting costs and reducing overheads can be achieved by investing in modernisation strategies, upskilling the workforce, streamlining production and other forward-thinking responsible strategies. The alternatives are reducing labour costs, not complying with regulatory standards, using inferior componentry, taking extreme risks and other irresponsible measures—all of which appear to have become commonplace in business.


I turn now to labour costs. Labour costs are frequently cut by placing unreasonable demands on workers, including longer working hours, which are often unpaid; by reducing the workforce numbers and working employees harder; by paying workers less than fair wages; by subcontracting work out; and by taking work offshore. It is all about squeezing more out of the labour force. The social costs of unemployment, housing, health and family breakdown, which inevitably follow when operations are transferred offshore, workers are placed under unreasonable work pressure, or work is subcontracted out so employers are no longer responsible for work conditions are all examples of where the consequences are inevitably paid for by the rest of society.


We saw the collapse of the financial system because of high-risk lending practices or high-risk investment schemes. This was driven by executives who were in turn motivated by increased profits. Hardworking people lost their homes, their health, their savings and sometimes their lives because of the decisions of highly remunerated executives. In the five years prior to the 2008 global financial crisis, senior executives of the five largest financial institutions in Wall Street were paid $3.6 billion in remuneration. They profited whilst others lost everything. They were rewarded for their failure.


I turn now to the transport sector. Each year around 300 lives are lost and about 5,500 are injured because of cost-cutting in the transport sector. I quote from a submission from the Transport Workers Union from February this year on this very matter:


Each road death costs $1.7 million. Each injury in an incident costs $408 000. When the non-monetised social impact of road deaths, injuries and illness, family breakdown, pain and suffering is included in the measurement of what road deaths and injuries cost the community—


The damages bill is immeasurable. The report attributes the cause of the road transport safety crisis to economic factors; namely, the low level of driver remuneration and their methods of payment. As made clear in the NTC report, the high level of control exercised by clients over price, timing, destination and route causes operators to bear the costs that, ordinarily, are borne by customers. Denied a proper return, let alone a margin that exceeds the cost of capital, operators undercut each other, bid the price of transport down and attempt to recoup the losses caused by clients from drivers by not paying them for all work performed and by paying them through incentive rates. It says:


Because employment is too often conditional on strict compliance with an operator's direction and client deadlines, drivers are prone to drive while fatigued, to speed, to take drugs and to skimp on maintenance.


All of that arises because someone is trying to make a profit. Usually the CEO or an executive is the person driving that to the point that they do.


Mining and construction workers' lives have been put at risk and lives lost or injured because of work practices imposed by employers. The recent spate of mining tragedies exposes some of these practices. In the building and construction sector, each year around 50 lives are lost and around 75,000 workers are injured through accidents, which in most cases are foreseeable and avoidable and which can be attributed to cost cutting. Yet people like Ark Tribe were taken to court for standing up for their right to a safe work environment.


In food production, farm producers are squeezed for lower prices by the major grocery retailers in turn placing hardship and stress on farming families. The current milk price war has been linked to the executive remuneration of the Coles CEO with allegations that the Coles CEO will be paid millions of dollars if he increases the Coles profit. Discounting milk is a strategy currently being employed by Coles to increase market share of grocery sales and ultimately the Coles profit. The Australian dairy farmers say the discounted milk is already reducing the income of dairy farmers and threatens their ongoing viability. This is a claim that Coles is disputing of course. We have also seen farm products being sourced from overseas where production standards do not meet Australian standards, which in turn leads to health impacts on Australian consumers and a demise of Australian food production. Again these are decisions made by executives whose primary interest is profit. The impact on Australian farmers and the health impacts on Australian consumers are ultimately borne by governments.


Another of the very concerning trends in recent times has been the use of overseas registered shipping and crews. We have now had several cases of extensive environmental disasters that have been attributed to cost-cutting decisions made by executives who are driven by profit. The environmental disaster on the Great Barrier Reef when a Chinese coal carrier ran aground, spilling about four tonnes of heavy fuel oil from a perforated fuel tank, has been attributed to a seaman being fatigued, having managed only 2½ hours of sleep in the previous 38½ hours. In February this year there was another shipping incident. It was associated with the multi-cat vessel Boskalis BKM 102 whilst working on the Gorgon project off Barrow Island. The four MUA crew members were put at risk and the pristine environment was badly polluted, because of the shoddy practices of the overseas shipping company. In addition, there was the Montara oil spill, which occurred in the Timor Sea on 21 August 2009 and continued right up until November 2009. I understand that Indonesia and East Timor are now seeking compensation for the extensive environmental damage done. Even if they are successful as to compensation and even if penalties are imposed, the reality is that the bulk of the environmental damage cost inevitably will fall onto governments and society.


The measures in this bill provide increased accountability by CEOs to shareholders and conversely give shareholders more control over executive remuneration, and they will be welcomed by many Australians. It is my view that most shareholders do not endorse the kinds of practices that I have alluded to in my remarks. It is my view that most shareholders want to see their executives acting responsibly. Time will enable us to determine whether the measures in this bill are sufficient to ensure the right level of accountability by CEOs. It is my view that many CEOs are still grossly overremunerated and I would consider supporting additional measures that I believe could be taken to curb excessive CEO remuneration packages. I note the comments of members opposite and I understand that they intend moving an amendment. I also note comments they believe that essentially the government should not meddle in private enterprise. These comments were made by a number of these speakers. I reject that proposition. I believe that this legislation is a step in the right direction, and I commend it to the House.


Debate adjourned.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2011-05-11,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (13:45):  I rise today to express my disappointment for the agricultural industry in the budget. Not only has the government delivered nothing for the industry; it has also failed to alleviate the crippling shortage of skilled workers. With the worst drought in the nation's history at an end, our agricultural industry is gradually returning to full production. In order to achieve this, the industry desperately needs skilled workers. The mining boom has been tremendous for the Australian economy but disastrous for Australian agricultural employment. The agricultural sector produces fine, hardworking employees who are very attractive to the mining sector and are drawn by generous salaries.


Under Labor's budget commitment, $280 million has been provided to boost apprenticeships, but to be eligible an apprentice must be undertaking a trade that appears on the National Skills Needs List. Agriculture and horticulture, as part of that, are not included on that list. Agriculture will not be able to return to its prime position as an economic powerhouse of the nation without new generations of skilled tradespeople. The government has no clue when it comes to agriculture; it needs to listen to the industry and include agriculture in its apprenticeship and training program.

The government's failure to deal with cost of living pressures on Australia's families in the budget.

",HoR,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,9,1
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2011-05-11,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:22):  At 7.30 last night the Treasurer rose to his feet to deliver his budget speech. His opening words were, 'This is a Labor budget.' Well, most Australians turned off at 7.31, as soon as he said that. Why? Because being a true Labor budget it delivered bigger debt, bigger deficits and bigger spin. The deficits in this budget, the stuff that really matters to Australians today, are growing. The budget deficit this year has grown in the last six months from $42 billion to nearly $50 billion. That means the government is borrowing $135 million every day just to fund the deficit. The budget deficit for next year, which is the appropriation bill that this House is going to vote on, is actually growing from $12 billion to $22.6 billion.


The Treasurer expects us to believe the fairytale story and for the Australian people to accept—with this year's budget deficit situation deteriorating because of external circumstances and the government's increase in its own expenditure, and next year's budget deficit increasing, including increased government expenditure—the only budget narrative the government had today, and that is that in two years time they will bring the budget back into surplus. That is the only narrative they had in this place today—to promise something that they promised last year, to promise something that they promised the year before. But the difference is that with the Labor Party it is 50 per cent promise, 50 per cent excuse. The debt of Australia, the net debt of the government, is now $106.6 billion—in dollar terms, the highest of all time. It is a deterioration in the net debt figure from $94 billion. Buried deep in the budget papers we have now discovered that the government is going to ask the parliament to increase the amount of debt issuance to $250 billion in gross terms. Of course, they are going to use the excuse of Basel III to maintain what will be since World War II the largest debt issuance in our modern history.


What does this all mean? For everyday Australians it means that the interest on the Labor Party debt will increase to $18 million a day every day for the next four years. It means that by the fourth year of this budget, interest will rise to $7½ billion. And the government expect us to believe the fairytale story that somehow they are going to bring the budget back to surplus with fiscal discipline. They sold and spun in the budget speech last night $22 billion of so-called savings. Ignore the fact that a third of that was tax increases. Even so, $22 billion, and now people are becoming more aware that the government is spending $19 billion of that $22 billion. But most intriguingly, and this is where the rubber hits the road, next year—in the year when we have stronger economic growth, where we have unemployment dropping to 4.5 per cent, where the government is running a bigger budget deficit—in that year the government is going to spend $2.2 billion more than it is saving. These much lauded savings that are going to bring the budget whirring back to surplus, in the budget where the rubber hits the road they are spending $2.2 billion more, and it is not even an election year. Growth is going up to four per cent but employment growth is actually slowing.


If we cut through the spin of this incompetent Treasurer, what we can recognise is that he is desperate to get adulation. He talks about the emotion of putting together a budget, how he is sleepless at night about the difficulty and challenges associated with the Australian economy, an Australian economy that he lauds as the best in the world. Yet he is so sleepless, he is so lost, he is suffering such insomnia.


Employment growth is slowing even though this government is desperate to spin half a million jobs being created over the next two years. That is an employment growth rate of just 2.2 per cent. It is less than the last three years of the Howard government at three per cent and, what is more, it is less than the last 12 months of this government itself, which had employment growth of three per cent, with 320,000 jobs created in the last calendar year. And somehow they think that it is a momentous achievement for them to be in the business of overseeing an economy creating half a million jobs in two years when the same economy created 320,000 jobs in the last 12 months.


On inflation, what I think was quite alarming was that last night, when you dig deep into the budget, the core inflation figures indicate that inflation is going up to three per cent, the top of the Reserve Bank band, by June 2013. Currently it is 2.25 per cent. We are in an environment where the Reserve Bank has clearly indicated it is going to take action. I want to make it perfectly clear to the Australian people and this parliament that Wayne Swan and Julia Gillard are going to own every interest rate increase from here on. They are going to be responsible for making life harder for everyday Australians and not easier. They had the chance in this budget. They had the opportunity to make the hard yards, and they failed that test because they lack courage. They talk courage but they display no courage. They talk surplus but they deliver deficit. They talk net debt as a negative and now they are going to deliver a significant increase in net debt.


This is a government that has never met its budget targets. I say to you why, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is because this government does not have internal discipline. They lack the processes for actually making hard decisions, as illustrated by the fact that they leaked $400 million in cuts in medical research and did not proceed with it. They leaked that they were going to cut childcare benefits and then did not proceed with it. What did they do? They cut families by $2 billion. It is something I said to the Leader of the Opposition in the lock-up: I cannot believe this government is reducing the real increases in the family tax benefit for families on $45,000 a year. Why would they do it?




Mr Bradbury:
  It is a supplement.




Mr HOCKEY:
  He says it is a supplement. It is not real money: is that it, sunshine? It is not real money. Two billion dollars is not real money. Somehow it is in your budget, so either it is real money and it is really going to affect Australians or, as the member for Lindsay would say, it is not real money. I say to you, sir, that Australian families are struggling, and particularly in your electorate of Lindsay. Your budget is indifferent to the plight of your people. Your budget is ignorant of the fact that everyday Australians are struggling: they are finding it harder to pay for higher electricity bills, for higher mortgage repayments, for higher fruit and vegetable prices, for higher petrol prices. This is a government that is overseeing a deterioration in the living standards of middle Australia. And why? Because of their own fiscal recklessness.


There is one figure set that illustrates this more graphically than any other. It is the fact that since Labor was elected the Public Service in Canberra has increased by 20,000 employees. Last night in the so-called tough budget the government increased the size of the Public Service by a further 1,100 employees, including 200 in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet alone and 55 in the Department of the Treasury. So at that time, when they are talking tough and expecting Australians to cut their cloth, this is a government that is going on a binge, a binge that is based on politics and not policy. Of course, in the budget there are reflections of their policy failures, which Australian families are now paying for. The $1.2 billion blow-out in the computers in schools program grew a further $200 million in last night's budget to $1.4 billion. The government's failed border protection policy has grown out by an additional $1.75 billion, and I suspect we will hear more about the growing bill for their failed border protection policies. What about the $111 million that is going to have to be spent mopping up the failed pink batts policy? How about that one, Mr Deputy Speaker? Of course this all reflects the fact that the Labor Party cannot rein in its spending. The Treasurer keeps talking about spending growth. He is working off a very high base because of course the government went for the credit card during the financial crisis, handing out $900 cheques, building school halls, installing pink batts, putting solar panels on roofs—they did it all. They smoked the credit card at the moment when Australia could not afford to have an excessive fiscal stimulus. It turns out that Australia gets a silver medal, or maybe even a bronze medal, for the biggest fiscal stimulus in the world as a percentage of GDP, and now we are paying a heavy price for it.


At no time in the forward estimates—and wasn't the Treasurer caught out by this today!—or at any time has the government's expenditure as a percentage of GDP been as low as it was in the last year of the Howard government. The Treasurer says that we were a profligate government—




Mr Shorten:
  You were.




Mr HOCKEY:
  yet nowhere in all of the budget figures at any time does the Labor Party ever get to the 22.9 per cent of GDP of the coalition in its last year. Then, belatedly, in a defensive mood, the Treasurer comes into this place and says, 'Oh, well, look at the average of the coalition. We are less than that.' So I looked at the average of the Labor Party so that we can compare apples with apples. Under the coalition on average over all of that period, including the very difficult period when we had negative growth during the Asian financial crisis, the coalition's percentage increased significantly, as it does when the economy comes down—the percentage of government expenditure rises as a percentage of GDP—but on average the Labor Party has been spending 24.6 per cent of GDP and the coalition just 24.03 per cent. When you add in the revenue and expenditure associated with the carbon tax at $26 a tonne—boom, boom! It all goes. 


Do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker? This is the challenge for the government: assuming there are no major new policy initiatives over the next two years, assuming the carbon tax is not going to have any impact on the budget, assuming there are no other challenges ahead, assuming that the terms of trade will remain at the highest level in 150 years, assuming that old Penny Wong can control the Prime Minister as she claimed to do. My goodness, what a mud wrestle! Senator Penny Wong claimed that she was going to control the Prime Minister's excessive demands for spending. I say to you: this mob will never deliver a budget surplus. This mob will never have the courage to deliver a budget surplus and, as the member for Longman said so vividly earlier, in question time, in his entire lifetime Labor have never delivered a budget surplus. Even though he was conceived in a surplus he was delivered in a deficit. It just goes to show what a celebration it was when Labor last delivered a budget surplus, and when Labor delivers a surplus again we will all give a good cheer and have a great party.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (15:34):  I listened carefully to the shadow Treasurer's speech. I think he has missed a lot of what happened in the budget last night, so I am pleased to assist and to be a torchlight of clarity in this matter of public importance debate. I am pleased to switch on the lights.


Australia is experiencing an economy in transition. We need to get our policy settings right. We on this side of the House understand that our economy is changing, and we need to make sure that government policies change to assist Australians to prosper from the transition of our economy. There are transformative forces at work in our world. On this side we understand the growth in the emergence of Asia. We understand that our population is growing older. We understand that information is king in the modern era and that the information pipeline is going to be a fundamental driver of economic organisation. We understand that, along with the high commodities prices in the mineral boom, we are also expanding as a services economy. We also understand that we need to change to a low-pollution economy.


This budget is an attempt to get away from sound bite style policy, which is, tragically, so beloved of the opposition. It is a search for systemic ways to make our nation more sustainable, more innovative and indeed more competitive. It is to help us make the transition into a digital economy, a low-pollution economy and an economy which can spread the benefits of the mining boom throughout all parts of this nation. After all, if the global phenomena of climate change and the global financial crisis have taught us anything at all it is this: everything and everyone is connected and change is not optional; it is inevitable. That is why this budget is so important. That is why Treasurer Swan's fourth budget is such a very good one. It is a statement of purpose, and the purpose is to secure our future his budget endeavours to tackle the cost of living issues and it builds upon Treasurer Swan's previous three budgets. Let us go through some of the contributions of the government to tackling the cost of living. People are paying lower taxes. Someone on $50,000 a year is paying $1,750, or 18 per cent, less tax than in 2007-08. The tax to GDP ratio—a statistic which was cleverly, selectively and disingenuously ignored by the opposition spokesperson who just gave us his contribution—has dropped from 23½ per cent in the last year of the Howard-Costello regime, when we came to office, to 20.3 per cent in 2009-10. 


Since September 2009 we have tackled the cost of living pressure on pensioners by increasing the age pension. It is up $128 a fortnight for single pensioners and around $116 for pensioner couples. We have developed the education tax refund. This is where families can claim up to 50 per cent of their education costs, up to $397 per year, for every child in primary school and up to $794 for each child in secondary school. There are over one million families and 1.7 million children who have already benefited from this education tax refund. We have also extended the education tax refund to school uniforms. Parents now will be able to claim up to 50 per cent of the cost of uniforms incurred from 1 July 2011—yet again helping with the cost of living pressures.


In this budget we were pleased to announce the increase of $4,200 to families who are receiving family tax benefit A. We have committed to increasing it up to $4,200 a year per teenager to help families meet the costs of older children still at school and to encourage more teenagers to stay at school. From 1 January 2012 we will increase the maximum payment rate of family tax benefit A by around $160 per fortnight for teenagers who are aged between 16 and 19 years who are in school or studying for an equivalent vocational qualification. This is going to benefit 650,000 teenagers turning 16 over the next five years.


But of course the best way to deal with the cost of living is to ensure that people have a job. Having a decent job is the best way to deal with cost of living pressures. Since 2007, under the stewardship of our Treasurer, we have overseen the creation of 700,000 new jobs, in mining, retail, health and the skilled trades. That is 550 jobs a day, every day, since Labor took office. And now there are over 440,000 Australians in training or apprenticeships. They are getting real training for careers in construction, automotive, furnishing, tourism, plumbing and hairdressing. We will increase the number of apprenticeships over the next three years by another 50,000. Liberal policy, I am afraid to report to the House, is to cut $2 billion from training and to sack 80,000 trainees.


When we look at this cost of living debate and what this budget contributes, we need to further put the facts in black and white. If you have got children in child care, you will get the choice of claiming childcare payments more regularly—getting the money in your pocket and off the bill you have. As I said, if you have children at school, you will be able to claim for their school uniforms. If your children are teenagers, we are increasing the family tax benefit payment by about $160 per fortnight. Also, importantly, if you are one of 50,000 single parents, tax rates will be cut by up to 20c in the dollar. If you want some training, to obtain a higher wage, as I have said, we are creating 130,000 training spots. If you want to be an apprentice, or if you have a teenage son or daughter who wants to be one, we will give more support for people to complete their training, through mentoring guidance and allowing good apprentices to get their qualifications quickly. If you are a tradesperson or a small business, if you are buying a new ute or car which is necessary for the business, you will be able to claim $5,000 back in tax. That is real help in terms of the cost of living.


If you are a low-income earner, you will get more in your pay packet each week through the advance payment of the low-income tax offset. If you are finding it tough to get a job, there will be 35,000 wage subsidies for the very long-term unemployed job seekers, to help them get a job, and 30,000 training places for single and teenage parents, to help them get the skills they need. Importantly—and dear to my heart—if you have the challenges and the financial costs which arise from having a disabled child in the school system, we will be contributing $200 million to the special schools and the school systems of various states in order to better support disabled children getting an education. If you are worried about your local hospital, there is $3.4 billion for emergency departments and elective surgery. There is $613 million for new medicines and making immunisation more affordable. If there is a teacher in your family, or you are a family that places a lot of value on the quality of your child's teacher, there is $425 million to reward our top performing teachers across the country.


This is a real list of things which go to the day-to-day lives, the lived experience, of people in the suburbs and regions of Australia. But I would not want the House just to take my word for the benefits of this budget. I will quote David Koch, who is a very well-known commentator. He said in today's paper—and it is a fair assessment:


The overriding theme is that if you don’t have a job, or if you earn a comfortable income, there are no more easy Government handouts.


Perhaps that is what is worrying the opposition. Kochie also said:


Compared with the rest of the world we are an economic miracle. Economic growth will be reasonable (after the hiccup of the natural disasters), inflation on target, unemployment falling and—


despite the Chicken Little prognostications of those opposite—


Government debt tiny compared with the rest of the world. 


Kochie could be viewed to be a commentator for the government, but he is not. He is independent, as I know the shadow Treasurer thinks. If Kochie were not sufficiently convincing and compelling, CommSec Chief Economist Craig James, who is hardly a member of the Marxist international, said:


Overall, it is a smart Budget, right for the times and challenges ahead.


Meanwhile, the ratings agency Moody's, who are hardly Green Left Weekly, have reconfirmed our AAA rating and said:


… Moody's notes that Australia's government debt remains amongst the lowest of all AAA-rated governments.


The chief economist of UBS, Scott Haslem said:


The bias towards reduced spending over new taxes to offset revenue shortfalls is commendable.


UBS says that what the government has done is commendable. Heather Ridout of the Australian Industry Group has said:


We believe this budget is very solid on the fundamentals. It makes a solid investment in skills … I think it will take pressure off interest rates in the longer term. 


But again it does not stop there with the commentary. On Bloomberg, it says:


Australia's government will end 23 years of spending growth to ease inflation from the biggest mining investment boom in the nation's history.


But of course the opposition would not rate CommSec, they would not rate UBS, they would not rate Kochie, they would not rate Bloomberg, because they do not agree with their view of the world.


I think it is important, when we are having a debate about who is doing the best in terms of the budget, that we understand that this budget is not formed in isolation. Politics is not a one-horse race; it is a two-horse race. We have to see what the opposition would do. We all remember last year when the Leader of the Opposition got up and gave a speech and made some political points and, at the end, said, 'By the way, the shadow Treasurer will deal with the costings in our propositions at the Press Club next Wednesday.' So we all waited with bated breath—what would the shadow Treasurer say the following Wednesday at the National Press Club? Unfortunately, he got up and said nothing. He said, 'Actually, that is the shadow finance minister's job.' So what we have is sort of the opposition equivalent of the Three Stooges: 'It was not me; it is him.' 'No, it is not me; it is the other person.'


The more important point is not even the gaffe of last year. The issue is this: good budgets are not centrally just about politics and parties. They have to be about good policy; they have to be about the future. So we need to have a good-faith debate here. This budget week is not just a test of the government; it is a test of the opposition. If the Liberal-National Party coalition have real alternatives that they truly believe in, they should set them out. They should set out their alternatives—anything less than that is absolutely wasting the opportunity. 


On the issue of getting the budget back into the black, the shadow Treasurer made some rather garrulous comments on 4 May and again on 6 May—indeed on any day that you talk to him. But on 4 May and 6 May he made it clear that he could get the budget back into the black by next year. When in Australian politics will there be any accountability for the comments of the shadow Treasurer? We all know that it took the Leader of the National Party to slap him down over his motormouth comments on trusts, when the shadow Treasurer said that trusts should be taxed in the same way as companies. It did not take long for the red warning light in the National Party bunker to go beep, beep, beep. And I have no doubt that the Trussinator was on the phone saying, 'This is not coalition policy.' I could just hear the Nationals going: 'Oh my god! The moose is loose; he is out again and he is making policy on the run'.


I think that what we need to do here is to make sure. Perhaps we need a little bit of National Party iron rigour— the wheaty hand in the glove—saying to Joe Hockey, 'Mate, what is our policy? What is our plan? What are we going to do? It is all right for us to bag the government—okay, that is one thing. What are we going to do?' All we have is their costings from the election and we all remember the $11 billion black hole. Tony Abbott fronted up, ran around the 36-hour—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! The Assistant Treasurer ought to refer to other honourable members by their titles.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Indeed. The Leader of the Opposition, which he was then and thankfully still is now, was running around on a 36-hour New South Wales law and order binge, where he was clearly submitting himself as the candidate for premier in the state election. But he did say, 'We have $50 billion in savings up our sleeves, in our gear.' But after the election, when they were forced to demonstrate at least some degree of financial rigour, there was an $11 billion costings black hole. Indeed when we were dealing with the floods package—very necessary to help with the reconstruction of terribly flood affected areas—they said, 'We can find cuts,' and we all know how that descended into farce. The shadow foreign minister told the shadow leader, 'You are not cutting foreign aid,' when in fact the opposition leader was trying to use One Nation's policy on cutting foreign aid. Of course we do not talk about the war now, do we? 


Returning to what is most important: I have submitted to this House today what we are doing to tackle cost of living pressures. I have submitted that this is a budget about getting us back into black by 2012-13. This is a budget which is about creating more jobs and spreading the benefits of the mining boom across all of the economy. We are an economy in transition; we need good policies in this country. But the challenge tomorrow night for the opposition is saying, 'If we do not like what you are doing, what is our plan?' The challenge for them is to demonstrate that they will not just keep this economy in deficit, unlike yesterday's capable Swan budget.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2011-05-11,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (15:50):  The government's 2011 federal budget is an absolute shambles. There is no plan; there is no vision; there are no solutions. The Treasurer told us at the beginning of his budget speech that it was a Labor budget with Labor values. Budgets that are a shambles, without a plan and without a vision are Labor values. That is what Labor budgets are all about. If, perchance, the economic circumstances improve, Labor have no idea how to deal with it. When tough decisions need to be made to reduce government expenditure, they disguise the expenditure with the traditional Labor value, the traditional Labor way of fixing problems: new taxes.


We hear a lot about $22 billion worth of so-called savings in this budget, but a third of that amount is actually new taxes. And the great big new carbon tax is not to be seen or heard of in this budget. It is the tax we dare not speak of, except of course when it comes to funding the promotion campaign—the campaign for the tax that is not even mentioned in the budget.


We all know that this budget will do nothing to deal with the problems of struggling families. Labor's extra spending means greater pressure on interest rates and the near certainty of extra interest rate rises this year. Inflation is on the march, but the budget does nothing to halt that advance. And over everything is the threat of the carbon tax, which hangs like a sword over the heads of every family, every small business and every community across the nation. This Labor budget is all about a return to Labor's core values, with attacks on the people Labor always hate. Bring out the old class prejudices again—an assault on people who care for their own welfare by taking out private health insurance, one of Labor's pet hates, and on families who save up so that they can fund in advance their children's  university fees, also on Labor's hit list. And what about single-income families, how they have been assaulted in this budget with removal of the dependent spouse rebate and the changes to the family tax benefits? All of this makes it more and more difficult for a family to decide that one of the parents will stay home to raise the children. Indeed, in future, under Labor's plan, the single-income family will become a thing of the past. It seems that is also one of Labor's core values.


The other thing about Labor budgets is all the overgrown rhetoric—grand statements, commitments about the biggest this, the biggest that, the largest programs of all kinds—but  when you search through it all you find the numbers are not real. There is a $2.2 billion mental health strategy but they do not bother to mention the mental health programs they have axed to help fund it. They do not bother to mention that some of this is just restoring money they have taken away from programs like headspace. It is a big headline. That is what they are interested in. The absolute classic at this has always been the minister for infrastructure. When you read his press statements they always say 'the biggest road project of all times'. He has been well and truly caught out with his statements in relation to the Pacific Highway—a big banner headline  'More funding for the Pacific Highway':


The Gillard government is prepared to increase its investment in this road by $1 billion as a part of the 2011-12 budget. 


Then he goes on to talk about what this extra funding will achieve. He makes it clear that there is an extra $1 billion in the budget for the Pacific Highway. He tried to defend himself in question time today when the member for Cowper quite rightly pointed out that this is not $1 billion extra for the Pacific Highway. This is not $1 billion worth of new money. He said the member for Cowper should go back and read budget paper No. 2, which has all the details about this item. Let us go to page 267 of budget paper No. 2 and remember that Minister Albanese is claiming he is providing $1 billion of extra money for the Pacific Highway. Page 267 says of this $1.02 billion:


Of the contribution, $700 million has been previously provisioned for in the budget.


So of the $1.02 billion, $700 million has been previously provisioned. It is not new money at all. It is re-announcing  the same money which was announced previously. He did acknowledge that of the rest, $270 million was in fact money which has been taken off other projects in New South Wales. So $970 million at least of this money is not new money at all. The next thing he went on to say was that this money was going to deliver us a better Pacific  Highway but if you read his press statement, he says:


This extra funding will complete necessary detailed planning for the remaining sections of the highway.


Detailed planning! It is not as though the minister went off on his own path on this one. That is also repeated in the budget document—a whole billion dollars spent on planning. Planning! They go even further by saying that if this money is matched by the New South Wales government further construction might be able to begin. They are waiting for the New South Wales government to put up the money to actually build the road. Yet the minister is trying to take credit for it all. However, he has caught himself out again because in 2009, when announcing the new N1 road network in Australia, he said that the Commonwealth would pick up 100 per cent of the cost of building the Pacific Highway. He was letting the New South Wales government off their traditional fifty-fifty share. It seems that the old destitute, hopeless Labor government in New South Wales was to be let off making any contributions, but the moment they have been relieved of office he expects the new incoming coalition government to pick up 50 per cent of the funding. So if there is going to be one centimetre of bitumen provided to the Pacific Highway in addition to what is planned as a result of this budget the minister says it has to be provided by New South Wales. This is the brave new investment. This is the new regional policy the Independents have been so willing to embrace. They are so quick to mouth the Labor rhetoric about new increased expenditure in the region. 


The regions are going to get another 100 bureaucrats in the regional development department but they are not going to get any significant new expenditure. There is another announcement about $4.4 billion over 10 years but nearly all of that money is dependent upon there being a mining tax, and what a lose-lose situation  this is for regional Australia. If you do not have a mining tax, you do not get any of the money that has been promised to the Independents and others for regional projects,  but if you do get the mining tax, you lose the jobs, the investment and the initiative that is necessary in regional communities to make them grow. This is Labor's lose-lose regional development policy. What they offered to the Independents and what is in this budget is less than what would have been delivered by a coalition government had we been elected. It is less, but for the Independents Labor tries to bulk it up by bringing in the traditional funding out of other portfolios, concentrating it all in a regional bucket and making it into a large number. Is anyone suggesting that there would not have been hospital funding—extensions, construction—if this new bucket had not been created? Of course, regional areas would have got something of a share. Are you suggesting there would not have been money for regional roads if it were not for this new bucket? All that has happened is that the titles on projects have been changed but there is no serious new money available for regional communities. 


What regional communities will have to pay is a heavier share of the burden, the changes to the fringe benefits tax, because country people have to travel further than people in the city. The tradies and the others who need their vehicles to travel around are now going to have the fringe benefits tax concessions cut. Those sorts of things will adversely affect regional areas.


Look at the agriculture budget. What a sad and sorry sight that is.  While Minister Albanese has scores of pages of press releases, there are only two pages for the whole of the department of agriculture because there is nothing there.  Another $32 billion has been taken away from it and there is no new expenditure on quarantine. This budget strategy has utterly failed. It has utterly failed regional Australians. It will deliver nothing for our communities. A government who can think nothing more than to introduce these costs is truly delivering on Labor values. (Time expired)

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:00):  I rise with great interest in being able to contribute to this matter of public importance debate, although I find it somewhat hypocritical that the member for North Sydney would come forward and draw attention to one of the biggest contradictions in the budget response he has led for the opposition. As anyone who has followed any of the interviews that the member for North Sydney has given over the last 24 hours would know, the contradiction is that, on the one hand, he wants to tell everybody that the budget handed down last night was too savage and ripped away at the heart of so-called middle-class welfare, as people out there say, but, on the other hand, he wants to tell us that it was not nearly savage enough. It is somewhat confusing and somewhat hypocritical but the member for North Sydney will get his opportunity, through his leader, tomorrow night to spell out in clear detail exactly what this confused position will ultimately mean for the Australian people.


I saw that the member for North Sydney raised the issue of cost-of-living pressures. I note that the issue of cost of living pressures has been raised with him on numerous occasions over the last couple of weeks in relation to specific measures that the government has indicated will provide relief to families from those cost of living pressures. On each occasion that any of these initiatives have been put to the member for North Sydney, he has failed to commit himself and his party to supporting these measures to provide relief to those families facing these pressures. On each occasion when he has been asked whether or not he supports the government's initiatives the best he could do was to fail to agree to support the government's initiatives and respond by saying the following, which I quote from Australian Agenda on 4 May:


At this stage the best support the Government can give is to get the budget back to surplus as soon as possible and take some of the upward pressure off interest rates.


Then on 8 May on the Insiders program he was asked the question again. I think it was Barrie Cassidy who tried to pin him down on whether or not he would support these measures which would provide relief to families. Once again, he refused to confirm that he would support those measures and the best he could come up with was to say:


If you want to take pressure off families, if you want to take upward pressure off interest rates, you have to get back to surplus as quickly as possible.


We agree that you have to get back to surplus as quickly as possible. That is why the budget that the Treasurer handed down last night charted out a pathway for a return to surplus in 2012-13. I know we have heard from the member for North Sydney that he thinks that somehow he is going to deliver a surplus sooner and I guess we will all see whether or not that is possible when his leader comes forward and sets out his party's plans tomorrow night. I think we all wait with bated breath to see that fiscal consolidation. That clearly would be the fastest fiscal consolidation known to man if that were to be achieved, but we will wait and see exactly how he intends to achieve that.


So we have the member for North Sydney out there raising issues of concern about the cost of living pressures. I note that he has failed to acknowledge any of the measures and we will see tomorrow night whether he supports the measures that this government is proposing to ease those cost-of-living pressures. There are many. If you have children in child care, for example, apart from having benefitted from the increase in the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent that this government introduced—




Mr Haase:
  You want to freeze it.




Mr BRADBURY:
  The member opposite is so confused about these matters that he somehow thinks that this has something to do with family payments. I will come to the family payments in a minute, but I am talking about the childcare tax rebate. We increased the rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent for out-of-pocket expenses. In addition to that, in this budget we are now providing families with a greater capacity to access those benefits sooner and in a more timely fashion. Those are the sorts of things you do if you want to relieve some of these cost of living pressures on families.


The member opposite wanted to buy into the debate over family payments and the family tax benefit. I am sure that the member would be much more supportive of our proposition than the member for North Sydney has been. It is a proposition that seeks to provide parents with family tax benefit relief if they have teenage children who are continuing high school. This is one of the anachronisms of the system. It is antiquated, it is old fashioned and it reflects a time when not as many children went on to study in years 11 and 12. As we know, more and more young people are doing that and we encourage that because ultimately it will increase workforce participation, it will give those kids a better chance of getting a job and in the end they will end up with better income. We encourage this, but the pressure that families have been feeling has been acute. That is why we have been committed to delivering an increase in the funding that is available through the family tax benefit for parents with teenage kids. For some families that will mean an improvement of up to $4,000 a year. It is a significant improvement that will relieve those cost of living pressures.


You do not hear anything on that today from the opposition, but we did hear something on this point from the shadow Treasurer the other day when he came out and said it was 'curious.' As the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs indicated today, his position has become curiouser, curiouser and curiouser. Unfortunately, he is so confused about it that none of us know where he stands on this issue. I tell you what, this government will be proceeding with this reform. It will put more money in the pockets of families as they try to help their kids go on to higher studies. n addition to that, we have expanded the availability of the education tax refund and one of the eligible items will now be school uniforms. This will provide relief to families who are facing cost of living pressures. In addition to that, if you are an apprentice, you will have the benefit of obtaining higher bonuses and more access to mentoring. If you are a tradie or a small business, you will have access to the new instant write-off up to $5,000, and we have expanded that to include utes and other motor vehicles used by tradies and other small businesses. In addition to that, we have invested a considerable amount of money in schools for children with disabilities which will help families already stressed and under financial pressure because of all the pressures they face raising children with disabilities. They will now have access to more assistance in their schools as a result of these measures.


These are the very real and tangible things that were outlined in last night's budget by the government that will relieve some of those cost of living pressures. They build upon a record of a government that have delivered many improvements that have assisted with the cost of living pressures. We could mention the $46.7 million worth of tax cuts between 2008-09 and 2011-12, the $3 billion to establish the education tax refund, the $1.6 million that was the enhancement in the childcare tax rebate, not to mention our historic reforms to the pension—increasing the rate of the pension by $128 per fortnight for singles and $116 per fortnight for couples. 


During this debate, we have had some discussion about interest rates and the opposition say that they believe the best thing you can do for families is to take pressure off interest rates. The best thing you can do to take pressure off interest rates is to not oppose the savings measures in this budget. The Leader of the Opposition has already indicated they will block the $3 billion. Every savings measure those opposite block will put more pressure on interest rates. They will put more cost-of-living pressures on the very people whom this government are determined to help. We will secure the passage of this budget through the parliament because it is important that we do that to deliver relief from cost-of-living pressures. Every time the opposition want to block the $3 billion worth of measures, they will be hurting the people who need relief.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2011-05-11,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:10):  The saddest thing about that 10-minute self-congratulation from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer is that he truly believes what he was given to say. This budget delivered last night fails on almost every ground, and that is rare. It is a budget that fails in substance. It is a budget that betrays the Australian people. It is a budget that knowingly increases the cost-of-living pressures that Australian families and small businesses face. Before last night's budget, Australian families and small businesses knew for sure that cost-of-living pressures, which have increased in recent months and years, would increase again thanks to the carbon tax. They did not know that before the election, but they knew it for sure last night thanks to the Prime Minister's backflip. They now know for sure, following last night's budget and the failure of the Treasurer, that that will be matched with increases in interest rates which will increase even further cost-of-living pressures. 


The government's failure on the budget has been identified by commentators here in Canberra and right across Australia. Alan Kohler described it as a budget on a 'wing and a prayer'. You do not need to take our word for it. For those backbenchers opposite, that respected economic commentator also said: 


Any decent CFO would be embarrassed by this budget. There has been an $8 billion blow-out in this year's deficit since the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Review last November, a $10 billion blow-out in next year's deficit. The return to surplus the year after, requiring a $26 billion turnaround in the bottom line in 12 months, simply ignores what is happening and plugging in the same economic parameters for 2012-13 as before. 


Robert Gottliebson, whom colleagues quoted in question time, made similar points.


A lot has been said quite rightly about debt. With this government, we know that the level of net government debt in dollar terms is going to be incredibly high, north of $100 billion. In 1996 when we won government from those opposite, we inherited a $96 billion debt. The Australian public are acutely aware of the cost of debt. They are acutely aware that the interest payments needed to service that debt is money that cannot be spent on day-to-day programs. They are acutely aware that the higher the level of net government debt the more pressure on interest rates. They are absolutely aware of that which is why it is like extracting teeth to get this Treasurer to name the figure for which he is responsible. Today he stated that figure. He mumbled it out. Do not take my word for the fact that this is a deceitful Treasurer; take the word of the former finance minister, who has written in his book and has belled the cat on the fact that this tactic, first in 2009, of not mentioning the budget deficit figure in the budget speech and trying to conceal the dollar figure of net government debt by referring only to the percentage of GDP was, in fact, a deliberate tactic. He has written about it in his book. What he said—and I would like those opposite to do what they normally do and howl interjections, because you will be interjecting against your own former colleague—was:


Their—


former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the Treasurer, Wayne Swan—


understandable concern about handing a political weapon to their opponents—


in naming this figure—


was more than offset by the ridicule that this apparent attempt to deny reality invited.


It was an attempt to deny reality. That tells us a couple of things about this dishonest Treasurer. The public have had many examples over the last three or four years of where this government cannot be trusted. When we see the Treasurer refuse to name that figure, he is doing so to deliberately conceal it from the Australian people. He mumbled it out in question time today, but last night when interviewed on Sky Agenda we had the incredible spectacle where he was asked by David Speers about the level of net government debt. David Speers said: 'What sort of peak debt are we now looking at?' The Treasurer responded: 'The peak of net debt will be 7.2 per cent in 2011-12.' David Speers asked: 'But how many in dollar terms? How much in dollar terms?' Wayne Swan replied: 'Well it's relatively modest,' and listen to this, 'I haven't got the figure on me at the moment.'


This Treasurer would have you believe that he is so incompetent that he does not know the dollar figure of the net debt for which he is responsible in the budget he has just delivered to parliament. In the contest between telling the truth and concealing the level of that debt from the public he would have you believe that he has no idea—and my friend and colleague with me at the table would agree, we think he has mostly no idea. But even we cannot accept that he would not know that figure, if only for the reason that we know from the exhibit released last week, the book of the former finance minister, that this was a deliberate tactic to conceal the level of the debt. The Treasurer even knowing that still ploughs on, like some sort of out-of-control lawn mower over wet grass, with the same inane, ridiculous strategy thinking that the Australian people will somehow be prevented from knowing that net government debt will peak at $107 billion. We even had the finance minister today, again, on Adelaide radio try and refuse to reveal the figure. She could only do it for a couple of answers and we had to ask the Treasurer today to state the figure.


The $107 billion—the $106 billion and some change in the Treasurer's view—is the most generous construction that can be put on it. That is, of course—as my friend the member for Groom knows, having been a minister in the previous government—the level of debt, but is not the level of fiscal deterioration. This government did not start with a debt position; it started with savings. In fact, it started in 2007-08 with $44 billion in the bank. This is like having a credit card with $44 billion in it and ready to go before you rack-up a dollar of debt. It is a $150 billion deterioration.


I was looking through the Treasurer's first budget. Every budget speech from the Treasurer has had some element of deception. We had temporary deficits one year; remember? In his first budget, when you look down at the same table that lists the level of net government debt—on page 10.8 in this year's budget for those opposite—you would not have guessed that what was projected for this time, 2011-12, was $106 billion, but in savings, not debt. He has managed to transpose the whole show.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (16:20):  I am very pleased to speak this afternoon in this matter of public importance debate about the cost of living, and it is very good to see that the opposition has decided to play catch-up in today's MPI because yesterday they certainly had no interest in the economy or budget settings and the way that it impacts on ordinary Australians. They had no interest in the way that this government is responding to the cost-of-living pressures that face Australians. They had no questions to ask and, frankly, today's efforts by the opposition in question time were not terribly much better.


This afternoon there is apparently a newfound interest in these issues from the other side of the chamber. Those of us on this side are extremely happy to talk about the way that this government is responding to the real needs of Australians through this budget and how we have responded to it since coming to office. Let us have a look at some of the practical measures that this government has been responsible for. In skills and training we have been ensuring that skills and training opportunities for young people in electorates such as mine are available to ensure that they have productive working lives and to enable them to meet living expenses. In my electorate of La Trobe the most recent commitments made in last night's budget mean that around 2,500 apprentices in my electorate alone will be able to benefit from Labor's investment in apprenticeships, which will enable more people in my electorate to ultimately get skilled jobs. Our commitments in relation to families with children have been fairly significant since coming to office and were expanded upon in yesterday's budget. We are providing families with children with the support that they need through increases to family tax benefit part A. Around 5,000 families in my electorate are affected by this commitment. They will receive an extra $4,200 per child aged between 16 and 19 years old. I am sure that those 5,000 local families will appreciate the meaningful and practical effects of our commitment to responding to their cost-of-living pressures.


During its term of office the Howard government certainly talked the talk of supporting pensioners and older Australians, but it took this government, in its first term and against the backdrop of a global financial crisis, to make a meaningful commitment to pensioners in real and financial terms. We have supported pensioners with a historic increase in the pension. Since September 2009 we have increased the age pension by $128 per fortnight for singles and $116 per fortnight for couples. We have also delivered an improved pension work bonus so that age pensioners can hold onto an extra $125 per week of their income from work. These are practical measures, real measures, things that the Howard government refused to do during more than a decade in office.


Meaningfully, since coming to office we have provided tax cuts three years in a row—$46.7 billion in cuts. We have also committed $1.25 billion in this budget to delivering up to $300 more in the low income tax offset during the year. We established a $300 billion education tax rebate and in this year's budget we have extended that rebate by $460 million to cover school uniforms. Again, this is something the Howard government, during a decade in office, had absolutely no interest in pursuing.


We have increased the childcare rebate, by $1.6 billion, from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses. We have made the childcare rebate more flexible to allow families to access those benefits sooner and we have implemented a historic Paid Parental Leave scheme so that parents can be supported after the birth of a child. We have also committed nearly half a billion dollars under the Teen Dental Plan. These policies and reforms run right across areas from childcare to education, taxation, pensions, superannuation and skills development. They are meaningful measures that are tangible to ordinary Australians, and certainly to members of my electorate.


With the announcements made in yesterday's budget, Australians will know that we have increased our already significant commitments to boosting employment and making sure that all Australians are given an opportunity to participate in work and take home an income. We on this side of the chamber know that these are things that respond to cost-of-living pressures. They are things which give options to working people, pensioners, families with children and to young people looking to develop skills and ensure they have a meaningful job and career. They are things which give them the opportunity to meet cost-of-living pressures. In addition to doing all of these things in the context of the financial crisis and the natural disasters around the country, which have had a significant impact on our budget measures, we understand the need to make significant and transformative economic changes. That is why our budget will ensure that there are settings in place to put downward pressure on inflation. We are investing in our workforce. We are investing in infrastructure. I notice that in this matter of public importance discussion the Leader of the Nationals declined to mention any significant means by which those on the other side of the House would contribute to our national infrastructure development and the jobs associated with any such development.


We know that the most important thing for Australian families, for all Australians and for the future of our country is ensuring that more Australians than ever have the security and dignity of work. That is why we acted swiftly to protect 200,000 jobs in the face of the global financial crisis, an event which seems to have escaped the opposition's interest and has been excised from their collective memory. Our commitment to ensuring the security and dignity of work for working Australians is reflected in our proudest achievement in government: the creation of over 750,000 jobs since coming to office. It is also why we have the settings in place for the economy to generate around 500,000 new jobs within the next couple of years. This sets the opposition in stark contrast to us. They made no effort to support our efforts to stimulate the economy in the face of the global financial crisis. Jobs were at the bottom of their list of priorities.


The opposition was asleep at the wheel during the last resources boom. We are not and we will not be. We are determined to ensure that the minerals resource rental tax will give all Australians a better share in the proceeds that come from our mineral wealth. This is something which will ensure that all Australians can profit from those mineral wealth gains, that there is a level of equity for Australians and that we can support significant programs into the future.


Despite all these things, the opposition are yet to present anything constructive or positive which would indicate how they would respond to the cost-of-living pressures which they are seemingly concerned about today—though perhaps not tomorrow, because they were certainly not interested in them yesterday during question time. On the one hand, the opposition assert that they will restore the budget to surplus by next year; on the other hand, they continue with their boundless spending commitments. I know that those spending commitments were made with gay abandon in my electorate during the last federal election campaign. There were a variety of election 'commitments' made by the former Liberal member for La Trobe which were not included in the costings of the coalition prior to the election. There were more than $80 million worth of election commitments in my electorate alone. This indicates the level of fiscal responsibility that runs right the way down from the leaders of the coalition to their individual members and candidates in local elections. Given that the opposition will make a swifter return to surplus while making these spending commitments, and not saying what their spending cuts are likely to be, presumably someone on the other side has the colour copier out, because the only way they can achieve those two ends is to start printing money. e know what happened the last time they tried to achieve spending cuts at the same time as making their election commitments. We know that there was an $11 billion black hole that was independently verified and tested. We know that the opposition has form when it comes to inaccurate representations of their economic commitments, and I certainly expect that to be the case tomorrow night.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The discussion is now concluded.

That the amendments be agreed to.


As members would recall the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 will repeal the requirements for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity as a precondition of their votes being included in the count for an election. This requirement was put in place by the previous government in 2006. It resulted in a situation where provisional votes were dealt with in a way that was inconsistent with the treatment of other types of declaration votes—namely, absent, postal and pre-poll votes. By repealing the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity, all declaration votes will be treated equally.


The bill replaces the requirement to provide evidence of identity with a test similar to that used in previous elections. The test provides for the divisional returning officer to compare the signature on the provisional vote envelope with the signature of the elector on previously lodged enrolment records if there is any doubt as to the bona fides of the elector.


This bill is supported by the Electoral Commission, which in its submissions to the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2010 federal election and matters related thereto recommended that the requirement for the production of evidence of identity by provisional voters should be repealed. The government will be supporting the amendments to the bill moved by Senator Xenophon and agreed to by the Senate. These amendments provide for the divisional returning officer if not satisfied that a signature on an envelope is that of the elector must make all reasonable attempts to contact the elector to require them to provide evidence of identity.


We see these amendments as providing a desirable safety net to prevent what would be otherwise valid additional votes from being discarded. They are a substantive improvement to the bill, and we will support them. I commend the bill to the House.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (16:35):  The opposition is supporting this amendment, as we did in the Senate, for the following reason. When we amended the legislation and put in place that those people wishing to cast a provisional vote should provide proof of identity we did so to protect the integrity of the roll. The minister makes the case that that meant we treated provisional votes as declaration votes different from other declaration votes, but of course the government by its own hand, by allowing pre-poll votes to be dealt with on the evening of the count, instead of being dealt with as they previously were, means that those declaration votes are already dealt with differently.


We were concerned, and so opposed the change to the legislation that would do away with proof of identity. Senator Xenophon's amendment will make more work for the Electoral Commission and I would have preferred it, and the opposition would have preferred it, if the responsibility had remained with the individual to ensure that they brought their proof of identity. I would point out that in the 2010 election somewhere between 75 and 80 per cent of people who wished to cast a provisional vote did so by providing that proof of identity. So that was an improvement over the 2007 position. Clearly, it was becoming accepted by those who wished to cast that sort of vote. By supporting the amendment as moved by Senator Xenophon it does mean that the concept of the need for a provisional voter to provide a proof of identity is an important one. Also I think it is important to recap as to why a person cast a provisional vote. The first point is that you were not found to be on the roll when you presented yourself. The second is that somebody had already voted in your name. The third is that the DRO simply did not like the look of you. The fourth is that you are on the confidential, secret roll because of security or other reasons that are acceptable. The way the government had drafted its amending bill meant that it was simply saying that the DRO had to compare the signature on the envelope with the existing signature. It is quite possible and indeed probable that in many instances there was no signature to compare it too. In the state election in New South Wales they had a similar provision where they had begun the process of automatic enrolment so there would be no signature because people were automatically put on the roll. So we believe that the concept of returning to the legislation the requirement for proof of identity is a step in the right direction. We would still at a future time in government revisit this because we believe it is the only way that you can adequately protect the integrity of the roll. The Electoral Commissioner, when he put in his submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, or JSCEM, made it quite clear that one of the key parts, if not the key part, of his task was to protect the integrity of the roll. We do see cases of multiple voting and we see that they are not followed up, and those are issues that we will be addressing in that committee. But for the purposes of this bill and this amendment, I say very firmly that returning to the legislation the concept that a provisional voter can be required to produce proof of identity is a step in the right direction. Therefore we support the amendment.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2011-05-11,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (19:00):  I rise today on behalf of small business tradesmen in my electorate of Paterson who have been failed by the Gillard Labor government. These workers are owed in excess of $600,000 for work they completed in good faith under Labor's Building the Education Revolution. Instead of helping them, Labor hung these businesses out to dry and then washed their hands of it. When Prime Minister Rudd announced a $16.2 billion program to build infrastructure in our schools he said it was to boost the economy. The government's website says that the BER will 'support local jobs and stimulate investment'. 


In my electorate of Paterson a group of 56 small businesses were subcontracted to build a school hall COLA facility at the Pacific Palms Public School. Unlike many others, these small businesses completed the job with distinction. They brought the supplies, they put in the hours and they finished the hall in August 2010. It is now six months later and they are still waiting for their payment. There are also subcontractors owed money for BER projects at Bungwahl Public School in my electorate and at Coopernook Public School in the member for Lyne's electorate. How on earth has this been allowed to happen? 


The company that subcontracted my constituents, Cape View Developments, has gone into liquidation. It failed to pay its subcontractors. The company that contracted Cape View Developments, Reed Constructions, failed to pay the subcontractors despite giving guarantees to the subcontractors they would once the work was completed. Neither the former state Labor Keneally government nor the current Gillard Labor government bothered to ensure the debt was settled. 


The buck must stop with the Prime Minister, who, as the former education minister, is responsible for the BER program. But our Prime Minister Gillard wants all of the gain and none of the pain. When it came to spruiking her program, Prime Minister Gillard was happy to send Senator Forshaw to my electorate to open the building work at Pacific Palms Public School and to speak to the media, but when it comes to ensuring those who did the work in good faith get paid for it, neither she nor Senator Forshaw was anywhere to be seen. Prime Minister Gillard has left those businesses and families under severe financial stress. She should be ashamed. For example, Carl Organ is a local plumber who signed a contract, bought supplies and completed the job. He is now owed more than $45,000. That is a massive amount of money for a small business and a family that is trying to make a living and put their kids through school. 


There are many other questions that are yet to be answered—questions such as: did Cape View sign a declaration of payment to a subcontractor under the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act stating to Reed that it had paid its subbies in order to get paid itself? If so, it could be in breach of the law. I have put the question to Reed Constructions but they would not answer my questions. Even the subcontractors themselves have been largely shut out by Reed, which seems to have gone to ground on the issue. Put simply, no-one wants to take responsibility for the BER program when things go wrong. Prime Minister Gillard has handed out billions of taxpayers' dollars but failed to put into place any mechanisms for accountability. So it is up to her to settle this matter. 


I wrote to the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Chris Evans, regarding this issue back on 3 March and he has not bothered to reply. Yet they continue to send Senator Forshaw to open school buildings in my electorate. Likewise the member for Lyne also had the chance to stand up for these workers, many of whom are his constituents, but he would not do anything for them. Sadly, I am not surprised, because he had a chance to vote with the coalition to approve an inquiry into the BER but he would not. I think he is more interested in his own job than he is interested in standing up for his own constituents. The small businesses who are already struggling because of these debts will now have to pay for lawyers to take this up in court on their behalf. It would be yet another burden. 


Labor must do something to fix this now and I will not rest until it does. I have written to the Prime Minister and the New South Wales Minister for Education, Minister Piccoli. Prime Minister, you are sending Senator Forshaw to open a building in Grahamstown on Monday and in another town on Tuesday. Will you instruct him to meet with the subbies who have not yet been paid? Prime Minister, I am demanding that you take an active role and end this debt problem for people who placed good faith in the BER program, built a great building but have not been paid and are wearing the burden of your policies.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (09:31):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to alert you to a terrible story about the government's continued failure on the home insulation scheme—a scheme that has cost lives and homes, destroyed businesses and cost the Australian taxpayer $1.7 billion and counting. The week before last I was contacted by a constituent of mine in Carnegie, Mr Horvath. You will remember that the government sent out insulation installers door to door to doorknock pensioners like Mr Horvath. He agreed to have them install insulation as it was a government program. He told me that, eight weeks after he had the roof insulation installed under the government's program last year, part of his bedroom ceiling collapsed at 1 am while he and his wife were sleeping. I just want to read part of the discussion that Mr Horvath had with Neil Mitchell where he described what happened:


Neil Mitchell: This must have given you an almighty fright, did it?


Geza Horvath: Yeah, I thought it's an earthquake because it happened at one o'clock in the morning. We were in bed.


Neil Mitchell: Did it come down on you?


Geza Horvath: Not exactly on us. It's about a metre from us. It came down on the wardrobe, top of the wardrobe, and it probably slipped over to the bed or hung down right on the end of the bed.


Neil Mitchell: Well, you're very lucky.


Geza Horvath: We were very lucky because it could have come down, the whole lot, because the weight of the concrete, this is the slab, the concrete (inaudible) into the timber and then plaster closed up on the front, so it's really heavy. When we cleaned it up, it was four wheelbarrows topped up of rubbish.


Neil Mitchell: And you're quite sure this was caused by the insulation work?


Geza Horvath: Definitely, because the timber with the (inaudible) timber where it's squeezed into the plaster into it. It's broken.


Neil Mitchell: And you still haven't had a government inspector out to look at it?


Geza Horvath: No. I couldn't cope with it because I'm on chemo, and the second chemo now, and I couldn't cope with it. But I was expecting, I got a call from Sydney about the first time I reported it, and these people they rang me up and they asked me if I have any spotlights, and I tell them I haven't got. But the crack was already there, and what he was saying is, ""Look,"" he said, ""you'll be alright"", and boom, he dropped the phone.


There was no inspection. Clearly the safety of Mr Horvath and his wife is the most critical thing. I contacted the office of the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Greg Combet, straight away to get a safety inspector out there. Until Mr Horvath spoke to Neil Mitchell, there was no day or time Mr Horvath had been given as to when an inspector would come. Straight after the interview we got a call from the minister's office letting us know that an inspector would be out by Friday 3 pm. It should not have to be like that.


Now that we know that the ceiling is safe, the key problem is fixing the ceiling. Yet—get this—the government takes no responsibility to ensure that there is a rectification of damage under the Home Insulation Program. This is despite the fact that they put the program in place and paid the bills. They leave it to the homeowner to pursue and resolve.


I specifically asked the parliamentary secretary's office what assistance would be provided to the people affected and what he would do to help Mr Horvath repair the damage to his home. The advice back from his department was that all that they would do was provide the name of the installer and the installer's insurer to Mr Horvath and then it was up to him. So they expect the victims—people who might be confused by the process and who might not be well enough to hunt down their installer—to write a letter to them, follow them up, contact the installer's insurer to check that it is being progressed and so on and so on—to do all the work.



The department advised me that they would give him a caseworker from the department. Yet all the caseworker will do is encourage him to continue to make calls to the installer. According to the annual report of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the minister and his parliamentary secretary have 1,027 people working there. If they are not helping elderly and vulnerable people who have been affected by this botched scheme, what are they all doing? The government has to take responsibility for cleaning up the mess that they have created. (Time expired)

Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (10:01):  I rise today to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The intention of this bill is to improve the effectiveness of the recovery of fee reductions, enrolment advances and business continuity payments paid to approved childcare services. Currently, where financial recoveries need to be made, these are for the most part offset against subsequent payments of fee reductions, enrolment advances or business continuity payments made to the service. Amendments made by this bill will enable recovery of these amounts also by way of set-off from any payments made to services through the childcare management system—that is, from acquittal payments made to services under the CCMS Act and from payments made to services under administrative (that is, non-legislative) schemes.


Under this government, significant debts have been raised, especially when childcare providers were transitioned to the CCMS system by the Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations, otherwise known as DEEWR. DEEWR officials in 2010 budget estimates indicated this debt to be in the vicinity of $70 million, with around 6,000 childcare providers owing a debt to the Commonwealth as a result. My understanding is that the department is still in the process of recovering these debts. However, discussions with providers have indicated that they are surprised at how tardy the recovery effort has been to date. I suspect that the Australian taxpayer would be quite mortified to learn of this unaccountable delay.


This legislation will assist in the recovery, and one can only hope it will (a) decrease future debt accumulation and (b) speed up the recovery process. These are, after all, taxpayer dollars that are sitting idle.


Amendments are also included in this bill to enable the recovery of those amounts from the same range of payments to be made to another approved childcare service operated by the same operator. The schedule 2 amendments seek to allow for greater clarification of when exactly a service has stopped providing care to a particular child, as this determines when childcare benefit is no longer payable. Each child is permitted 42 days absence from care in a given year. However, in circumstances in which it is clear that the service has ceased caring for the child, this bill will allow the minister to specify through a legislative instrument the exact circumstance of a child's absence from care. This will then ensure cessation of the childcare benefit.


Further amendments proposed by this bill will allow the secretary the discretion to cease advance enrolment payments to businesses that have notified their intent to close. This will reduce the debt to the Commonwealth where previously advance enrolment payments were paid up until the business ceased operating. In addition, the bill enables for the greater sharing of relevant protected information between departments where expressed or implied consent has been granted. The purpose of these amendments is to allow information collected by Centrelink on approved childcare services to be shared with the relevant state and territory regulatory bodies under the new education and care services national law. The coalition believes that these amendments make for a more cohesive system, unlike other policies of this government that actively seek to increase the workload on childcare providers by overwhelming providers with baseless paperwork and bureaucracy. In short, the coalition have no issue with this unremarkable piece of legislation before the Main Committee today. We take great issue with the government's management of the childcare industry and the nation's children and will, of course, have much more to say about that in the future.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (10:05):  I speak in support of the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This is amending legislation. It makes a number of administrative amendments to family assistance law: strengthening debt recovery, empowering the secretary to do certain things and improving compliance and administration of the childcare benefit. It will mean that unscrupulous operators cannot operate in the market and it will protect the markets from the same. It will improve the accountability of the childcare market and also make it clear that, if a childcare operator restructures, they cannot continue to operate in the market without consequence. It will make sure that mums and dads who send their kids to childcare centres while they attend work know they have the best operators possible caring for their kids.


Meaningful reform I think is at the heart of our agenda with respect to child care. I think this is extremely important because mums and dads who send their kids to child care want to make sure their kids are cared for by ethical, moral, highly educated professionals who not just provide child care but engage in the education process and improve the socialisation that child care provides for young people before they attend school. The rapid growth in the childcare industry has provided many benefits to families and to our economy, but of course there have been some problems and this legislation seeks to overcome them. At the risk of sounding Orwellian, not all childcare operators are equal, not all state regulations are best practice and not enough scrutiny has been undertaken with respect to the childcare industry to make sure that young people receive consistent, appropriate and the best early learning experiences they can be offered.


The unprecedented and shocking collapse of ABC Learning Centres across the country in 2008 exemplified some of the problems in the industry. The industry grew rapidly under the watch of the previous Howard coalition government without appropriate regulation and the consequences were there for all to see. The ABC collapse could have been alarming and disastrous. It was the federal Labor government's quick and decisive action that ensured that childcare centres remained open across the country that saved the day. In fact, 90 per cent of centres remained open when most could have collapsed entirely. About 100,000 families benefited from the government's timely and effective action at the time.


Since 2008 we have introduced a range of measures to ensure the financial viability of childcare providers is strengthened, and I will take this opportunity to outline some of those. These include strengthening the approval process, providing additional notification of the closure of centres and establishing a new penalty regime to have consequences for unscrupulous and unethical childcare operators. Until the 2010 budget we had invested $18.2 billion in early child care across the forward estimates, and that was increased in the budget last night. In 2010 that was $11 billion more than the former Howard coalition government, whose commitment to child care was wonderfully exemplified by the fact that they ripped $1 billion out of the childcare sector in almost the first act they undertook upon election in 1996. That was really an act of economic and familial vandalism of the sector. It had consequences in terms of not just economic development but productivity. In 2008, we delivered on our election commitment by increasing the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, from a maximum of $4,354 per child to $7,500 per child per annum. The Howard government had made it so that you could only claim it on a yearly basis or you could knock it down to quarterly, but we changed that and made it on a weekly and fortnightly basis. For a family with long day care needs earning about $55,000 a year, out-of-pocket childcare costs went down from about 13 per cent to seven per cent in 2010.


This is not some esoteric piece of legislation that does not have consequences right across the country. That is evident from the fact that, based on the latest figures that I could obtain, there are 869,770 children in child care across the country. That is 627,980 families with parents working and building our economy while their children are in child care—and there are 13,899 childcare services creating jobs across the country. The legislation before us will improve accountability in the childcare industry and will protect the market, as I said, from unscrupulous operators.


We have also invested another $273.7 million in the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care. We think it is important that there be nationwide consistency with respect to childcare centres—an arrangement which improves educator-to-child ratios, introduces educator qualification requirements and includes a new childcare rating system. Indeed, contrary to what the previous speaker, the member for Farrer, said, it goes about reducing the regulatory burden by establishing a single regulator.


These reforms are very much based on and exemplified by international research into the first five years of life, which points to the importance of shaping the learning experience and social development of our young people. Indeed, I was pleased to see the press release issued by the Hon. Kate Ellis, the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare, on 12 April 2011, stating that a new report from Early Childhood Australia highlighted the importance of our national reforms to early childhood education and care. The minister welcomed the report and made the point that we are working with the states and territories to 'lift the standard of care across the country'. The report 'clearly makes the case for quality in child care' and is at one with our position on the quality reforms for the childcare sector.


There is little doubt that those on the opposite side of the chamber have manufactured hysteria and faux outrage as we have trumped them in this area of policy reform. They really have forgotten—but the childcare sector has not—that they failed miserably in this area when they were in power. The sector welcomed reform back in 1996, but the coalition came to power and just ripped the heart out of the sector. The sector was left desperately trying to recover, contacting and lobbying coalition members repeatedly. The coalition had failed them and were unsuccessful, much as they were unsuccessful in the aged-care sector during the 11½ years of Howard coalition rule.


We are not going to be cowed by the white noise that those opposite not just perpetrate but also perpetuate, like the previous speaker. We are going to forge ahead because we think this is a meaningful reform agenda. This legislation is part of that agenda, improving accountability, consistency and quality. We want to make sure that parents have peace of mind, that employers and employees have certainty and, most particularly, that our young people have the kind of quality early childhood and care experience they deserve.


Finally, I noted in last night's budget announcements that, under the portfolios of Mr Garrett, the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, and Ms Ellis, the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare, there was $32.4 million for an early childhood reform agenda, and I think that is important. There is $9.2 million for the recognition of prior learning package to assist early childhood workforce access training, and $23.2 million over four years for the Australian Early Development Index, to be met from existing resources. That brings the total to $28 million in relation to the AEDI for the next three-year cycle. I think that what I have outlined here in my speech shows the high priority that we put on early childhood education and how important it is, and not just for our economy. It is an absolute fact that the previous coalition government spent about one-fifth of our OECD competitors on early childhood education. It is a great shame that we spent about a fifth of what the Americans, the New Zealanders, the Canadians and the British spent. It seemed that the Howard coalition government had a real blank in this area. They just could not understand that this was an important part not just in helping mums and dads but in helping the economy. So a national quality reform agenda is absolutely crucial for early childhood education and care. This legislation, though amending legislation, is important. It is to be recognised that it plays out not just nationally but locally.


Finally, I want to say that the best demonstration of this that I can think of in my electorate is the commitment we made to the Yamanto Early Learning and Care Centre, where the minister came out and made that announcement with me and we opened it together—a $1.6 million commitment. That is the best childcare centre in terms of facilities in the Blair electorate. Its collocation beside the Amberley District School means greater convenience for families in the growing suburbs in the south side of Ipswich, not far from where I live. It is about two kilometres along the road from where I live—in fact, it is on one of my running routes, and I run past it regularly. It is a well-attended childcare centre. That is a demonstration locally of the national approach we have undertaken since we were elected in 2007.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (10:17):  I am quite pleased to rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care And Other Measures) Bill 2011. When this bill first came to my attention, back when caucus was discussing it, like most people I thought it was a fairly dull bill. It amends a whole stack of acts that have the word 'administration' in them. It deals with things like improving the effectiveness of the recovery of fees, allowing the government to pursue a childcare centre for return of overpaid fees and a whole stack of administrative things to do with the implementation of the national quality agenda. When you first have a look at it, it really does seem to be a lot of small administrative acts. But it underpins some very important reforms in what is perhaps the most important areas for many people in my constituency and beyond: the area of child care. It underpins ensuring that our childcare system is more efficient and it underpins the pursuit of the national quality agenda, and both are very important.


Mr Deputy Speaker, when it comes to child care there is no doubt that times have changed since you and I were children, when usually only one parent worked and grandparents were available to look after the grandchildren even in their forties. My grandmother looked after me, and I look back now and think she would not have been much older than 45. She was certainly much younger than I am, and she looked after us from time to time. That no longer happens in quite the same way in modern families. So professional child care becomes a very important issue for families, and they care greatly about this issue—as you can imagine, because our childcare system takes care of their precious children for large parts of the day. They care that it is affordable, they care that it is available and they care overwhelmingly that it meets the standards that they expect. The Rudd and Gillard governments have been working very hard since 2007 on all three of those elements—affordability, availability and quality—and this bill underpins some of the work that we have been doing in that area. There is no doubt that the changes we have made since 2007 have already assisted families greatly. Most families now spend around seven per cent of their disposable income on child care, compared to 13 per cent in 2004. It is a substantial reduction from 13 to seven per cent of disposable income and I think we can be proud of that. There is no doubt that this is largely a result of the increase in the childcare rebate from 30 to 50 per cent, up to a cap of $7,500.


The recent childcare update provides quite an interesting picture of the extent to which families are using child care across the country. Currently, 869,770 children attend child care benefit approved child care, an increase of 8.7 per cent on the June quarter in 2009. Again, that is a substantial increase and a significant help for families. Children spend an average of 21.6 hours per week in child care across all types, and almost one in four children between zero and 12 years attend child care. Almost 628,000 Australian families had at least one child in approved child care, an increase of 8.4 per cent on the June quarter. Overall we are investing around $20 billion in funding for early childhood education and child care over the next four years, and that is up by more than $12 billion since the last four years of the former coalition government. Again, that is a substantial increase, which has largely led to that change in out-of-pocket expenses from 13 per cent in 2004 to seven per cent in 2010.


We also made a promise early on to pay the childcare rebate quarterly, and we delivered on that commitment. If you remember back to pre-2007, parents had to wait until the end of the financial year after the year in which they paid the expenses to claim their rebate. We also promised to make the childcare rebate payable fortnightly and we are delivering on that from July 2011. These are significant improvements in the childcare system that is available for parents around Australia.


But $20 billion is a lot of money and it is important that we do this efficiently. The amendments in this bill give the Australian government greater scrutiny over operators and their past practices. It enables the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one service from another service run by the same operator. Up until now, that has not been possible. The Commonwealth has only been able to pursue recovery of payments from the specific operator. This will ensure that operators who run up debts to the Commonwealth in one service can be held accountable for their actions via another service. For example, when an operator accumulates debts and then exits the market and re-emerges in a similar form, the government will be able to pursue that new entity for recovery.


We know these accountability reforms are very important. In fact, we have been working to improve the financial accountability of childcare centres for quite some time. The collapse of ABC Learning in 2008 was unprecedented and it was quite a shock. The member for Blair has outlined some of the consequences of that. If the government had not acted quickly, almost 100,000 families would have had to find alternative care arrangements with very little notice. Since that time we have made quite significant changes to ensure financial viability of childcare providers, including strengthening the approvals processes and requiring additional notification of closures of centres. The new approvals process includes financial checks for new childcare centre operators to make sure they are viable from the outset and well placed to meet quality standards. These new amendments build on that work to ensure that we have a viable, efficient childcare sector—again, something that is very important to parents seeking affordability along with quality in child care.


Affordability is, of course, a major issue for parents. As I said, we have made significant changes that have improved affordability for parents. Quality is another issue which parents care profoundly about. Recent reports indicate that quality is not always what it should be. A recent report showed that childcare centres accredited between 1 July and 31 December 2010 were not always up to standard. In some areas, around a quarter of them failed to ensure that potentially dangerous products, plant and objects were inaccessible to children or failed to ensure toileting and nappy-changing procedures were positive experiences. For parents who put their children in child care, I know that reading this report would cause great concern, which is why the national quality framework is incredibly important.


This bill supports the government's $273.7 million investment in the national quality framework. The framework has already been endorsed by COAG. There has been significant work done on this in recent years. The framework aims to improve educator-to-child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention, and it introduces educator qualification requirements so that educators are better able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them to learn and develop. It includes a new rating system so that parents know the quality of care on offer and can make informed choices. I know that for parents in my constituency the ability to know exactly where they are putting their child and the quality of care that that child will receive is perhaps one of the most important factors in choosing a childcare centre. The amendments also reduce the regulatory burden, in spite of the opposition speaker's claim to the contrary, by requiring childcare centres to only deal with one regulator. We know that the first five years of a child's life shape their future. It is perhaps the five years that have more importance in determining the path or your life than any other years that we live through. So it is incredibly important that we get this absolutely right. 


The new national quality framework enables the Commonwealth to share information with childcare services that are regulated by state and territory bodies, and this benefits childcare centres by not requiring them to provide the same information to more than one body. Again, while this bill seems to deal with rather dry administrative matters, it underpins some incredibly important reforms that the government has been undertaking for some time. I am pleased to support this bill.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (10:27):  Child care is one of the most vital services for which any government can take responsibility. Adequate child care provides parents with certainty that their children will be not only cared for properly but also given the opportunity to learn. So it is about care and also about learning, at an affordable price. Under the Rudd and Gillard governments, we have made a real commitment towards improving child care, improving accessibility to child care and recognising the importance of child care. Adequate child care is not something that is a privilege; it is the right of all parents to have access to affordable child care.


That is why the government is providing $20 billion over four years for early childhood education and child care. This is almost $12.8 billion more than that provided during the last four years of the Howard government. That is a significant increase in funding for child care and children's education services. This says to me that you go to the Rudd-Gillard governments to look at outcomes for children, a commitment to children and learning, and to see how important child care is. Then you look at the record of the Howard government to see how undervalued child care was under that government. We believe that quality child care is the right of all families and all children. I think the other side of the parliament believes that quality child care is a privilege, not a right.


The government is also providing $16.4 billion to help 800,000 Australian families annually with the cost of child care through the childcare benefit and the childcare rebate. This includes $9.2 billion over four years to reduce childcare fees under the childcare benefit and $7.2 billion to assist working families with out-of-pocket childcare costs under the childcare rebate. This is $10.2 billion more fee assistance than under the last four years of the Howard government. Once again, you have a government which recognises the importance of child care as opposed to the Howard government, which looked upon it as a privilege or something that was there for the wealthy.


The legislation that we are debating here today will amend the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999, the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Management System and Other Measures) Act 2007, the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, the Student Assistance Act 1973 and the Age Discrimination Act 2004. The bill makes a number of amendments which allow the government to strengthen debt recovery provisions, compliance and administration of childcare benefits.


These may be largely administrative changes—changes which look at compliance, accountability and recovery—but these are vital changes that will ensure the ongoing viability of our childcare system by a government which is totally committed to ensuring that all children get affordable, quality child care. As I have already mentioned, this is something that the previous Howard government was not committed to.


The bill improves the effectiveness of the recovery of fee reductions, enrolment advances and business continuity payments paid to approved childcare services. It clarifies provisions concerning the effects of a child's absence from care and authorises the minister to specify by legislation the circumstances in which these services will permanently cease providing care. That is quite an important change in this legislation and something that often causes confusion. I am really pleased to see that the minister has put this particular provision in the legislation, because it is all about clarification and certainty, not only to the families that enrol their children in childcare centres but to those childcare centres as well. I have been approached by owners of childcare centres who have found in the past that the provisions, uncertainty and lack of clarity in the act were causing them problems. The minister has set out very clearly the rules that are in place here. Because of this, families can have that certainty which was previously missing.


There are a number of other amendments which look at the recalculation of childcare benefits and fees and information to allow the Commonwealth to share information about childcare services with the states and territories. These are all vitally important changes that will ensure the smooth operation of our childcare services. This legislation is very positive; it shows how committed the Australian government is to providing access to quality, affordable child care and to ensuring the long-term viability of child care. I would like to share with the House that since this government came to power I have noticed a big change within my electorate for the number of people that are waiting to access child care, and that is the MyChild website, which allows parents to look at the services that have vacancies and to compare fees and the services that are provided. It has been a very, very positive initiative that parents have embraced. It has helped parents and carers deal with the problems that existed previously of lack of access to services and not knowing where the services were and what was available. The introduction of this website has improved accessibility to child care.


Given the state of my voice, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think I might finish there. In doing so I would like to conclude where I started, by emphasising the importance of child care for families and carers and the importance of quality child care for the children themselves. I congratulate the minister on the changes she is introducing here and on her commitment to child care and to the children of Australia.

Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide—Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (10:36):  I thank the member for Shortland and all the members who have made contributions to this debate. This bill contains important amendments to the family assistance administration act and other legislation in order to improve accountability in the childcare sector. The government and, indeed, families right across Australia know just how important this is. We know that, and we were reminded by the overnight collapse of ABC Learning in 2008, which was entirely unprecedented. The government's quick and decisive action at that time meant that 90 per cent of those centres continue to operate for Australian families today. Had that government support not been provided, almost 100,000 families right across Australia might have been faced with the prospect of having to find alternative care arrangements with little or no notice at all. Since 2008 we have introduced a range of new measures to better ensure the financial viability of childcare providers, including strengthening approvals processes and requiring additional notification of closures of centres. We want to make sure that what happened in 2008 with ABC never ever happens again.


The amendments in this bill today, the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011, represent a part of our commitment to improving accountability within the childcare market and protecting the market from unscrupulous operators. This bill broadens the powers of the secretary to refuse the approval of a childcare service for the purposes of family assistance law. Combined with other measures, this will give the Australian government greater scrutiny over operators and their past practices, including the power to look at whether service operators are fit and proper persons. The bill also enables the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one childcare service to another childcare service operated by the same operator. These measures will also enhance the government's ability to deal with phoenixing, where an operator who accumulates debts exits and then re-enters the market under a restructured company. Under current arrangements the government can only consider the exact operator and their history in the industry. We need to strengthen this.


Importantly, this bill will also support the government's $273.7 million investment in the National Quality Framework. The changes to protected information will support the National Quality Framework by enabling the Commonwealth to share information on childcare services with state and territory regulatory bodies. This will benefit childcare services by not requiring them to provide the same information to more than one body. This framework, endorsed by COAG, will improve educator-to-child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention. It will introduce educator qualification requirements so that our educators are better able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them to learn and develop. It will include a new rating system so parents know the quality of care on offer and how to make informed choices, and it will reduce the regulation burden so services only have to deal with one regulator.


We are doing this because we know from years and years of international research that the first five years of a child's life shapes their future, health, learning and social development. We want to make sure that that future is bright for Australian children. We know how important this is. We also know that, of the long day care services that received an accreditation decision between 1 July and 31 December last year, 25 per cent of those services failed to ensure that potentially dangerous products, plants and objects were inaccessible to children. Twenty-nine per cent failed to implement effective and current food safety and hygiene practices. Twenty-eight per cent failed to ensure that toileting and nappy-changing procedures were positive experiences, and 20 per cent did not act to control the spread of infectious diseases and maintain records of immunisations. This government believes that Australian children deserve better. As a government, we believe that we can and must do better when it comes to the safety, wellbeing and early learning of our children.


In summary, this bill makes a number of amendments that will improve transparency of the childcare industry and protect families from unscrupulous operators, and I commend the bill to the House.

Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (10:01):  I rise today to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The intention of this bill is to improve the effectiveness of the recovery of fee reductions, enrolment advances and business continuity payments paid to approved childcare services. Currently, where financial recoveries need to be made, these are for the most part offset against subsequent payments of fee reductions, enrolment advances or business continuity payments made to the service. Amendments made by this bill will enable recovery of these amounts also by way of set-off from any payments made to services through the childcare management system—that is, from acquittal payments made to services under the CCMS Act and from payments made to services under administrative (that is, non-legislative) schemes.


Under this government, significant debts have been raised, especially when childcare providers were transitioned to the CCMS system by the Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations, otherwise known as DEEWR. DEEWR officials in 2010 budget estimates indicated this debt to be in the vicinity of $70 million, with around 6,000 childcare providers owing a debt to the Commonwealth as a result. My understanding is that the department is still in the process of recovering these debts. However, discussions with providers have indicated that they are surprised at how tardy the recovery effort has been to date. I suspect that the Australian taxpayer would be quite mortified to learn of this unaccountable delay.


This legislation will assist in the recovery, and one can only hope it will (a) decrease future debt accumulation and (b) speed up the recovery process. These are, after all, taxpayer dollars that are sitting idle.


Amendments are also included in this bill to enable the recovery of those amounts from the same range of payments to be made to another approved childcare service operated by the same operator. The schedule 2 amendments seek to allow for greater clarification of when exactly a service has stopped providing care to a particular child, as this determines when childcare benefit is no longer payable. Each child is permitted 42 days absence from care in a given year. However, in circumstances in which it is clear that the service has ceased caring for the child, this bill will allow the minister to specify through a legislative instrument the exact circumstance of a child's absence from care. This will then ensure cessation of the childcare benefit.


Further amendments proposed by this bill will allow the secretary the discretion to cease advance enrolment payments to businesses that have notified their intent to close. This will reduce the debt to the Commonwealth where previously advance enrolment payments were paid up until the business ceased operating. In addition, the bill enables for the greater sharing of relevant protected information between departments where expressed or implied consent has been granted. The purpose of these amendments is to allow information collected by Centrelink on approved childcare services to be shared with the relevant state and territory regulatory bodies under the new education and care services national law. The coalition believes that these amendments make for a more cohesive system, unlike other policies of this government that actively seek to increase the workload on childcare providers by overwhelming providers with baseless paperwork and bureaucracy. In short, the coalition have no issue with this unremarkable piece of legislation before the Main Committee today. We take great issue with the government's management of the childcare industry and the nation's children and will, of course, have much more to say about that in the future.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (10:05):  I speak in support of the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011. This is amending legislation. It makes a number of administrative amendments to family assistance law: strengthening debt recovery, empowering the secretary to do certain things and improving compliance and administration of the childcare benefit. It will mean that unscrupulous operators cannot operate in the market and it will protect the markets from the same. It will improve the accountability of the childcare market and also make it clear that, if a childcare operator restructures, they cannot continue to operate in the market without consequence. It will make sure that mums and dads who send their kids to childcare centres while they attend work know they have the best operators possible caring for their kids.


Meaningful reform I think is at the heart of our agenda with respect to child care. I think this is extremely important because mums and dads who send their kids to child care want to make sure their kids are cared for by ethical, moral, highly educated professionals who not just provide child care but engage in the education process and improve the socialisation that child care provides for young people before they attend school. The rapid growth in the childcare industry has provided many benefits to families and to our economy, but of course there have been some problems and this legislation seeks to overcome them. At the risk of sounding Orwellian, not all childcare operators are equal, not all state regulations are best practice and not enough scrutiny has been undertaken with respect to the childcare industry to make sure that young people receive consistent, appropriate and the best early learning experiences they can be offered.


The unprecedented and shocking collapse of ABC Learning Centres across the country in 2008 exemplified some of the problems in the industry. The industry grew rapidly under the watch of the previous Howard coalition government without appropriate regulation and the consequences were there for all to see. The ABC collapse could have been alarming and disastrous. It was the federal Labor government's quick and decisive action that ensured that childcare centres remained open across the country that saved the day. In fact, 90 per cent of centres remained open when most could have collapsed entirely. About 100,000 families benefited from the government's timely and effective action at the time.


Since 2008 we have introduced a range of measures to ensure the financial viability of childcare providers is strengthened, and I will take this opportunity to outline some of those. These include strengthening the approval process, providing additional notification of the closure of centres and establishing a new penalty regime to have consequences for unscrupulous and unethical childcare operators. Until the 2010 budget we had invested $18.2 billion in early child care across the forward estimates, and that was increased in the budget last night. In 2010 that was $11 billion more than the former Howard coalition government, whose commitment to child care was wonderfully exemplified by the fact that they ripped $1 billion out of the childcare sector in almost the first act they undertook upon election in 1996. That was really an act of economic and familial vandalism of the sector. It had consequences in terms of not just economic development but productivity. In 2008, we delivered on our election commitment by increasing the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, from a maximum of $4,354 per child to $7,500 per child per annum. The Howard government had made it so that you could only claim it on a yearly basis or you could knock it down to quarterly, but we changed that and made it on a weekly and fortnightly basis. For a family with long day care needs earning about $55,000 a year, out-of-pocket childcare costs went down from about 13 per cent to seven per cent in 2010.


This is not some esoteric piece of legislation that does not have consequences right across the country. That is evident from the fact that, based on the latest figures that I could obtain, there are 869,770 children in child care across the country. That is 627,980 families with parents working and building our economy while their children are in child care—and there are 13,899 childcare services creating jobs across the country. The legislation before us will improve accountability in the childcare industry and will protect the market, as I said, from unscrupulous operators.


We have also invested another $273.7 million in the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care. We think it is important that there be nationwide consistency with respect to childcare centres—an arrangement which improves educator-to-child ratios, introduces educator qualification requirements and includes a new childcare rating system. Indeed, contrary to what the previous speaker, the member for Farrer, said, it goes about reducing the regulatory burden by establishing a single regulator.


These reforms are very much based on and exemplified by international research into the first five years of life, which points to the importance of shaping the learning experience and social development of our young people. Indeed, I was pleased to see the press release issued by the Hon. Kate Ellis, the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare, on 12 April 2011, stating that a new report from Early Childhood Australia highlighted the importance of our national reforms to early childhood education and care. The minister welcomed the report and made the point that we are working with the states and territories to 'lift the standard of care across the country'. The report 'clearly makes the case for quality in child care' and is at one with our position on the quality reforms for the childcare sector.


There is little doubt that those on the opposite side of the chamber have manufactured hysteria and faux outrage as we have trumped them in this area of policy reform. They really have forgotten—but the childcare sector has not—that they failed miserably in this area when they were in power. The sector welcomed reform back in 1996, but the coalition came to power and just ripped the heart out of the sector. The sector was left desperately trying to recover, contacting and lobbying coalition members repeatedly. The coalition had failed them and were unsuccessful, much as they were unsuccessful in the aged-care sector during the 11½ years of Howard coalition rule.


We are not going to be cowed by the white noise that those opposite not just perpetrate but also perpetuate, like the previous speaker. We are going to forge ahead because we think this is a meaningful reform agenda. This legislation is part of that agenda, improving accountability, consistency and quality. We want to make sure that parents have peace of mind, that employers and employees have certainty and, most particularly, that our young people have the kind of quality early childhood and care experience they deserve.


Finally, I noted in last night's budget announcements that, under the portfolios of Mr Garrett, the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, and Ms Ellis, the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare, there was $32.4 million for an early childhood reform agenda, and I think that is important. There is $9.2 million for the recognition of prior learning package to assist early childhood workforce access training, and $23.2 million over four years for the Australian Early Development Index, to be met from existing resources. That brings the total to $28 million in relation to the AEDI for the next three-year cycle. I think that what I have outlined here in my speech shows the high priority that we put on early childhood education and how important it is, and not just for our economy. It is an absolute fact that the previous coalition government spent about one-fifth of our OECD competitors on early childhood education. It is a great shame that we spent about a fifth of what the Americans, the New Zealanders, the Canadians and the British spent. It seemed that the Howard coalition government had a real blank in this area. They just could not understand that this was an important part not just in helping mums and dads but in helping the economy. So a national quality reform agenda is absolutely crucial for early childhood education and care. This legislation, though amending legislation, is important. It is to be recognised that it plays out not just nationally but locally.


Finally, I want to say that the best demonstration of this that I can think of in my electorate is the commitment we made to the Yamanto Early Learning and Care Centre, where the minister came out and made that announcement with me and we opened it together—a $1.6 million commitment. That is the best childcare centre in terms of facilities in the Blair electorate. Its collocation beside the Amberley District School means greater convenience for families in the growing suburbs in the south side of Ipswich, not far from where I live. It is about two kilometres along the road from where I live—in fact, it is on one of my running routes, and I run past it regularly. It is a well-attended childcare centre. That is a demonstration locally of the national approach we have undertaken since we were elected in 2007.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (10:17):  I am quite pleased to rise to speak on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care And Other Measures) Bill 2011. When this bill first came to my attention, back when caucus was discussing it, like most people I thought it was a fairly dull bill. It amends a whole stack of acts that have the word 'administration' in them. It deals with things like improving the effectiveness of the recovery of fees, allowing the government to pursue a childcare centre for return of overpaid fees and a whole stack of administrative things to do with the implementation of the national quality agenda. When you first have a look at it, it really does seem to be a lot of small administrative acts. But it underpins some very important reforms in what is perhaps the most important areas for many people in my constituency and beyond: the area of child care. It underpins ensuring that our childcare system is more efficient and it underpins the pursuit of the national quality agenda, and both are very important.


Mr Deputy Speaker, when it comes to child care there is no doubt that times have changed since you and I were children, when usually only one parent worked and grandparents were available to look after the grandchildren even in their forties. My grandmother looked after me, and I look back now and think she would not have been much older than 45. She was certainly much younger than I am, and she looked after us from time to time. That no longer happens in quite the same way in modern families. So professional child care becomes a very important issue for families, and they care greatly about this issue—as you can imagine, because our childcare system takes care of their precious children for large parts of the day. They care that it is affordable, they care that it is available and they care overwhelmingly that it meets the standards that they expect. The Rudd and Gillard governments have been working very hard since 2007 on all three of those elements—affordability, availability and quality—and this bill underpins some of the work that we have been doing in that area. There is no doubt that the changes we have made since 2007 have already assisted families greatly. Most families now spend around seven per cent of their disposable income on child care, compared to 13 per cent in 2004. It is a substantial reduction from 13 to seven per cent of disposable income and I think we can be proud of that. There is no doubt that this is largely a result of the increase in the childcare rebate from 30 to 50 per cent, up to a cap of $7,500.


The recent childcare update provides quite an interesting picture of the extent to which families are using child care across the country. Currently, 869,770 children attend child care benefit approved child care, an increase of 8.7 per cent on the June quarter in 2009. Again, that is a substantial increase and a significant help for families. Children spend an average of 21.6 hours per week in child care across all types, and almost one in four children between zero and 12 years attend child care. Almost 628,000 Australian families had at least one child in approved child care, an increase of 8.4 per cent on the June quarter. Overall we are investing around $20 billion in funding for early childhood education and child care over the next four years, and that is up by more than $12 billion since the last four years of the former coalition government. Again, that is a substantial increase, which has largely led to that change in out-of-pocket expenses from 13 per cent in 2004 to seven per cent in 2010.


We also made a promise early on to pay the childcare rebate quarterly, and we delivered on that commitment. If you remember back to pre-2007, parents had to wait until the end of the financial year after the year in which they paid the expenses to claim their rebate. We also promised to make the childcare rebate payable fortnightly and we are delivering on that from July 2011. These are significant improvements in the childcare system that is available for parents around Australia.


But $20 billion is a lot of money and it is important that we do this efficiently. The amendments in this bill give the Australian government greater scrutiny over operators and their past practices. It enables the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one service from another service run by the same operator. Up until now, that has not been possible. The Commonwealth has only been able to pursue recovery of payments from the specific operator. This will ensure that operators who run up debts to the Commonwealth in one service can be held accountable for their actions via another service. For example, when an operator accumulates debts and then exits the market and re-emerges in a similar form, the government will be able to pursue that new entity for recovery.


We know these accountability reforms are very important. In fact, we have been working to improve the financial accountability of childcare centres for quite some time. The collapse of ABC Learning in 2008 was unprecedented and it was quite a shock. The member for Blair has outlined some of the consequences of that. If the government had not acted quickly, almost 100,000 families would have had to find alternative care arrangements with very little notice. Since that time we have made quite significant changes to ensure financial viability of childcare providers, including strengthening the approvals processes and requiring additional notification of closures of centres. The new approvals process includes financial checks for new childcare centre operators to make sure they are viable from the outset and well placed to meet quality standards. These new amendments build on that work to ensure that we have a viable, efficient childcare sector—again, something that is very important to parents seeking affordability along with quality in child care.


Affordability is, of course, a major issue for parents. As I said, we have made significant changes that have improved affordability for parents. Quality is another issue which parents care profoundly about. Recent reports indicate that quality is not always what it should be. A recent report showed that childcare centres accredited between 1 July and 31 December 2010 were not always up to standard. In some areas, around a quarter of them failed to ensure that potentially dangerous products, plant and objects were inaccessible to children or failed to ensure toileting and nappy-changing procedures were positive experiences. For parents who put their children in child care, I know that reading this report would cause great concern, which is why the national quality framework is incredibly important.


This bill supports the government's $273.7 million investment in the national quality framework. The framework has already been endorsed by COAG. There has been significant work done on this in recent years. The framework aims to improve educator-to-child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention, and it introduces educator qualification requirements so that educators are better able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them to learn and develop. It includes a new rating system so that parents know the quality of care on offer and can make informed choices. I know that for parents in my constituency the ability to know exactly where they are putting their child and the quality of care that that child will receive is perhaps one of the most important factors in choosing a childcare centre. The amendments also reduce the regulatory burden, in spite of the opposition speaker's claim to the contrary, by requiring childcare centres to only deal with one regulator. We know that the first five years of a child's life shape their future. It is perhaps the five years that have more importance in determining the path or your life than any other years that we live through. So it is incredibly important that we get this absolutely right. 


The new national quality framework enables the Commonwealth to share information with childcare services that are regulated by state and territory bodies, and this benefits childcare centres by not requiring them to provide the same information to more than one body. Again, while this bill seems to deal with rather dry administrative matters, it underpins some incredibly important reforms that the government has been undertaking for some time. I am pleased to support this bill.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (10:27):  Child care is one of the most vital services for which any government can take responsibility. Adequate child care provides parents with certainty that their children will be not only cared for properly but also given the opportunity to learn. So it is about care and also about learning, at an affordable price. Under the Rudd and Gillard governments, we have made a real commitment towards improving child care, improving accessibility to child care and recognising the importance of child care. Adequate child care is not something that is a privilege; it is the right of all parents to have access to affordable child care.


That is why the government is providing $20 billion over four years for early childhood education and child care. This is almost $12.8 billion more than that provided during the last four years of the Howard government. That is a significant increase in funding for child care and children's education services. This says to me that you go to the Rudd-Gillard governments to look at outcomes for children, a commitment to children and learning, and to see how important child care is. Then you look at the record of the Howard government to see how undervalued child care was under that government. We believe that quality child care is the right of all families and all children. I think the other side of the parliament believes that quality child care is a privilege, not a right.


The government is also providing $16.4 billion to help 800,000 Australian families annually with the cost of child care through the childcare benefit and the childcare rebate. This includes $9.2 billion over four years to reduce childcare fees under the childcare benefit and $7.2 billion to assist working families with out-of-pocket childcare costs under the childcare rebate. This is $10.2 billion more fee assistance than under the last four years of the Howard government. Once again, you have a government which recognises the importance of child care as opposed to the Howard government, which looked upon it as a privilege or something that was there for the wealthy.


The legislation that we are debating here today will amend the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999, the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Management System and Other Measures) Act 2007, the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, the Student Assistance Act 1973 and the Age Discrimination Act 2004. The bill makes a number of amendments which allow the government to strengthen debt recovery provisions, compliance and administration of childcare benefits.


These may be largely administrative changes—changes which look at compliance, accountability and recovery—but these are vital changes that will ensure the ongoing viability of our childcare system by a government which is totally committed to ensuring that all children get affordable, quality child care. As I have already mentioned, this is something that the previous Howard government was not committed to.


The bill improves the effectiveness of the recovery of fee reductions, enrolment advances and business continuity payments paid to approved childcare services. It clarifies provisions concerning the effects of a child's absence from care and authorises the minister to specify by legislation the circumstances in which these services will permanently cease providing care. That is quite an important change in this legislation and something that often causes confusion. I am really pleased to see that the minister has put this particular provision in the legislation, because it is all about clarification and certainty, not only to the families that enrol their children in childcare centres but to those childcare centres as well. I have been approached by owners of childcare centres who have found in the past that the provisions, uncertainty and lack of clarity in the act were causing them problems. The minister has set out very clearly the rules that are in place here. Because of this, families can have that certainty which was previously missing.


There are a number of other amendments which look at the recalculation of childcare benefits and fees and information to allow the Commonwealth to share information about childcare services with the states and territories. These are all vitally important changes that will ensure the smooth operation of our childcare services. This legislation is very positive; it shows how committed the Australian government is to providing access to quality, affordable child care and to ensuring the long-term viability of child care. I would like to share with the House that since this government came to power I have noticed a big change within my electorate for the number of people that are waiting to access child care, and that is the MyChild website, which allows parents to look at the services that have vacancies and to compare fees and the services that are provided. It has been a very, very positive initiative that parents have embraced. It has helped parents and carers deal with the problems that existed previously of lack of access to services and not knowing where the services were and what was available. The introduction of this website has improved accessibility to child care.


Given the state of my voice, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think I might finish there. In doing so I would like to conclude where I started, by emphasising the importance of child care for families and carers and the importance of quality child care for the children themselves. I congratulate the minister on the changes she is introducing here and on her commitment to child care and to the children of Australia.

Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide—Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (10:36):  I thank the member for Shortland and all the members who have made contributions to this debate. This bill contains important amendments to the family assistance administration act and other legislation in order to improve accountability in the childcare sector. The government and, indeed, families right across Australia know just how important this is. We know that, and we were reminded by the overnight collapse of ABC Learning in 2008, which was entirely unprecedented. The government's quick and decisive action at that time meant that 90 per cent of those centres continue to operate for Australian families today. Had that government support not been provided, almost 100,000 families right across Australia might have been faced with the prospect of having to find alternative care arrangements with little or no notice at all. Since 2008 we have introduced a range of new measures to better ensure the financial viability of childcare providers, including strengthening approvals processes and requiring additional notification of closures of centres. We want to make sure that what happened in 2008 with ABC never ever happens again.


The amendments in this bill today, the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Bill 2011, represent a part of our commitment to improving accountability within the childcare market and protecting the market from unscrupulous operators. This bill broadens the powers of the secretary to refuse the approval of a childcare service for the purposes of family assistance law. Combined with other measures, this will give the Australian government greater scrutiny over operators and their past practices, including the power to look at whether service operators are fit and proper persons. The bill also enables the Australian government to offset and recover payments owed by one childcare service to another childcare service operated by the same operator. These measures will also enhance the government's ability to deal with phoenixing, where an operator who accumulates debts exits and then re-enters the market under a restructured company. Under current arrangements the government can only consider the exact operator and their history in the industry. We need to strengthen this.


Importantly, this bill will also support the government's $273.7 million investment in the National Quality Framework. The changes to protected information will support the National Quality Framework by enabling the Commonwealth to share information on childcare services with state and territory regulatory bodies. This will benefit childcare services by not requiring them to provide the same information to more than one body. This framework, endorsed by COAG, will improve educator-to-child ratios so that each child gets more individual time and attention. It will introduce educator qualification requirements so that our educators are better able to lead activities that inspire youngsters and help them to learn and develop. It will include a new rating system so parents know the quality of care on offer and how to make informed choices, and it will reduce the regulation burden so services only have to deal with one regulator.


We are doing this because we know from years and years of international research that the first five years of a child's life shapes their future, health, learning and social development. We want to make sure that that future is bright for Australian children. We know how important this is. We also know that, of the long day care services that received an accreditation decision between 1 July and 31 December last year, 25 per cent of those services failed to ensure that potentially dangerous products, plants and objects were inaccessible to children. Twenty-nine per cent failed to implement effective and current food safety and hygiene practices. Twenty-eight per cent failed to ensure that toileting and nappy-changing procedures were positive experiences, and 20 per cent did not act to control the spread of infectious diseases and maintain records of immunisations. This government believes that Australian children deserve better. As a government, we believe that we can and must do better when it comes to the safety, wellbeing and early learning of our children.


In summary, this bill makes a number of amendments that will improve transparency of the childcare industry and protect families from unscrupulous operators, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2011-05-11,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (12:24):  I rise to speak to the first report of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform handed down recently that goes to and is entitled The design and implementation of a mandatory pre-commitment system for electronic gambling machines across Australia. It is no secret that I have very real and genuine concerns about the ineffectiveness of this report in addressing what, it was suggested, was the core focus of the committee—that is, to assist problem gamblers. Broader than that, I am concerned that the recommendations put forward by the majority of the committee, which did not include coalition members, will harm the industry significantly. We end up in a situation where, as a consequence of the committee's recommendations, Labor Party policy and the grubby deal that was done between Julia Gillard and the Independent member for Denison to form government, we are now faced with the situation where the likely policy outcome will be the implementation of laws that will see nothing happening with respect to assisting problem gamblers but will have a truly detrimental effect on the pubs and clubs sector across Australia. Why is this so, and how can I be certain: because of the valid concerns raised by members of the public and others with respect to the findings of the report.


In summary, it is relatively straightforward. We know as a matter of history that the Labor Party is only motivated to do something in this space as a consequence of the Prime Minister's deal with the Independent member for Denison. We know as a matter of history that poker machine reform was not a burning ambition of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer or cabinet. It was not something that was on the radar for this government until such time as it was demanded by the Independent member for Denison that there be reform in this space, namely, through the implementation of a mandatory precommitment system, that Labor suddenly said, 'Yes, we believe in it too.'


In fact the most concerning aspect of this is that it is now Labor Party policy to implement mandatory precommitment, which is what is driving this agenda. The reality is that if it were not Labor Party policy, if it were only the Independent member for Denison that wanted mandatory precommitment, then this would not happen. The reason why it will happen is that Labor has signed up to this holus-bolus. It is now Labor Party policy to have mandatory precommitment.


What concerned me was that for those of us who were appointed to the joint select committee, it was not a case of being charged with exploring mandatory precommitment; it was not a case of having an inquiry into whether mandatory precommitment would work; rather the answer was already given: there would be mandatory precommitment and the committee's task was simply to look at the way in which that should happen. We already knew before we started that the Labor Party and the Independent member for Denison, as well as of course Senator Xenophon, were all committed to making mandatory precommitment happen.


On the face of it, if you did not bother to look into the issue very much, you would think it seemed like a reasonably good idea. After all, I have seen Labor member after Labor member, as well as the Independent member for Denison, stand up, hand on heart, palms wringing, saying, 'This is about the 95,000 problem gamblers in Australia.' I have heard Labor member after Labor member, the Independent member for Denison and others engage in rhetoric about how policy changes need to be effected to do something for problem gamblers. As if anyone who is critical of the recommendations or the findings of the committee was in some way not motivated to assist problem gamblers. 


We saw it just recently in the previous exchange between the member for Kingston and me where there is this disgraceful moral superiority that comes from those who back the recommendations of this report implying that in some way I and other members of the coalition who knock back and reject the recommendations are not concerned about problem gambling. It is disgraceful that members opposite would moralise on this issue, would claim a monopoly on assisting problem gamblers, when in reality they do not know the first thing about the impact of these recommendations on problem gamblers. That is the great disgrace, because the single most hard-done-by group as a result of these recommendations will in fact be problem gamblers. I will go into great detail to explain why because I understand this topic implicitly as well as on the basis of the evidence that has been supplied.


I think it is time that Labor members, the member for Denison and Senator Xenophon, were held to account to back up their rhetoric when it comes to this report, because I know they will fail. The reason they will fail is that there are several fundamental flaws with this particular report and the recommendations of the majority of the report which cannot be overcome because they are illogical. The fundamental thrust from the member for Denison, from Labor members and indeed from the Independent senator, Senator Xenophon, was that mandatory precommitment would assist Australia's problem gamblers because of the fact that they would be required to precommit to a certain level of losses. On first principles, that sounds rational. On first principles, you would have to ask: who could disagree with that? If someone has a gambling problem, wouldn't logic suggest the very best thing you could do is make them commit to a certain level of losses and then be shut out of the system? It just seems like common sense. But what is clear from the evidence is that problem gamblers have a pathological problem. By definition, that is why they are called problem gamblers. By definition, someone who is a problem gambler—someone who is potentially losing their home, someone who is potentially losing their job, someone who is potentially engaging in criminal activity, someone who is potentially hurting the loved ones around them as a result of their gambling addiction—is not logical, is not rational.


That is the very reason why, when you say to a problem gambler who is already potentially losing their home, losing their loved ones and putting their life on the line and who is potentially suicidal as a direct consequence of their gambling habit, 'Look, you are responsible for setting your own gambling limit. We think you'll be able to handle that,' it is doomed to fail from the outset. Problem gamblers—and we know this from international examples—will set a limit that is exceptionally high, well above what they can afford. As a consequence, this piece of technology which the Labor Party and the member for Denison like to hold out as the silver bullet solution will in fact fail miserably. Someone with a pathological gambling addiction will not sit there and think to themselves, 'You know, I can only afford to lose $50 this week, so I'm going to set my limit at $50.' No, they are bound in a spiral of irrationality that will see them set a limit of $1,000 or $10,000. Who knows what the limit will be? But I guarantee you one thing, Madam Deputy Speaker: it will not be a rational limit, because this is a person who is battling an addiction, who is already losing their home and their family, who is having an impact on loved ones and who is potentially suicidal. Yet apparently they are meant to have this moment of clarity where they will say, 'I can only afford $50 this week. That will be my limit.'


The reality is that problem gamblers have a pathological problem and they need medical intervention. They need support and assistance to make them realise that they cannot handle gambling and that they should not be gambling, full stop. That is what is required, because the only people who will stand by a rational limit are rational people who do not have a gambling addiction. We know from the psychological evidence that was given to the committee that problem gamblers chase their losses. They are of the view that if only they were given one more shot, if only they had one more big wager, they would be able to win back that which they have already lost. That is the psychology and that is exactly what drives them to set unrealistic loss limits on their cards. That is why this technology simply will not work. The people who will set rational loss limits on their cards are recreational gamblers—the 4.8 million gamblers out of the five million poker machine players. They will set reasonable limits. I welcome the member for Denison, who has just come into the Committee. These are the people who will set rational loss limits on their cards. These are the people who will recognise that it is having an impact on their lives.


In addition to that, from the outset I have made it clear that without the integrity of a national database this system is doomed to fail. I was met with cries of protest from the member for Denison and from Labor members, who said I was scaremongering. They said I was scaremongering to suggest that there had to be biometric identifiers and that there needed to be a national database. This is where it all just conveniently slips through the net in the majority report of this committee, because they like to conveniently disregard the need for a national database. I have heard the member for Denison say this on numerous occasions: 'People don't have to worry because the information will be kept on the card.' Without a national database, there is nothing at all to prevent a problem gambler from going into—I will use a local example from my electorate—the Southport Surf Lifesaving Club, getting a card from the club after supplying their 100 points of ID, or whatever the regime may be for identity verification, setting their limit at $500 or whatever, expending that limit and then thinking: 'I've got to chase that loss. I'm going to go to the club down the road.' So they jump in their car and drive down to the Broadbeach Bowls Club. They go in there and say: 'I'd like to sign up for a card here. I want to play the pokies.' Without a national database there is no way that that bowls club can know what the surf lifesaving club has on their system. Without one, that person could have a card from every pub and club that they wanted. There must be a way to verify that this person is not using multiple cards in multiple venues. The only way to do that is to have a national database. Even the preferred, short-term political fix solution that the member for Denison and Labor members have proposed, which is that it be state based jurisdiction, does not overcome the problem that in tourism towns like the Gold Coast, for example, where we have a border right through the guts of it, people can swap across from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. There must be a national database. It is an absolute requirement for this to work. Otherwise, the person can have all of their particulars on their smart card from the Southport Surf Life Saving Club—the assurance that the member for Denison and Labor members like to claim—but that does not mean anything if they get another card from another venue when they provide their ID and the venues do not know about each other. I have never heard members opposite address that, and I would dearly love to hear members opposite address that very issue. I invite members opposite to please tell me how you can get system integrity without having a central database. They know what I know, which is that you cannot.


In addition to that, let us talk about the recreational gamblers. Let us talk about the 4.8 million Australians who play the poker machines once a month or once every three or four months. This is the person who goes to the Southport Surf Life Saving Club, provides their 100 points of ID, gets their card, plays their 50 bucks on the poker machines, walks away and does not think about it for three months. Three months later when they turn up to some other club or even the same club and say, 'I would like to play the pokies,' the club will say, 'Where is your card from three months ago? You are on the system as having a card already. We need to see your card.' If the person says, 'I'm sorry. I haven't played the pokies for three months. Can you issue me with another one?' isn't that situation going to present some challenges? Do they just issue you with another card? You would assume not because how would you know that the problem gambler who just had a massive loss the day before is not also turning up and saying, 'I'm sorry. I lost my card. Can I get another one?' Therefore, you would have to assume that there are some systems in place for the person who only had a punt three months ago, has not thought about it again since, does not have a card on them and wants another one. Again, I would love to hear from members opposite their solution to this, because I have never heard it. The devil is in the detail when it comes to this, and they have been scant on detail every step of the way.


The single most offensive aspect of this—and it is offensive—that I have heard from members opposite with respect to the 70,000 people whose livelihoods rely on this industry and the 4.8 million recreational punters who do not have a gambling problem is the explanation that the reason the pubs and clubs are concerned is because there is going to be a massive deterioration in problem gambling revenue. The member for Denison and Labor members say that if you cannot survive as a club with deterioration in problem-gambling revenue then you have a failed business model. I have heard this time and time again. Indeed, the report itself deals with it. That is disingenuous, because their concerns are not about the revenue from problem gamblers. Their concerns revolve around the fact that the people who are going to be put off playing the poker machines are the 4.8 million recreational gamblers who do not have a problem. That is where the loss of revenue is going to come from—people who are not going to provide 100 points of ID in order to get a card, people who are not going to put up with a great big new federal bureaucracy in order to have a $30 or $40 punt on the poker machines.


Time does not allow me to get into the issue of low-intensity machines. But low-intensity machines were not a central part of the committee's focus. They were a quick political fix that came in during the last several weeks. They deserve to be a core part of the focus of the inquiry of the committee. For reasons I will go into in another forum, they are also not the solution.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (12:39):  We are here today to comment on the report that was tabled in parliament this week by the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, entitled The design and implementation of a mandatory pre-commitment system for electronic gambling machines. The reason that this committee has conducted the inquiry is that we have a problem. We have a problem with pokies addiction, and it is real. It is a public health issue, it is a family issue, it is a workplace issue and it is an economic issue. It will not go away as a result of the hysterical speeches of those who sit in the chamber opposite me. It will go away because members in this place have the courage to do something about it.


The reason we have an obligation to do something about it is that governments license the existence of gaming machines. We derive revenue from them. Therefore, we have an obligation to ensure that they are operating safely and in line with community values. I can tell the members opposite and everybody else that the community simply does not accept the proposition that any business, organisation or government should profit from the misery of others. Our objective in bringing these reforms forward is to ensure that we are able to properly regulate this form of gambling which is proven to have an addictive and damaging effect on so many Australians.


Throughout the 1990s there was a liberalisation of poker machines throughout Australia. It led to what the Productivity Commission has recently described as the maturation of the industry. In common speak, that has led to a growth in the number of machines in clubs, pubs and many other venues around the country. So we have the situation today where there are close to 200,000 electronic gaming machines in this country, and nearly half of them are in my state of New South Wales.


As I have already mentioned, we have an obligation to do something about this because governments derive a source of revenue from gaming and poker machine revenue. States derive about $5 billion per annum from gambling—about 10 per cent of state revenue—and a significant proportion of that comes from electronic gaming machines. The total gaming revenue in the economy as a whole was $19 billion in 2008-09, which is about $1,500 per adult.


As members opposite have indicated, Australians do not mind having a punt. I do not mind having a punt myself. I am amongst the estimated 600,000 people who play poker machines. Unfortunately, about 115,000 people have a problem with gambling. While these 115,000 people make up only about 15 per cent of the total gambling population, they contribute somewhere between 26 per cent or 40 per cent of gaming revenue. So we have a problem, particularly when you consider that hotels derive about one-third of their revenue, clubs about 60 per cent of their revenue and casinos about 78 per cent of their revenue from these machines. We have a problem and we have to deal with it.


We can stick our heads in the sand, like the member for Moncrieff, opposite, begs us to do and say that what we are doing at the moment is good enough. But we on this side of the House do not believe that that is fulfilling our obligation to the communities that we represent. We have put in place a proposition which says nothing more than this: we do not give up on problem gamblers and we do not think that people who play poker machines, as the member opposite seems to suggest, are somehow mad and bad most of their lives. We understand and the evidence before the committee was quite simply that, yes, when problem gamblers and many other gamblers are in a gaming environment and sitting before a poker machine they lose control and are not operating on the basis of reason that most of us would operate on normally. But even these people have moments of lucidity and moments of reason when they go home and they have to explain to their wife, their husband or their kids, or when they have to go to work the next day and explain why they are asking for an advance in their pay, or when they have to go and cash in their television or their video recorder. They have moments of reason and they understand that the behaviour they engaged in last night, last week or for the last 10 days when they were on a binge—'chasing the losses', as the member opposite has pointed out—was wrong. The tools that we are proposing to put in place will give them some control over that gambling addiction.




Mr Ciobo:
  But they are not rational.




Ms Rishworth:
  They're not irrational all the time.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  As the member for Kingston has pointed out, these people do not have a problem all the time; they have a problem when they are in a gaming situation. They have moments of reason, moments of lucidity.



Mr Ciobo interjecting—




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  The evidence before the committee was quite clear on this point. It might have been evidence that was delivered on some of the many days when the member opposite who is interjecting so much was not there, but it was very clear that the expert evidence before the committee—




Mr Ciobo:
  I rise on a point of order. I have a reasonably wide tolerance for being verballed, but statements of factual inaccuracy like that one should be withdrawn. I find them offensive.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms K Livermore
):  The member for Moncrieff has made his point.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  The second reason we do not give up on problem gamblers and we believe the precommitment technology that has been the subject of this inquiry has a very good chance of solving or helping to resolve problem gambling is that it will prevent people who have been identified by experts as at-risk gamblers converting to problem gamblers. They will avoid doing that by using the precommitment technology to effectively set themselves a budget to punt, a budget to gamble, so that they know on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis how much of their family income they are going to be able to put through a poker machine—how much they can afford to lose.


So we have very good reasons to believe—we are not as cynical as those members opposite—that the technologies and the systems that we are proposing to put in place will work. We believe they will work because they will stop the conversion of at-risk gamblers to problem gamblers and they will give problem gamblers who have already crossed the Rubicon some tools, in those moments of lucidity and reason, to take control of their gambling addiction. Of course in and of itself it is not the complete solution. It has to be part and parcel of a package of solutions. The recommendations put forward by the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform go to a combination of solutions.


Some objections have also been raised throughout the course of the inquiry about the egregious costs that this is going to visit upon the industry. We have listened closely to this evidence, and the report points out that for the most part these claims are widely exaggerated and these technologies can be introduced for a fraction of the cost that is estimated and a fraction of the revenue that is generated by one of these machines over its life span. With that comment made, we do make the concession and we do understand that there is going to be a need, particularly for small clubs, for us to have a phased introduction of these technologies and we have recommended exactly that.


I will make the point that the member for Moncrieff was alluding to and then going to quite pointedly in his contribution to the debate. I enjoyed his cross-examination of witnesses throughout the inquiry on this particular point. It goes to the issue of privacy and intrusion, that somehow the introduction of this technology is going to be the visitation upon every Australian citizen of some mammoth Big Brother database which is going to intrude upon every aspect of their private, social and working lives. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have ruled out quite early the use of biometric technology, despite the fact that many pubs are already introducing biometric technology as a condition of visiting their premises here and now. Many pubs in the state of New South Wales and elsewhere, I am reliably advised, are already introducing, beyond the pale of regulation, biometric technology—fingerprint scanners, retina scanners—as a condition of entering their premises. I believe, and I am sure that many right-minded citizens—and I suspect the member for Moncrieff—would agree with me, that this sort of activity should probably not be occurring outside the realm of regulation; but perhaps that is a matter for another day. 


The second point that I would make on the issue of privacy and intrusion is that it is a condition of the establishment of a club that they set up and keep a membership register and ensure that anybody who enters the premises of a club, at least in New South Wales or Queensland and I suspect everywhere else, has proof of identity which satisfies the requirements of the legislation and is able by one means or another to satisfy the occupiers of the premises—the licensees, the club owners and managers—that when they enter those premises and intend to use the facilities, including the electronic gaming machine facilities on those premises, they can show that identity. That is to say, the database already exists. Not only does it exist but it collects  information about the gaming habits of individual club members and visitors and the clubs already use that data to market to those patrons they know who are frequenters of electronic gaming machines. They do such things—and I make no value judgment about this whatsoever—as send free tickets for meals and a courtesy cab around to a regular punter's home and say, 'Come on down, we've got a special deal for you today; we will put on a meal and free drinks and we've got a special pokies promotion going on.' 


I make no value judgment about that whatsoever. Clubs are entitled to market, but they are already using this data and we believe that the introduction of the mandatory precommitment technology is no greater intrusion on a club member or a club patron's privacy than already exists. In fact, through this mechanism we might serve to tidy up some of the practices that many within the community think are not meeting community standards and expectations. 


We are far more optimistic than those opposite. If their real issue is problem gambling and they think that we should do something about it and if their real objection is this just ain't the problem, we are a bit more optimistic. This ain't the solution. We are a bit more optimistic than that. One of the recommendations of the committee, as the member for Moncrieff knows, is that there shall be a trial. I am quite confident that, as a result of the rollout of this technology and the trial that we intend to put in place, any of the teething problems that the member for Moncrieff is so passionately concerned about will be able to be dealt with. I am sure the member for Moncrieff and those he represents will get plenty more opportunities—



Mr Ciobo interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Moncrieff has had his opportunity.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  to run his scare campaign around his alleged concerns about privacy. But I end my contribution where I began. Gambling addiction is real, it is a public health issue, it is a family issue, it is a family issue, it is a workplace issue and it is an economic issue and we cannot sit idly by and just identify all of the problems—for those of us who have the gumption and the courage to try to do something about it—without proffering some of the solutions that will make a real difference.


Debate adjourned.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2011-05-11,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (12:24):  I rise to speak to the first report of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform handed down recently that goes to and is entitled The design and implementation of a mandatory pre-commitment system for electronic gambling machines across Australia. It is no secret that I have very real and genuine concerns about the ineffectiveness of this report in addressing what, it was suggested, was the core focus of the committee—that is, to assist problem gamblers. Broader than that, I am concerned that the recommendations put forward by the majority of the committee, which did not include coalition members, will harm the industry significantly. We end up in a situation where, as a consequence of the committee's recommendations, Labor Party policy and the grubby deal that was done between Julia Gillard and the Independent member for Denison to form government, we are now faced with the situation where the likely policy outcome will be the implementation of laws that will see nothing happening with respect to assisting problem gamblers but will have a truly detrimental effect on the pubs and clubs sector across Australia. Why is this so, and how can I be certain: because of the valid concerns raised by members of the public and others with respect to the findings of the report.


In summary, it is relatively straightforward. We know as a matter of history that the Labor Party is only motivated to do something in this space as a consequence of the Prime Minister's deal with the Independent member for Denison. We know as a matter of history that poker machine reform was not a burning ambition of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer or cabinet. It was not something that was on the radar for this government until such time as it was demanded by the Independent member for Denison that there be reform in this space, namely, through the implementation of a mandatory precommitment system, that Labor suddenly said, 'Yes, we believe in it too.'


In fact the most concerning aspect of this is that it is now Labor Party policy to implement mandatory precommitment, which is what is driving this agenda. The reality is that if it were not Labor Party policy, if it were only the Independent member for Denison that wanted mandatory precommitment, then this would not happen. The reason why it will happen is that Labor has signed up to this holus-bolus. It is now Labor Party policy to have mandatory precommitment.


What concerned me was that for those of us who were appointed to the joint select committee, it was not a case of being charged with exploring mandatory precommitment; it was not a case of having an inquiry into whether mandatory precommitment would work; rather the answer was already given: there would be mandatory precommitment and the committee's task was simply to look at the way in which that should happen. We already knew before we started that the Labor Party and the Independent member for Denison, as well as of course Senator Xenophon, were all committed to making mandatory precommitment happen.


On the face of it, if you did not bother to look into the issue very much, you would think it seemed like a reasonably good idea. After all, I have seen Labor member after Labor member, as well as the Independent member for Denison, stand up, hand on heart, palms wringing, saying, 'This is about the 95,000 problem gamblers in Australia.' I have heard Labor member after Labor member, the Independent member for Denison and others engage in rhetoric about how policy changes need to be effected to do something for problem gamblers. As if anyone who is critical of the recommendations or the findings of the committee was in some way not motivated to assist problem gamblers. 


We saw it just recently in the previous exchange between the member for Kingston and me where there is this disgraceful moral superiority that comes from those who back the recommendations of this report implying that in some way I and other members of the coalition who knock back and reject the recommendations are not concerned about problem gambling. It is disgraceful that members opposite would moralise on this issue, would claim a monopoly on assisting problem gamblers, when in reality they do not know the first thing about the impact of these recommendations on problem gamblers. That is the great disgrace, because the single most hard-done-by group as a result of these recommendations will in fact be problem gamblers. I will go into great detail to explain why because I understand this topic implicitly as well as on the basis of the evidence that has been supplied.


I think it is time that Labor members, the member for Denison and Senator Xenophon, were held to account to back up their rhetoric when it comes to this report, because I know they will fail. The reason they will fail is that there are several fundamental flaws with this particular report and the recommendations of the majority of the report which cannot be overcome because they are illogical. The fundamental thrust from the member for Denison, from Labor members and indeed from the Independent senator, Senator Xenophon, was that mandatory precommitment would assist Australia's problem gamblers because of the fact that they would be required to precommit to a certain level of losses. On first principles, that sounds rational. On first principles, you would have to ask: who could disagree with that? If someone has a gambling problem, wouldn't logic suggest the very best thing you could do is make them commit to a certain level of losses and then be shut out of the system? It just seems like common sense. But what is clear from the evidence is that problem gamblers have a pathological problem. By definition, that is why they are called problem gamblers. By definition, someone who is a problem gambler—someone who is potentially losing their home, someone who is potentially losing their job, someone who is potentially engaging in criminal activity, someone who is potentially hurting the loved ones around them as a result of their gambling addiction—is not logical, is not rational.


That is the very reason why, when you say to a problem gambler who is already potentially losing their home, losing their loved ones and putting their life on the line and who is potentially suicidal as a direct consequence of their gambling habit, 'Look, you are responsible for setting your own gambling limit. We think you'll be able to handle that,' it is doomed to fail from the outset. Problem gamblers—and we know this from international examples—will set a limit that is exceptionally high, well above what they can afford. As a consequence, this piece of technology which the Labor Party and the member for Denison like to hold out as the silver bullet solution will in fact fail miserably. Someone with a pathological gambling addiction will not sit there and think to themselves, 'You know, I can only afford to lose $50 this week, so I'm going to set my limit at $50.' No, they are bound in a spiral of irrationality that will see them set a limit of $1,000 or $10,000. Who knows what the limit will be? But I guarantee you one thing, Madam Deputy Speaker: it will not be a rational limit, because this is a person who is battling an addiction, who is already losing their home and their family, who is having an impact on loved ones and who is potentially suicidal. Yet apparently they are meant to have this moment of clarity where they will say, 'I can only afford $50 this week. That will be my limit.'


The reality is that problem gamblers have a pathological problem and they need medical intervention. They need support and assistance to make them realise that they cannot handle gambling and that they should not be gambling, full stop. That is what is required, because the only people who will stand by a rational limit are rational people who do not have a gambling addiction. We know from the psychological evidence that was given to the committee that problem gamblers chase their losses. They are of the view that if only they were given one more shot, if only they had one more big wager, they would be able to win back that which they have already lost. That is the psychology and that is exactly what drives them to set unrealistic loss limits on their cards. That is why this technology simply will not work. The people who will set rational loss limits on their cards are recreational gamblers—the 4.8 million gamblers out of the five million poker machine players. They will set reasonable limits. I welcome the member for Denison, who has just come into the Committee. These are the people who will set rational loss limits on their cards. These are the people who will recognise that it is having an impact on their lives.


In addition to that, from the outset I have made it clear that without the integrity of a national database this system is doomed to fail. I was met with cries of protest from the member for Denison and from Labor members, who said I was scaremongering. They said I was scaremongering to suggest that there had to be biometric identifiers and that there needed to be a national database.

Without one, that person could have a card from every pub and club that they wanted. There must be a way to verify that this person is not using multiple cards in multiple venues.

The tools that we are proposing to put in place will give them some control over that gambling addiction.




Mr Ciobo:
  But they are not rational.




Ms Rishworth:
  They're not irrational all the time.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  As the member for Kingston has pointed out, these people do not have a problem all the time; they have a problem when they are in a gaming situation. They have moments of reason, moments of lucidity.



Mr Ciobo interjecting—




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  The evidence before the committee was quite clear on this point. It might have been evidence that was delivered on some of the many days when the member opposite who is interjecting so much was not there, but it was very clear that the expert evidence before the committee—




Mr Ciobo:
  I rise on a point of order. I have a reasonably wide tolerance for being verballed, but statements of factual inaccuracy like that one should be withdrawn. I find them offensive.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms K Livermore
):  The member for Moncrieff has made his point.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  The second reason we do not give up on problem gamblers and we believe the precommitment technology that has been the subject of this inquiry has a very good chance of solving or helping to resolve problem gambling is that it will prevent people who have been identified by experts as at-risk gamblers converting to problem gamblers. They will avoid doing that by using the precommitment technology to effectively set themselves a budget to punt, a budget to gamble, so that they know on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis how much of their family income they are going to be able to put through a poker machine—how much they can afford to lose.


So we have very good reasons to believe—we are not as cynical as those members opposite—that the technologies and the systems that we are proposing to put in place will work. We believe they will work because they will stop the conversion of at-risk gamblers to problem gamblers and they will give problem gamblers who have already crossed the Rubicon some tools, in those moments of lucidity and reason, to take control of their gambling addiction. Of course in and of itself it is not the complete solution. It has to be part and parcel of a package of solutions. The recommendations put forward by the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform go to a combination of solutions.


Some objections have also been raised throughout the course of the inquiry about the egregious costs that this is going to visit upon the industry. We have listened closely to this evidence, and the report points out that for the most part these claims are widely exaggerated and these technologies can be introduced for a fraction of the cost that is estimated and a fraction of the revenue that is generated by one of these machines over its life span. With that comment made, we do make the concession and we do understand that there is going to be a need, particularly for small clubs, for us to have a phased introduction of these technologies and we have recommended exactly that.


I will make the point that the member for Moncrieff was alluding to and then going to quite pointedly in his contribution to the debate. I enjoyed his cross-examination of witnesses throughout the inquiry on this particular point. It goes to the issue of privacy and intrusion, that somehow the introduction of this technology is going to be the visitation upon every Australian citizen of some mammoth Big Brother database which is going to intrude upon every aspect of their private, social and working lives. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have ruled out quite early the use of biometric technology, despite the fact that many pubs are already introducing biometric technology as a condition of visiting their premises here and now. Many pubs in the state of New South Wales and elsewhere, I am reliably advised, are already introducing, beyond the pale of regulation, biometric technology—fingerprint scanners, retina scanners—as a condition of entering their premises. I believe, and I am sure that many right-minded citizens—and I suspect the member for Moncrieff—would agree with me, that this sort of activity should probably not be occurring outside the realm of regulation; but perhaps that is a matter for another day. 


The second point that I would make on the issue of privacy and intrusion is that it is a condition of the establishment of a club that they set up and keep a membership register and ensure that anybody who enters the premises of a club, at least in New South Wales or Queensland and I suspect everywhere else, has proof of identity which satisfies the requirements of the legislation and is able by one means or another to satisfy the occupiers of the premises—the licensees, the club owners and managers—that when they enter those premises and intend to use the facilities, including the electronic gaming machine facilities on those premises, they can show that identity. That is to say, the database already exists. Not only does it exist but it collects  information about the gaming habits of individual club members and visitors and the clubs already use that data to market to those patrons they know who are frequenters of electronic gaming machines. They do such things—and I make no value judgment about this whatsoever—as send free tickets for meals and a courtesy cab around to a regular punter's home and say, 'Come on down, we've got a special deal for you today; we will put on a meal and free drinks and we've got a special pokies promotion going on.' 


I make no value judgment about that whatsoever. Clubs are entitled to market, but they are already using this data and we believe that the introduction of the mandatory precommitment technology is no greater intrusion on a club member or a club patron's privacy than already exists. In fact, through this mechanism we might serve to tidy up some of the practices that many within the community think are not meeting community standards and expectations. 


We are far more optimistic than those opposite. If their real issue is problem gambling and they think that we should do something about it and if their real objection is this just ain't the problem, we are a bit more optimistic. This ain't the solution. We are a bit more optimistic than that. One of the recommendations of the committee, as the member for Moncrieff knows, is that there shall be a trial. I am quite confident that, as a result of the rollout of this technology and the trial that we intend to put in place, any of the teething problems that the member for Moncrieff is so passionately concerned about will be able to be dealt with. I am sure the member for Moncrieff and those he represents will get plenty more opportunities—



Mr Ciobo interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Moncrieff has had his opportunity.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  to run his scare campaign around his alleged concerns about privacy. But I end my contribution where I began. Gambling addiction is real, it is a public health issue, it is a family issue, it is a family issue, it is a workplace issue and it is an economic issue and we cannot sit idly by and just identify all of the problems—for those of us who have the gumption and the courage to try to do something about it—without proffering some of the solutions that will make a real difference.


Debate adjourned.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2011-05-11,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (12:55):  I rise to support the motion of the Prime Minister that was also spoken to by the Leader of the Opposition, about the death of the Australian boxing legend Lionel Rose. The reason I rise to speak about Lionel Rose is that I had the good fortune of meeting Lionel on quite a few occasions and entertaining him at my house on quite a few occasions. This was in 1980, after Lionel had finished his boxing career but when he was still well known and respected within the Australian sporting community. We all know that Lionel suffered some hard times during his life, but he always managed to use that spirit of his, the fighting spirit that Lionel had, to continue to get on with his life.


I would like to put on record some information that I have researched about Lionel on the biography websites. Lionel Rose's career embodied the stuff legends are made of. In a boxing career begun in a makeshift ring in a poverty-stricken Aboriginal settlement, Rose developed a crushing punch that helped him become the first Australian Aborigine to win a world championship title and the second Australian to take home a world title in boxing. His win catapulted him to fame in Australia. His lifetime career of 53 fights with only 11 losses made him a legend in the world of boxing.


Lionel Rose was born on 21 June 1948 and raised in Jacksons Track, a poor Aboriginal settlement 50 miles south of Melbourne. The eldest of nine children in an Aboriginal family, Rose was on the wrong side of a society divided by racism, mistrust and economic disparity. As a child Rose escaped racism through boxing. Rose's father, an amateur boxer, inspired Rose to don his first pair of boxing gloves at the age of 14. The pair trained in a ring made of chicken wire. Rose and his siblings also became avid fans of tent matches, which were popular boxing bouts that travelled the country, much the way a circus might. However, it was at a ring match in Melbourne that Rose found his inspiration in another Aboriginal boxer.


I'd seen plenty of tent fights when I was younger, but the great George Bracken was the first boxer I saw in the ring—


Rose told the website Vibe Australia. 


His great fighting style and speed really made me take an even bigger interest in boxing than before.


Rose began his amateur boxing career under the guidance of trainer Frank Oakes. He later married Oakes' daughter Jenny. Rose won his first big fight in 1963, the day after the death of his father. By the end of that year Rose had won Australia's national amateur flyweight title. Flyweight is one of the lowest weight classifications in boxing, with an upper limit of 112 pounds. In 1964, Rose narrowly missed being selected for the Australian Olympic team. By that time Rose knew he wanted to make a career of boxing and decided to go professional. In 1964, Rose began his professional training at Jack Rennie's Melbourne gym. Rennie, a legendary figure in Australian boxing, worked Rose hard often pairing him with Mick Croucher, a more experienced boxer 20 pounds heavier than Rose. Croucher recalled to the World Boxing Foundation website:


Champions are born not made and [Rose] had enormous natural ability. Some people work hard in training and are very dedicated but to be a champion in any sport a person must be born with a natural gift and Lionel was fortunate enough to have that.


Under Rennie, Rose moved to the bantamweight division, with a weight limit of 118 pounds. He also developed what the Age described as an 'easy style married to a tooth-shaking straight left to the clenched jaws of all who came against him'. In September 1964, Rose won his first professional bout in eight rounds. He won his next four fights in a row. In all of 1965, Rose lost only one fight. Between January and October 1966, Rose won six of seven matches, qualifying to compete for Australia's bantamweight title. On October 28, 1966, Rose beat the reigning champion, Noel Kunde, in a 15-round decision to win the title. Rose went on to win his next nine matches, including a 13-round challenge to his title in December 1967. That fight made Rose famous in Australia, as his challenger Rocky Gatellari was expected to win. Yet that fame was nothing compared to what was about to come.


By 1968 Rose had a fight record of 29 wins and two losses. He was the two-time Australian bantamweight champion and had developed quite a following in the boxing world. Boxing promoters at the international level took notice and offered Rose a chance to fight then bantamweight world champion Masahiko 'Fighting' Harada at a title match in Tokyo. The Japanese fighter was already a legend in the ring, having successfully defended his world title five times. Rose was eager to take him on. His trainer Rennie was not so sure. According to the World Boxing Foundation website Rennie thought Rose, then barely 19 years old, 'wasn't yet ready for a World Title shot'. Nonetheless, Rose accepted the challenge. Rose arrived in Tokyo six weeks prior to the fight to train extensively and assimilate to the Japanese culture. Despite his preparations, no-one considered him a threat to Harada's title. Boxing scholar Jim Amato noted on the Inside Boxing website: 


When this Australian entered the ring to face Harada he was a prohibitive underdog. Very few gave him a legitimate chance.


Rose ignored the naysayers and entered the ring with confidence. The website actually says: 'An estimated 30 million Australians'—but I am sure it would have been more like three million—'tuning in by radio and television, entered with optimism.' The website further states:


Rose started the fight by holding back, a stance which caught Harada off-guard. I expected Rose to come in and attack first but he didn't. So I started to take the initiative myself. That is where I made a mistake,"" Harada told The Age. After the third round, despite injuring his hand, Rose told Rennie, ""Don't worry about me; this bloke can't punch,"" noted The Age. That seemed true throughout much of the fight as Harada unleashed a volley of punches that Rose either ducked or absorbed without much notice. Meanwhile, Rose landed several stunning blows to the champ. ""By the end of the flight the desperate champion was chasing Rose round the ring,"" wrote The Age. After 15 rounds, Rose became the new World Bantamweight Title. The disappointed Japanese crowd was stunned, but gave Rose a respectful ovation as he struggled to hold aloft the massive title trophy. Rennie proudly told The Age, '[Rose] was a boy doing a man's work, and he did it well. He was in a strange country, among a strange crowd, and he did not let this worry him.'


When Rose returned to Melbourne, he was met by an estimated quarter of a million people lining the streets to welcome him home. 'It was simply unbelievable,' Rose told Vibe Australia. 'To fulfil my ultimate dream and then be met by so many people was amazing. My picture was all over the newspapers and it made me realise how much it meant to everyone.' Later that year he was named Australian of the Year, the first Aborigine to receive such an honour. Rose had not only become an Australian hero; he had also become an Aboriginal icon. 'To see the way that my people looked at me and to know that I made a difference to them was an honour,' he told Vibe Australia. Rose refused to get involved in political issues, instead helping Aborigines, often children, at a grassroots level. One example occurred in 1999 when Rose gave his championship belt to an Aboriginal child who had been set on fire in a racially motivated attack.


In the late sixties and early seventies, Rose continued to fight successfully He defended his title three times: in July 1968; once again in Tokyo; in December 1968, in Inglewood, California; and in March 1969, in front of record crowds in Melbourne. The Inglewood match was memorable for two reasons. The challenger was a Mexican boxer, Chucho Castillo, and the fans were evenly split, with Americans rooting for Rose and Latin Americans pulling for Castillo. When Rose won in a decision after the 15th round, the crowd erupted into a riot. Over a dozen people, including a boxing official, were hospitalised.


Despite the sensation the riot made in the press, the most impressive moment for Rose during his California visit was meeting Elvis Presley: 


I was punching a heavy bag in a gym in L.A., and I hear a voice sing out, ""Hey, Lionel! What's doin'?"" ""And it was Elvis himself,"" Rose recalled to The Age. ""I was in awe of him, but he said he was in awe of me."" Music had been a part of Rose's life for even longer than boxing. He had learned to play guitar as a child and was never without one. ""You're never lonesome with your guitar,"" Rose told The Age.


In 1969 Rose appeared on a televised variety show, singing along to his guitar. Australian producer and songwriter Johnny Young caught Rose's act and offered to pen a song for the boxer. The result was ""Thank You,"" Rose's first single. The song reached the No. 1 spot in Australia's country charts. The following year Rose, again, made the charts with a cover of the country classic Pick Me Up On Your Way Down. Rose began touring as a musician when not boxing and, in 1970, recorded two albums for the Festival label. One of those, Jackson's Track, is considered a lost classic in Australian country music circles. Back in the boxing ring, Rose had a couple more successful fights before he fought Mexican boxer Ruben Olivares in August of 1969. Olivares, who went on to become a boxing legend, knocked Rose out in the fifth round, taking the world championship title. Rose fought seven more bouts over the next year and a half, winning five. However, he had begun to have trouble keeping his weight down to bantam levels. 'I used to spit a real lot in order to lose an ounce,' he recalled to the Age. By 1971 Rose was up to the lightweight category that had a weight limit of 135 pounds. In that division he fought unsuccessfully in a bid for the Australian lightweight title. By the end of 1971 he had gone down to the superfeatherweight level that had a weight limit of 130 pounds. In that category he made an unsuccessful bid for the world title in Japan. After that loss, Rose decided to hang up his gloves. He did not fight again for four years. 


Rose interrupted his retirement and returned to the ring in 1975. However, after losing four of six bouts, he retired from the sport for good in 1976. Over the next few decades, Rose worked odd jobs, including running a cafe and performing as a musician. He soon fell on hard times due to alcoholism. At his lowest point, he was arrested for his role in a robbery attempt. Despite these setbacks, Rose remained a hero for both Aboriginal and white Australians. In 1991, a biography of Rose, called Rose Against the Odds, was published. In 1995 a full-length movie of the same name was released. Ten years later, Rose was honoured with an Australian stamp bearing a replica of his boxing gloves. That same year he was honoured with a Deadly Award for lifetime achievement in sports, one of Australia's most prestigious Aboriginal awards.


I would like to get on the record a couple of quotes by his peers. As the member for Bennelong will know, we all get a lot of plaudits when we are successful in sport but some of the most meaningful are the ones you get from your peers who played a sport with you. You understand those people. Jeff Fenech, who clawed his way out of working-class Marrickville in Sydney's inner west to win three world titles, told the Australian:


Lionel was simply brilliant, arguably the most gifted fighter this country ever produced.


Barry Michael, another famous Australian boxer, recalled:


Lionel would often jab with triple left hooks and thrown at incredible hand speed.


Australian boxing historian Paul Upham said:


Rose's win against Rocky Gattellari, himself a former WBC flyweight world title contender, at the old Sydney Stadium, remains one of the best pound-per-pound bouts in the annals of the sport in this country.


Lionel was to win with a knockout in the 13th round with a straight right hand and it was the very first boxing match televised interstate by the Seven Network.


I applaud the career and the life of Lionel Rose. It was a pleasure to have met him and entertain him in my home during a time when he was going through a tough period. He was a champion bloke and an Australian legend.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (16:00):  I rise to put on the record my condolences on the passing of Lionel Rose, the famous Australian boxer. The condolence motion was discussed a little earlier this morning. Sadly, Mr Deputy Speaker Murphy, you were not here to hear the words of the member for Swan, who gave a quite detailed history and a very personal testimony to the life of Lionel Rose and what he contributed to Australian society. I also acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the member for Hasluck as the first Indigenous member in the House of Representatives. He shares with Lionel Rose that he was a first in Australian history, as Lionel was the first Australian of the Year and I think the first Australian champion in his teens as well. So there are a number of firsts happening here.


Lionel Rose was born in the late 1940s and grew up in Victoria in an Aboriginal settlement called Jackson's Track. The history is that his dad was a boxer, and the talent obviously ran in the family. Lionel Rose's talent was identified when he was quite young. Clearly Lionel saw an opportunity to use his talents to advance his life. By the age of 14 he was well engaged in boxing. By the age of 19, after a very short period of time—a space of just five years—he became the bantamweight champion of the world against Fighting Harada in Japan. I also recall, from when I was a young girl, not just the energy around that fight with Fighting Harada but also the fight with Rocky Gattellari.


As much as I might not be the person in this parliament who is most associated with boxing, in the absence of there being an eldest son in my family I sufficed, as the eldest daughter, as my father's companion in watching the boxing on the television on many, many evenings. It was a great passion of his to follow the boxing, so I was given the commentary of his view of many fights over many years. I recall very fondly the time I spent with my dad and the pride we felt watching Lionel Rose and his progress to the world championship, as well as the things that happened in the time that followed.


We listened on the radio, as well, to the reports of that boxing match. I can still recall the energy all these years later, even though I was only a child at the time. I can still recall how it captured a part of the imagination of Australians that an Aboriginal person was representing us, and we were very proud to be associated with Lionel's great success. One of the images I also recall is the victory parade that greeted Lionel on his return. For me there is an image of him in a sports car and of a ticker tape parade. How appropriate that such great recognition by a quarter of a million people was given to such a fighting hero of our nation.


The Prime Minister yesterday recorded Lionel Rose's success, a career of 42 wins from 53 bouts—no mean achievement—and, in fact, 12 knockouts amongst those successes. His refusal to fight in South Africa was also noted by the Prime Minister. We understand the courage and conviction of the man who lay beneath the fighter in that action.


As much as I enjoyed watching the boxing with my father, I think a more enduring love in my life has been a love of music. I can absolutely recall as a young girl hearing Lionel Rose's voice singing I Thank You for Just Being You. What good words they are to have as we remember him today. He was the first Aboriginal person that I knew, through the television. In my world there were no people in my class who identified as Aboriginal. There were no people in my community that I was familiar with who were Aboriginal.  Lionel Rose was the first Aboriginal person that I met through the media.


I recall a man with a great smile, a man of humility, a man who was a world champion and a man who was seen as a hero. He is an inspiration and that is why I am pleased to be speaking here to this condolence motion. He is an inspiration to all young Australians, an ideal that teens might achieve great things, that they might become the very best in the world in their teen years and that success at that level is not only for the old but for those who have talent at any age. He is an inspiration to the first peoples of this nation: to follow your dreams, to believe in yourself and to achieve recognition not just in our own country as an Australian of the Year—the first Aboriginal Australian of the Year—but internationally, for the talents that lie within when they are unleashed are a great thing.


Also, for all Australians generally, he was a complex man. He lived a rich life—a tapestry of great times and also great sorrows, as we heard from the member for Swan. But he was a man of particular talents in the fields of sport and music. One of his own songs was titled I Thank You for Just Being You, but I am sure that there are many Australians today who would say, 'I thank you, Lionel Rose, for just being you and the great joy you brought to our lives.'

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (16:06):  I rise to speak with pride on the condolence motion for Lionel Rose, an Aboriginal champion boxer, who served as an inspiration to many Australians but, particularly to Aboriginal people, he was a hero. Lionel Edward Rose was born on 21 June 1948 at Jackson's Track near Jindivick, Victoria, Australia and passed away at Warragul, Victoria, Australia, on 8 May, aged 62. In 2007 he had a stroke that left him partially paralysed. He had an impressive boxing record of 42 wins, with 12 wins by knockouts and 11 losses, out of a total of 53 fights. Lionel Rose was heralded as one of this country's greatest sporting heroes yet he was humble and down to earth. He will be missed by his family, but equally by the many he touched.



I want to use the words of Alan Duff from his book Maori Heroes:


Every family, group, tribe, race and nation needs heroes. Heroes give us someone to look up to. Heroes inspire us and provide a model and standard for people to aspire to. They represent what is best in us, the qualities of courage, determination, perseverance and humility and, yes, talent and intelligence. The first qualities listed are a necessity but the latter two are not. The most ordinary person is capable of being a hero.


Lionel Rose was our hero. David Horton's entry in the Encyclopedia of Aboriginal Australia, publishedby the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, appears on pages 954 to 955:


Lionel Rose, Australian boxer. Lionel Rose was born in the early 1940s. He was one of Australia's most successful boxers. Lionel grew up in an Aboriginal settlement called Jackson's Track in Victoria. When Lionel was growing up he studied his father, who was also a boxer. Lionel saw boxing as an escape from the poor living in the country. He ended up winning his first Australian amateur flyweight title when he was just 15. One of Lionel's greatest achievements was winning a world title. Although he was not the first Aboriginal to win a world title he was the first boxer to do so. Rose won the bantamweight title in 1968 against Harada from Japan. He was also only the second Australian to win a world title while still in his teens. After Lionel missed out on the Tokyo Olympics in 1964, Rose turned professional. He was trained by a Melbourne trainer named Jack Rennie. Rose entered in a fight against Rocky Gattellari at Sydney stadium. Everybody was behind Rocky Gattellari but when Lionel Rose knocked him out in round 13 the fans had a new hero. When Lionel went to Japan to fight Harada, Harada already had five successful title defences to his credit. Harada was given advice that if he hit an Aboriginal in the legs he would fall immediately. He ignored the advice and hit him in the head, but this had no effect. In the ninth round Harada dropped to his knees from a short left punch to his chin. He then opened himself to more and more punishment and Lionel went on to win that fight. Lionel Rose became a symbolic figure in the interracial politics of the times. He won his world title just a few months after the referendum which gave the Australian government new powers to advance Aboriginal rights. 


Lionel was 16 when he made his professional boxing debut, and at 18 he won the Australian bantamweight title. At 19, we know that he went on to win the fight against Fighting Harada. He gained a considerable amount of weight and moved up several classes to the lightweight, but he was unable to emulate his success as a bantamweight and retired in 1976.


Lionel Rose grew up in hardship, learning to box from his father, Roy, a useful fighter on the tent-show circuit. Lionel Rose began his professional boxing career on September 1964, outpointing Mario Magriss over eight rounds. The fight was in Warragul, but the majority of Rose's fights were held in Melbourne. He lived in Melbourne with Jack and Shirley Rennie, training every day in their backyard gym.


His defeat of Harada made Rose an instant national hero in Australia, and an icon among Aboriginal people. He responded well to the public reception at Melbourne Town Hall, which was witnessed by a crowd of more than 2,000. The parade had more than 250,000 and at a point later when he was interviewed he acknowledged the impact of that crowd on him and the success that he had achieved.


Lionel Rose of course was Australian of the Year in 1968, the first Aboriginal person to be awarded the honour. In 1996, Rose presented young burns-attack victim Tjandamurra O'Shane with his world-title belt, helping to speed the youngster's recovery. Tjandamurra had been the victim of a racially charged attack in Cairns the previous year. In 2007 Lionel Rose suffered a stroke that left him with speech and movement difficulties. 


I also want to share with you the person Lionel Rose was. I cite an article by Cathy Bedford in which she wrote a personality profile. This profile gives an insight into Lionel Rose the person. To do her work justice, I will quote her article faithfully:


Lionel grew up in an Aboriginal settlement called Jackson's Track near the Gippsland town of Drouin in the 1940s. Born into a large family with tight budgets Lionel was forced to bring in money to support his eight younger brothers and sisters. 


He instantly looked to his father, a professional boxer in the travelling tent-show circuit. Tragically Lionel's father and greatest boxing mentor died when he was 14 before he could see his son fight professionally.


I went from nothing to something, you know what I mean … in an instant ... I got the shock of my life 


“He saw one amateur fight and I won that."" Lionel says. ""Of course he was over the moon about that. He used to talk all the time about the boxing he showed me the real fundamentals of it. So by the time I got to the gym I trained under another fella named Frank Oakes; actually ended up marrying his daughter too.” 


Lionel's path to glory was not as straight forward. A young country boy taken swiftly to the bright lights of Melbourne. From small-time bouts to a chance at the big time. 


“I went from nothing to something, you know what I mean…in an instant. When we got back to Melbourne so many people lined the streets to welcome you home at the town hall. And that’s a memory that will never disappear from my mind. I got the shock of my life anyway. Especially because there were only 10 to see us off when we went over there to fight for the title.”


 “I wanted to go home after a fortnight, I couldn’t hack the noise it was all that."" Lionel says. ""You know the city and the country it’s all differences you know. I was 16 or 17 and I couldn’t be doing the things that other 16 year olds do today.""


I ended up cutting the song at Armstrong Studios in South Melbourne and blow me down it became number one within a fortnight. And it stayed at number one for 32 weeks.


""I had to be up at 6 o’clock running, I had to go to work during the day and then come home and train and then into bed again, I did that for six years… But it made a name for me and I’ve met some terrific people in my travels.”


“That was in Los Angeles, we went out to MGM studios with Elvis Presley for about three hours. I was in awe of him anyway. We were the first allowed on his set in 10 years.”


But singing was to be Lionel's triumph too. Who would have thought the poor boy from Jackson’s track could progress from the musical domain of his lounge room to the heights of the Australian  musical charts with the song 'Pick me up on your way down'. 


“I did a show on Channel Seven called Sunny Side Up and sung a song called Pick me up on your way down."" Lionel says. ""Anyhow, Johnny Young came around to the gym and look he said ‘I’ve got a song here, I’d like to record if you want to do it?’ I said ‘Nah I’m not into that I only sing in the bathroom or in the lounge room with the brothers and sisters’.""


""But he persevered and I ended up cutting the song at Armstrong Studios in South Melbourne and blow me down it became number one within a fortnight. And it stayed at number one for 32 weeks that song.""


But now, 25 years after he stepped out of the ring for the last time he has finally got his wish and returned to his roots in Gippsland.


“Well I’m doing good at the moment, thank you very much. It’s all clear ahead so I’m just enjoying life at the moment.”


“My mum only lives 5 mile away in Drouin so I’m back with my family, and I really am enjoying life immensely at the moment. I’ve got a hell of a lot of friends here, so there’s no shortage of that you know.” 


“I’ve got fond memories of growing up here. They were probably the best times in my life. But life wasn’t too hard, we lived in a community, there were uncles and aunties living next door and down the road a bit so it was a family thing.” 


“If you go down the track a bit and you look back, you realise that the days at Jacksons track were black tea and damper days but the fond memories I have of it are incredible.”


Lionel Rose never lost his connections to his community nor his family. He cherished the times when he was boxing at the height of his career and many of the memories he shared with those of us who he knew. But equally he was as content back within his community, because the memories of where you grow up, your totems and the significance of the land around you, becomes important.


Lionel, you gave all Australians a hero to be proud of. In keeping with the lyrics of your song, thank you for being you. Rest in peace in the presence of the Almighty.

Mr LYONS
 (Bass) (16:17):  I rise to acknowledge the life of Lionel Edward Rose. I mourn his passing. I will not go through the facts and figures that I have before me that others have covered and will cover. I think of my times in the YMCA boxing ring and when I went to the local shows, with Harry Paulsen beating the drum and asking people to roll up. As a kid, I always rolled up. There were always plenty of Aboriginal fighters. I had the good fortune of playing football with many Aboriginal players. In fact, every club that I played with had at least one Aboriginal player. But in Tasmanian in 1968 they did not stand up and talk about their Aboriginality. Lionel Rose not only gave Australia a hero but gave Tasmanian Aboriginals a hero and made them stand that bit prouder. I remember in 1968 listening to him fight Fighting Harada. What a great feeling that was for Australia. I am involved with Australian Rules footy and each year we have an Indigenous round. We have people like Syd Jackson come down and talk to us about Australian Aborigines and what a wonderful contribution they have made to sport. Before I embarrass myself any further I just want to say he was a hero. I bought his songs, although I did not buy too many records. I think I Thank You was a great song for our nation at the time. Pick Me Up on Your Way Down—we could still live with those words today, couldn't we? And Please Remember Me—I certainly do.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (16:20):  I rise to speak on the sad and premature passing of one of our greatest ever sporting legends. It is rather difficult to do this after my friends the member for Hasluck and the member for Bass so vividly demonstrated what Lionel Rose did for our generation in bringing us together. He was born and raised in Jacksons Track, south-east of Melbourne, one of the few remaining untouched Aboriginal communities at the time. Lionel grew up in the most difficult of circumstances. He learned to box from his father, Roy, who was an amateur fighter. Initially, when he could not afford gloves, he wrapped his hands in rags and he boxed in a ring made of fencing wire stretched between trees. There was no such thing as rope-a-dope for Lionel. He was given his first gloves at the age of 10 by a press photographer.


Lionel commenced organised training at the age of 15 under a local trainer, Frank Oakes; Lionel would later marry his daughter Jenny. Soon after, he won the Australian amateur flyweight title. He turned professional in 1964 after missing out on selection for the 1964 Olympic Games. He moved to Melbourne and lived with Jack and Shirley Rennie. Jack became his trainer and they worked out every day in their backyard gym. Interestingly, Harry Hopman was a great friend of Jack Rennie and a great fan of boxing. He took two young Australian tennis players who were living and training with him at the time to see Lionel do his farewell spar before he went to Los Angeles to defend his title: Phil Dent and I got to meet Lionel at that time. We were so impressed with his gentleness and with his incredible modesty. He was already a world champion at 19.


He built up a flawless record in Australia and New Zealand, leading to winning the Australian bantamweight title in October 1966. He continued to win belts, including a famous knockout win against Rocky Gattellari at Sydney Stadium. He then challenged the legendary national hero Fighting Harada for the world bantamweight title on 26 February 1968 in Tokyo. He was an enormous underdog; he was said to be too young to fight at this level. He made history by becoming the first Aboriginal Australian to win a world championship. He defeated Harada in 15 gruelling rounds.


This win made Rose an instant national hero and an icon among Aboriginal Australians. He was welcomed back to Melbourne by 250,000 fans to celebrate his great success. Rose defended his title again in Tokyo and in California, where the disappointed local crowds started a riot; the referee needed hospitalisation and over a dozen spectators were also treated. He retired in 1971, with a brief but unsuccessful comeback attempt in 1975.


Lionel Rose became the first Indigenous Australian to be awarded Australian of the Year in 1968, the same year he was awarded an MBE. In 2003, he was an inaugural inductee into the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame. He was featured on an Australia Post stamp two years later and also awarded the Ella Lifetime Achievement Award for contribution to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sport. Lionel went on to have a musical career. In 1970 he released two hit ballads: I Thank You and Please Remember Me. The song I Thank You was a nationwide hit, more recently used by the comedians Roy and HG as a substitute for the Australian national anthem during their sporting broadcasts.


After retiring from boxing Lionel remained an inspiration for Indigenous Australians. In 1996 Lionel gave his world title belt to a six-year-old Indigenous boy, Tjandamurra O'Shane, who was the innocent victim of a horrific schoolyard attack, suffering burns to 70 per cent of his body. Lionel hoped the belt would give O'Shane hope for a speedy recovery. In 2008 O'Shane completed year 12 and graduated from Woree State High School, providing a great joy for Lionel, who had suffered a stroke earlier that year. 


An award-winning film of his life, a documentary called Lionel, premiered at the Melbourne International Film Festival in 2008. The film explored his rise and his struggle with the dimensions of being a mythic sporting figure, showing the contrast between hero and the man. The film is not just a tribute to an icon but an honest portrayal of a complex and conflicted human being. The filmmaker added the by-line: 'Lionel's imperfections may be larger than life, but so is his heart.'


Lionel Rose was an inspiration to his people, many of whom experience great hopelessness in white society. Lionel showed that anything is possible, that a poor young Indigenous boy could rise to be a world champion and become a national hero. It is a beautiful irony that, on the same day that Lionel passed, Daniel Geale, another young Australian with Indigenous heritage, won the IBF middleweight championship in Germany, becoming only the fourth Australian born boxer to win a title on foreign soil.


Legendary trainer Johnny Lewis said:


I think Lionel Rose showed indigenous Australians that they could achieve anything if they worked hard, but he was an inspiration for all Australians.


Even current boxing champion Anthony Mundine, one not normally renowned for sharing the limelight, described Lionel Rose as the best Australian fighter ever. Lionel also became a symbol of the political discourse of the time, as debate on racial equality and Indigenous rights was the defining issue of the day. He turned professional the same year as the Freedom Ride and won his world title one year after the 1967 referendum.


It is interesting that Lionel found his fame in the manly art of self-defence, yet he displayed the most extraordinary level of gentleness. I grew up with a girl called Evonne Goolagong. Evonne showed the same extraordinary gentleness, as did Cathy Freeman later on. All three shared an incredible physical grace. In Lionel's case it belied his speed and also belied the power with which he hit. This unusual mix of manliness and gentleness produced in Lionel Rose, our champion, a gentle man. Thank you.

 (Shortland—Government Whip) (16:27):  My contribution will only be brief. I would like to place on record my tribute to a truly great Australian. Lionel Rose was a role model for not only Indigenous Australians but all Australians. Whilst I am not a person who is usually a boxing fan, I can remember where I was and what I was doing at the particular time that Lionel Rose won his world title. His win had a great impact in my community, which had a large Indigenous population. It had an empowering effect on those people, especially when he was made Australian of the Year. That showed just what a groundbreaking person he was and the impact he had on our society. The songs he wrote and the contribution he made crossed so many different layers of our society. I briefly place on the record of this House my appreciation and thanks for the work that he did.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (16:30):  I pay tribute to a great man and legend, Mr Lionel Rose MBE, who passed away on Sunday, 8 May 2011. I would also like to express my deepest sympathy and pass on my condolences to his family and friends. In 1968, when Lionel Rose beat Japanese boxer 'Fighting' Harada, Lionel became a role model for Aboriginal people throughout Australia. Lionel was a great champion and was rightly hailed as Australia's first Aboriginal world champion, with over 100,000 people attending a civic reception in his honour at Melbourne Town Hall. In that same year, Lionel was made Australian of the Year—what a great tribute to a great man. He was an absolute legend and a champion for his people and all Australians. 


Lionel Rose was a remarkable man admired by all. He was a wonderful human being and it is fitting that he will be honoured with a state funeral. In a Sydney Morning Herald article on 9 May, Australian boxing trainer Johnny Lewis said:


It seems incredible that on the same day Lionel Rose leaves us Daniel Geale becomes a world champion. 


Mr Lewis goes on to say: 


Daniel is very proud of his indigenous background and the way was opened for Daniel by Lionel Rose and Tony Mundine. They were great role models. I think Lionel Rose showed Indigenous Australians that they could achieve anything if they worked hard, but he was an inspiration to all Australians.


This was a wonderful tribute to Lionel Rose by the legendary boxing trainer Johnny Lewis. Only four Australians have won world titles overseas—Jimmy Carruthers, Lionel Rose, Jeff Harding and a local boy from my Macarthur electorate, Daniel Geale. Daniel is a resident of Harrington Park; he trains at the Grange Old School Boxing gym at Smeaton Grange. Even though Daniel was born in Launceston, Tasmania, in recent years he has resided in the Macarthur electorate. Daniel won gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and turned professional in 2004. In December of that year, he won the world IBO middleweight championship. On 8 May, Daniel won the IBF middleweight world championship—an amazing achievement. I am proud to say that my office gave Daniel the Aboriginal flag that he took with him to Germany for the world championship this year. 


Daniel Geale is the latest Aboriginal champion to become a role model for the Aboriginal youth in my electorate. I am proud to be the member for Macarthur, a place where Aboriginal heritage is valued and cherished. The Macarthur region is home to one of the largest urban concentrations of Aboriginal people in Sydney. There are more than 5,000 Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people living in the Macarthur region, representing approximately 2.3 per cent of the total population of my electorate. The median age for Indigenous residents in Macarthur is 17 years, compared to 32 years for the general population. 


Macarthur over the years has produced many Aboriginal role models in sports, the arts, policing and education. People such as Djon Mundine, our internationally recognised Aboriginal curator at the Campbelltown Arts Centre; Constable Brenton Magee, a Campbelltown police officer and a great role model for local Aboriginal youth; and Frances Bodkin, a botanical author, teacher and traditional storyteller at the at the Mount Annan Botanic Gardens, who was recently one of 100 Indigenous women across the country recognised for their tireless contribution to the community. That is to name just a few of our local Aboriginal people who have made a significant contribution to our community. I am sure that Lionel would not mind me mentioning other inspirational Aboriginal leaders here today. There are many throughout all our communities. Lionel Rose was a quiet, unassuming Australian, a role model not only for Aboriginal people but for all Australians. He was a national hero for us all. It has been said that Lionel Rose's decency redefined sportsmanship. Lionel Rose led by example and remained a man of the people. There will never be enough accolades to celebrate the wonderful life of Lionel Rose and his contribution to humanity and Australian society. I am pleased to inform the House that Daniel Geale has these same attributes. I have no doubt that he will also become a role model for the youth of Australia and follow in the same footsteps as the great Lionel Rose, who will always be remembered.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-05-11,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (16:35):  I rise to pay tribute to Lionel Edward Rose MBE, world titleholder, Australian of the Year and modest singer, who overnight became an instant Australian hero and an icon amongst Aboriginal Australians—indeed, all Australians. Rose stayed true to his roots and his life throughout the rags to riches tale. He came from very modest beginnings to the highest level of international sport, taking the hopes of a nation with him. On 26 February 1968, Rose made history by becoming the first Aboriginal Australian to win a world champion boxing title. That same year, Rose was also awarded Australian of the Year, making him the first Aboriginal Australian to be awarded the honour. 


Lionel Rose was born and raised at Jacksons Track near the Victorian town of Warragul. He grew up in hardship, learning to box from his father, a useful fighter on the tent show circuit. Yet it was a friendship Lionel Rose forged with local press photographer Graham Walsh, who later introduced him to local Warragul trainer Frank Oakes, which launched him into the fighting circuit. The making of his career was once described by boxing historian Grantlee Kieza as aboxer who 'sparred with rags on his hands in a ring made from fencing wire stretched between trees'. 


At the tender age of 16, Lionel Rose narrowly missed out on selection for the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. However, this was the year he began his professional boxing career on 9 September, when he outpointed Mario Magriss over eight rounds at a professional fight in Warragul. Over the next 18 months, Lionel Rose had a record of 13 wins, one loss and one knockout. It was on 26 October 1966 that he won the Australian bantamweight title. He won that title in a gruelling 15-round decision. Lionel Rose challenged Japanese boxer Fighting Harada for the world bantamweight title and won, again in a gruelling 15-round decision. On 8 March 1969, Lionel Rose retained the title with yet another 15-round decision over British boxer Alan Rudkin, but lost the title five months later in a fifth round knockout. Thinking that his career was over, Lionel Rose continued to box, but only unknown fighters. However, after a 10-round decision on 10 October 1970, when he upset Japanese lightweight champion Ishimatsu Suzuki, he once again positioned himself as a world title challenger.


All in all, in his professional boxing career Lionel Rose compiled a record of an impressive 42 wins, 11 losses and 12 wins by knockout. During his time off from boxing in the 1970s he became a modest Australian singer, releasing one album and two singles. His climb to the top from the lower end of society made him personable to Australians and a pillar to the Aboriginal community. 


In 2007, Lionel Rose sadly suffered a stroke which left him with limited speech and movement. However, it was a short illness which took his life on 8 May 2011, at the all too young age of 62. Lionel Rose was an inspirational man whose tale is recognised both nationally and internationally. The world has lost a boxing champion, Australia has lost a national hero and his own people have lost a wonderful role model. He will be sadly missed and I offer my sincerest condolences to his family and also the countless members of his wider family, which stretches the length and breadth of the nation, the country he loved so much. To a great man and champion of his people, all people: may you rest in peace.

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (16:39):  It was NAIDOC Week last year when a person walked into the room, and of course it was Lionel Rose, and no room was the same in Drouin if Lionel was in that room, or if Lionel was at the football ground, or if Lionel was around. Lionel did not want any attention whatsoever, as we have heard today from the very generous speakers who have spoken in this condolence debate and who have passed on their condolences to the family, as I do to the broader Rose family. As their local member, I am as distant from Lionel and his family as any other person of my background. But I am not distant from Jacksons Track, and I am not distant from the story of Jacksons Track. I do not think anybody fully understands the incredible story that Lionel Rose is, coming out of Jacksons Track. No-one understands the enormity of the journey of the young boy coming out of Jacksons Track onto the world stage.


I do not think he had much time for politicians, or even NAIDOC Week, but he was out with his family; he was doing what he wanted to do. It was great to hear from members of parliament, especially the member for Bass, who obviously has a very deep and personal connection to Indigenous communities because of the work he has done with young footballers and sportsmen. Lionel, speaking to you now—we were there listening to you on the radio. I do not like boxing, because for all of my life, when I have listened to or watched boxing, my heart was in terror that Lionel Rose or one of his sporting colleagues was going to be severely hurt boxing on behalf of this nation, because that is what he was doing. Maybe it seemed that he was doing it for himself, but the nation was watching Lionel Rose. The nation was listening to Lionel Rose. The nation was hoping and praying for his wellbeing and his success. Fourteen people saw him off when he left to go overseas, and when he achieved that success 250,000 people crowded the streets of Melbourne—all the way from Essendon Airport and all the way in, there were people standing on the side of the road waiting for Lionel's car to come past. He was our new hero. And don't we love a hero! 


Jacksons Track was a disgrace. When Carolyn Landon wrote the story of Jacksons Track and put it in black and white, we had an issue. I do not cry reading books, but I cried many times when I was reading Jackson's Track. I had to put the book down, and I could not read the next page until I could get myself back to a state where the tears in my eyes were not destroying my ability to read the book Jackson's Track. As a local member, I know where this guy came from. And he must have had a burning desire within him. You would hear those who are competent in sport talk about his speed, his ability and the power that came from such a gentle soul. The only person I ever met in Lionel Rose on the number of occasions that I met Lionel was a gentle, quiet, unassuming, humble human being. That is the person I knew. He did not have the humour of Syd Jackson. He did not even have what you would call grace and style—but humble!


Here was this guy who changed the world for Australia—to think that one of our Indigenous young people could go and tackle Fighting Harada and win. As you have heard from all of the people today who spoke about how he was rated, if he was on Sportsbet going into that fight, you would not have had any money on him at all. And he won. He won against the odds—as a child, as a teenager and as a boxer.


He could sing as well. I thought he sang Telephone to Glory.




Mr Wyatt:
  That was Jimmy Little.




Mr BROADBENT:
  Yes, I know, but I think Lionel actually recorded Telephone to Glory, which was one of the songs that we sang at my wedding. I am not saying I have an identification with Lionel because of that, but I am saying that it has been interesting and fascinating to hear the members of parliament in this place speak on Lionel Rose in the way they have today.


If this nation ever thinks that members of parliament do not care about our families, our Indigenous communities and all that goes with them, today is a perfect example of it being wrong. When tears were shed here today we all entered into that moment with the member for Bass. He said, 'I do not want to disgrace myself any more over this issue.' He was not disgracing himself. There was not a person here who was not standing with him. Vale, Lionel Rose.


I am sorry that he suffered after his stroke, but I want to let you all know that what I saw in that room was not just a hero but a family gathered around an ordinary man in protection, in care and in honour. He could go back to his community near Jacksons Track to live and say, 'I am very comfortable,' as he said to Kathy Bedford. He said, 'I am back with my family and I am very happy. I am living life well.'


His cousin, who was the chairman of the Boxing Federation, was interviewed by ABC Radio the other day. He said, 'He was never on time, so to get him to the footy on time we would always tell him that the football was two hours earlier, and then we would get him there.' He loved being there at the footy with his family, watching his family play. Even with his great talent and ability, his family's love of him was for his ordinariness—for his love of community, for his love of his family and just for the fact that he was nestled in their arms before he died.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (16:48):  It is a great honour to rise to speak in recognition of Lionel Rose and to do so after the members for Hasluck and McMillan. I say that because they both, in their own way, represent a part of this story. The member for McMillan represents the area in which the great Lionel Rose grew up. It was not a privileged background, as has been well set out. It was a tough, hard background, but he was an Australian who took an extraordinary journey. In my view, the definition of what we in this House seek to achieve for people is the opportunity to live the life of their choice. The title of a book by the great British explorer in the Danakil area of the Horn of Africa, Wilfred Thesiger, was The Life of My Choice. If that is what we aspire to bring in some small measure to Australia, Lionel Rose was the embodiment of that life. He came from the most humble of beginnings in the Gippsland area, an area adjacent to my own electorate. I know that on the Mornington Peninsula and in West Gippsland this is somebody they looked to as one of their own, and there was a great sense of affection many years—43 years—after he took on and beat Masahiko 'Fighting' Harada in Tokyo. He was looked upon as a local. He was looked upon as an Indigenous path maker and trailblazer. But above all else he was looked upon as an extraordinarily generous, decent and courageous human being.


So in our part of the world there is this great sense of affection, connection and gentle love for Lionel Rose which goes back to the fact that he was a local who came from a background which should not have led him to the world stage but which did, and he did it on his own terms and in his own way—a way which inspired generations of young Australians from all backgrounds. But on top of that he, along with Evonne Goolagong Cawley, also helped pave the way for Indigenous Australians to be held in a higher level of esteem and to give themselves that sense of the possibility that they could do anything in this country.


In that context we have somebody who was an inspiration to young locals in Gippsland and the Mornington Peninsula of Victoria and, more generally, Australia; a particular inspiration to Indigenous Australians; but, above all else—and this is where I want to finish in this very brief recognition and tribute—an exemplar to all of us of a life well lived. At end of day there is no doubt he was able to look back and, with family and friends around him and with his own set of achievements—yes, there was hardship at the start; yes, it was hard along the way; and, yes, there was hardship at the finish—look at a life well lived, believing and knowing that he had lived the life of his choice and done so in a way which brought honour to him and to his family and brought joy to millions of Australians.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (16:52):  I also rise to support the condolence motion for the late Mr Lionel Rose, and I would like to associate myself with some of the comments of the previous speakers, including Mr Hunt and Mr Broadbent, whom I have just listened to here. I am sorry I did not get to hear some of the earlier speakers as well; I understand they also gave very moving and honourable tributes to this great man.


Lionel Rose, as we all know, passed away last Sunday. He was a world champion sportsman, he was an Indigenous superstar and he was a great Australian. Of course, he is remembered primarily today by most Australians for being the first world champion boxer for Australia, and he won that title way back in 1968 in Tokyo, coming up against the world bantamweight champion at the time, Masahiko Harada. Lionel was just 19 years old when he took that fight on. He was the underdog. Few thought he would be able to win that fight against the world champion, but history showed that he did; and, in doing so, he changed sporting history in Australia forever. He also made an incredible contribution more broadly than that.


Today, when we think about our Indigenous sporting superstars and other Indigenous role models, we have many. We of course have dozens of AFL footballers who dominate the football field. We have had people like Evonne Goolagong Cawley. We have had Cathy Freeman. We have had Nova Peris-Kneebone, Wendell Sailor and the like. We have had other outstanding Indigenous role models reach the peak of our community, including the member for Hasluck here, who is a fellow parliamentarian. But back in 1968, when Lionel Rose became the world champion boxer, we did not have such circumstances. He was the first real Indigenous superstar and real Indigenous hero. Of course, he won this only a year after the referendum on Indigenous affairs. It was a unique time in Australian political history in regard to Indigenous issues, as the referendum was passed a year earlier with 90 per cent approval of the particular measure which gave the Commonwealth power to enact laws to the benefit of Indigenous people in Australia. His win came a year after that and, in doing so, gave Indigenous Australians, from what I have read, a huge confidence boost. As I mentioned, he became Australia's first Indigenous superstar.


It is interesting to note, when we reflect on his victory at that time, that the history books say it was not just Indigenous Australians who were celebrating like crazy over this incredible victory; indeed, there were 100,000 everyday Australians on the streets of Melbourne who gave him a tickertape parade when he returned. In some respects it was a remarkable act of reconciliation, without it being called that at the time. All Australians probably thought, 'We're just proud of this guy, who's a fantastic Aussie hero.' I think that is worth reflecting on as well.


He inspired all of us at the time with his sporting prowess and certainly inspired Indigenous Australians. Sadly, his victory did not mark a turning point in addressing Indigenous social and economic disadvantage. Indeed, in part the opposite is the case when we look back at some of the great social decline in Indigenous communities, particularly remote Indigenous communities, that started in about the late sixties and early to mid-seventies. While we are reflecting upon Lionel Rose today we should also be thinking about the disadvantage which still exists in Indigenous communities. Through Lionel Rose's memory we should commit to maintaining on the political agenda of this parliament the alleviation of disadvantage in Indigenous communities.


Lionel Rose was not just a great sports star but also, as other people have noted in this chamber, a very principled man. The Australian, in its editorial yesterday, pointed out that 'Rose took pride in refusing a lucrative offer to fight in apartheid-ridden South Africa in 1970, where he would have been classed as an honorary white'. Also, in 1996, he generously gave his world title belt to six-year-old Tjandamurra O'Shane, who was the victim of a racially charged attack in Cairns, in the hope that it would hasten the child's recovery. All accounts are that he was a truly honourable man, a family man, a well-loved man and a principled man. We will remember Lionel Rose for all of that and more and we will remember him as an Australian hero.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (16:59):  I rise to speak on the condolence motion for Mr Claude Choules and to pass on my sympathy and support to his extensive family. Along with many others, I was saddened to hear of the passing of Mr Choules on 4 May 2011, aged 110—the last of our World War I combat veterans. Mr Choules's passing brings to a significant end Australia's and the world's last living connection to World War I and closes another chapter in world history. I note that Mr Choules served in the British Royal Navy during World War I, having joined at the age of 14, and I understand that he witnessed the scuttling of the German fleet in 1919. He also served with the Royal Australian Navy during World War II. So he has service in both World War I and World War II.


It is extraordinary to think that 70 million people served in World War I, with millions of these paying the ultimate sacrifice for their country. More than 750,000 Australians served during World War I, with 155,000 wounded and 64,000 losing their lives.


Reading about Mr Choules's life, I was reminded of my own family. Some of the history of Mr Choules's life is contained in his book which is titled The Last of the Last. I understand that Mr Choules started writing this book when he was in his 80s, with the support of his daughters, and that the book was subsequently published in 2009, when Mr Choules was 108. My great-grandfather, William Glanville, and Mr Choules both served in the British Royal Navy in World War I. My grandfather, William Henry Glanville, and Mr Choules both served in the Royal Australian Navy in World War II. My father, William Weir, also served in World War II but with the RAAF. Fortunately, they, like Mr Choules, returned home safely to their relatives and friends. Our veterans fought for our country so that Australia and the world could be free from oppression and violence. Mr Choules's 20 years of dedication to the defence of this nation is a shining reflection of the loyalty and selflessness demonstrated and embraced by Australia's veterans.


The McPherson electorate has an extensive veteran community, with the Burleigh Heads, Currumbin Palm Beach, Mudgeeraba and Tweed Heads and Coolangatta RSL sub-branches providing support to the McPherson veteran community. I know that they share my sorrow in Mr Choules's passing. Mr Choules can be assured that he has left behind a community that embraces our ANZACs. This has been demonstrated at recent Anzac Day services across the country. Attendance at our Gold Coast Anzac services is continuing to increase year by year. I understand that in excess of 10,000 people attended the dawn service conducted by the Currumbin Palm Beach RSL sub-branch, which was held at Elephant Rock on Currumbin Beach. That service was also telecast live throughout Australia.


Mr Choules is survived not only by his extensive family but also by a grateful nation, who will forever remember the sacrifices diggers like him made for Australia during the world wars. As a federal member of parliament, as the daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter of World War I and World War II veterans, and as an Australian, I am tremendously proud of the legacy Mr Choules and other veterans like him have left. Lest we forget.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (17:04):  I join with other members in marking the death and honouring the life of Claude Stanley Choules, who was the last living combat veteran from World War I. In doing so, I endorse the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and those of my parliamentary colleagues. If there is a theme to all our contributions it is, understandably, that of remembrance. It is a fact of life that time marches ever forward and it is a part of the human condition that successive generations constitute the links we have between the present day and our history. Claude Choules was the last living contact we had with the combat experience of World War I. On hearing of Claude's death, my thoughts turned to my grandfather, who served in the Middle East in World War One and in the Pacific in World War II. Jesse Lilburn 'Pat' Parke fudged his age upwards to be involved in the First World War, and downwards for the Second World War. He died of health problems related to his war service, before I was born. I am sure it is the case for many Australians that the passing of Claude Choules resonates strongly with their memory of relatives who were directly involved in World War I. 


As long as Claude lived, a human connection remained to that time, a human connection remained to the history that also involved our grandfathers and great-uncles. Now that thread has been severed and we will have to make a greater effort as time passes so that we continue to remember, so that children born this week, whose lives never intersected with Claude Choules, will nevertheless come to learn and understand the horrors of war and the incredible suffering and sacrifices made by Australians in the cause of peace.


In this context I note that we will shortly mark the centenary of Anzac, which I am sure will provide a significant opportunity for us to remember as a nation and to strengthen our capacity to remember. I am aware, for example, of an effort underway to have added to the war memorial in Fremantle a set of plaques that record the more than 800 local men who lost their lives in World War I. It is a project that I wholeheartedly support.


I would like to note that Claude Choules has a special connection to Fremantle, for there was a time when Fremantle was both his home and to some extent his responsibility. Claude settled in Fremantle between the wars, and in World War II as a naval chief petty officer was apparently charged with the responsibility of rigging vessels in Fremantle harbour so that they could be blown up in the case of invasion. Thankfully, it never came to that. Of course, it never came to that because of the efforts of service personnel like Claude Choules, because of the military and civilian fortitude of tens of millions across the allied nations. 


After the Second World War, Claude became a cray fisherman, which was and continues to be a typical Fremantle profession. At 110, Claude Choules was the oldest Australian man and the seventh-oldest man alive, which is incredible. His life spanned a remarkable period of history, including the two most awful conflicts the human race has inflicted on itself. Claude's wife of more than 75 years, Ethel, a nurse, who he met on the ship out to Australia, died when she was 98. Claude cared for her until the end, sleeping on a canvas sheet on the floor by her bed. He is survived by three children, 11 grandchildren, 22 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren. Our best wishes and condolences go out to all of them, and I will be honoured to convey these sentiments to Claude's family at his funeral service, which is to be held next Friday, 20 May, at St Johns Anglican Church in Fremantle. 


On hearing the news of Claude's death, I called and spoke with Claude's daughter, Anne Pow, who lives in Palmyra in my electorate. Anne made the point to me that Claude hated war and the glorification of war. With all his personal experience, Claude Choules believed that war was pointless; and, as much as he was and is a symbol of remembrance, we should not whitewash the fact that he personally did not like to dwell on the wars. As I understand it, he only marched in Anzac parades when he was ordered to.


Anne wanted to impress on me the fact that her dad was a remarkably happy man. I think that is a quality that comes through even in the photographs that accompany the newspaper stories of his death. I like to think that one of the secrets of his long life was his happiness. He was also clearly a loving and good humoured man and a man devoted to his family. Those are the qualities I believe he would have most wanted to be remembered for.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (17:08):  I rise today to support the motion by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Fremantle and I have something in common: Claude was living in the electorate of Swan when he passed away but he also, as the member for Fremantle said, spent time living in the Fremantle electorate.


Claude was the last surviving combat male from World War I. He lived in WA in the electorate of Swan at the Gracewood hostel in Salter Point. For those who do not know Salter Point, it is a peaceful area along the Swan River, and I am sure it would have been a great and peaceful place for him to spend his last days. I know the staff of Gracewood will be missing him, as will his family and all those who knew him.


In my small way, on behalf of the people of the electorate of Swan, I wish to pass on my condolences to Claude's family. Claude did not like war and he saw it as his job so he did what he had to do. He was typical of many veterans who do not glorify war, but at the same time he was a symbol of the men and women of the Allies who fought to preserve our way of life and the many freedoms and rights we enjoy as a society. He along with his fellow Allied force members, whether they be men or women, were prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for their countries. We have recently held Anzac ceremonies all over Australia and other parts of the world to recognise the fallen members of Claude's troop and Allied forces in conflicts around the world, but particularly the ones Australian and New Zealand forces fought in. People like Claude are symbols and reminders to us of these valiant men and women.


I have taken some details from the Sydney Morning Herald article by Gerry Carman, which gives us an insight into the man who was referred to as 'the last of the last':


As a centenarian, he retained a sense of humour, insisting a laugh was good for the senses and the soul. Asked the secret of his longevity, he responded: ''Don't die.''


He was also the oldest man living in Australia when he died.


Towards the end, a degenerative eye disorder, exacerbated by a fall, meant Choules relied on touch. But overall, he appeared to be in remarkably good health.


His daughter, Anne Pow, attributed his long life to his overall fitness, healthy lifestyle and a happy, contented disposition that allowed him to eat and sleep well to the end.


He didn't own a car until he was 50 and rode a bicycle everywhere. And, his wife, Ethel, a children's nurse, ensured the family always had a healthy, balanced diet long before modern health fads took hold.


Claude Stanley Choules, who held dual British and Australian nationality, was born on March 3, 1901, at Wyre Piddle, Pershore, in Worcestershire, one of five children of Madelin and Henry, a haberdasher and gambler. His mother abandoned the family when he was a young child - for many years he thought she had died - and his older brothers were sent to different family homes while his father raised him and his sisters, Phyllis and Gwen. This would later shape his make-up as a considerate, conscientious and attentive father, polite to all.


Choules dropped out of school at 14 and fibbed about his age to join the navy in 1915. The previous year he had tried to join the army as a bugle boy when he learnt that his brothers, Douglas and Leslie, were serving in the British Army. Both had fought at Gallipoli before going on to fight on the Western Front in France, where Douglas was gassed and died a year later and Leslie won the Military Medal for bravery.


After initial training on HMS Impregnable, at one time a 140-gun square-rigged wooden battleship, Choules served in the North Sea on HMS Revenge, flagship of the Royal Navy's first battle squadron.


He witnessed two historic events at the end of the Great War: the surrender of the Imperial German Navy at the Firth of Forth off Scotland's east coast, on November 21, 1918, 10 days after the armistice; and he was present at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands on June 21, 1919, when German admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered his interned fleet to be scuttled. Preventive action limited the scuttling to 52 of the 74 ships.


Between 1920 and 1923, Choules served in the Mediterranean before being seconded with 11 other Royal Navy personnel to come to Australia in 1926 on loan to the RAN as an instructor at Flinders Naval Depot on the Mornington Peninsula.


On the way to Australia, on the passenger ship SS Diogenes, Choules met Ethel Wildgoose, a Scot on her way to Melbourne, and they married not long after.


Choules asked for a permanent transfer to the RAN. He returned to Britain for courses to qualify as a chief torpedo and anti-submarine instructor and he was also on duty for the construction of the RAN's heavy cruisers, Australia and Canberra. He was part of the commissioning crew of HMAS Canberra, in which he served until 1931.


Choules took his discharge from the RAN that year but remained in the reserve; he rejoined the RAN the following year as a torpedo and anti-submarine instructor, with the rank of chief petty officer. During World War II, he served as the RAN's senior demolition expert in Western Australia. Early in the war, he disposed of the first German mine to wash up on Australia's shores, near Esperance in Western Australia. During the dark days of 1942, he set explosives to blow up oil tanks and placed depth charges in ships unable to leave Fremantle Harbour in anticipation of a Japanese landing.


Had the Japanese invaded, he would also have had to ride a bicycle about 500 kilometres south to Albany to blow up harbour facilities there.


He remained in the RAN after the war and transferred to the Naval Dockyard Police, which enabled him to stay in the service until 1956, five years longer than regulations allowed for RAN ratings, who had to retire at 50.


But Choules was not done with the sea. He bought a crayfish boat and spent 10 years fishing with Ethel. He also shot rabbits and culled kangaroos - until he saw the film Bambi.


Despite his military record, Choules became a pacifist. He was known to have disagreed with the celebration of Australia's most important war memorial holiday, Anzac Day, and refused to march in annual commemoration parades.


An excellent ballroom dancer, he had pumps made for his whirls across the dance floor doing the foxtrot, which he taught his daughters and grandchildren. He also loved to play the mouth organ; not surprisingly, his favourite tunes were seas shanties, including What Shall We Do with a Drunken Sailor?


Ethel Choules died in 2006, aged 98, and Claude spent his last years at the Gracewood Hostel at Salter Point in Perth.


His death follows that of American Frank Buckles, who died in February, also aged 110, and who, until then, had been the oldest surviving veteran of World War I. He'd been an ambulance driver near the Western Front. … Claude Choules is survived by his children, Daphne, Anne and Adrian, 13 grandchildren, 26 great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren.


Claude Choules was a symbol of those before our time and our generation who gave to their country—did not ask what they could take from their country but were prepared to give to their country. A lot of us should remember those qualities and those character traits as we go about our daily lives and see what we can give to this country in memory of people like Claude Choules, to celebrate his contribution to Britain and to Australia.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (17:16):  I rise to express my condolences on the passing of Mr Claude Choules. On Thursday, 5 May 2011 Mr Claude Choules, the last-known veteran to have served in World War I, passed away. While he spent his later life here in Australia and fought for Australia in World War II, it is Mr Choules's connection as a British serviceman to the First World War that I wish to reflect on here today.


As a teacher, I have had the opportunity to teach and learn about the war, so often called the Great War. So extreme the loss of life, so long the conflict, so broad the impact, it was a war that our forebears hoped would be the war to end all wars. Claude Choules was there in the fray as a serviceman in the British Royal Navy. He lived a life, as did his peers, impacted by the realities of that long and tragic conflict. But, while Mr Choules's passing marks the end of that historical period and our connection with World War I, it is important in my view to honour his passing by placing on the record in this place that he and those who served alongside him will not be forgotten.


Recently, students from my electorate of Robertson undertook an excursion to Villers-Bretonneux and assisted with the Anzac Day service there. They were supported and encouraged in this excursion by Roger Macey, who continues the tradition established by Mr Paul Salmon and his fellow history staff, and obviously very much encouraged by their school principal. I understand that all present at the service were described on the day as 'pilgrims', reinforcing the sense and depth of esteem held for those who served and died, or survived, on Flanders Fields.


I offer my condolences and those of the people of the seat of Robertson to the Choules family at this time of great personal loss. I also offer them some comfort at this time in the observation of two young Aussies, Emily Rayner and George Margin, the school captains of Brisbane Water Secondary College, who were at Villers-Bretonneux this Anzac Day. They both reported back to their school and gave a speech to the gathered assembly. Emily Rayner had the following to say:


As young Australians it became incredibly emotional for us to experience first hand the physical and spiritual presence they left behind … those graves are ultimately a profound and visual statement depicting the sacrifice that each and every one of them gave for us.'


George Margin, the boy school captain, responded to an epitaph that he read on the grave of an Australian soldier by the name of Philip Ball who died on the Western Front. The epitaph simply said, 'I fought and died in the Great War; did I die in vain?' George's response is:


Philip Ball and all the thousands of other Australians, I say to you: You did not die in vain. We made this pilgrimage to honour your sacrifice. We will never forget.


Claude Choules, the last of the last, we will remember you. We honour your service and your life. We will never forget you.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2011-05-11,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (17:19):  It is appropriate today that we reflect as a House on the passing away of Claude Choules, who died at the age of 110 in Perth in a nursing home. It is appropriate that we take this opportunity to pause at this juncture to reflect not just on his personal iconic qualities that have been so ably outlined by my colleagues here today but also on the fact that he was the last known combat veteran of World War I, the war that was to end all wars. When you reflect upon the life of Claude Choules, here was a man who signed up at the age of just 14 years of age in the Royal Navy and who served on famous ships, like the HMAS Impregnable and the HMAS Revenge; who was a commissioning crewmember of the HMAS Canberra before World War II and who served with her until 1931; who served in two world wars, the most famous conflicts of human history; and who was a person who rejected war as a means to an end, who never liked it and never commemorated it or regarded it as something that he would tolerate.


We are here today, because of the service and sacrifice of so many people like Claude, that great generation of Australians who volunteered to put themselves in harms way. I want to take a moment to reflect upon this conflict and Claude's contribution and the contributions of those Australians who did so much for us in World War I, because it is very important. Out of a population of just five million—a tiny component of the entire world—416,809 men enlisted in World War I. That goes to show what a great nation Australia truly is: in the cause of freedom, 416,809 people out of five million enlisted voluntarily to fight. That is the mark of the strength of a free society like Australia.


The citizen soldier is something that I believe in quite passionately. Every free nation, indeed, needs a citizen soldiery. When you look at the great Australian military tradition that has emerged since our nation's formation, the citizen soldier—the ordinary person who steps forward to volunteer their life for their family, for their friends and for their country—is the hallmark of greatness. There is no other nation or system that can replicate that quality of a person putting themselves into harm's way by their own choice. They do not ask what their country can do for them; they ask what they can do for their country. Every free society that you look at has this. If you go back to Rome, republican Rome had the citizen soldier, and they conquered the known world. In Elizabethan England, privateers fought the Spanish and the closed markets. Minutemen in Boston in the United States of America were citizens who within minutes would take up a musket and fight the oppression of invaders who they regarded as taking over their country and their land.


In Australia, we had those 416,809 men out of five million—men like Sir John Monash, who at the beginning of the First World War was a citizen, a successful engineer. At the end, he commanded the Australian corps; he was Field Marshall Sir John Monash. He was laden with honours. He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George and Knight Commander of the Bath. He was mentioned in despatches five times. He was decorated by the French, Belgian and American governments. And he was an ordinary Australian, like those 416,809 men. They were ordinary Australians, not soldiers. They stepped up to save our country from oppression. It reminds me of that great story of the Australian who came back from World War I to be congratulated on being a great soldier. That unknown soldier gave an immortal retort: 'I am not a soldier; I am a farmer.'


That is why I am such a supporter of the citizen soldier and the reserve forces in our country today. That great Australian military tradition that has been passed down by men like Claude Choules through his life, his service and his belief that he should do something to make our country a better place. The life of Mr Choules spanned an incredible era of technological and other change. Yet that tradition of military service—that tradition of people doing something for other people, of stepping up to the plate and joining our Defence forces—carries forward. The service and sacrifice of those in the Australian Defence forces has a connection and a bond to those who have served our nation over a span of more than a century—indeed, the span of the life of Claude Choules. He would have been happy to see it. His generation nurtured and preserved a way of life that we embrace today. It is my hope in supporting this motion of the House today—and I commend the House for bringing forward such a motion—that we also let future generations be so privileged as to live under the same freedom and values of Australia through the dedication of the young people who are in uniform all around the world deployed on our behalf today. I want to thank Mr Choules and those 416,000 brave men of that great generation of people who stepped up to fight for the cause of freedom in our world. I endorse this motion before the House today.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:25):  The passing of Claude Choules is truly the end of an era. Mr Choules is The Last of the Last—the title of his autobiography. A significant chapter in world history ends with his passing. He was the last known living combat veteran of the Great War of 1914 to 1918 when he died in Perth on 5 May, aged 110. His death follows that of American Frank Buckles, who died in February, also aged 110, and who until then had been the oldest surviving veteran of World War I. Claude Choules was also the last surviving sailor of World War I and served in both the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. In fact, he was only two days younger than the RAN, which was established on 1 March 1901.


In 1914, after hearing that his two older brothers, Douglas and Leslie, were serving in the British Army, Mr Choules tried to join as a bugle boy. However, a year later, at the age of 14, he fibbed about his age and joined the Royal Navy and served in the North Sea on the HMS Revenge, the flagship of the Royal Navy's first battle squadron.


Claude Choules witnessed two historic events at the end of the Great War: the surrender of the imperial German navy at the Firth of Forth off Scotland's east coast on 21 November 1918, 10 days after the Armistice; and he was present at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands on 21 June 1919 when German Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered his interned fleet to be scuttled. During World War II, Claude Choules was acting torpedo officer of the HMAS Fremantle and served in the RAN until 1956.


The knowledge and memories this gentleman possessed are beyond our comprehension; the changes and momentous occasions in world history he saw, experienced and felt is staggering. With his passing an historic curtain is sadly drawn. Although he scorned the glorification of war, Claude Choules was a fine example of the men and women who served and who serve so bravely for us—the price of freedom being eternal vigilance. He is an example of the servicemen who fight for peace and stability for Australia and who ensure that democracy prevails.


As the member for Riverina, whose hometown of Wagga Wagga is also home to the soldier, with the important strategic and training bases of both the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy, the death of a serviceman has always been felt deeply no matter the age. The selfless sacrifice and courageous commitment made by men such as Claude Choules ensures the spirit which exists within every person who wears a military uniform continues to burn brightly. I offer my sincere condolences to his very extensive family. Mr Claude Stanley Choules—lest we forget.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2011-05-11,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (17:52):  The coalition will not be opposing the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill. Like all tax law amendment bills, this makes a number of changes to the tax law and the administration of tax. It does so in this case through five schedules, all essentially unrelated. I will run through each of them briefly. Schedule 1 adds some deductible gift recipients to the existing schedule—namely, the Charlie Perkins Trust for children and students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. It adds those to the relevant list allowing donations over $2 to be tax deductible and thereby encouraging public support for charitable activities.


The second schedule deals with some changes with respect to self-managed superannuation funds. The provision in this schedule will allow the government, through regulation, to impose rules on self-managed superannuation fund investments in personal use assets, such as collectables and artworks amongst a number of other things identified. Members would be aware that the sole purpose test of the relevant superannuation act requires that assets of a superannuation fund be held for the sole purpose of generating retirement income. The recent Cooper Review, the review of the entire superannuation system, recommended that self-managed superannuation funds be prohibited from investing in personal use assets and that those assets, to the extent that they existed within those funds, should be disposed of within five years. The review found that personal use assets lent themselves to personal enjoyment and therefore failed that sole purpose test that I just outlined. The government announced back in July last year that it did not support those conclusions of the Cooper review but said that it would tighten the requirements around personal use assets rather than take up the recommendation to prohibit them. That is what this schedule seeks to do—to provide the government with the power of regulation to impose rules relating to investment of personal use assets by self-managed superannuation funds.


The Assistant Treasurer, the member for Maribyrnong, outlined in his second reading speech back on 24 March the government's intentions in this regard when he said that the amendments would allow regulations to make rules relating to how self-managed superannuation fund trustees make, hold and realise investments in collectables and personal use assets. He said that the purpose of the rules would be to ensure that these investments are made for retirement income purposes and not for current day benefit. He further advised that the content of those regulations is being developed in consultation with the industry. We believe that this reflects a sensible balance. We understand that it is supported by the Self-Managed Super Fund Professionals Association of Australia.


The third schedule deals with tax file numbers with respect to locating superannuation accounts in order to facilitate consolidation of those accounts. It allows super fund trustees and retirement savings account holders to use tax file numbers to locate accounts and facilitate consolidation of multiple accounts. At the present point in time, there are some restrictions on the ways that super funds can use tax file numbers. In particular, they are not permitted to use tax file numbers to locate accounts for the purposes of the very consolidation that this schedule deals with. This will not replace account or membership numbers, but will simply remove the requirement that super funds use other methods for searching for multiple funds before using tax file numbers. Apparently, individuals can still choose not to give their tax file number. There are not changes to the consequences for failing to do so. We agree on this side of the House that it is important to maximise individual retirement savings and for small accounts to be consolidated as easily and as quickly as possible.


The fourth schedule deals with the goods and services tax and specifically the issue of the determination of Australian taxes, fees and charges with respect to the goods and services tax. Currently, the federal Treasurer determines by legislative instrument those Australian taxes, fees and charges that are not regarded as consideration for a taxable supply and therefore not subject to GST. That determination is an administrative process involving the Ministerial Council for Federal Financial Relations and the formal agreement of state and territory treasurers. The instrument is updated twice yearly and over the now more than 10 years of the operation of the goods and services tax it has grown, I am advised, to over 600 pages. The government's view is that this is becoming a significant administrative burden on all levels of government. The amendment means that the default position will be that Australian taxes, fees and charges are not subject to GST and therefore will not need to be listed. Regulation may be made to treat the payment of an Australian tax, fee or charge as consideration for supply and therefore as subject to the goods and services tax. On the subject of goods and services tax, my friend opposite would think it remiss of me not to remind the House that I always welcome in tax law amendment bills schedules that consolidate and protect the goods and services tax which this side of the House fought so hard to implement and those opposite fought so hard to prevent coming into existence. Now that they are in government, perhaps they realise the errors of their ways, and it is good to see them preserving and protecting the goods and services tax which their former leader and former Prime Minister said on the day of its introduction would be marked down 100 years from now as 'a day of fundamental injustice'. I had been unfair in the past that no-one would remember Fundamental Injustice Day declared by the member for Griffith back in 1999, when the legislation for the goods and services tax passed through the House. I think in the years from now he will remember Fundamental Injustice Day, but it will not be the day that the goods and services tax passed through the House; it will be 24 June 2010.


Schedule 5, the final schedule, as is often the case with these tax law amendment bills, simply makes a range of corrections, additions and the sorts of changes and improvements you would expect to see in taxation law. We do not oppose this bill, and I commend it to the House.

"Thomson, Craig, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Mr CRAIG THOMSON
 (Dobell) (18:01):  It is always good to hear members of the opposition talking about their past record as the highest taxing government in Australia's history, and it is great that the member for Casey took the opportunity to remind us again. He should not be so modest, though: it was not one year that they were the highest taxing government in history; they held the record for four years in a row. It is a terrific record, and we love the way you always come out to remind the Australian public. We love the way that you remind them that your government was the highest taxing government in Australia's history and it has been this government that has gone about reforming tax to make sure that ordinary Australians are not slugged to the extent that they were when those on the other side had the Treasury benches.


I am not sure that I would necessarily be making the boast about being the highest taxing government in history, but that is something the member for Casey obviously likes to remind us about on many occasions—and I encourage him to continue to remind us about the former government's record in relation to tax!




Ms Owens:
  My pensioners remind me.




Mr CRAIG THOMSON:
  As the member for Parramatta points out, we are constantly reminded by our constituents, particularly those on fixed incomes or those on pensions, of the high-taxing history of the former government.


I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill 2011. It has a number of schedules, and I will go through each of those schedules to look at what they are actually proposing. The first schedule is about deductible gift recipients. Under the current law taxpayers can claim income tax deductions for certain gifts to organisations with DGR status. Division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 sets out the requirements for organisations to be granted DGR status. Organisations must either fit one of the general categories of DGR or be specifically listed under these provisions. This schedule lists the Charlie Perkins Trust for Children and Students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. It also changes the name of one deductible gift recipient from Guides Australia Inc. to Girl Guides Australia.


The Charlie Perkins Trust was established in late 2002 in memory of the late Dr Charles Perkins AO. The trust's aim is to advance the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders through the provision of scholarships to Indigenous persons for study at overseas institutions such as Oxford and Cambridge University. The Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation was established in 1990 and works to advance the education and life opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and provide additional assistance, such as assisting with the cost of relocating families and partners, to female Indigenous scholars undertaking programs overseas. Listing the Charlie Perkins Trust for Children and Students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation means that the organisations will be in a significantly better position to attract private and corporate donors, and to raise funds for their ongoing work supporting Indigenous Australians to undertake higher education at prestigious overseas universities such as Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard.


Schedule 2 is in relation to self-managed superannuation fund investments in collectables and personal use assets. This measure will allow implementation of the government's election commitment to tighten legislative restrictions on self-managed superannuation funds, investments and collectables and personal use assets. The Super System Review recommended that SMSF investments in collectables and personal use assets should be prohibited because these assets lend themselves to personal enjoyment and therefore can involve current day benefits being derived by those using or accessing these assets. This recommendation was restricted to SMSF investments because of the closely held nature of SMSFs, where members have direct control over the investment of their retirement savings.


In response to criticisms of the recommendation by SMSF and art industry representatives, the government rejected this recommendation in recognition that collectables can be legitimate investments for some SMSF trustees. However, the government also announced that it would tighten the legislative standards applying to SMSF investment in collectables and personal use assets to ensure that such investments do not give rise to current day benefits for SMSF trustees. The legislative standards that will apply to SMSF investment in collectables and personal use assets are being developed in consultation with the industry, and will be set out in regulations. These measures will enable those regulations to be made. This measure also removes a reference to the provision that was repealed on 24 September 2007.


These amendments will allow implementation of the government's election promise to tighten legislative restrictions on self-managed superannuation fund investments in collectables and personal use assets to ensure that they do not give rise to current day benefits. It will give authority for regulations to make rules in relation to how these investments are made, held and realised. It will also give the regulations authority to impose a penalty of not more than 10 penalty units for contraventions of the regulations, and to provide for the transitional period of existing investments held prior to 1 July 2011. The regulations being developed in consultation with industry will be released for public consultation prior to being finalised. These amendments, as I have also said, remove reference to a provision that was repealed on 24 September 2007.


Schedule 3 relates to superannuation tax file number amendments. Schedule 3 makes a number of amendments which will improve the operation of the superannuation industry. It allows superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers to use tax file numbers to locate members' accounts without first having to use other methods of identification, and will facilitate account consolidation. The new law will allow superannuation fund trustees and RSA providers to use tax file numbers to locate a member's account details. However, the law will not allow the fund to use tax file numbers to replace their existing account numbers. The aim of the law is to remove the impediment for funds to use other search methods before tax file numbers are used. It will not replace existing account identification methods, such as account or membership numbers. This ensures that the amendment operates in accordance with the National Privacy Principle 7: that tax file numbers should not become a national identifier. The amendments will also allow superannuation fund trustees and RSA providers to use tax file numbers to facilitate the consolidation of multi-accounts held by the same person in the same superannuation fund and across multiple superannuation funds, provided the requirements of the regulations are met.


These amendments will improve the administrative efficiency of the superannuation industry, and make it easier for superannuation fund trustees and retirement saving account providers to locate member accounts and to facilitate account consolidation. These amendments will be subject to appropriate privacy safeguards. In keeping with the current guidelines governing the use of tax file numbers, it will remain voluntary for individuals to provide their tax file number to their superannuation fund or to their RSA provider.


The measure is part of the government's package of stronger super reforms, which were announced on 16 December 2010. Allowing for the greater use of tax file numbers is the first of a number of initiatives from the package that will improve the administrative efficiency of the superannuation industry. Regulations will be enacted to support the use of tax file numbers and to facilitate the account consolidation process. This will include requirements for member consent and other procedures and processes that superannuation fund trustees and RSA providers must follow before consolidating accounts. These regulations will, again, be developed in consultation with the industry. Schedule 4 exempts Australian taxes, fees and charges from the goods and services tax. Currently, Australian taxes, fees and charges are exempt from GST by being listed in a determination made by the Treasurer under division 81 of the GST act and agreed to by the states and territories. The determination has grown to over 680 pages, and its compilation is a cumbersome and time-consuming process. The schedule will repeal and replace division 81 of the GST act to allow entities to self-assess the GST treatment of a payment of an Australian tax or an Australian fee or charge in accordance with certain principles. Under these amendments, government entities will no longer need to have an Australian tax or certain categories of Australian fees or charges listed on the determination in order for those taxes, fees or charges not to be subject to GST. The amendments will amend the GST law to replace the current mechanism for exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges with a legislative exemption with effect from 1 July 2011. Generally, the measure will provide the same outcome as the current mechanism but in a more efficient manner. This measure will provide increased certainty to taxpayers and government agencies in relation to the GST treatment of new taxes, fees and charges, as the tax treatment is not dependent on the item being listed in the determination. A legislative exemption will provide a more effective and transparent approach to exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges from the GST compared to the current exemption mechanism.


Schedule 5 relates to the 12-month export period for the GST-free supply of boats. The legislation provides that the supply of a new recreational boat will be GST free if the boat is exported from Australia within 12 months of delivery or certain other events in the case of payment by instalment. This is subject to certain conditions. There are two main sets of conditions: conditions relating to the nature of the boat—the boat must be a new recreational boat—and the boat must not be used in any form of disqualifying activity, with certain exemptions. Under the conditions for a new recreational boat, essentially the boat must be constructed in Australia; not be a substantially reconstructed boat; not used, sold or leased since completion, except in connection with the supply or acquisition of the boat as trading stock, or in connection with the particular supply or acquisition by the purchaser under consideration; be principally designed or fitted out for recreational purposes and not be a commercial boat. The first two conditions essentially ensure the boat is a new boat; the last two conditions ensure the boat is a recreational type boat. Under the disqualifying use conditions, the boat cannot be used as security for a loan except a loan to buy the boat itself. It cannot be used to carry on an enterprise in Australia. It cannot be used to carry on an enterprise outside Australia, except for private or domestic purposes or for a private recreational pursuit or hobby. The former exemption may embrace the latter exemption, which has been added out of caution.


Essentially, an overseas business may buy a new recreational boat in Australia and allow its employees to sail around Australia in the boat, or live in it while it is moored somewhere for 12 months and for consideration except where the employee of an overseas business is allowed to sail or live on the boat as above, or the boat is used to compete in a race or sporting event. Essentially, these conditions are designed to use the boat for commercial purposes or financial gain while in Australia. The actual supply of the boat by the supplier to the purchaser relates to the carrying on of an enterprise, but is not a disqualifying activity. The commissioner has the discretion to extend the 12-month export period as he does under the existing 60-day export period for a GST-free supply.


An exemption from disqualifying use has been provided to the use of the boat in a private capacity by the purchaser to participate in a racing or sporting event. This is in recognition that Australia is home to world-class sporting events including boats, such as yacht races and waterski events, and that participation in such events with a new boat built for Australian conditions could encourage some purchasers—in particular, foreign purchasers—to buy a new boat in Australia.


The measure was not implemented via a refund system, as proposed by several submissions, for administrative and legal reasons. A refund system would relieve the supplier of any further GST obligations after he paid the GST to the government. However, a mechanism was not available within existing resources to pay refunds of this nature. Further, these submissions suggested that a control permit be deemed to have been granted to the purchaser immediately after the boat was purchased and the supplier forwarded the GST. This would have been a necessary component for the use of a refund system to implement the measure. However, to grant and control permits in this way would have required more complex legislative changes than in this bill, and this would have delayed considerably legislation to implement the measure. Schedule 6 is in relation to other amendments. Schedule 6 makes various other amendments to the taxation laws. The amendments seek to ensure that taxation operates as intended by correcting technical or drafting defects. It is essentially a technical schedule.


While this may not be the most exciting piece of legislation, it is nonetheless an important piece of legislation. It is part of this government's ongoing reform in relation to taxation generally. It is part of making sure that business in Australia is simpler and more streamlined. For those reasons it is important that this legislation be supported. I commend the bill to the House.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (18:15):  I am very pleased to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill 2011. It is very satisfying to speak on bills such as this one because they reinforce some very responsive and progressive reforms that this government is pursuing. I thank the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation for his commitment to creating a better future for all Australians. This bill demonstrates the commitment of the government to fulfilling its election promise of increasing the level of education for Indigenous Australians. This bill also takes steps towards fulfilling the government's election commitment to the creation of a stronger and fairer superannuation industry. Both measures are an investment in the future, the former by assisting Indigenous Australians to achieve educational equality and the latter by ensuring the provision of a comfortable retirement for all Australians, including many in my electorate of Greenway.


This bill does a number of important things and I would like to focus on three of them. The bill grants deductible gift recipient, or DGR, status to two educational trusts designed to support Indigenous education. It enables the regulation of investments by trustees of self-managed superannuation funds to ensure that there is no misuse of superannuation assets and it allows the use of tax file numbers by trustees of superannuation funds and retirement savings account providers to locate and consolidate member accounts. These important measures will result in a better future for all Australians by increasing the level of Indigenous education and by providing a comfortable retirement for working Australians.


Schedule 1 of the bill adds two organisations to the list of DGR recipients. These two organisations are the Charlie Perkins Trust, for children and students, and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. The Charlie Perkins Trust was established in 2002 in memory of the late Dr Charlie Perkins AO. Dr Perkins was an inspiration to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians alike. In a life full of achievements, Dr Perkins was responsible for the organisation of the famous Freedom Ride, which exposed the discrimination suffered by Indigenous Australians, in 1965. He was the first Indigenous person to graduate from university, in 1966, and he was appointed to a number of influential roles, such as Commissioner of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, before being awarded the Order of Australia in 1987.


The Charlie Perkins Trust seeks to continue the inspiring work of Dr Perkins by providing for the advancement and education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The trust provides scholarships for overseas study at institutions such as Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard, which provide Indigenous students with the opportunity to access their unlimited potential and which will undoubtedly pay dividends to Australia in the future.


The second organisation is the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation, which was established in 1990. Dr Sykes was another inspirational Australian whose legacy will surely be long. Dr Sykes was a poet and author who was heavily involved in the Aboriginal land rights movement and who, among other roles, was the Executive Secretary of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in 1972. Among her many achievements, Dr Sykes was the first Indigenous Australian to attend an American university, receiving a PhD from Harvard. She was later awarded the Australian Human Rights Medal, in 1994, in recognition of her tireless campaigning for Aboriginal rights. The Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation also aims to advance the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and specifically provides additional assistance to female Indigenous scholars undertaking programs overseas, such as assisting with relocation costs for partners or family. 


By being specifically listed as DGRs, the Charlie Perkins Trust and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation will be in a significantly better position to attract private and corporate donors. The increased donations will allow these great organisations to help even more Indigenous Australians to reach their potential. I am very proud to support these measures which will provide such a tangible benefit to Indigenous Australians and the future of our country. It is a strong demonstration of the commitment of this government to the advancement of the education of Indigenous Australians. It is very important for my electorate of Greenway as the Blacktown local government area is home to the largest Indigenous population in New South Wales, something which is not very well known.


Another feature of the bill I would like to comment on is being implemented as part of the government's election commitment to a fairer, stronger and simpler superannuation system. With this measure the government lays the foundation to regulate SMSF investment in collectables and personal use assets. SMSFs account for 99 per cent of all superannuation funds in Australia, numbering approximately 430,000. They hold over 30 per cent of all superannuation assets and, in recent years, they have enjoyed an annualised growth rate of 20 per cent. These statistics are very real and they can be found in APRA's Annual Superannuation Bulletin, published on 19 January this year.


As a popular vehicle for superannuation management, which forms such a significant portion of the superannuation industry, it is vital that SMSFs maintain a high standard of governance. Indeed, one of the key messages from the Cooper review and the government's Stronger Super response relates to the importance of these high levels of governance amongst SMSFs. The bill implements measures which will ensure that SMSF trustees do not derive any current day benefits from investments in collectables and personal use assets. These new measures will ensure that SMSF assets cannot be misused by an SMSF trustee, for example, by 'collecting' and then driving high-end sports cars or  'investing' in expensive artwork which is then displayed in the trustee's home. The government recognises that investment in collectables and personal use assets can be a legitimate investment for some SMSF trustees. Accordingly, the measures implemented by this bill do not call for a blanket prohibition on SMSF investment in collectables and personal use assets.


The government is certainly aware that to completely prohibit such investments would unreasonably prejudice certain industries, such as the significant art industry in this country. Instead, in fulfilment of the government's election promise, the measures allow the investment in collectables and personal use assets to continue, but remove the ability of the SMSF trustee to derive any current day benefit from such investment. The bill does this by allowing the creation of specific regulations regarding collectables and personal use assets with which SMSF trustees will need to comply. The regulations can relate to the making, holding or realising of such investments, and may prescribe penalties for noncompliance. These new measures will ensure that, as the number of SMSFs grows, their standard of governance will remain high. In this way the government is fulfilling its election commitment to create a fairer, stronger and simpler superannuation system for the future.


The third measure under this bill I would like to discuss fulfils another election promise of this government. Under schedule 3 of the bill, the government proposes to amend legislation and grant to superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers the ability to use the TFNs of members to locate and consolidate the superannuation contributions of those members. This initiative is also consistent with the government's commitment to the creation of this fairer, stronger and simpler superannuation system.


This is an extremely important item. There is currently some $18.8 billion in lost superannuation in some 5.8 million lost superannuation accounts. While lost superannuation is still held on trust by the trustee of an eligible rollover fund, or in some cases the trustee of a superannuation fund, the lost super moneys are not being managed at the direction of the member for whose benefit they are held. It is vital that every Australian is able to enjoy a secure, comfortable retirement. Ensuring every working Australian is in full control of their superannuation is critical to achieving this outcome.


An efficient way of tracking down lost superannuation is by using the TFN of a fund member. However, while many account holders supply their TFNs to superannuation funds, it is actually against the law for trustees to use a TFN as the primary search method for lost accounts. This is a significant impediment to efficient administration of the superannuation industry. This new initiative will allow a trustee to locate and consolidate lost accounts using the TFNs of superannuation fund members without first needing to exhaust all other avenues. This will improve the administrative efficiency of the superannuation industry, which in turn will result in better returns to members.


It is also important to note that privacy safeguards will not be compromised by this initiative. It will remain voluntary for individuals to provide their TFN to their superannuation fund or retirement savings account provider, and TFNs will not replace account numbers as primary identifiers. These amendments are consistent with the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988, the National Privacy Principles contained in that act as well as the TFN Guidelines. To ensure that the account consolidation process is carried out in the most efficient way, regulations will again be developed in consultation with industry. Among other requirements, member consent will be required for the consolidation of accounts, and processes and procedures will be created which superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings providers must follow before beginning the consolidation process.


There are several benefits associated with this bill which I have sought to highlight. With the passage of this bill it is evident that many Australians will achieve a tangible benefit from these measures to be implemented. These actions are also a genuine reminder of this government's commitment to policy delivery and fulfilling its vision for the future of Australia. It is a great example of the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, and the people on this side more generally, listening to the needs of our constituents and responding to important policy issues. The bill delivers on multiple election promises that will undoubtedly have a very positive impact on sectors such as Indigenous communities throughout Australia and will assist in addressing some of the very real challenges facing the superannuation industry now and in the future. I commend the bill.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (18:26):  I take the opportunity to speak briefly to schedules 1 to 4 and 6, which have been covered quite extensively by the member for Casey and my colleagues the member for Dobell and the member for Greenway. I will just touch on those briefly; then I want to go to schedule 5 in particular. Schedule 1, as has been indicated, has added two additional organisations to the list of deductible death recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997—that is, the Charlie Perkins Trust for Children and Students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation fund. As was indicated by the member for Greenway, both organisations are established in the names of significant and important Indigenous Australians with a very worthwhile cause at the heart of their activities, and I think this is something that will be well supported across all members of the House.


Schedule 2 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, and that is to permit the regulation to impose rules on self-managed superannuation fund trustees that make, hold or realise investments involving collectibles and personal-use assets. As indicated, the intention was to ensure the appropriate use of assets within those trust funds and was a commitment in the election campaign. I would also commend that. I understand from the contribution of the member for Casey that it is also supported on the other side.


Schedule 3 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act and the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 to allow the use of tax file numbers for a very specific purpose in order to locate member accounts without having to use other methods that may be less accurate and appropriate, but within a very strict and specific purpose in order not to breach the privacy considerations that need to be used when utilising tax file numbers. Schedule 4 amends GST law to replace the current mechanism for ensuring Australian taxes, fees and charges are not subject to GST, with a legislative exemption which allows for the making of regulations to treat an Australian tax or an Australian fee or charge in a particular way. The amendments allow the GST treatment of an Australian tax, fee or charge to be determined against legislative principles, providing the same outcome as the current mechanism but in a more efficient manner. So I would support all of those first four schedules. Schedule 6 is a range of miscellaneous amendments which I would also support.


I particularly want to take the opportunity to speak to schedule 5 because it is something that I have worked on for quite a few years—indeed, since we were in opposition—in conjunction with a local business called Seawind Catamarans. Seawind had approached me during the period in which their sector of the industry was campaigning around these reforms in order to support their international competitiveness. I am a great supporter, as many of my colleagues are, of the manufacturing sector of this country, and this is an important local manufacturing business. The dilemma that they faced was that the way the GST rules operated meant that people who purchased one of their catamarans had to export it within 60 days under the GST application. That creates a problem in a number of areas. Often these people are buying their first large boat, and they need to be taught how to navigate it properly. Often that is best done by sailing up and down the coast. The other advantage of that for us as a nation, of course, is not only the selling of a locally manufactured boat but also the fact that they then visit ports up and down our coastal areas, spending tourist dollars and participating in our tourist based areas as well.


The concern was that we needed to have a way to extend the amount of time in which they could utilise a boat for a private purpose in Australia beyond the standard 60 days. This particular schedule extends that to 12 months, but it does put very appropriate conditions and controls around that to ensure that the intention is achieved in making our manufacturing sector in the boatbuilding area competitive. Certainly since I first started working with them on this particular amendment, I was conscious that for something like Seawind Catamarans we have seen the global financial crisis and the very high Australian dollar and, like many in the sector, these things are putting real pressure on this local industry. They have a building facility in my electorate, which the Treasurer has visited, in fact, and there is also a second site in Nowra. They employ a significant number of people, and we are, obviously, very keen to see that business continue in our region.


To be able to add a small bit to making them internationally competitive through this particular amendment is particularly important. I think the schedule is well worth supporting, and I particularly commend the work that has been done to put it together in a way that means it does achieve what it is intended to achieve. The member for Dobell went through all the detail of that, so I will not repeat that, but I do welcome that particular schedule on behalf of our local industry. I commend all six schedules in this bill to the House.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (18:32):  Firstly, I would like to thank the members who have contributed to this debate: the members for Dobell, Greenway, Cunningham and, indeed, Casey.


Schedule 1 amends the deductible gift recipient—DGR—provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts to organisations that are DGRs. This schedule adds two new organisations to the act: the Charlie Perkins Trust and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. It also recognises the name change of Guides Australia Incorporated to Girl Guides Australia. Making these organisations deductible gift recipients will assist them in attracting public support for their activities.


Schedule 2 allows regulations to make rules relating to how self-managed superannuation fund—SMSF—trustees make, hold and realise investments in collectables and personal use assets. Collectables can be a legitimate investment for some SMSF trustees. However, there is a risk that SMSF trustees may gain current day benefit from these investments due to the nature of the assets. These amendments allow regulations to be made that will ensure SMSF investments in collectables and personal use assets are made for retirement income purposes, rather than current day benefit. The schedule also removes a reference to a provision that was repealed in 2007.


Schedule 3 will improve the administrative processes of superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers by removing the requirement for funds to use other search methods before tax file numbers are used. It will also allow superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers to use tax file numbers to facilitate the consolidation of multiple superannuation accounts held by the same person, provided the conditions in the regulations are met. The accompanying regulations will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to support the use of tax file numbers, facilitating the account consolidation process and to protect the privacy of members.


Schedule 4 will amend the GST law to replace the current mechanism for exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges with a legislative exemption with effect from 1 July 2011. The GST law currently specifies that Australian taxes, fees and charges are exempt from GST if they are included in a determination of the Treasurer. This measure will allow the GST treatment of an Australian tax, fee or charge to be determined against legislative principles. Generally this measure will provide the same outcome as the current mechanism, but in a more efficient manner. This measure will provide increased certainty to taxpayers and government agencies in relation to the GST treatment of new taxes, fees and charges, as the tax treatment is not dependent on the item being listed in the determination. A legislative exemption will provide a more effective and transparent approach to exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges from the GST compared to the current exemption mechanism.


Finally, schedule 5 to this bill covers other amendments to tax laws. These amendments are part of the government's commitment to the care and maintenance of the tax law, and include some legislative issues raised by the public through the tax issues entry system. This bill deserves the support of the parliament.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2011-05-11,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (17:52):  The coalition will not be opposing the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill. Like all tax law amendment bills, this makes a number of changes to the tax law and the administration of tax. It does so in this case through five schedules, all essentially unrelated. I will run through each of them briefly. Schedule 1 adds some deductible gift recipients to the existing schedule—namely, the Charlie Perkins Trust for children and students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. It adds those to the relevant list allowing donations over $2 to be tax deductible and thereby encouraging public support for charitable activities.


The second schedule deals with some changes with respect to self-managed superannuation funds. The provision in this schedule will allow the government, through regulation, to impose rules on self-managed superannuation fund investments in personal use assets, such as collectables and artworks amongst a number of other things identified. Members would be aware that the sole purpose test of the relevant superannuation act requires that assets of a superannuation fund be held for the sole purpose of generating retirement income. The recent Cooper Review, the review of the entire superannuation system, recommended that self-managed superannuation funds be prohibited from investing in personal use assets and that those assets, to the extent that they existed within those funds, should be disposed of within five years. The review found that personal use assets lent themselves to personal enjoyment and therefore failed that sole purpose test that I just outlined. The government announced back in July last year that it did not support those conclusions of the Cooper review but said that it would tighten the requirements around personal use assets rather than take up the recommendation to prohibit them. That is what this schedule seeks to do—to provide the government with the power of regulation to impose rules relating to investment of personal use assets by self-managed superannuation funds.


The Assistant Treasurer, the member for Maribyrnong, outlined in his second reading speech back on 24 March the government's intentions in this regard when he said that the amendments would allow regulations to make rules relating to how self-managed superannuation fund trustees make, hold and realise investments in collectables and personal use assets. He said that the purpose of the rules would be to ensure that these investments are made for retirement income purposes and not for current day benefit. He further advised that the content of those regulations is being developed in consultation with the industry. We believe that this reflects a sensible balance. We understand that it is supported by the Self-Managed Super Fund Professionals Association of Australia.


The third schedule deals with tax file numbers with respect to locating superannuation accounts in order to facilitate consolidation of those accounts. It allows super fund trustees and retirement savings account holders to use tax file numbers to locate accounts and facilitate consolidation of multiple accounts. At the present point in time, there are some restrictions on the ways that super funds can use tax file numbers. In particular, they are not permitted to use tax file numbers to locate accounts for the purposes of the very consolidation that this schedule deals with. This will not replace account or membership numbers, but will simply remove the requirement that super funds use other methods for searching for multiple funds before using tax file numbers. Apparently, individuals can still choose not to give their tax file number. There are not changes to the consequences for failing to do so. We agree on this side of the House that it is important to maximise individual retirement savings and for small accounts to be consolidated as easily and as quickly as possible.


The fourth schedule deals with the goods and services tax and specifically the issue of the determination of Australian taxes, fees and charges with respect to the goods and services tax. Currently, the federal Treasurer determines by legislative instrument those Australian taxes, fees and charges that are not regarded as consideration for a taxable supply and therefore not subject to GST. That determination is an administrative process involving the Ministerial Council for Federal Financial Relations and the formal agreement of state and territory treasurers. The instrument is updated twice yearly and over the now more than 10 years of the operation of the goods and services tax it has grown, I am advised, to over 600 pages. The government's view is that this is becoming a significant administrative burden on all levels of government. The amendment means that the default position will be that Australian taxes, fees and charges are not subject to GST and therefore will not need to be listed. Regulation may be made to treat the payment of an Australian tax, fee or charge as consideration for supply and therefore as subject to the goods and services tax. On the subject of goods and services tax, my friend opposite would think it remiss of me not to remind the House that I always welcome in tax law amendment bills schedules that consolidate and protect the goods and services tax which this side of the House fought so hard to implement and those opposite fought so hard to prevent coming into existence. Now that they are in government, perhaps they realise the errors of their ways, and it is good to see them preserving and protecting the goods and services tax which their former leader and former Prime Minister said on the day of its introduction would be marked down 100 years from now as 'a day of fundamental injustice'. I had been unfair in the past that no-one would remember Fundamental Injustice Day declared by the member for Griffith back in 1999, when the legislation for the goods and services tax passed through the House. I think in the years from now he will remember Fundamental Injustice Day, but it will not be the day that the goods and services tax passed through the House; it will be 24 June 2010.


Schedule 5, the final schedule, as is often the case with these tax law amendment bills, simply makes a range of corrections, additions and the sorts of changes and improvements you would expect to see in taxation law. We do not oppose this bill, and I commend it to the House.

Mr CRAIG THOMSON
 (Dobell) (18:01):  It is always good to hear members of the opposition talking about their past record as the highest taxing government in Australia's history, and it is great that the member for Casey took the opportunity to remind us again. He should not be so modest, though: it was not one year that they were the highest taxing government in history; they held the record for four years in a row. It is a terrific record, and we love the way you always come out to remind the Australian public. We love the way that you remind them that your government was the highest taxing government in Australia's history and it has been this government that has gone about reforming tax to make sure that ordinary Australians are not slugged to the extent that they were when those on the other side had the Treasury benches.


I am not sure that I would necessarily be making the boast about being the highest taxing government in history, but that is something the member for Casey obviously likes to remind us about on many occasions—and I encourage him to continue to remind us about the former government's record in relation to tax!




Ms Owens:
  My pensioners remind me.




Mr CRAIG THOMSON:
  As the member for Parramatta points out, we are constantly reminded by our constituents, particularly those on fixed incomes or those on pensions, of the high-taxing history of the former government.


I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill 2011. It has a number of schedules, and I will go through each of those schedules to look at what they are actually proposing. The first schedule is about deductible gift recipients. Under the current law taxpayers can claim income tax deductions for certain gifts to organisations with DGR status. Division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 sets out the requirements for organisations to be granted DGR status. Organisations must either fit one of the general categories of DGR or be specifically listed under these provisions. This schedule lists the Charlie Perkins Trust for Children and Students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. It also changes the name of one deductible gift recipient from Guides Australia Inc. to Girl Guides Australia.


The Charlie Perkins Trust was established in late 2002 in memory of the late Dr Charles Perkins AO. The trust's aim is to advance the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders through the provision of scholarships to Indigenous persons for study at overseas institutions such as Oxford and Cambridge University. The Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation was established in 1990 and works to advance the education and life opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and provide additional assistance, such as assisting with the cost of relocating families and partners, to female Indigenous scholars undertaking programs overseas. Listing the Charlie Perkins Trust for Children and Students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation means that the organisations will be in a significantly better position to attract private and corporate donors, and to raise funds for their ongoing work supporting Indigenous Australians to undertake higher education at prestigious overseas universities such as Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard.


Schedule 2 is in relation to self-managed superannuation fund investments in collectables and personal use assets. This measure will allow implementation of the government's election commitment to tighten legislative restrictions on self-managed superannuation funds, investments and collectables and personal use assets. The Super System Review recommended that SMSF investments in collectables and personal use assets should be prohibited because these assets lend themselves to personal enjoyment and therefore can involve current day benefits being derived by those using or accessing these assets. This recommendation was restricted to SMSF investments because of the closely held nature of SMSFs, where members have direct control over the investment of their retirement savings.


In response to criticisms of the recommendation by SMSF and art industry representatives, the government rejected this recommendation in recognition that collectables can be legitimate investments for some SMSF trustees. However, the government also announced that it would tighten the legislative standards applying to SMSF investment in collectables and personal use assets to ensure that such investments do not give rise to current day benefits for SMSF trustees. The legislative standards that will apply to SMSF investment in collectables and personal use assets are being developed in consultation with the industry, and will be set out in regulations. These measures will enable those regulations to be made. This measure also removes a reference to the provision that was repealed on 24 September 2007.


These amendments will allow implementation of the government's election promise to tighten legislative restrictions on self-managed superannuation fund investments in collectables and personal use assets to ensure that they do not give rise to current day benefits. It will give authority for regulations to make rules in relation to how these investments are made, held and realised. It will also give the regulations authority to impose a penalty of not more than 10 penalty units for contraventions of the regulations, and to provide for the transitional period of existing investments held prior to 1 July 2011. The regulations being developed in consultation with industry will be released for public consultation prior to being finalised. These amendments, as I have also said, remove reference to a provision that was repealed on 24 September 2007.


Schedule 3 relates to superannuation tax file number amendments. Schedule 3 makes a number of amendments which will improve the operation of the superannuation industry. It allows superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers to use tax file numbers to locate members' accounts without first having to use other methods of identification, and will facilitate account consolidation. The new law will allow superannuation fund trustees and RSA providers to use tax file numbers to locate a member's account details. However, the law will not allow the fund to use tax file numbers to replace their existing account numbers. The aim of the law is to remove the impediment for funds to use other search methods before tax file numbers are used. It will not replace existing account identification methods, such as account or membership numbers. This ensures that the amendment operates in accordance with the National Privacy Principle 7: that tax file numbers should not become a national identifier. The amendments will also allow superannuation fund trustees and RSA providers to use tax file numbers to facilitate the consolidation of multi-accounts held by the same person in the same superannuation fund and across multiple superannuation funds, provided the requirements of the regulations are met.


These amendments will improve the administrative efficiency of the superannuation industry, and make it easier for superannuation fund trustees and retirement saving account providers to locate member accounts and to facilitate account consolidation. These amendments will be subject to appropriate privacy safeguards. In keeping with the current guidelines governing the use of tax file numbers, it will remain voluntary for individuals to provide their tax file number to their superannuation fund or to their RSA provider.


The measure is part of the government's package of stronger super reforms, which were announced on 16 December 2010. Allowing for the greater use of tax file numbers is the first of a number of initiatives from the package that will improve the administrative efficiency of the superannuation industry. Regulations will be enacted to support the use of tax file numbers and to facilitate the account consolidation process. This will include requirements for member consent and other procedures and processes that superannuation fund trustees and RSA providers must follow before consolidating accounts. These regulations will, again, be developed in consultation with the industry. Schedule 4 exempts Australian taxes, fees and charges from the goods and services tax. Currently, Australian taxes, fees and charges are exempt from GST by being listed in a determination made by the Treasurer under division 81 of the GST act and agreed to by the states and territories. The determination has grown to over 680 pages, and its compilation is a cumbersome and time-consuming process. The schedule will repeal and replace division 81 of the GST act to allow entities to self-assess the GST treatment of a payment of an Australian tax or an Australian fee or charge in accordance with certain principles. Under these amendments, government entities will no longer need to have an Australian tax or certain categories of Australian fees or charges listed on the determination in order for those taxes, fees or charges not to be subject to GST. The amendments will amend the GST law to replace the current mechanism for exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges with a legislative exemption with effect from 1 July 2011. Generally, the measure will provide the same outcome as the current mechanism but in a more efficient manner. This measure will provide increased certainty to taxpayers and government agencies in relation to the GST treatment of new taxes, fees and charges, as the tax treatment is not dependent on the item being listed in the determination. A legislative exemption will provide a more effective and transparent approach to exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges from the GST compared to the current exemption mechanism.


Schedule 5 relates to the 12-month export period for the GST-free supply of boats. The legislation provides that the supply of a new recreational boat will be GST free if the boat is exported from Australia within 12 months of delivery or certain other events in the case of payment by instalment. This is subject to certain conditions. There are two main sets of conditions: conditions relating to the nature of the boat—the boat must be a new recreational boat—and the boat must not be used in any form of disqualifying activity, with certain exemptions. Under the conditions for a new recreational boat, essentially the boat must be constructed in Australia; not be a substantially reconstructed boat; not used, sold or leased since completion, except in connection with the supply or acquisition of the boat as trading stock, or in connection with the particular supply or acquisition by the purchaser under consideration; be principally designed or fitted out for recreational purposes and not be a commercial boat. The first two conditions essentially ensure the boat is a new boat; the last two conditions ensure the boat is a recreational type boat. Under the disqualifying use conditions, the boat cannot be used as security for a loan except a loan to buy the boat itself. It cannot be used to carry on an enterprise in Australia. It cannot be used to carry on an enterprise outside Australia, except for private or domestic purposes or for a private recreational pursuit or hobby. The former exemption may embrace the latter exemption, which has been added out of caution.


Essentially, an overseas business may buy a new recreational boat in Australia and allow its employees to sail around Australia in the boat, or live in it while it is moored somewhere for 12 months and for consideration except where the employee of an overseas business is allowed to sail or live on the boat as above, or the boat is used to compete in a race or sporting event. Essentially, these conditions are designed to use the boat for commercial purposes or financial gain while in Australia. The actual supply of the boat by the supplier to the purchaser relates to the carrying on of an enterprise, but is not a disqualifying activity. The commissioner has the discretion to extend the 12-month export period as he does under the existing 60-day export period for a GST-free supply.


An exemption from disqualifying use has been provided to the use of the boat in a private capacity by the purchaser to participate in a racing or sporting event. This is in recognition that Australia is home to world-class sporting events including boats, such as yacht races and waterski events, and that participation in such events with a new boat built for Australian conditions could encourage some purchasers—in particular, foreign purchasers—to buy a new boat in Australia.


The measure was not implemented via a refund system, as proposed by several submissions, for administrative and legal reasons. A refund system would relieve the supplier of any further GST obligations after he paid the GST to the government. However, a mechanism was not available within existing resources to pay refunds of this nature. Further, these submissions suggested that a control permit be deemed to have been granted to the purchaser immediately after the boat was purchased and the supplier forwarded the GST. This would have been a necessary component for the use of a refund system to implement the measure. However, to grant and control permits in this way would have required more complex legislative changes than in this bill, and this would have delayed considerably legislation to implement the measure. Schedule 6 is in relation to other amendments. Schedule 6 makes various other amendments to the taxation laws. The amendments seek to ensure that taxation operates as intended by correcting technical or drafting defects. It is essentially a technical schedule.


While this may not be the most exciting piece of legislation, it is nonetheless an important piece of legislation. It is part of this government's ongoing reform in relation to taxation generally. It is part of making sure that business in Australia is simpler and more streamlined. For those reasons it is important that this legislation be supported. I commend the bill to the House.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (18:15):  I am very pleased to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 2) Bill 2011. It is very satisfying to speak on bills such as this one because they reinforce some very responsive and progressive reforms that this government is pursuing. I thank the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation for his commitment to creating a better future for all Australians. This bill demonstrates the commitment of the government to fulfilling its election promise of increasing the level of education for Indigenous Australians. This bill also takes steps towards fulfilling the government's election commitment to the creation of a stronger and fairer superannuation industry. Both measures are an investment in the future, the former by assisting Indigenous Australians to achieve educational equality and the latter by ensuring the provision of a comfortable retirement for all Australians, including many in my electorate of Greenway.


This bill does a number of important things and I would like to focus on three of them. The bill grants deductible gift recipient, or DGR, status to two educational trusts designed to support Indigenous education. It enables the regulation of investments by trustees of self-managed superannuation funds to ensure that there is no misuse of superannuation assets and it allows the use of tax file numbers by trustees of superannuation funds and retirement savings account providers to locate and consolidate member accounts. These important measures will result in a better future for all Australians by increasing the level of Indigenous education and by providing a comfortable retirement for working Australians.


Schedule 1 of the bill adds two organisations to the list of DGR recipients. These two organisations are the Charlie Perkins Trust, for children and students, and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. The Charlie Perkins Trust was established in 2002 in memory of the late Dr Charlie Perkins AO. Dr Perkins was an inspiration to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians alike. In a life full of achievements, Dr Perkins was responsible for the organisation of the famous Freedom Ride, which exposed the discrimination suffered by Indigenous Australians, in 1965. He was the first Indigenous person to graduate from university, in 1966, and he was appointed to a number of influential roles, such as Commissioner of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, before being awarded the Order of Australia in 1987.


The Charlie Perkins Trust seeks to continue the inspiring work of Dr Perkins by providing for the advancement and education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The trust provides scholarships for overseas study at institutions such as Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard, which provide Indigenous students with the opportunity to access their unlimited potential and which will undoubtedly pay dividends to Australia in the future.


The second organisation is the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation, which was established in 1990. Dr Sykes was another inspirational Australian whose legacy will surely be long. Dr Sykes was a poet and author who was heavily involved in the Aboriginal land rights movement and who, among other roles, was the Executive Secretary of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in 1972. Among her many achievements, Dr Sykes was the first Indigenous Australian to attend an American university, receiving a PhD from Harvard. She was later awarded the Australian Human Rights Medal, in 1994, in recognition of her tireless campaigning for Aboriginal rights. The Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation also aims to advance the education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and specifically provides additional assistance to female Indigenous scholars undertaking programs overseas, such as assisting with relocation costs for partners or family. 


By being specifically listed as DGRs, the Charlie Perkins Trust and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation will be in a significantly better position to attract private and corporate donors. The increased donations will allow these great organisations to help even more Indigenous Australians to reach their potential. I am very proud to support these measures which will provide such a tangible benefit to Indigenous Australians and the future of our country. It is a strong demonstration of the commitment of this government to the advancement of the education of Indigenous Australians. It is very important for my electorate of Greenway as the Blacktown local government area is home to the largest Indigenous population in New South Wales, something which is not very well known.


Another feature of the bill I would like to comment on is being implemented as part of the government's election commitment to a fairer, stronger and simpler superannuation system. With this measure the government lays the foundation to regulate SMSF investment in collectables and personal use assets. SMSFs account for 99 per cent of all superannuation funds in Australia, numbering approximately 430,000. They hold over 30 per cent of all superannuation assets and, in recent years, they have enjoyed an annualised growth rate of 20 per cent. These statistics are very real and they can be found in APRA's Annual Superannuation Bulletin, published on 19 January this year.


As a popular vehicle for superannuation management, which forms such a significant portion of the superannuation industry, it is vital that SMSFs maintain a high standard of governance. Indeed, one of the key messages from the Cooper review and the government's Stronger Super response relates to the importance of these high levels of governance amongst SMSFs. The bill implements measures which will ensure that SMSF trustees do not derive any current day benefits from investments in collectables and personal use assets. These new measures will ensure that SMSF assets cannot be misused by an SMSF trustee, for example, by 'collecting' and then driving high-end sports cars or  'investing' in expensive artwork which is then displayed in the trustee's home. The government recognises that investment in collectables and personal use assets can be a legitimate investment for some SMSF trustees. Accordingly, the measures implemented by this bill do not call for a blanket prohibition on SMSF investment in collectables and personal use assets.


The government is certainly aware that to completely prohibit such investments would unreasonably prejudice certain industries, such as the significant art industry in this country. Instead, in fulfilment of the government's election promise, the measures allow the investment in collectables and personal use assets to continue, but remove the ability of the SMSF trustee to derive any current day benefit from such investment. The bill does this by allowing the creation of specific regulations regarding collectables and personal use assets with which SMSF trustees will need to comply. The regulations can relate to the making, holding or realising of such investments, and may prescribe penalties for noncompliance. These new measures will ensure that, as the number of SMSFs grows, their standard of governance will remain high. In this way the government is fulfilling its election commitment to create a fairer, stronger and simpler superannuation system for the future.


The third measure under this bill I would like to discuss fulfils another election promise of this government. Under schedule 3 of the bill, the government proposes to amend legislation and grant to superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers the ability to use the TFNs of members to locate and consolidate the superannuation contributions of those members. This initiative is also consistent with the government's commitment to the creation of this fairer, stronger and simpler superannuation system.


This is an extremely important item. There is currently some $18.8 billion in lost superannuation in some 5.8 million lost superannuation accounts. While lost superannuation is still held on trust by the trustee of an eligible rollover fund, or in some cases the trustee of a superannuation fund, the lost super moneys are not being managed at the direction of the member for whose benefit they are held. It is vital that every Australian is able to enjoy a secure, comfortable retirement. Ensuring every working Australian is in full control of their superannuation is critical to achieving this outcome.


An efficient way of tracking down lost superannuation is by using the TFN of a fund member. However, while many account holders supply their TFNs to superannuation funds, it is actually against the law for trustees to use a TFN as the primary search method for lost accounts. This is a significant impediment to efficient administration of the superannuation industry. This new initiative will allow a trustee to locate and consolidate lost accounts using the TFNs of superannuation fund members without first needing to exhaust all other avenues. This will improve the administrative efficiency of the superannuation industry, which in turn will result in better returns to members.


It is also important to note that privacy safeguards will not be compromised by this initiative. It will remain voluntary for individuals to provide their TFN to their superannuation fund or retirement savings account provider, and TFNs will not replace account numbers as primary identifiers. These amendments are consistent with the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988, the National Privacy Principles contained in that act as well as the TFN Guidelines. To ensure that the account consolidation process is carried out in the most efficient way, regulations will again be developed in consultation with industry. Among other requirements, member consent will be required for the consolidation of accounts, and processes and procedures will be created which superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings providers must follow before beginning the consolidation process.


There are several benefits associated with this bill which I have sought to highlight. With the passage of this bill it is evident that many Australians will achieve a tangible benefit from these measures to be implemented. These actions are also a genuine reminder of this government's commitment to policy delivery and fulfilling its vision for the future of Australia. It is a great example of the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, and the people on this side more generally, listening to the needs of our constituents and responding to important policy issues. The bill delivers on multiple election promises that will undoubtedly have a very positive impact on sectors such as Indigenous communities throughout Australia and will assist in addressing some of the very real challenges facing the superannuation industry now and in the future. I commend the bill.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (18:26):  I take the opportunity to speak briefly to schedules 1 to 4 and 6, which have been covered quite extensively by the member for Casey and my colleagues the member for Dobell and the member for Greenway. I will just touch on those briefly; then I want to go to schedule 5 in particular. Schedule 1, as has been indicated, has added two additional organisations to the list of deductible death recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997—that is, the Charlie Perkins Trust for Children and Students and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation fund. As was indicated by the member for Greenway, both organisations are established in the names of significant and important Indigenous Australians with a very worthwhile cause at the heart of their activities, and I think this is something that will be well supported across all members of the House.


Schedule 2 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, and that is to permit the regulation to impose rules on self-managed superannuation fund trustees that make, hold or realise investments involving collectibles and personal-use assets. As indicated, the intention was to ensure the appropriate use of assets within those trust funds and was a commitment in the election campaign. I would also commend that. I understand from the contribution of the member for Casey that it is also supported on the other side.


Schedule 3 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act and the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 to allow the use of tax file numbers for a very specific purpose in order to locate member accounts without having to use other methods that may be less accurate and appropriate, but within a very strict and specific purpose in order not to breach the privacy considerations that need to be used when utilising tax file numbers. Schedule 4 amends GST law to replace the current mechanism for ensuring Australian taxes, fees and charges are not subject to GST, with a legislative exemption which allows for the making of regulations to treat an Australian tax or an Australian fee or charge in a particular way. The amendments allow the GST treatment of an Australian tax, fee or charge to be determined against legislative principles, providing the same outcome as the current mechanism but in a more efficient manner. So I would support all of those first four schedules. Schedule 6 is a range of miscellaneous amendments which I would also support.


I particularly want to take the opportunity to speak to schedule 5 because it is something that I have worked on for quite a few years—indeed, since we were in opposition—in conjunction with a local business called Seawind Catamarans. Seawind had approached me during the period in which their sector of the industry was campaigning around these reforms in order to support their international competitiveness. I am a great supporter, as many of my colleagues are, of the manufacturing sector of this country, and this is an important local manufacturing business. The dilemma that they faced was that the way the GST rules operated meant that people who purchased one of their catamarans had to export it within 60 days under the GST application. That creates a problem in a number of areas. Often these people are buying their first large boat, and they need to be taught how to navigate it properly. Often that is best done by sailing up and down the coast. The other advantage of that for us as a nation, of course, is not only the selling of a locally manufactured boat but also the fact that they then visit ports up and down our coastal areas, spending tourist dollars and participating in our tourist based areas as well.


The concern was that we needed to have a way to extend the amount of time in which they could utilise a boat for a private purpose in Australia beyond the standard 60 days. This particular schedule extends that to 12 months, but it does put very appropriate conditions and controls around that to ensure that the intention is achieved in making our manufacturing sector in the boatbuilding area competitive. Certainly since I first started working with them on this particular amendment, I was conscious that for something like Seawind Catamarans we have seen the global financial crisis and the very high Australian dollar and, like many in the sector, these things are putting real pressure on this local industry. They have a building facility in my electorate, which the Treasurer has visited, in fact, and there is also a second site in Nowra. They employ a significant number of people, and we are, obviously, very keen to see that business continue in our region.


To be able to add a small bit to making them internationally competitive through this particular amendment is particularly important. I think the schedule is well worth supporting, and I particularly commend the work that has been done to put it together in a way that means it does achieve what it is intended to achieve. The member for Dobell went through all the detail of that, so I will not repeat that, but I do welcome that particular schedule on behalf of our local industry. I commend all six schedules in this bill to the House.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2011-05-11,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (18:32):  Firstly, I would like to thank the members who have contributed to this debate: the members for Dobell, Greenway, Cunningham and, indeed, Casey.


Schedule 1 amends the deductible gift recipient—DGR—provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts to organisations that are DGRs. This schedule adds two new organisations to the act: the Charlie Perkins Trust and the Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation. It also recognises the name change of Guides Australia Incorporated to Girl Guides Australia. Making these organisations deductible gift recipients will assist them in attracting public support for their activities.


Schedule 2 allows regulations to make rules relating to how self-managed superannuation fund—SMSF—trustees make, hold and realise investments in collectables and personal use assets. Collectables can be a legitimate investment for some SMSF trustees. However, there is a risk that SMSF trustees may gain current day benefit from these investments due to the nature of the assets. These amendments allow regulations to be made that will ensure SMSF investments in collectables and personal use assets are made for retirement income purposes, rather than current day benefit. The schedule also removes a reference to a provision that was repealed in 2007.


Schedule 3 will improve the administrative processes of superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers by removing the requirement for funds to use other search methods before tax file numbers are used. It will also allow superannuation fund trustees and retirement savings account providers to use tax file numbers to facilitate the consolidation of multiple superannuation accounts held by the same person, provided the conditions in the regulations are met. The accompanying regulations will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to support the use of tax file numbers, facilitating the account consolidation process and to protect the privacy of members.


Schedule 4 will amend the GST law to replace the current mechanism for exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges with a legislative exemption with effect from 1 July 2011. The GST law currently specifies that Australian taxes, fees and charges are exempt from GST if they are included in a determination of the Treasurer. This measure will allow the GST treatment of an Australian tax, fee or charge to be determined against legislative principles. Generally this measure will provide the same outcome as the current mechanism, but in a more efficient manner. This measure will provide increased certainty to taxpayers and government agencies in relation to the GST treatment of new taxes, fees and charges, as the tax treatment is not dependent on the item being listed in the determination. A legislative exemption will provide a more effective and transparent approach to exempting Australian taxes, fees and charges from the GST compared to the current exemption mechanism.


Finally, schedule 5 to this bill covers other amendments to tax laws. These amendments are part of the government's commitment to the care and maintenance of the tax law, and include some legislative issues raised by the public through the tax issues entry system. This bill deserves the support of the parliament.
