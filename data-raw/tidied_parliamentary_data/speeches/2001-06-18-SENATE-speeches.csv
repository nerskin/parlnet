"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-06-18,"—The opposition wishes to indicate at the outset of this debate that it will not be opposing the passage of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 2001. The bill increases funding to the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, and the increased funding will become effective from 1 July 2001. Currently, the funding arrangements are that the Commonwealth contributes $1 for every $2 raised from industry by way of levy payments. This bill will increase the government's contribution by matching $1 for every $1 contributed by industry levies. At first one might think that this is some sort of generous increase from $1 for every $2 to $1 for every $1. However, in reality, the additional funding amounts to only $1.6 million per annum. Further, when this initiative—the sole initiative of Minister Tuckey in the almost three years that he has had this ministry—is compared with the funding established by the previous Labor government under the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy and the RFA process, this increase is not only paltry and minuscule but also an insult to the industry. 
It is an insult to industry because Minister Tuckey has been for the last 2½ years running around the country ranting and raving about the wonderful things that he was going to do for the forest industry and for the wood and paper products industry. He announced in 1998 that he would establish an action agenda. Mr Tuckey indicated that that action agenda would be developed in consultation with industry and that the details would be announced in June 1999. Anyone who cares to take the time to read the Hansard of estimates proceedings, the House of Representatives and the Senate will note that the famous action agenda was noted for its lack of action. Indeed, it was not until the end of 2000, some 18 months after the deadline of June 1999, that we finally saw any details regarding Minister Tuckey's action agenda. The only matter of substance in that action agenda was this funding increase of $1.6 million. 
Minister Tuckey was asked a question on notice earlier this year by the shadow minister for forestry, Mr Ferguson, as to what other funding initiatives would be contained within this action agenda. After all, this was Minister Tuckey's grand vision for the industry. Minister Tuckey's response to that question on notice, which was delivered on 5 March 2001, stated:
The government is in the process of developing the 2001-2002 budget. Details of funding for Action Agenda items are as yet unknown. 
That was a telling admission by Minister Tuckey because, as we all know, he is one who is never short for words. He usually has a lot to say. He has a hell of a lot to say. There is not much substance, but he has a lot to say. But on this occasion, when he was asked the specific question of what other funding initiatives are in this action agenda that the minister has spent two years or more developing, his response was that the government is in the process of developing this year's budget and the details of funding are as yet unknown. For Minister Tuckey that was a short, succinct response that for once said nothing without him making a lot of noise in doing so, which is his usual approach.
It was a short time from March through to May, so we waited for the budget. What was in the budget in terms of funding for this industry? Absolutely nothing. There was not one cent of additional funding for new initiatives for this industry in this year's budget. There was not one cent for any initiative under the famous Tuckey action agenda. So the action agenda, as I said, is characterised by its total lack of action. This minister and this government stand condemned for their failure to match their words with deeds, to match their promises with real dollars to support this industry.
As I said, the opposition is prepared to support this legislation, notwithstanding this government's and this minister's total failure to develop policies to give real support to the industry, because at least the industry will benefit to the tune of $1.6 million by virtue of this legislation. That has only come about because of the intense lobbying by the industry of this government to change that formula with respect to Commonwealth funding. The funds that were originally allocated under those initiatives of the previous Labor government, such as the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy and other plans, are coming to an end or have ceased. This government has not established anything to replace that assistance. This $1.6 million is the only measure that has been announced so far, and it is clear that there is nothing more to come.
As I said, this minister and this government stand condemned for their failure to support the timber industry, the wood and forest products industry. It was the previous Labor government, through the National Forest Policy Statement, that established the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy, the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation and the RFA process and brought some harmony back to what was a very divisive industry and a very divisive issue. But since Minister Tuckey has come to this portfolio, through his actions and many of his statements, he has turned all that on its head. The only thing that Minister Tuckey can claim credit for, and I do not think he would want to claim credit for it, is that he has led to the establishment of a new political group—which you, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, are well aware of—the Liberals for Forests group. That is Mr Tuckey's legacy to this industry, and he should be condemned, as I am sure many of his colleagues privately agree.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—That was a small `l' liberal, I think, Senator Forshaw.
—Because of Mr Tuckey's failures in this industry, his remaining time is short. On this occasion, we will support the government's bill because at least it does provide some small amount of additional assistance for the industry.",SENATE,<title>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-06-18,"—As Senator Forshaw said, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Amendment Bill 2001 gives an extra $1.6 million out of the taxpayers' purse into the forest industries. On the face of it, it is meant to help real research and development of that industry. When it was established, the fund, which is the basis of the legislation we are dealing with, was to have as its primary focus the rural side of that industry. The explanation given during the debates on the bill which introduced this provision in 1993 stated:
Commonwealth funding is intended to match the rural half of the industry contribution, consistent with arrangements for research and development in other rural industries.
Now that is being matched by a component which is for the manufacturing oriented component of the forest products industry. That in itself might not have been so bad if in fact it were being specifically tailored to go to innovative plantation based aspects of the industry with downstream processing, but it is not. This is simply a means of moving more funds into the arena of native forest logging in Australia and also propping up what looks to be a plantation industry with real problems. I will be asking the government about that industry in the committee stage of the bill.
However, looking at the use of the existing fund, I have real concerns. Some of the current projects that are being funded could hardly be described as research and development. For example, one from Melbourne University was called `promoting the science of sustainable management of native forests', and the objectives included `to form an association of scientists who understand and have contributed to sustainable management of Australia's native forests'. That effectively, if you ask me, means to fund a lobby group who are involved in the destruction of native forests, and I will be asking the government representative in the committee stage what has been the outcome there in terms of research and development—exactly where the research and development of that industry organisation has been developed and to what end.
Another example is a quest to be involved in `dyeing eucalypt veneer to increase its value and marketability'. The objectives here include `to investigate the profitability of establishing a veneer dyeing plant in Tasmania'. That request came from Cassino Timbers, but it appears on the face of it to be a direct request for a subsidy for a commercial venture. One has to ask the government exactly what is the intent here, who is leading whom, to what degree is fashion—in terms of veneer colouring and dyeing—being addressed in that particular quest for a subsidy and what has been the outcome.
Mr Acting Deputy President, because this does affect the logging industry right across the board, it is a very important opportunity to question the government about protecting people from a potential collapse of their investment in the plantation sector. You and I and everybody else here are aware that there has been prodigious advertising to get people to invest—sometimes with a primary motive being tax breaks—in the plantation industry in recent years. However, a recent Ausnewz study showed that `there is bound to be ongoing downward pressure on price' for hardwood pulpwood. Studies by Judy Clark at the ANU and others have indicated that the much vaunted shortfall in wood supply in the near future around the globe and in the region is simply not going to eventuate. I am very concerned about that. In fact, Christine Milne, consulting from my office, wrote to ASIC in Melbourne earlier this month, on 8 June. That letter states:
Dear Sir,
I write with regard to Australia's listed plantation sector and what appears to be a grave situation for investors. Earlier this year the Timber Investment Managers Association hired a public relations firm and launched a major advertising campaign to try to portray the industry as a sound, long term investment delivering benefits to regional economies. This public campaign was in response to the collapse in investor confidence in their stocks.
At the same time industry analyst Ausnewz released a study suggesting that prices for hardwood pulpwood are likely only to go down in the future as increased plantation supplies in Australia, Chile, China, Vietnam and South Africa outpace the lift in demand after 2010. Its conclusion was that “there is bound to be ongoing downward pressure on price.”
The letter from Christine Milne goes on:
In spite of the public relations effort and the taxation benefits of investment in plantations, it has been clear from media reports that the sales and profits forecasts for several tree companies will not be met.
In view of the collapse of HIH and One Tel in recent weeks, I write to draw your attention to developments within the plantation sector and to request that you:
a) investigate whether there have been any breaches of the law, especially with respect to share trading by directors and trading whilst insolvent,
b) consider taking action as a matter of urgency to warn potential investors of the risks, especially given the approaching end of the financial year and the 100% tax deductibility of the investment, and the implicit support given to the sector through the government's endorsement of the “2020 Vision” to treble Australia's plantation estate.
These are very serious matters. 
Let us look at some specifics in the industry with which this bill deals. Firstly, with Great Southern Plantations Ltd, we find that Helen Sewell cashed in most of her holding of 25 million shares, or about 18 per cent of the company, in March-April this year. Company founding director John Young said that the fact that the stock had been picked up by institutions, including the Commonwealth Bank, reflected the stock's strong investment case, which included another forecast big lift in bluegum woodlot sales this financial year from $76 million to $90 million. He basically said, `Things have never looked as good.' Although he said that he had sold none of his shares, a more recent report indicates that both he and Ms Sewell sold down their personal stakes to institutions, including Colonial First State. On 1 June, John Young issued a profit warning, admitting that the 2001 result would be below forecast and that the company was unlikely to meet its full year's sales target of $90 million. The share price thereupon tumbled 29.7 per cent.
The question arises: on what basis were investors persuaded to invest when the founder or founders were selling out? Ms Sewell claimed that her retirement as an executive at Great Southern coincided with a `full circle', signing a heads of agreement with two major Japanese companies, Daio Paper Company and Nichimen Company, to buy and process all the woodchips it could produce. This implies contractual and attractive pricing arrangements—presumably, the big lift in bluegum woodlot sales to which John Young was referring in April. However, it is now apparent from the end of year forecasts that this just is not the case. The question is: was it ever the case that the heads of agreement included the pricing and contractual arrangements that would have guaranteed markets and financial returns and, as such, influenced investment decisions?
A second case is Forest Enterprises Australia, which has been very active in my home state of Tasmania. Not only is the managing director currently charged with being knowingly concerned in an unregistered managed investment scheme and offering for subscription securities without a registered prospectus, but the company has so far failed to secure the $17½ million lifeline that it said it needed to end its cash crisis. In fact, the American potential assurers there have withdrawn. Already the company has stalled in finalising contracts with farmers who in some cases had begun to remove infrastructure in preparation for sale to the company. Forest Enterprises Australia is seeking to raise $20 million through its 2001 woodlot project, and it has an extension until the end of this month in a bid to gain more investors.
Timbercorp, a third company, applied for tax office permission to extend product rulings over its eucalypt, olive and almond projects until the end of June. Fourthly, Australian Plantation Timber extended its 2001 eucalypt project until 16 June and was forced to issue a supplementary prospectus clarifying assumptions about future timber prices. In the case of Forestry Tasmania, Forestry Tasmania Trees Trust is a matter about which ASIC had been advised previously. The minister or ASIC has advised that this trust is immune from Corporations Law because it is operated by the Crown in Tasmania.
In view of the general concerns that I have just enumerated in respect of the plantation sector, in my opinion it is an obvious job for ASIC to take action to warn prospective investors of the risk. Forestry Tasmania is forecasting real returns after 10 years equivalent to 10½ to 12.9 per cent per year, which appears to be very much contrary to experience of the sector as a whole. I am very worried about investors in this once prodigious plantation industry. I refer you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to the government's own consultants, Jaakko Poyry, who earlier this year reported:
With [a] background of oversupply and under-utilisation in many regions (eg. Bombala, North Queensland, Oberon, Tumut, Latrobe, Green Triangle), the concept of trebling Australia's plantation area under Vision 2020—
that is Minister Tuckey's program—
is confounding particularly for small private growers trying to access the market.
Many private growers can correctly ask: why is the government supporting expansion when they cannot sell what they now have? That is a very serious situation. Yet the prospectuses are still going out inveigling people to invest in this plantation industry to get the tax breaks on the basis that there is a looming wood shortage somewhere around the world or the region, when it is patently obvious from the facts that that is not the case. That promotion requires a very rapid answer from the government, indeed from the Prime Minister, as well as from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.
In this legislation to promote research and development in this area, the funds that are involved should be confined to research and development in the plantation sector—not in the native forest industries, where the majority of Australians want the chainsaws withdrawn. If we are going to do research and development in that area, then we should follow the exemplary example of the new Western Australian government: it should be into the job reach and investment reach industries of hospitality, accommodation, tourism and recreation which, along with other ancillary industries, give a much better return when we keep our forests standing instead of putting them on a truck and sending them off to a woodchip mill where the jobs are created overseas. 
To that end, I want to flag to the Senate an amendment which would effectively mean that the research and development funds which are being put aside or extended through this piece of legislation would go to plantations established before 1990—that is, the mature plantation sector that was put there without the loss of forest coverage which has gone on at a great rate since 1990—and exclude the awesome amount of plantations which have replaced native forests since 1990, which has been a phenomenal injustice to the Australian environment, a plundering of Australia's heritage and of course a stupid policy if you look at global warming. Replacing the biggest carbon banks in the Southern Hemisphere, our natural forests, with plantations is a detrimental thing to do if you are looking at trying to keep carbon out of the atmosphere. It will increase the impost on future generations as they try to handle the great economic, environmental and social dislocation and damage that is to come out of global warming. These are important questions. I know that the government will want to answer the questions that I have put up. I will be pursuing them in the committee stage. I also ask senators to look very carefully at the amendment I have framed, which makes some sense out of extending another $1.6 million into research and development in the forest industries.",SENATE,<title>PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2001-06-18,"—I would like to thank the Labor Party for their support of this legislation and to make some summing up remarks. As has been pointed out, the purpose of this bill is to remove an anomaly that has existed in the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 since 1994. That anomaly meant that the Commonwealth matched industry contributions for forest research and development at half the rate at which it matches levy contributions from all other primary industries. The bill repeals two clauses in the act that specify a special funding arrangement for forest research and development from the Commonwealth at one dollar from the Commonwealth for every two dollars from industry up to a maximum of 0.25 per cent of gross value of production. 
The effect of this bill is to provide, from July 2001, government funding to the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation at the same rate as is provided to other research and development corporations under the act—that is, dollar for dollar matching of industry levy contributions up to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of gross value for production. The Commonwealth is effectively doubling its contribution to the forest industry. The forest and wood products industry contributes about one per cent to Australia's gross domestic product. It employs some 80,000 people directly and a further 194,000 people indirectly. Its activities are focused in regional Australia. The forest and wood products sector plays a crucial role in the economic and social health of rural and regional Australia.
In 1999-2000, Australia imported $3.8 billion worth of forest and wood products, mainly paper and high value products, and we exported $1.6 billion worth of products, mainly woodchips and round wood. With our extensive forest resources there is tremendous potential to export a range of high value products and progressively reverse the current imbalance of trade in forest and wood products. World demand for forest and wood products continues to grow, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.
By increasing the Commonwealth government's contribution to forest research and development, the bill provides a much more secure footing for continuing investment in national and strategic research and development into resource management, production, processing, transport, marketing and usage of forest and wood products. This R&D is vital if the industry is to take full advantage of emerging opportunities to add value to our native timber resources and develop new opportunities for our expanding plantation base. The bill is one of a series of actions undertaken by this government to support a sustainable, competitive and innovative forest and wood products industry in Australia. I commend the bill to the Senate.

That the Senate take note of the report.
This was the second occasion on which the Joint Standing Committee on Migration has reviewed regulation 4.31B. In its previous report in 1999, the committee concluded that there is no evidence to date that regulation 4.31B has deterred genuine refugees from applying for review. We have made the same finding on this occasion. The regulation has been in force for a period of years, but no hard evidence has come forward to the committee that the regulation prevents any genuine asylum seeker in this country from applying for review. Some of the persons who gave evidence to the committee continued to put forward that assertion. They do not have convincing evidence. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs does not believe—and the committee was not convinced—that the regulation prevents a genuine asylum seeker from applying for review. There is evidence within the body of the committee's report that it has a small effect, but nonetheless an effect, on those who are seeking to abuse Australia's protection system.
The committee, in weighing up all the evidence, decided to play it safe and, rather than reaffirming that the regulation remain forever, decided that a further sunset clause should be put around the regulation and that it should be reviewed again in two years. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Regulation 4.31B was introduced on 1 July 1997 as part of a package of measures to combat abuse in Australia's refugee determination system. The regulation provides for a fee of $1,000 to be charged those whose claim for refugee status has been refused and who then unsuccessfully appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal for refugee status.
The regulation is intended to deter applicants who have no real claim to be considered refugees.
The Committee previously reported to the Parliament on this regulation in May 1999 and recommended that it be subject to a sunset clause. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs requested that the Committee again review the regulation prior to its scheduled expiry on 30 June 2001.
The Committee received 28 submissions from 21 organisations and individuals. This was more than the Committee had received for the 1999 review.
In the course of this review the Committee heard evidence from a number of people with relevant expertise. These included the Refugee Review Tribunal, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the International Commission of Jurists, the Migration Institute of Australia, and the Refugee Advice and Casework Service.
Many submissions argued against the continuation of the fee; some urged that it be continued and increased; others believed that the fee should not exist.
The Committee returned to the basic questions it had asked in 1999: whether there was abuse of the refugee review system; whether the fee had an effect on any abuse; and whether people with bona fide claims to be considered refugees were being discouraged from seeking review.
In looking at abuse of the refugee review system, the Committee found that one in three applicants invited by the refugee review Tribunal to put their case in person did not take up this invitation. The Committee considered this evidence that the applicants themselves knew that their claims could not be sustained. [2.11]
Most of those who had been refused refugee status since the fee was introduced were still in Australia. This indicated that their motivation was a desire to prolong their stay in Australia. [2.13]
In short, Madam President, there is abuse of the refugee review system which requires attention.
The Committee then examined whether the fee was reducing the level of abuse. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs argued that applications for review which lacked merit would be concentrated in nationalities from which there were very few successful refugee applications.
The proportion of applicants from this group who were refused refugee status by the Department and who then appealed to the Tribunal had been increasing by 10 per cent each year prior to the introduction of the fee. Since the fee was introduced in 1997 the increase has been only one per cent each year. [2.34]
The Committee considered that this was evidence that the fee was deterring applications which were not made in good faith. [2.37]
An equally important consideration for the Committee was that the fee should not discourage bona fide applicants, that is, those who genuinely believed that they would meet the refugee definition.
The Department provided an analysis of nationalities from which most refugee applications were successful. Applicants with a genuine belief that they would qualify as refugees could be expected to be concentrated in this group. The proportion of these unsuccessful applicants for refugee status who appealed to the Refugee Review Tribunal was rising prior to the introduction of the fee in 1997 and was unaffected by the fee. [2.49]
The Committee considered that this indicated that the fee was not discouraging bona fide applicants from seeking review. [2.49]
The Committee also sought comment on this important point from those directly involved with refugees. Not one of them claimed that the fee had discouraged any bona fide applicants from applying for review. [2.50]
The statistical and practical evidence convinced the Committee that the fee was not adversely affecting bona fide applicants.
This conclusion was also relevant to the argument advanced by a number of organisations that the fee was discriminatory and therefore breached Australia's international obligations. However, the evidence showed that the fee was not discouraging bona fide applicants. It was therefore not discriminatory. The Committee considered that the fee did not put Australia in breach of its international obligations. [4.15]
Another argument advanced for removing the fee held that it was not cost effective.
However the Committee observed that a total of $1.3 million dollars has been collected thus far, and in the last financial year receipts were five times the total expenditure on processing. [4.38]
The Committee therefore concluded that the financial argument against continuation of the fee could not be sustained. [4.40]
The Committee also received submissions which proposed alternatives to the fee.
A number of the proposals had been made during the 1999 review, but had not been adopted by the Committee. During the current review the Committee was not provided with any new information to support those proposals. The Committee therefore did not pursue them during this review.
In addition, some proposals for the replacement of the fee had the potential to open up new avenues for delay or litigation. The Committee therefore did not endorse them.
In its review of Migration regulation 4.31B the Committee noted that refugee determination process takes some time to reach a conclusion. Therefore the full effects of the fee might not yet have become apparent.
The Committee concluded that the regulation should be extended for a further two years and subject to another review. [4.59]
During the review the Committee's attention was also drawn to the continuing level of concern about the activities of some migration agents. This issue had been raised in another of the Committee's reviews in 2000, and Committee had itself commented on it in its 1999 report on this regulation.
The Committee has therefore recommended that the activities of migration agents be brought under closer scrutiny by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Migration Agents Registration Authority. [3.47]
Madam President, this regulation again highlighted to the Committee how the legitimate processes involved in determining migration issues can be exploited to permit people to remain in Australia who otherwise would be unlikely to have a valid reason to stay.
The Committee considered that this aspect of the migration system requires continuing review. It has therefore recommended that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs systematically examine the existing migration processing and review operations with a view to streamlining them. 
I would like to thank those who provided the Committee with submissions and evidence, and also made available further material as needed by the Committee.
My thanks also go to the Committee for their work on what was their second review of the regulation in two years. Although already familiar with the main issues, the Committee approached the new inquiry with open minds, seeking new insights to the crucial questions involved.
I would also like to extend my thanks to the small committee secretariat of Richard Selth, Steve Dyer, and Vishal Pandey for their assistance with the inquiry arrangements and processes.
Madam President, I commend this report to the House.

The Committee previously reported to the Parliament on this regulation in May 1999 and recommended that it be subject to a sunset clause. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs requested that the Committee again review the regulation prior to its scheduled expiry on 30 June 2001.
The Committee received 28 submissions from 21 organisations and individuals. This was more than the Committee had received for the 1999 review.
In the course of this review the Committee heard evidence from a number of people with relevant expertise. These included the Refugee Review Tribunal, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the International Commission of Jurists, the Migration Institute of Australia, and the Refugee Advice and Casework Service.
Many submissions argued against the continuation of the fee; some urged that it be continued and increased; others believed that the fee should not exist.
The Committee returned to the basic questions it had asked in 1999: whether there was abuse of the refugee review system; whether the fee had an effect on any abuse; and whether people with bona fide claims to be considered refugees were being discouraged from seeking review.
In looking at abuse of the refugee review system, the Committee found that one in three applicants invited by the refugee review Tribunal to put their case in person did not take up this invitation. The Committee considered this evidence that the applicants themselves knew that their claims could not be sustained. [2.11]
Most of those who had been refused refugee status since the fee was introduced were still in Australia. This indicated that their motivation was a desire to prolong their stay in Australia. [2.13]
In short, Madam President, there is abuse of the refugee review system which requires attention.
The Committee then examined whether the fee was reducing the level of abuse. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs argued that applications for review which lacked merit would be concentrated in nationalities from which there were very few successful refugee applications.
The proportion of applicants from this group who were refused refugee status by the Department and who then appealed to the Tribunal had been increasing by 10 per cent each year prior to the introduction of the fee. Since the fee was introduced in 1997 the increase has been only one per cent each year. [2.34]
The Committee considered that this was evidence that the fee was deterring applications which were not made in good faith. [2.37]
An equally important consideration for the Committee was that the fee should not discourage bona fide applicants, that is, those who genuinely believed that they would meet the refugee definition.
The Department provided an analysis of nationalities from which most refugee applications were successful. Applicants with a genuine belief that they would qualify as refugees could be expected to be concentrated in this group. The proportion of these unsuccessful applicants for refugee status who appealed to the Refugee Review Tribunal was rising prior to the introduction of the fee in 1997 and was unaffected by the fee. [2.49]
The Committee considered that this indicated that the fee was not discouraging bona fide applicants from seeking review. [2.49]
The Committee also sought comment on this important point from those directly involved with refugees. Not one of them claimed that the fee had discouraged any bona fide applicants from applying for review. [2.50]
The statistical and practical evidence convinced the Committee that the fee was not adversely affecting bona fide applicants.
This conclusion was also relevant to the argument advanced by a number of organisations that the fee was discriminatory and therefore breached Australia's international obligations. However, the evidence showed that the fee was not discouraging bona fide applicants. It was therefore not discriminatory. The Committee considered that the fee did not put Australia in breach of its international obligations. [4.15]
Another argument advanced for removing the fee held that it was not cost effective.
However the Committee observed that a total of $1.3 million dollars has been collected thus far, and in the last financial year receipts were five times the total expenditure on processing. [4.38]
The Committee therefore concluded that the financial argument against continuation of the fee could not be sustained. [4.40]
The Committee also received submissions which proposed alternatives to the fee.
A number of the proposals had been made during the 1999 review, but had not been adopted by the Committee. During the current review the Committee was not provided with any new information to support those proposals. The Committee therefore did not pursue them during this review.
In addition, some proposals for the replacement of the fee had the potential to open up new avenues for delay or litigation. The Committee therefore did not endorse them.
In its review of Migration regulation 4.31B the Committee noted that refugee determination process takes some time to reach a conclusion. Therefore the full effects of the fee might not yet have become apparent.
The Committee concluded that the regulation should be extended for a further two years and subject to another review. [4.59]
During the review the Committee's attention was also drawn to the continuing level of concern about the activities of some migration agents. This issue had been raised in another of the Committee's reviews in 2000, and Committee had itself commented on it in its 1999 report on this regulation.
The Committee has therefore recommended that the activities of migration agents be brought under closer scrutiny by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Migration Agents Registration Authority. [3.47]
Madam President, this regulation again highlighted to the Committee how the legitimate processes involved in determining migration issues can be exploited to permit people to remain in Australia who otherwise would be unlikely to have a valid reason to stay.
The Committee considered that this aspect of the migration system requires continuing review. It has therefore recommended that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs systematically examine the existing migration processing and review operations with a view to streamlining them. 
I would like to thank those who provided the Committee with submissions and evidence, and also made available further material as needed by the Committee.
My thanks also go to the Committee for their work on what was their second review of the regulation in two years. Although already familiar with the main issues, the Committee approached the new inquiry with open minds, seeking new insights to the crucial questions involved.
I would also like to extend my thanks to the small committee secretariat of Richard Selth, Steve Dyer, and Vishal Pandey for their assistance with the inquiry arrangements and processes.
Madam President, I commend this report to the House.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2001-06-18,"—As I was saying earlier when speaking on the Corporations Bill 2001 and related bills, the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001 was introduced on 5 April. Further legislation was introduced on 7 June—including some important transitional, consequential and substantial amendments—and I understand that further amendments are to be introduced when the bill is actually debated for the first time in the House of Representatives next week. Meanwhile the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities has resolved to inquire into the bill, given that it is a substantially different bill to the draft that was circulated last year. This was done immediately so that the Financial Services Reform Bill could be introduced—again, so as to assist the government with the passage of the legislation. But the committee's task has been made harder by not knowing what the whole picture is.
The Labor Party broadly supports the bills that we are examining today to the extent that the bills overcome the constitutional uncertainty surrounding the current Corporations Law scheme. While the arrangement that the Commonwealth has negotiated does reflect compromises and has resulted in increasing the voting power of the states in relation to certain proposed amendments to the Corporations Law, a national system of corporate regulation greatly facilitates business in Australia. The bills have the strong support of the business community as a necessary and relatively immediate solution to the uncertainty which has surrounded corporate law for the past two years. I do however urge the government to commit to finding a long-term solution to a national system of corporate regulation and to rectify any constitutional uncertainties surrounding other cooperative schemes.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-18,"—There is not that much to say about the Corporations Bill 2001 and related bills, except for the need to get on with them and make sure that they become law as soon as possible. The Corporations Bill is the cornerstone of a package of bills introduced in response to the High Court's decisions in Wakim and Hughes and the consequent virtual collapse of the national Corporations Law scheme. The Corporations Bill 2001 and related bills will, in effect, re-enact the Corporations Law as a Commonwealth act, capable of operating throughout Australia. To meet the provisions of the new agreement between the Commonwealth and the states on these matters, a significant rewrite of a number of sections was necessary to avoid the previous constitutional difficulties. The bills are not intended to effect any substantive policy changes. The agreement requires that the new national scheme will operate subject to a five-year sunset provision—which, in our view, is a negative—but it is anticipated that its operation will be extended beyond that period. This legislation will restore a reasonable level of certainty into corporate regulation. The government has given a commitment that the bills contain no new policy measures, and the inquiry of the corporations and securities committee, of which I was a part, confirms that view. Consequently, the Democrats propose to support the bills without amendment.
Due to the need to expedite the passage of these bills, the Democrats do not propose to use the occasion of their presentation in the Senate to further pursue our agenda of amending, wherever necessary, the Corporations Law to address the democratisation of companies and to significantly improve corporate governance. For some years now, I have sought to amend bills relating to the Corporations Law to at least give the option to shareholders of implementing methods of greater accountability into the corporate governance of public companies. So far those amendments have not been successful, although there have been a number which I have been able to get up in conjunction with the Labor Party. I will continue to pursue those changes to empower shareholders and make directors more accountable, and I expect an opportunity to do that with future bills in this area.
There are other issues which require amendment, including provoking greater coverage of the remuneration disclosure clauses. I do know that Senator Conroy is very fond of that particular issue, and I can assure him of our support in that matter. I think this time around the government will be more supportive with the disclosure of remuneration than they were the last time around.
The status of Corporations Law in this country is dependent upon our Constitution. One of the great strengths of Australia might be regarded as its constitutional set-up, but sometimes it creates such real difficulties that you have to have sympathy for those who believe that a substantial constitutional rewrite would be helpful in some areas. The tremendous difficulty had by the Attorney-General and, indeed, his staff in trying to get agreement in this area I think is indicative of a circumstance which is undesirable. In my view, Corporations Law should be unequivocally in the hands of the Commonwealth, and the states should have nothing at all to do with it—and, if I could get a constitutional change to effect that, I would. But there we are: we have to first develop that change and, secondly, put it to the Australian people—and both those processes are very difficult.
The other thing I want to say—apart from the need, after 100 years, for a wholesale review of the Australian Constitution—is about the status of corporations generally in the eyes of the public. Corporations, particularly what is known as the big end of town or big business, attract an awful lot of opprobrium in the general community, and that arises most of all from the power and the effect they have in our society. I think it was the Labor Party who brought out Professor Saul from Canada; he is one of the people who research the powers of corporations world wide. I think it was his research that said that 51 of the major economies in the world are corporations. Those of us in nation states seek to protect ourselves and provide for peace and good outcomes by promoting democracy. It is democracy that protects the world most of all from many of the excesses to which it would otherwise succumb. Therefore, it is in the interests of nation states to pursue the democratisation of companies and to continually review the way in which companies are regulated and the effects and standards that they carry through.
I note for the purposes of the record that there is a company law review, for instance, presently being carried out in the United Kingdom, and a major issue right at the heart of that review is corporate governance. I think it is essential over time to keep reviewing the Corporations Law to ensure that it remains in step with community feelings. Whilst it is my party's belief that, on a taxation basis, as far as possible, entities that conduct business should all be taxed on a similar basis, I also hold the view that we need more diversity in terms of our entities. I think development in Corporations Law of something equivalent to the close corporation as developed in South Africa or the limited size of companies elsewhere in the world needs to be developed—a kind of mini version of Corporations Law that would be more suitable for small business and medium business, and perhaps even for micro business.
The other issue I wish to raise in my general remarks on these bills is the issue of the greater expectations of companies as expressed through legislation and regulation. It used to be that people believed that companies would do the right thing as a result of common values, common ethics and common standards, particularly as expressed through directors and management. More and more, however, there is an expectation that community standards need to be expressed in a prescriptive manner. That happens with environmental regulation. It happens with social regulation such as on health and safety, and we are starting to see real pressure on companies and indeed on legislators to legislate for sustainability measures—what is known as the `triple bottom line', which is awfully difficult to express in accounting terms but is an important view. I note that the United Kingdom government, for instance, in the Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment, and Assignment, Forfeiture, Bankruptcy etc.) Amendment Regulations 1999 have actively promoted ethical standards of investment. The United Kingdom government is taking the view that superannuation schemes and pension schemes have to report on ethical types of investments. A campaign has been running in this country for those sorts of views to be taken on board.
Sometimes it is necessary for governments to try and run ahead of the community, but in this case I think it would pay both the department and the minister concerned, in either this government or the next government, to look far more closely at what the expectations of the community are concerning our corporations and what should or should not be reasonably in the law to reflect that. Far too often the governments of the day focus just on the more efficient or simpler or more legalistic areas to the exclusion of values and value systems which people want attached to our corporations. They want those values and value systems attached to our corporations entirely because of the power, the effect and the impact that corporations have in our society.
However, after having ranged a bit in my remarks, I want to congratulate the government in finally persuading the recalcitrant states to come good on this. They were not all recalcitrant. I think New South Wales and Victoria behaved far better, for instance, than Western Australia and South Australia who both happened to be in the hands of Liberals at the time, although the Western Australian Liberal Attorney-General is a particularly eccentric sort of Liberal, I think. Anyway, well done! The Democrats will certainly support the passage of these bills.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-06-18,"—The Corporations Bill 2001 and related bills are important. They are important bills for the sorts of reasons that have been raised by speakers before me. We have just heard an excellent speech from Senator Murray, who has many wise things to say in this chamber. I must say, though, that there is something I disagree with him about.
—Something more.
—That is right, Senator Murray. We do not agree on everything. Senator Murray took to task the states. This situation was because of the decision of the High Court—and the High Court is always, by definition, right. When the High Court made the right decision, that meant that Australia's understanding of how Corporations Law was to operate was thrown into some disorder. People throughout the country were alarmed—and properly alarmed—and measures were taken. The interesting thing is that after those measures were taken a right result was obtained.
We can be too precipitous in writing laws. We are a federation, and we have all the benefits and disadvantages that a federation brings. But I think we would be alarmed, the country having developed as it has for a hundred years, if we did suddenly have some central power that could make all laws that need to be made and that was the end of the matter. We would become like the United Kingdom, and that may be a problem.
This leads to a consideration of what forms corporate law. At the moment, corporate law is within the portfolio of the Treasurer. When we were in government, it was in the portfolio of the Attorney-General, and there were some great Attorneys-General who had much to say about corporate law. Mr Michael Duffy—you would remember him well, Mr Acting Deputy President Sherry—struggled for some time with corporate law. He was typical because, I think, corporate law is something that will never be settled. There is not, as it were, a situation we can reach where there will be no need for any more corporate law, because corporate law deals with companies and with companies' relationships with lots of other people. If you have relationships like that, then you are going to have the need to adjust the law. Family law, for example, is in a similar position because you are dealing with relationships and relationships keep changing. There are new developments in relationships and new laws need to encompass that.
With company operations, a whole series of relationships occurs. I will go through them all, although they are well known to everybody here. There is a relationship between the people who run the company—the board and the chief executive officer—and the owners, the shareholders. There is a relationship, depending on what sort of company it is, between the customers and the company. There are relationships between the people who work for the company and the company. There are relationships with the community as a whole. We have heard in this chamber many a discussion about companies' responsibilities to the environment, companies' responsibilities to employees, companies' responsibilities to customers, and so on. We have heard that the basic law is that the company's responsibility should be to its shareholders and to its own wellbeing. That concept came out of the common law in the 19th century, as Diane Brown, whom I see here, would know—she is very learned in this area, and I often rely upon her wisdom.
The concept of where company law has gone is interesting. It has been taken out of the Attorney-General's Department, which really deals with human relationships. It deals with the wide thrust of the law, which is really about putting into rules those standards that we should abide by as a decent community. This government has taken company law out of the Attorney-General's Department and put it across to Treasury, whose purpose is to see that the economy runs well and that the wealth of the nation increases. That is not so much concentrated upon the wellbeing of the community generally, except in the sense of getting money so that it can be expended for the good of the community. This brings up the concept of the proper balance between the economy and the community.
It is proper that we make political decisions about the Corporations Law in the context of the Constitution. Good political action requires discussions, an understanding of how things work, the testing of propositions and, finally, the application of wisdom to bring about the right results. Politics has had a big part to play in Corporations Law, and so it should, in my view. That theme is adopted by Mark J. Roe, a professor at the Columbia Law School, who has written a fascinating book entitled Strong Managers, Weak Owners—The Political Roots of American Corporate Finance. In his preface, he says:
I show that politics—democracy in general, and American democracy in particular—affected the organization of the large firm. The interaction between firms and financiers was, and still is, mediated partly by politicians, and that mediation in a democratic society is a central—and neglected—explanation for the organizational forms we observe. Were the title—
that is, the title of his book—
not already taken, a good one for this book would have been The Visible Hand, because the visible hand of politics affected the structures of financial intermediaries, which in turn affected the structure of the large public firm.
He says that the political decisions that have been made over the years in America are central to the way in which companies have developed and that that has been neglected, but he is bringing it forward. In the paragraph above the one I have just read, he says:
American political organization has been important. Our federal system favored smaller, local interests over concentrated private economic power. An American antigovernment bias tended to suppress the alternative of allowing concentrated private economic power, and building a countervailing national political power in Washington: the public would have more easily accepted powerful private financial structures had there been a stronger central government.
I accept that. In his learned address, Senator Murray said that it is a pity that the power to legislate for companies was not all centralised. If it were all centralised, we might have a corporate law which was more efficient in the sense of enabling more money to be made, but then companies' effects upon society may well have been much more adverse.
What the High Court did might not have been as bad as we might at first think. It applied the law according to the Constitution, and that has led to the situation that we have now arrived at: everybody across the board accepts the legislation that is now before us. Although economic efficiency is good and economic efficiency should be encouraged, proper weight should be given to the political process. We are now going through the political process. It has been a good political process. We are coming up with a bill that people find satisfactory at least. The business world can breathe a sigh of relief. The states are comfortable with the bill. Of course, the states can withdraw the power if they feel like it, but clearly, if it works, that will not happen. A referendum giving the right powers to the Commonwealth might be contemplated—it might have been a way out of this—but, in the end, what we have reached is fair enough.
It is not only the Corporations Law that has been changed; all the other law that goes along with it has been changed too. In particular, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Bill 2001 has been brought up to the point where it can operate as was intended, in the same way as the Corporations Law is to operate. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is absolutely essential to the way corporate law runs. Mr David Knott, who presently heads up the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has shown a lot of energy and wisdom in this area, and I want to note that. He succeeded another person who deserves that praise, namely Alan Cameron, who ran that organisation immediately before he did. When he first came to this area, he ran the Australian Securities Commission. In these speeches, I always like to pay tribute to Henry Bosch. He ran the National Companies and Securities Commission. He was a man of great wisdom. He is near my age and anyone near my age must have wisdom and judgment. I am sure that Senator Denman would agree with that, not that she has got anywhere near my age.
The point is that we can have all the good law in the land but, unless we have the right people administering it, it can all go wrong. In that context of people who have contributed, I think we ought to pay tribute to the advisers from the department in the boxes over there who have had to get this legislation up to speed—isn't that right, Senator Patterson?—and which has now been presented in the chamber. I think we ought to give them a bit of praise as well.
—You don't even need their votes!
—No, this is all going to go through. The advisers have made a great effort. They have got together a bill which everybody in the chamber has rushed forward to support. That does not often happen.
—I was just saying that you do not need them to vote and you are making up to them.
—Never! That is a cynicism that does not become you, Senator Patterson.
—I am not being cynical.
—You are, really.
 (Senator Sherry)—Order! Enough of the discussion across the chamber, Senator Cooney.
—Sorry, Senator Patterson—
 (Senator Sherry)—Order! Senator Cooney, please return to your contribution to the debate.
—I did not want to misjudge Senator Patterson; I would not do that. These are important pieces of legislation. The importance of this legislation ultimately is this: companies are now perhaps the most central institution in our society. It has been said that some companies have empires around the world in all sorts of different countries. Some companies have incomes of vast proportions. We must stop looking at company law simply as a means of balancing company rights against the rights of others. We must start looking at company law almost as a constitution for companies so that companies have a set of laws that cause them to act in a way best suited to the community as a whole. Those old 19th century ideas that linger, where those who own the company have what are often selfish ends met and where companies are somehow considered to be a benign influence in the world of capitalism, and that is all, must go and we must start to see companies as they really are: as very big forces in a community. The churches do not have the power they used to have and I do not think politics has the power it used to have. Those powers have decreased, but the powers of companies have increased and it is in that light that we should start looking at corporate law. These bills have given me the opportunity to say those things and, having said them, I will now sit down.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-06-18,"—I follow the remarks of Senator Cooney in this debate and wish to add some short matters to it. I do not intend to take my full 20 minutes. Hopefully, I can say what I want to say in short form. In passing, Senator Cooney referred to the underpinning issues of corporatisation and globalisation which he viewed as going hand in hand. I am not sure if the world is yet ready for a world corporate court. That might be a little further away, although corporations might be pursuing it in their own way.
If it was not for a smart bootmaker, we would not be here today dealing with Corporations Law. The smart bootmaker was Solomon who, in a famous case, started what has brought us to where we are now. The Corporations Law has had a long development, stretching from the 19th century to now. In that long development, there has been an incubation of various concepts that have been teased out and developed. It is an issue that has confronted us throughout the ages. One of the issues that confronted us recently—the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum call it a `recent event'; it has taken two years to deal with Re Wakim, which is not recent, in my view—was a difficult issue and now seems to have been resolved, at least for the states of New South Wales and Victoria, although the caveat is that it can be sunsetted in five years or that either state could withdraw from it. From reading the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum, I understand that the other states will come on board. A couple of caveats also surround their involvement in the system.
In response to Senator Murray's suggestion of a national scheme, Senator Cooney commented on one of the difficulties that have confronted people not only in Corporations Law but in other jurisdictions and other areas in relation to our federalist system. Unfortunately, I did not hear the contribution by Senator Murray, but one can assume it suggested that it would be a lot easier with a national system—devoid of the necessity of dealing with the states. The case of Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd was one of the matters that went through the full Federal Court and then on to the High Court. It was subject to the Re Wakim decision and it found it difficult to get around it. In a sense, it found its way through by using the accrued jurisdiction of the Federal Court, rather than dealing with it as the Federal Court did, in saying it was a matter that was subject to Re Wakim. I am saying that in short form, so the lawyers that are present might excuse me for that. Page 4 of that decision states:
The significance of the decision in Re Wakim appears from the following statement:
`Australia is a federation of a dualist kind, consistently with the common law tradition. While some provisions in the Constitution provide for co-operation, they do not fundamentally alter its dualist character; indeed, if anything, they reinforce it. The nature of the Australian constitutional system needs to be borne in mind in designing co-operative procedures. The issues at stake essentially are questions of principle.'
When dealing with these areas, we must take on board the dualist nature of our system. We do understand that it has to be a cooperative system and, in truth, that is the strength of our system. It is a federation and we can learn from that. If we then deal with it as a federation and as a dualist system, we can provide excellent responses to it rather than, in some instances, treat it as a single system or a unitary system.
The mechanism that has been adopted in the corporations bills has taken some of the elements of a dualist system on board and has developed a unique solution by using a power that was provided in the Constitution to deal with one of these issues. I refer ostensibly to section 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution, which goes to the broader issue of examining how you would then deal with inconsistencies in matters that arose. The 1890s debates of our founding forefathers, when dealing with the Constitution, went to this provision. We could utilise this provision in obtaining the approval of states to move the federation forward. Section 51(xxxvii) deals with:
... matters referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the Parliament or Parliaments of any State or States, but so that the law shall extend only to States by whose Parliaments the matter is referred, or which afterwards adopt the law ...
Perhaps if we had looked at those provisions a lot earlier and tried a little harder, we would not be where we are today, although that is a matter of history.
The report of the provisions that deal with the bill itself takes the history right from the inception—at least, there was a national will to invoke a corporations system which was national in its character and which allowed the business world to deal with the national scene and the international scene and to allow both corporate citizens and corporate entities to further their goals. From memory, its incubation was from about 1961 to 1 January 1991, when we came up with a national scheme. It was not for want of trying on the part of the parties who put their minds to developing a national scheme. However, this current reconfiguration of a national scheme will—I trust the government in this one instance—meet the needs of business, meet the needs of being able to deal in a corporate world and meet the requirements of business for certainty in dealing with both legislation and the contracts that it desires to be made.
The corporations bills, then, are a collection of bills in response to the High Court's decision in Re Wakim and, later, Hughes. The bills are designed to replace the Corporations Act 1989. That present scheme started on 1 January 1991 and is administered by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Central to that national scheme were the cross-vesting provisions, which were seen as the solution to establishing a national Corporations Law. As we discovered earlier, examination of the Constitution itself might have highlighted the solution which we have now adopted. However, the cross-vesting legislation did not survive in its entirety when challenged in the High Court. It is a matter of history now that the High Court cast doubt on the constitutional foundation and the important element of the Corporations Law scheme. The term `cross-vesting' is used to describe legislative arrangements which allow federal, state and territory courts to exercise each other's jurisdictions and which provide for transfers and removals to ensure that cases are heard in the appropriate courts.
So we had a system that said that, in relation to matters where litigants wished to pursue particular cases, they would be transferred to the appropriate jurisdiction to be dealt with. The heart of the cross-vesting legislation was to enable that to occur. The decision in Re Wakim made the cross-vesting arrangements invalid to the extent that they tried to confer state jurisdiction on a Federal Court. The general scheme was established by the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987, which was Commonwealth legislation. Reciprocal legislation in the states and territories was designed to give effect to that scheme. It was useful in that a matter could be instituted in a superior court. It was useful in that the matter could then be heard in that superior court, which was deemed appropriate for that time.
The outcome of the process since the cross-vesting legislation gave that power, particularly in the national scheme that was envisaged in the 1991 Corporations Law, was that we would then have a Federal Court which could develop a body of case law, a body of precedent and a sophisticated expertise in dealing with corporations matters. Of course it was highly regarded, and still is highly regarded, so much so that there has been at least a drive—which is reflected in the current bill before us today—to reinstitute the Federal Court into a pre-eminent position as one of our bodies that deal with Corporations Law in a thoughtful, meaningful, pragmatic and appropriate way.
Unfortunately for the Federal Court, the demise of part of the cross-vesting scheme in relation to the corporations part, on which it relied in dealing with the federal inability to confer state jurisdiction, resulted in a significant reduction of its workload. The number of cases that were filed in the Federal Court dropped significantly—in fact, down to a very slow dribble. The matters, consequently, had to be taken and filed in the state supreme courts, and in effect this was a travelling backwards in time to prior to the cross-vesting legislation when the state supreme courts would deal with Corporations Law matters.
Of course, business likewise argued that it was no longer a satisfactory solution to allow matters to go back to the state supreme courts, although this was not a reflection on the state supreme courts themselves. The short solution to overcome this was seen by the states as at least ensuring that the decisions made by the Federal Court were still sound. The so-called federal courts states jurisdictions act of 1999 was passed. The legislation did two things. Firstly, it provided that parties in judgments of the Federal Court have the same rights as if those judgments were judgments of the state supreme court. Secondly, it provided for state matters commenced in a federal court and part-heard to be transferred to the state supreme court, at least ensuring that parties would not lose their rights.
It did not, however, address what the current bill does—the viability of the national scheme over time—or ensure that the Federal Court would be replaced in its position as the pre-eminent court to deal with Federal Court matters dealing with corporations. The decisions which created so much uncertainty were Re Wakim and, to a lesser extent, Hughes—although Hughes did raise further problems, which I will not go into in great detail today. They are certainly highlighted in a report of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, which examined this bill in detail and reported in May 2001. This valuable report does provide insightful comment about the problems that arose as a consequence of Re Wakim and Hughes.
Let us get to the element most needed by business, the community and people who deal with corporations. Corporations are sometimes given the enigmatic appearance of being large organisations which are faceless, but in essence they encourage trade, they deal with trade, they deal with contracts and they allow the ordinary discourse of business. The solution which was put forward came from a joint meeting of the standing committee of the Attorney-General, which agreed in principle sometime back in August 2000 that the preferred realistic option for resolving the current dilemma would be to proceed with a referral system. However, the devil was in the detail, and that unfortunately foundered on some difficult rocks.
The Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria did agree to overcome the difficulties in any event. The need to ensure certainty and consistency in this area was certainly going to overcome obstacles that arose. At least the target date for parties is 1 July 2000. At this stage we know that New South Wales and Victoria have signed up. The other states are, we understand, in the process or have signed up as we speak. If not, they are not very far away.
There were some impediments: the growth in the federal area to overcome the states and the states were reticent to give up any of their power in relation to the industrial relations area. The solution which was put forward by the Commonwealth was to provide an objects clause about that matter to ensure that there was no desire by the Commonwealth to overcome, through this mechanism, the states ability to deal with industrial relations on a state basis. One of the good things about the mechanism is that it does allow the states to opt out or to walk away if they find the system not working. I doubt that will happen, as Senator Cooney has said. The desire to have a national uniform system of Corporations Law will ensure that the parties maintain a good working relationship, and it does allow the states to have a little bit more say with the Commonwealth about how a national system will work. It provides a return to certainty.
On the matter of how to solve it in the longer term, the legislation is one of those solutions that can stay. An alternative course that has been suggested is a constitutional change. The Senate, more than most, understands the difficulties that can be presented with trying to achieve a constitutional solution or amendment to the Constitution. Also, other matters that could have been taken up which would have allowed a return to certainty may have been canvassed. But in truth the basis of quickness, the ease of bringing the legislation before us and the certainty of restoring confidence in our Federal Court in dealing with national legislation and the Corporations Law suggested that the referral power would, in effect, be the best solution at this point in time. It was seen as a mechanism to allow flexibility for the parties. That was also a matter that was at the forefront of the 1890 debates, when that provision in the Constitution was put in. It was seen as a flexibility mechanism in the Constitution.
In conclusion, the New South Wales and Victorian agreement on the referral will ensure that at least the key problems which have been highlighted in the past about the referral system—whether a state retains power to legislate in a matter which it has referred to the Commonwealth, whether a reference may be made subject to conditions in its excise or duration or whether it can in fact have a sunset provision—will not eventuate. These are matters which were answered a while ago now—in the constitutional commission of the 1980s—in the affirmative. They are still alive today. But it would appear from the overall drive to ensure that there is a national scheme that those problems people perceived will not eventuate.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-06-18,"—I genuinely thank all honourable senators for their contribution to the debate and thank Senator Ludwig for being brief, as he promised at the outset of his remarks.
A couple of remarks made by both Senator Tierney and Senator Ludwig do deserve a response and amplification. Senator Ludwig referred to the fact that we have solved the problem as a federation and we have done so in a cooperative way. We did that as a federation back in 1990. Senator Cooney was the chairman of the committee that handled the legislation that put in place the scheme that we will have in place until this legislation comes into effect. It was rudely shaken by the High Court's decision of last year.
Senator Cooney would remember that the then opposition, which I was a very young member of, ensured that that legislation was passed by the Senate: not without proper scrutiny—we did hold a one night hearing and we put it under scrutiny. He would recall, perhaps better than Senator Ludwig, that even to get to the scheme that we put in place as a parliament and as a federation in the dying days of 1990—it came into effect on 1 January 1991—took an extraordinary amount of effort by the then government. I think Lionel Bowen was the Attorney-General and I think Michael Duffy might have taken over the batten. And it took an extraordinary amount of effort by the parliaments and the Attorneys-General of each of our states and territories, to an extent.
It answers the question that Senator Ludwig asked about why we did not do the referral of powers in those days. I think Senator Cooney and I know the answer to that. States do not give up their power lightly; nor should they. The history of centralised unitary governments is not a good one in terms of protecting the rights of individuals. Australia is blessed with a very strong federation, very much because of the foresight of our founding fathers in ensuring that we had some very strong checks and balances and constitutional and institutional bulwarks against the centralising tendencies of federations. Australia has been very well served there. The evolution of the Corporations Law is a very good example of that.
—Can you take this interjection? You did a very good job on that committee, if I recall.
—Senator Cooney, I think I am prepared to accept that interjection. The more interesting point about my involvement, since the honourable senator has raised it, is in fact that I was—as you would know better than most—very cautious about this new scheme. I was particularly cautious because a number of my friends and colleagues in the then state parliament were cautious. You will recall the Hon. Robert Pike, who was very concerned about the 1990 scheme. Senator Lightfoot was not a member of the upper house in that particular year; he was soon thereafter. Our dear, departed Mr Pike was a member.
There was a group of business people in Western Australia, called the WA Opposition Group—a very distinguished group of lawyers led by Mr Laurie Shervington, now of Minter Ellison I think, and then of Northmore, Hale, Davey and Leake—who formed a group of corporate lawyers and other business people who were very concerned about the centralisation of the Corporations Law under the Commonwealth. I think I can speak accurately for Mr Shervington, who was very instrumental in ensuring the shape of the law. He was consulted by the then Attorney-General and consulted by Mr Lavarch after the law came into effect. Mr Shervington—along with others, I am sure, in the other outlying smaller states—ensured that the intent of the scheme was that the states did have a say in how ASIC would conduct itself, that there would have to be votes when there were substantive changes to the law and that regulations did maintain the intent of the parliament and the people who forged the new scheme. I was privileged to be the parliamentary secretary with responsibility for ASIC between November 1996 and October 1998. I can say that the states—the ministers in particular; the Attorneys-General who made up the ministerial council on corporations—took their roles very seriously, as they always do in these things.
The Commonwealth, although it tended to get its way, had to work very closely with the states on a range of issues and has had to continue to do so. To answer a question raised by Senator Conroy, those same mechanisms that ensure that the states are heard, are in place in this bill. As all honourable senators have said, this is a very important piece of legislation that creates the constitutional certainty that is required. As a result of reforms, particularly over the past couple of years through the Corporations Law Economic Reform Program, Australia has in place a Corporations Law that is the envy of many jurisdictions around the world.
It is interesting to read the debate that is currently raging in Europe over takeovers reform. There is a clear perception around Europe, internationally and across the English Channel in the city of London over the future of the takeovers regime in Europe. It is quite clear from the debate that is raging about that particular important segment of the Corporations Law that, if Europe does not get their takeovers directive right, it will be a massive competitive disadvantage for businesses headquartering anywhere within the European Union. This throws focus on the importance of the Corporations Law reforms that this government has put in place over the past couple of years.
It is crucial for a nation of Australia's size—with something less than two per cent of world capital markets—that all of our Corporations Law, and the law governing our financial sector generally, is at the leading edge. You cannot afford to rest in this area—you need to keep your eye on the ball—so I take this opportunity to once again make a plea to the Australian Labor Party and to the Australian Democrats to look at their opposition to the government's takeovers reforms in relation to the follow-on rule. It is a crucial piece of reform. It is a piece of undone business that will ensure that the performance of corporate boards at the top end of town is put under constant pressure through a real and live daily threat to corporate control. There is a reluctance on the part of the Senate to embrace reforms that would ensure that members of boards, sitting in their comfortable leather chairs, are put under a serious day-by-day threat from the marketplace and to ensure that our takeovers law is in sync with the best takeovers provisions in the world, and they are based in the city of London—
—Just like the club.
—Senator Conroy talks about the club. The takeovers reforms that we propose would break up the club. Most commentators on Australia's takeover regimes believe that boards are incredibly entrenched because the takeovers laws in Australia, which we have sought to reform, make it very hard to launch a takeover bid. We believe that, to ensure that boards do not become comfortable—to ensure that the clubrooms become far more uncomfortable—they should be subject to the pressure of a follow-on rule and mandatory bids that ensure that control can pass in a freer marketplace.
—Senator Conroy wants to defend the comfortable people in the clubs in Collins Street and the clubs in Sydney who become entrenched in their directorships and who are subject to very little competition for corporate control because the Labor Party and their friends on the crossbenches—the Democrats—refuse to ensure takeovers reform in this country and that the takeover code is left behind. We could have a world leading regime in Australia that ensures particularly that our leading ICT sector companies are able to do mergers and acquisitions to give them scale. We are talking about the Corporations Law, and of course takeovers are a crucial part of that. When it comes to takeovers reform and building a good corporate sector in Australia and a competitive environment for corporate control, I will never let a chance go by.
With those comments, I have provided to Senator Conroy written responses to the particular concerns he raised. If he would like me to put them on the record I would be happy to but, really, they say that there are no substantive changes to the law involved. There was also a reference in Senator Conroy's questions to some points made by Alan Cameron, the former distinguished head of ASIC, in relation to some numbering changes and cross-referencing changes that have been made. Apart from that, I can assure you that there are no substantive policy changes. There is also a summary in the document I have provided to Senator Conroy, which I am happy to have tabled, that talks about the progress of the legislation in each of the state parliaments.
I note that, in my home state of Western Australia, the legislation has been referred to a parliamentary committee. I take this opportunity to commend the bill to that committee and to that parliament. This is an important change that has been made, and I can speak on behalf of Laurie Shervington and the people who have worked very hard on corporations matters in Western Australia for the past decade or so in saying that the business community is very keen to see this law put in place. It is very different from what happened in 1990, when there was a reluctance to put in place a new national scheme. The Western Australian business community, including small business, medium enterprises and very large businesses such as Wesfarmers are very keen to see this new scheme put in place. I call on my parliamentary colleagues in the Western Australian parliament to listen very carefully to the business community in Western Australia when enacting this important legislation.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bills read a second time, and passed through their remaining stages without amendment or debate.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-06-18,"—I move:
That the committee insists on the amendments made by the Senate to which the House of Representatives has disagreed.
I would like to make some remarks in relation to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. Senators will recall that the last time this bill was before the Senate the government flagged the view that the provisions we are dealing with, which the ALP, the Democrats and I think some other senators voted to excise from the bill, relates to provisions that enable the ACCC to take representative actions on behalf of them, particularly in relation to the secondary boycott provisions.
The government has made a decision that has been flagged publicly that it will not hold up the many other benefits that will flow from the reform of the Trade Practices Act by seeking to continue the disagreement between the two houses on this issue. I certainly would like to make it clear that the government is committed in a policy sense to pursuing this. We are somewhat bamboozled at the incredible backflip performed by the Australian Labor Party. It is probably not incredible when you are made aware of the policy paucity, the policy laziness, on the other side and also the incredible power that the trade union movement has over Labor Party members and senators. It is not surprising that that power exists, because most members on the other side of the chamber are either active union members or have come from careers within the union movement.
During the last debate, I believe Senator Andrew Murray made the point that he would like to see far greater disclosure of the union movement's donations and influence over the Australian Labor Party. What occurred during debate on this bill earlier this year should ring loud alarm bells with not only Senator Murray and the Australian Democrats but also anyone who cares about parliamentary democracy. We saw on a series of occasions late last year a range of Labor spokesmen making comments about not only how desirable this bill was for Australia but also how desirable this very provision of the bill was for Australia. I quote none other than Joel Fitzgibbon, the shadow spokesman for small business, on 9 November 2000 at approximately 1.22 p.m. in the House of Representatives, when he said:
The ACCC already has the power to take representative actions under parts IVA and V of the act, and it makes sense to extend that to part IV.
...	...	...
This is a sensible amendment and both the Reid committee and the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector unanimously recommended it. 
This chap in the other place was very enthusiastic, and he was joined in his enthusiasm by Mr Kim Wilkie, who I might say is very hard to get enthusiastic about anything. But on this issue Mr Wilkie became almost animated, which again is unusual for Mr Wilkie. He said:
It gives small businesses more reasonable powers to be able to seek redress and fairness ...
He is right. On this occasion Mr Wilkie actually got it right. It may have been an aberration, but he is in fact right. He said:
It gives small businesses more reasonable powers to be able to seek redress and fairness in relation to unconscionable conduct. It is a most important bill—
right again, Mr Wilkie—
given the lost opportunities that the government has had since it came to power to amend and improve the Trade Practices Act.
I tell you what, Mr Acting Temporary Chairman, it is pretty hard to amend things like the Trade Practices Act when you have to bring the bills through this place, the Senate, when you have the trade union movement's advocates sitting on the other benches. Mr Wilkie also said:
Small businesses are crying out for fairer competition laws ...
Hear, hear, Mr Wilkie—yes, they are, and they are crying out for representative actions. So Mr Wilkie was behind us at 5.08 p.m. on 9 November, and he was joined by Stephen Martin, another Labor member. On 27 November, Mr Martin said:
As I have indicated, they certainly chose to support the measure that the Trade Practices Act be amended to give the ACCC the power to undertake representative actions and to seek damages on behalf of third parties under part IV of the act—and that is great; Labor certainly supported that. 
Stephen Martin would know this, because I think at one stage he was the shadow minister for small business. So he would have actually spoken to small businesses about this. At the risk of boring you, Mr Acting Temporary Chairman, I will just repeat what he said:
... and that is great; Labor certainly supported that.
That is, the power to undertake representative actions and to seek damages on behalf of third parties. 
And what are we talking about? What is Mr Martin talking about? He made the point that I made back in March—that is, that taking action under the secondary boycott provisions is something that a Woolworths or a Coles can do because they have a legal department and they have significant resources. If you are the little local super value store or the little local grocery store and you are being affected by a secondary boycott—you might have a lawyer you employ every now and again for contractual or commercial reasons, but you probably never contemplate suing someone and taking action under the Trade Practices Act because of the resources you would require—you would need a bank account of potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars to take these sorts of actions. 
The government has sought to put these provisions in the law to ensure that those small businesses—which are obviously in head to head competition with massive nationwide and sometimes internationally based organisations which can afford big legal departments and big legal bills—are provided with an option, a remedy, a course of action that is open to small businesses. Labor has said no—and sadly they have said no to this important provision with the support of the Australian Democrats. Kelvin Thomson, another Labor member of the other place, said:
The ACCC currently has the power in part IVA and part V, so this change will help make the act more consistent and help to protect small business people. Let me also indicate that I think these changes are very modest and that more action is needed in this area generally.
So he was saying that we should go further—but, again, he was supporting it. That was on 28 November 2000 at 4.51 p.m.
What happened between 4.51 p.m. and 5.12 p.m. on 28 November? This is something that Senator Murray should look at very closely. Anyone who is contemplating a vote for Labor, but who is concerned about the incredible and quite often insidious influence of the trade union movement upon people who are elected by the people and come into this place, should look closely at this and ask Labor: who took a phone call on 28 November 2000 between 4.51 p.m., when Mr Kelvin Thomson spoke in the other place, and 5.12 p.m., when Mr Bevis, the shadow minister for industrial relations—not small business; nothing to do with the Trade Practices Act—spoke? It was 21 minutes. That 21 minutes is the closest parallel to the faceless men photograph and description of the Labor Party back when Gough Whitlam was trying to reform the Australian Labor Party. In that 21 minutes a phone call was received by someone in the Labor Party in this building from someone outside the building. We will not hear who they were, Senator Murray, because they do not have to reveal these sorts of things. Mr Bevis said:
... the Labor Party do not believe that the secondary boycott provisions should be dealt with under trade practices law. 
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—The point I was making before we suspended an hour ago was that between 4.51 p.m. and 5.12 p.m. on 28 November—I am assured that it was a period of about 21 minutes—a telephone call was made from someone in the union movement we would suggest and we saw the Labor Party do one of the most miraculous backflips in Australian political history. Within less than half an hour they went from saying, `What a fantastic amendment this is that we are debating tonight,' to saying—in Mr Bevis's speech on 28 November at 5.12 p.m.—that this was part of some ideological campaign in the industrial relations community by the government. I will remind the chamber that this was 21 minutes later. I find this quite incredible, and it is the only evidence you need to know that the Labor Party in government are certainly a government of the people, by the people, for the people, as long as those people are trade union officials. Twenty-one minutes after Mr Thomson said that this was an important change and a good change to the legislation, Mr Bevis said:
... the Labor Party do not believe that the secondary boycott provisions should be dealt with under trade practices law ... it is our intention to move amendments to carve out the secondary boycott provisions from this bill so that it is clear that the wider, more extensive powers that the bill affords the ACCC are not used as a backdoor method by the government in its ongoing ideological campaign in the industrial relations community.
That comment was made at the same time that Joel Fitzgibbon, the shadow minister for small business, was saying, `This is a sensible amendment'. Mr Wilkie, the member for Swan, said that `small businesses are crying out' for this, and Mr Martin said that this would give the ACCC power `to take representative action and to seek damages on behalf of third parties for breaches of part IV of the act'. That was great. Labor certainly supported that. But 21 minutes and one or two telephone calls later, a huge backflip occurred. We know who is in control of the Labor Party. That seems to be the only reason that Labor have given for this incredible backflip, this awesome abuse of union power within the Australian political process and this abuse of small business. We want small businesses to be able to go to the ACCC and seek the use of representative actions in the case of alleged secondary boycotts. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats do not want small businesses to have that open to them. In fact, the union movement do not want the people to have that open to them. 
The ALP's contention is that the government could use the powers afforded the ACCC in some mythical, ideological campaign. In fact, the record shows that the ACCC has been in a position to take action against secondary boycotts since the current provisions came into effect in 1997 and in that time has undertaken only a handful of cases. Under section 29 of the act a minister cannot direct the ACCC on part IV matters. As I think all Australians know, the ACCC—and I challenge any member of the Labor Party to allege otherwise—guards this independence closely. Small businesses can take action under the Workplace Relations Act but those actions are necessarily restricted to actions provided for by that act and generally speaking must be employment related. The Workplace Relations Act does not give small business the right to take actions arising out of an alleged breach of the anticompetitive conduct provisions, including the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-06-18,"—The opposition support the position we originally took in the Senate that the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 be amended to exclude this government proposal.
—Order, Senator Campbell.
—The parliamentary secretary is getting quite excited. 
—I am amused.
—Well, you can be amused or bemused. The parliamentary secretary talked about the government's interest in small business. Over the last 12 months, the government have let loose on small business the worst regime of regulation and red tape in the history of Federation. That is why out in the electorate small businesses are burning the coalition to pieces in resentment and anger. They were told that they were going to get a better and simpler tax system with the introduction of the GST. They were told that they were going to have a more efficient tax system. They were told in the 1996 election that there would be a 50 per cent reduction in red tape for small business. That was the unequivocal promise by the Prime Minister and the coalition.
The indisputable facts are that, since this government came to office and since the introduction of the new tax system, the tax act has gone from 3,500 pages to over 8,000 pages and the requirement to fill in forms has spiralled out of control. Every day we see stories in the paper of small business being interviewed about the nightmare of red tape and the nightmare of trying to fill in the BAS form. This government said, `It's only one or two pages, but by the way you have to read a 180-page document to know how to fill the one or two pages in.' So for any minister of this government to get up and say that they are in favour of small business and are trying to help small business is just hypocritical in view of what the government has done to small business. I draw the parliamentary secretary's attention to an article that appeared in today's Herald Sun or yesterday's Melbourne Herald Sun Sunday about a businessman reconditioning engines in the Alston electorate.
—Aston?
—Sorry, the Aston electorate. I should not give credit to the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate for having an electorate named after him already. This businessman pointed out all of the things I have just said. He has apparently voted Liberal all his life but feels absolutely dudded by what this government has done to his small business through the tax changes. So with those introductory remarks, I will explain to the parliamentary secretary and the government why we will reject the message from the House of Representatives.
The Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 has come back to the Senate tonight in its original form because the government has rejected Labor's proposed amendments. This is confirmation that in this debate the government is prepared to put the big end of town and its obsession with the trade union movement ahead of the small business interests. Again, the only group of people now cheering on the GST and the tax changes are a small circle of mates of the Liberal Party out of the big end of town. Of course, they have bureaucracies in those big, private companies who can handle the paperwork. The GST was drawn up with the influence of the big end of town who knew that they would have accountants and lawyers to help them fill the forms in. They did not care about small business and what they would have to do. So it is clear that, on any issue dealing with the economy, when this government is faced with a conflict between big and small business big business always wins.
We have known since the lower house rejected Labor's amendments that this transmission was coming back to the Senate, and that is why tomorrow my colleague in the lower house Mr Joel Fitzgibbon, the shadow minister for small business, and I who represent him in this place will be introducing private members bills that pick up the recommendations of the retailing committee. What is the government doing today by rejecting this Senate message? It is putting at risk all of those initiatives that have been begging for adoption since 1997. The Reid committee made its recommendations to the parliament, and here we are in the year 2001 still trying as an opposition to get them through the parliament. Why are we having difficulty getting them through the parliament? The government is allowing its intransigence on this issue and its obsessive hatred of the trade union movement—which has just been shown again tonight by the parliamentary secretary, and we hear it in question time day in, day out—to be ahead of the interests of small business.
The government says that these recommendations were adopted by the retailing committee only two years ago, a committee of which I was a member, and we are still considering them. The government was dragged screaming to the establishment of a retailing committee after Labor took the initiative, and then what did the government do next? It made sure none of the recommendations would ever see the light of day. Mr Bruce Baird, the Liberal member from the lower house, was handed the poisoned chalice as the committee's chair. The government was never serious about implementing any initiatives flowing out of the committee, and it was made abundantly clear to the chair that it would not accept any changes. This was doubly clear when the government rejected the Baird committee's recommendation that a mandatory retail code be established.
The secondary boycott provisions in sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act are not necessary to implement the objectives of the Reid and Baird committees. What the committees had in mind was the misuse of market power provisions of the act. Currently, the ACCC can take action against a firm guilty of misuse of market power and secure fines of up to $10 million. However, that penalty is of no assistance to a small business that has been injured by the actions of a larger player in the market. These matters go to sections 46 and 47 of the Trade Practices Act. At no time did either the Reid committee or the Baird committee consider 45D and 45E to be an issue for small business. These were committees chaired by the Liberal Party with a coalition majority on them. That is the point we make. When the committees dealt with these issues, we got bipartisan recommendations. This is what this government, for ideological reasons, now chooses to ignore.
My colleague Mr Fitzgibbon and I will be challenging members of the government to support those bills as a sign of their commitment to small business. This will be a true test of their mettle and a sign to the small business sector of the Howard government's sincerity towards small business. We know that this sector, as I said in my opening remarks, is tax reform weary, battle fatigued and struggling to keep its head above the water in the government imposed GST environment. We have no compunction in rejecting the government's view on this bill. We have no compunction at all in voting against the message from the House of Representatives. 
What we do look forward to is the debate in the small business community in the next six months about comparing what this government has done to small business with what the small business future should be under a Labor government with an effective roll-back in a number of areas. We cannot unscramble all the egg, but we will be able to make a number of initiatives to improve the small business environment. With this GST tax reform package, one million small businesses in Australia have been left to hang and in many cases go broke or have their long-term interests destroyed by an ideologically obsessed government. We look forward to the debate in the election campaign. We look forward to small business making it clear to this government that they have been sold a dud and they have had their economic prospects and prosperity wrecked for stupid reasons. The government's bill is a mealy-mouthed effort to divert the attention of the small business community away from the GST imposed havoc and blame the trade union movement. We know that is not going to work, and it has not worked. Therefore, the opposition very strongly rejects the message from the House of Representatives and the government's position.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-18,"—The Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 is a good bill. It is a bill that we welcomed. It took far too long to get to the parliament in the first place, some eight months, but it did introduce five out of the 10 unanimous recommendations of the Liberal, Labor, National and Democrat political parties. So five out of 10 was what came forward, and we fully supported those recommendations and approaches. In that respect, Mr Acting Chairman, you would wonder why the government would put at risk what would be welcome changes by the small business community, for the sake of rejecting two amendments from the Senate that do not alter the existing law at all. The schedule of amendments made by the Senate, to which the House of Representatives has disagreed, states that the ACCC can already take actions under the secondary boycott provisions and may seek monetary penalties or injunctions; equally, individuals may seek injunctions, damages or an ancillary order under the secondary boycott provisions. So already there are laws, which both we and the government support, which would not be affected if the Senate amendments were to be accepted; they would just not be strengthened in the way that the government wants.
I understand the government's position, but we have not supported it. In preparing myself for today's debate, I had another look at my second reading remarks on this issue. I will repeat them pretty well verbatim, if I may, because not much has changed. At that time I stated that the amendments:
... remove sections 45D and 45E—which deal with secondary boycotts and contracts affecting the supply of goods or services—from section 87, which will provide for representative actions. Sections 45D and 45E are provisions that are, to a greater or lesser extent, related to industrial action by employees or unions. It is fair to say that, from memory, when the retailing sector committee considered the idea of representative actions under part IV of the Trade Practices Act, no attention was paid to those workplace relations provisions being present in part IV. 
I was a member of that committee; there is nowhere that I can recall them ever being raised. I continued:
They might have been in the minds of some people but I cannot remember their being discussed. As I recall, most of us were concerned about the ability of the ACCC to take representative actions for things like predatory pricing and anticompetitive behaviour. I make the point that, for small business in particular, there is no other recourse but to the ACCC for anticompetitive behaviour but, where workplace relations matters are concerned, small business has recourse to the Industrial Relations Commission.
The Democrats [did] not see that these two need to be combined or that the need [was] readily apparent. When I, as the Democrats' representative on the committee, concurred in the report, I confess that the issue of secondary boycotts and sections 45D and 45E was not in my mind, and I suspect it was not in the minds of the Labor members of the committee, who also concurred in the report. I have specifically asked the shadow minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, about his memory of that, and he said it was not in his mind at the time.
So here we have a committee that reviewed certain small business issues and then came to some conclusions, and the government has extended those conclusions to take in an area of concern—that is, of concern to the government but not at all an area of concern for the committee. To my mind, that is just taking a licence with the views of the committee.
I do not in any way say that the government is not entitled to pursue its legitimate policy views; the government would like to see the ACCC take representative actions for industrial relations matters on 45D and E. But we simply see that as being an unnecessary addition to what is a welcome bill. For the government to overturn or refuse to let the bill go through merely for the sake of that small addition would be foolish. Small business is not going to say, `Well, it's the fault of Labor or the Democrats that we don't have the bill,' because we will be able to explain to them how small the issue is that is being dealt with. They will say, `It's the government's fault for not giving us these very welcome powers and changes,' which as you know, Minister—through the chair—all parties support; there is no-one who opposes them.
With those remarks, I indicate that the Democrats continue to insist on the amendments that the Senate made. I hope that the government will accept that insistence and, if it feels necessary, come back to this issue from its policy perspective in another way at another time—but not in a way that affects or prevents these particular reforms from being accepted and put into law to the benefit of small business.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-06-18,"—I would make it clear to Senator Murray that I have moved that the committee does insist on these amendments, which means that we are all in agreement so far. I would make the point that we are not in any way at all attributing something to Mr Fitzgibbon in relation to what may have been in his mind in relation to agreeing to the committee's report unanimously. He made the point for himself in his own words at 1.22 p.m. on 9 November when he said that the ACCC:
has the power to take representative action under Parts IVA and V of the act, and it makes sense to extend that to Part IV.
...	...	...
This is a sensible amendment and both the Reid committee and the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector unanimously recommended it.
That is what Mr Fitzgibbon said in the other place, as did a number of his other colleagues. It is certainly quite clear—certainly to me—why the Labor Party have changed their mind. For Senator Schacht to then say we are protecting the big end of town and not looking after small business! This amendment has no great advantage to big business or the big end of town. They are quite capable of taking actions themselves. They have the legal resources—to use your words, Senator Schacht—and the accounting resources, if you want to relate it back to the business activity statements and tax reform. They can do that. This is a representative action which allows smaller businesses without the resources of a legal or accounting department and endless financial resources to seek the assistance of the ACCC in these matters. So on this occasion, the Labor Party is siding with the big end of town, knowingly or unknowingly, and letting small business hang out to dry. To accept Senator Murray's invitation: yes, we will have to revisit this. We would like to see the bill pass, for the good reason Senator Murray has made clear. There is a lot of other good law in it and we are not prepared to see it held up any longer because of an ideological obsession of the Australian Labor Party in relation to defending to the death the rights of a privileged few in our society—the officials of trade union movements.

Resolution reported; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,22,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-06-18,"—This Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 2000 proposes to amend the Family Law Act and other legislation to enable superannuation interests to be divided on marriage breakdown either by agreement or by court order. At present, superannuation interests themselves cannot be split but they can be taken into account by the Family Court. This bill will allow the splitting of interests. In the event of a marriage breakdown it is always preferable for marriage assets to be divided fairly between the parties by agreement. Given the complexity of superannuation, fairness demands that an effort be made to ensure that people make informed choices about the division of superannuation assets. This bill requires that the parties to a financial agreement splitting superannuation assets obtain legal advice prior to entering into such an agreement.
I note that a 1997 survey claimed that the average value of women's superannuation on divorce was just $5,590, compared with $26,152 for men. The survey also found that both men and women are ill informed about their spouse's superannuation. In the context of a widespread disparity in superannuation assets and a relatively low level of knowledge about superannuation, the requirement that the parties have their rights explained to them by a professional is a very important safeguard. Other safeguards will exist. Agreements can be set aside if, for example, they are obtained by fraud. The requirement that legal advice be sought prior to entry into an agreement is likely to minimise the number of cases in which that occurs.
We recognise that it will not always be the case that superannuation interests can be split by agreement. It will be necessary for the Family Court to make orders to divide the assets of former spouses. This bill will now allow superannuation interests to be split by court order rather than simply be taken into account. That requires an estimation of the value of existing superannuation interests. In relation to interests in defined benefits plans, that may present significant difficulties, as the present day value of the interest may depend upon future events. Factors such as the ultimate length of service of an employee and the income at retirement can influence the present value of the benefit. The bill and the regulations propose to deal with that in most cases by using actuarial tables. That will usually be a fair approach; however, I note that in some cases alternative valuation methods will apply. In particular, the cliff vesting provisions and the provisions relating to valuation methods supplied by superannuation funds offer alternatives that may be more appropriate in particular circumstances.
The Democrats support the legislation, but we will monitor its implementation to ensure that it operates fairly and provides a workable solution to the problem of dividing superannuation benefits on divorce.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-06-18,"—The Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 2000 was introduced into the House of Representatives on 13 April 2000. The bill will amend the Family Law Act 1975 to provide for the division of superannuation interests on marriage breakdown. The bill was seen by the government as being part of an overall reform package which would include regulations under the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993.
Currently, the division of property following marriage breakdown is a matter governed by the Family Law Act 1975. It allows couples to make their own informal arrangements or use the Family Court in a variety of ways to settle matters between the parties, particularly to make property orders under section 79. However, there have been legal difficulties in dealing with superannuation interests because they are not currently defined as property under the Family Law Act. Doubts have also been raised over the Family Court's power to affect the rights of people who are not parties to the marriage—for example, the trustees of superannuation funds. There is doubt not only whether the Family Law Act authorises that but also whether the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to legislate to enable the court to do so.
The Family Court can, and does, take superannuation interests into account and divides other property accordingly. However, that is far from ideal, because it often means that current property—usually the family home—has to be traded off in whole or in part against superannuation that may not be able to be accessed for many years. In many cases, that may leave one person with a house but no retirement income, and the other person with no house but significant retirement income that may not be accessible for many years. As the Attorney-General observed, the proposed legislation is designed to address the inequity and inflexibility of that situation.
In 1998, there were 51,370 divorces in Australia. A recent Australian Bureau of Statistics study of marriages from 1977 to 1994 concluded that about 43 per cent of all marriages end in divorce. Of those, eight per cent occurred within five years of marriage, 19 per cent within 10 years, 32 per cent within 20 years, and 39 per cent within 30 years. On the value of superannuation policies in Australia, the parliamentary Bills Digest No. 55 notes:
An increasing number of Australian employees now have superannuation policies. The relative value of those policies is increasing and is projected to continue increasing. In 1986, a report published by the Australian Institute of Family Studies ... revealed that of the men and women surveyed, in about 55 per cent of cases at least one spouse had superannuation. By 1997, 81 per cent of the men and women sampled by the AIFS reported that at least one spouse had superannuation. By 1999, 91 per cent of Australian employees had a superannuation account. AIFS estimates that the percentage of a couple's total net assets represented by superannuation increased from about 14 per cent in the late 1980s to about 25 per cent in the late 1990s.
In the lead-up to this legislation, a series of reports and discussions papers canvassed what to do about problems associated with superannuation in the context of marriage breakdown. For example, as far back as 1987, the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Acts entitled Family law in Australia recommended a discretionary power to enable the court to defer the making of a final order in property proceedings until superannuation benefits had been received.
The Australian Law Reform Commission's report Matrimonial property suggests that the notional value of superannuation be included in the value of matrimonial property unless that would lead to inequity. In 1992, the Attorney-General's Department proposed in a discussion paper that on marriage breakdown the vested portion of a person's superannuation interests be reallocated between the parties. In 1992, the Family Law Council recommended that superannuation be divided on marriage breakdown in proportion to the length of cohabitation unless injustice would result. In 1992, the Australian Law Reform Commission's report Collective investments: superannuation made several recommendations, including for accumulation schemes that the court be empowered to order the relative entity to divide the superannuation interests and to roll over the non-contributor's share into an approved deposit fund. It also recommended for defined benefit funds that the court be empowered to order the relevant entity to pay an amount to be determined by a prescribed formula into an approved deposit fund and also that, subject to court approval, the parties could agree to vary their shares.
Since then, there have been a number of other reports. Time does not allow me to go into them in great detail, but I should mention that in 1995 the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services, of which I am currently deputy chair, recommended that in view of the lack of progress the resolution of the treatment of superannuation assets on marriage breakdown should be dealt with as a priority.
I would now like to comment briefly on the separate property regime. The proposed legislation will operate against the background of a separate property regime as opposed to a community of property regime. The Attorney-General's Department explained that the fact of marriage does not create any special property rights in the partners. The department added that each party to the marriage retains, until otherwise decided by the court, or until the parties agree otherwise, whatever property he or she may have had prior to the marriage, and any property acquired in separate names during the marriage. Following marriage breakdown, the court then has a discretion to alter interests in that property. That power is provided under section 79 of the Family Law Act. But it must not make any such orders unless it is just and equitable to do so. In making its orders, the court can take into account a range of factors. Those factors include the contributions, both financial and non-financial, that any spouse has made to the marriage. That includes the acquisition, conservation and improvement of property as well as contributions to the welfare of the family.
A separate property regime has an effect on how superannuation may be divided. The court could not be limited in its jurisdiction only to some amount of superannuation accumulated during the period of cohabitation or marriage. As with all other property, the court has to be given a broad discretion over all superannuation. As the Attorney-General's Department pointed out, the court has to be given two essential matters so that the proposals can operate successfully: firstly, jurisdiction in relation to the subject matter—superannuation; and, secondly, the power to bind third party trustees so that the court's orders could operate successfully.
The legislation proposes to do a number of things. The bill is a continuation of the reform of family law. Under the proposed legislation, couples will be able to divide their superannuation interests on marriage breakdown in the same way that they can divide their other assets. The bill will amend the Family Law Act 1975 to include superannuation within the definition of property, and to allow superannuation to be divided on marriage breakdown in one of two ways: either by agreement of the separating couple, or by court order. The bill will permit separating couples to make binding agreements about how to divide their superannuation interest or interests. This gives people the flexibility to settle their own financial affairs wherever possible and therefore to avoid costly and protracted litigation.
A person holding a superannuation interest may be nearing retirement or another condition of release at which time the actual value of the interest will become known. In such circumstances, or for other reasons, couples may want to defer an agreement about how their superannuation interests are to be divided. The bill therefore enables couples to make an agreement to flag their superannuation interest. This agreement would prevent the superannuation trustee from dealing with the flagged superannuation interest until the flag has been lifted, either by further agreement or by court order.
The bill also provides that when a superannuation agreement is in force, the trustee of the relevant fund will be required by law to give effect to the agreement. Where a couple has separated but not yet divorced, the bill requires that at least one of them will have to sign a document called a breakdown declaration. This declaration will state that the couple is married, but they have separated at the time of making the declaration. If the value of the superannuation interest is greater than the eligible termination payment threshold determined under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, then an additional declaration will be required.
For people to be able to make agreements about dividing their superannuation, they will need information about the fair value of any superannuation interests to be taken into account upon marriage breakdown. For this reason, the bill provides that the superannuation trustee must provide information to the spouse of a partner so that both parties are aware of the details of superannuation interests that are involved.
Valuation is a particularly important issue for defined benefit schemes where there is a vested benefit and an unvested value. The unvested value is generally not accessible until the fund member satisfies certain requirements specified by the fund. This is the most difficult area in reaching an equitable conclusion as to the division of assets. The valuation of an accumulation plan is more easily ascertained. For this reason, the bill provides for different methods of valuing a superannuation interest, depending on the type of interest. The details of how the value is to be calculated, including actuarial information, are to be set out in the regulations. This will ensure that people are aware of the value of the interest they are dealing with in the agreement, and will also ensure that there can be no dispute about how the value is to be calculated.
It is preferable that people make their own arrangements for dealing with superannuation interests. However, if they are unable to agree, the bill provides for the Family Court to have the jurisdiction and power to make an order to divide superannuation interests. The amendments to the Family Law Act, as proposed in the bill, will apply to all marriages, including those that were dissolved before the amendments commence. The amendments will not apply, however, where a property settlement has been finally concluded, whether by formal agreement or by court order.
As I mentioned earlier, the bill provides for some issues to be dealt with by regulation. These regulations are particularly important and need to be scrutinised very carefully. The matters covered by the consultation draft regulations include the following: the valuation of interests of parties; the calculation of the growth factor for base amounts allocated to nonmember spouses under agreements or court orders; fees payable to trustees for splitting superannuation interests; and other matters such as unsplittable interests and payments, the identification of trustees in some cases, provision of information by trustees, prescribed forms, and how the total withdrawal value of a person's various superannuation interests is calculated.
The Senate superannuation committee, of which I am deputy chair, carried out an exhaustive set of consultations in respect of this legislation. While the minister is here, I would like to acknowledge the extensive cooperation we received from the various government departments—in particular, the Attorney-General's Department—with respect to the committee's consultation on this legislation. Generally, it was much greater cooperation, I might say, than we have normally been accorded in respect of superannuation legislation that appears before the Senate.
As I mentioned, there are a number of difficulties—in particular, in respect of defined benefit funds. The issues that create the most difficulty were highlighted by the IAA in a submission to the superannuation committee. They include trustee discretion to split a defined benefit interest while in the accumulation phase, the treatment of partial vested accumulation interests, whether the definitions of accumulation phase and payment phase adequately cover the field, problems relating to trustee responsibilities, the order of deduction for members' benefit components, some implications of the treatment of surcharge liability, the appropriate index to adjust the base amount in defined benefit schemes and the application of a vested benefit minimum. These are some of the details that caused the most significant concern before the committee. Having flagged some of the identified difficulties, I would point out that, generally and overwhelmingly, the vast majority of submissions before the Senate committee were supportive of the legislation we are considering this evening.
I would like to mention a couple of other issues in passing. It is not necessarily always to the advantage of one of the partners in the breakdown of a relationship that they receive a superannuation asset. It is usually the female who receives the family home or a monetary value that is related to the value of the family home. Why is that so? The asset in this case can generally be accessed straightaway, through either the sale of the family home or a payment of money in lieu. Given that females are the custodial parent in 90 per cent of cases, this is often to their advantage, rather than waiting for access to moneys at age 55 or later, depending on their date of birth. It is often to their advantage to be able to effectively access their superannuation moneys before access age is reached. So that is one disadvantage. It is not a clear-cut issue, as many would suppose.
Some of the complaints will end up being resolved by the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. I have no concern about that in itself; however, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal does still have a significant backlog, following a High Court decision about its powers. The legislation will also require an extensive education campaign to inform the family law community and the superannuation industry. I would not underestimate the size of that task. I hope that the government is preparing such a campaign—and I certainly hope that it is not one of the propaganda campaigns we have become so used to in recent times in the form of government advertising. There needs to be an education campaign and I sincerely hope that it is focused on the areas that it is required to be focused on. I hope that it is not part of some political propaganda exercise in the lead-up to the election.
A major underlying issue is the adequacy of superannuation contributions. The level of superannuation contributions has been a matter of some public debate in recent times, and that issue underpins the final retirement incomes of the two partners after a relationship breaks down. Another interesting aspect of this concerns me, the Labor opposition and the entire superannuation committee, and that is that the proposed legislation does not deal with de facto and same sex couple relationships. The reason it does not deal with those is that there is no jurisdiction with respect to de facto couples. It is, as I understand it, clearly in state law. It does seem to me that this places married couples at a disadvantage. De facto couples are covered by a state statute, if it exists, or state common law. They will certainly not be covered by these particular provisions.
It was argued before the superannuation committee that this could act as a disincentive to marriage. Whatever one's views about the status and nature of marriage in our society, I do not believe it is a good thing that one particular relationship is discriminated against over another with respect to the dealing of property rights. This is a general problem in the area of property rights where a relationship ends, but the issue of superannuation does highlight a particular problem. The same issue applies to same sex couples. I take issue on principle. Whatever one thinks of same sex couple relationships, the fact is that the property—in this case, superannuation—is the property of the individuals. It is not up to the state to determine what happens to their own personal relationships, and they should be covered by the same provisions that we are considering this evening.
The Labor Party will be supporting this legislation without amendment. We still have some concerns, which we hope will be addressed in the regulations, but it does follow many years of exhaustive consultation. It is necessary legislation. It is important legislation, particularly given superannuation's growth as a major asset of couples in this country. It should be given greater certainty and greater surety and the rules should clearly be laid down so that they can be implemented in a practical way on the regrettable dissolution of a marriage.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-06-18,"—I rise to speak on the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 2000. This bill before the chamber tonight has the ability to amend portions of another piece of legislation that is still before the parliament. For substantiation of that we need only look at the bill itself, where the government says:
A Bill for an Act to amend legislation relating to family law, and for related purposes.
It does not define succinctly that it is amending the Family Law Act 1975. What we have here this evening can only be equated in reality with what we so often look at on our TVs with great humour: the Yes, Minister program. That is the level we have reached in relation to this bill. We are setting out to amend a piece of legislation that has not even completed its passage through this house.
The superannuation bill will provide for different methods of valuing a superannuation interest, depending on whether the interest is a lump sum or a pension. The details of the information needed and the calculations necessary to value that superannuation and to split it will be contained in the family law regulations. Here, again, we have another problem with the bill that the government is putting forward: it does not give clarity in any way as to how the process will be followed. It merely says that the detail will be in the regulations. There is no doubt that when those regulations are brought before this chamber we will be back in exactly the same situation, where this chamber will have no input into those regulations. We will have no input into the process of how the calculations are made, other than to accept or reject the regulation. Again, we have legislation that is being driven by a process that this chamber does not have the ability to scrutinise fully or amend.
The bill allows that in some circumstances the parties may agree to defer how the superannuation interest is to be divided. Minister, are we legislating to encourage a person, by deferring the settlement on an unfortunate family break-up, to ensure that they do not agree, because there may be a financial benefit to that person by holding out for a later date at which the settlement may be made? I have grave concerns that this legislation will do this instead of creating a situation of a just and equitable separation. The government on numerous occasions have put before us the fact that the legislation may jeopardise their other main criteria: the ability to have a clean break between partners in a marriage that has deteriorated to the point where they wish to separate. I believe this legislation will delay or defer settlement within a marriage break-up. If it is not the government's intention for that to happen, the government need to very clearly and succinctly, through the debate in the committee stage of this bill, set out how they intend to ensure that that is not the result.
The bill also allows the court to set aside a superannuation agreement in certain circumstances—for example, if it is obtained by fraud, if it was otherwise void or where there was a significant change in circumstances. If you wanted a bill so wide that the courts could basically at any time set aside a superannuation scheme, the government has just handed it to you in the way it has drafted this bill—that is, if this chamber passes the bill unamended, as Senator Sherry has indicated.
Section 79 of the Family Law Act provides that under certain circumstances the court can set aside orders in relation to property interests. Section 79A(1) says:
Where, on application by a person affected by an order made by a court under section 79 in proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to a marriage or either of them, the court is satisfied that:
(a) there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of fraud, duress, suppression of evidence (including failure to disclose relevant information), the giving of false evidence or any other circumstance ...
So the act itself sets out the process under which the court can set aside orders and alter property interests. This bill that the government is introducing under section 79 gives the court the ability to change the interests of the parties in a property and, under the new definition of this bill, superannuation will be defined as part of a property settlement. So the court can, if it is satisfied that it is just and equitable, change any agreement that is entered into by those parties.
If we look at some of the other issues that the bill does not address, we see that the issue of great concern is that the bill does not define the time to which the superannuation refers. The bill does not in any way define whether the period over which the superannuation was accumulated was different from the period of the marriage. If a person at a young age enters into a superannuation scheme as an individual and then at a later point enters into a marriage and continues to accumulate that superannuation, the bill does not in any way whatsoever define whether the financial benefit that is derived by that single individual prior to the marriage is excluded from the calculations. 
The bill itself also relates to superannuation agreements that I believe would have too much scope for the Family Court itself. It has the possibility to allow the Family Court to interfere with the arrangements that parties have agreed to and also to frustrate the implementation of those agreements.
In the committee stage I will be seeking clarification from the minister to define certain issues in relation to this bill. I will be asking: what are the words `a significant change in circumstances' going to mean to a person entering into an arrangement? What right of redress will either parties have in relation to settlements made by the courts, if they cannot be agreed to by the partners? Also, I will be asking for clarification from the minister in relation to the splitting of superannuation and whether that spitting will occur in such a way at a defined time that it will deliver for both parties within that process a clean break, so each one can then move forward in restructuring their lives. Will the parties forever have hanging over them the ability of the other person within that relationship at any given time to go back to the court under section 79 and reopen the issues?
I believe that the bill, because it has the potential to amend legislation that has not even completed its passage through this chamber, should have been set aside until that section of the legislation relating to financial agreements is actually completed. This issue relating to the superannuation could then have been addressed in the knowledge of what could be contained within a financial agreement. Today we certainly do not know what implications that other piece of legislation may have. I will be moving a series of amendments to the bill in the committee stage in an attempt to clarify it and to assure that it will be just and equitable for both partners who enter into these agreements and that, where possible, it will ensure a clean break so that each partner can then set about restructuring their lives.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2001-06-18,"—Let me start by thanking honourable senators for their contribution to the debate on this important piece of legislation. The Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 2000 will amend the Family Law Act 1975 to give effect to the government's commitment to enable the division of superannuation on marriage breakdown. For many years now, the Family Court has had to grapple with superannuation being simply a financial resource. It was a contingent interest—it was not one that was available for division immediately upon a separation or upon a court order as a result of property settlement proceedings in the Family Court. So for years there has been this uncertainty. This bill will give relief to all those who go to the Family Court to deal with superannuation, and I think it will serve the community well. 
In general terms, the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) Bill provides that parties will be able to divide superannuation either in its accumulation phase or in its payment phase by agreement or, where the parties are unable to agree, by court order. This bill is one component of the legislative package that will implement the new regime.
There are other parts to this. The Family Law Amendment Regulations will deal with the valuation of a superannuation interest. It is a contingent interest, so it is rather difficult to value at any particular point in time, especially when a superannuation benefit accelerates dramatically on the occurrence of some event such as the attainment of a certain age. The second part is the Superannuation Industry Supervision Regulations, which deal with the creation and certain specific circumstances of a new superannuation interest for the nonmember spouse. Of course, an essential part of this package is allowing the nonmember spouse to have this interest in the superannuation. Thirdly, there are consequential amendments to tax, social security and veterans' affairs legislation which deal with the effects of splitting up the superannuation.
This bill was referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services. In considering the bill, the committee looked at preliminary drafts of the Family Law Regulations and the Superannuation Industry Supervision Regulations, which were released for public comment in October last year. The Senate committee's final report made several recommendations for amendments to the legislative proposals. A number of its recommendations are more properly implemented by amendments to the regulations. Others are more appropriately dealt with by legislation, and that has been accommodated in the other place. As well as that, some other amendments have been made by the government in the other place, which have come about as a result of consultation from interested groups, the judiciary and the legal profession. We now have an amended bill, which includes those amendments.
Perhaps the most notable amendment that the government has introduced relates to the concept of a percentage only interest in this bill. A percentage only interest, which will be prescribed under the Family Law Amendment Regulations, will only be able to be split by the specified percentage method or by a special percentage method applying for such interests. The policy intention is that the interest that will be prescribed to be percentage only interest will be interest for which the only equitable and appropriate method of splitting it is by specifying a percentage rather than a base amount split. That means that, when the superannuation payment becomes payable, the nonmember spouse will have a percentage that would have been ruled by the court or agreed to. This has been a very complex area but one which needed to be dealt with.
I note that Senator Harris has foreshadowed amendments; in fact, he has circulated amendments in the chamber. At this stage, the government are unable to support any of those amendments, and perhaps it is best that we go into the reasons for that during the committee stage. I do thank all those who have contributed to the debate on this bill and also during the course of the inquiry; it has really been dealt with on a bipartisan basis. I think that recognises the importance of this bill. What we have here is a reform to family law which was much needed.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-06-18,"—I am pleased to speak on behalf of the opposition tonight on the important subject of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, which this Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2001 extends for a further five years beginning in the year 2001-02. Export promotion is vital for Australia. Our own market is too small to sustain our standard of living, so we must make our way in the global economy. For many of our industries, our primary producers for instance, this has been well understood for a long time. For our wool, wheat, meat and mineral producers exports have always been crucial, and they have succeeded in selling to the world despite having to confront massive market distortions in the form of trade barriers and foreign production subsidies. Australia's other industries are also widening their horizons. Our exports of manufactures and services are growing. This is crucial, not only because these industries employ the overwhelming majority of Australians—four out of five Australians work in the service economy—but because they are the fastest growing sectors in the global economy. Australia has a competitive edge in many of these areas, whether it is the high-tech fast ferries made by Austal in Western Australia and Incat in Tasmania or the wide range of professional services sold to the regional and global markets by Australian financial, legal, educational and hospitality providers. Australia is already part of the global economy and competing successfully in it. It is a battle not yet won. The global economy is increasingly competitive, and we have to do a much better job of equipping ourselves to compete, a better job of building a knowledge nation. It is in an export oriented economy that Australia's future lies.
The expansion and broadening of Australia's export base over the past 20 years has brought benefits not only in terms of export revenue. The increase in export orientation of our businesses is also changing our industrial landscape. Studies have consistently shown that exporting firms provide better paying and more interesting jobs than firms that rely solely on the domestic market. The most recent study into this issue, conducted jointly by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Trade Commission, found that exporting businesses paid their staff on average $17,000 more than non-exporting businesses—a massive 60 per cent more. Other findings of the study were that export businesses were more likely to employ people on a full-time basis and were more committed to staff training than non-export businesses. So trade is about more than the business bottom line. It is also good news for the wider economy and for Australia's workers. Yet it is sometimes argued that the increasing exposure of the Australian economy to trade is a bad thing for workers. From this assumption comes the conclusion that constraints to trade will benefit workers and that their interests would be served by Australia withdrawing from involvement in the global economy.
I should say that these ideas do not have political boundaries. They are heard across the political spectrum and in the country and city alike. It is true that changing patterns of trade will affect workers in some industries. There are some industries in which Australia is not as globally competitive as we might wish. But technology is an even more important driver of economic change, and the answer to issues of employment does not lie in trade barriers any more than it lies in trying to hold back new technology. After he had done considerable work on this subject, the Nobel prize winning economist Amartya Sen said recently:
The economic predicament of the poor cannot be reversed by withholding from them the great advantages of contemporary technology, the well-established efficiency of international trade and exchange, and the social as well as economic merits of living in open rather than closed societies. Rather, the main issue is how to make good use of the remarkable benefits of economic intercourse and technological progress in a way that pays adequate attention to the interests of the deprived and the underdog.
Sen identifies the key issue before government today: how to use the tools of government to harness the benefits of trade and shape economic outcomes on the ground. Governments need to recognise that trade can have dislocative effects for particular industries and for particular workers, and they need to respond by implementing policies that ensure that we do not leave people behind. This means constructive industry policy and safety net policies, not an outdated and obsessive attachment to trickle-down economics.
Accepting the economic theory underpinning trade—that is, trade's potential to raise living standards—is important, but even more important is accepting the responsibility that governments have in managing the impact of globalisation. The Howard government tries to tell people that trade is good for them, but it has no strategy for explaining why trade is good for the Australian economy and it has no strategy for dealing with circumstances—real circumstances—where particular industries and workers are adversely affected by changing economic patterns due to trade or some other factor or combination of factors.
The opposition are committed to ensuring that Australia competes successfully in the global economy—we are confident in the ability of Australians to do so—but we do not believe that the approach based on telling people to take their medicine and sit down is an effective substitute for policies designed to address real, everyday situations. Unlike the government, we are not slaves to the market. Rather, we will seek to use the levers of government to ensure outcomes that deliver the benefits of trade to all Australians, not just to those businesses and individuals already succeeding in the global economy. The Labor Party is proud of the decisive role it played during the Hawke and Keating years in restructuring and internationalising the Australian economy. These changes, frequently opposed by the coalition parties when they were led by Mr Howard in opposition, had many benefits. One was a sea change in the way in which Australian businesses viewed the global economy and a subsequent explosion in our exports. That explosion was based on fundamental restructuring—that is, on something more than US50c to the $A1.
It was under Labor that Australia became fully connected to the global economy and it was under Labor that trade became a crucial contributor to our national wealth. Trade is now responsible for 40 per cent of our GDP. That came about because we had a view of trade as part of a broader economic framework. We still hold that view and we will work in government to ensure that trade policy serves the economic interests of the entire Australian community.
One part of our work when last in office was the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. That was an original Labor scheme set up by Gough Whitlam and Jim Cairns. The idea was a visionary one, predating the contemporary debate about globalisation and free trade. It was based on a simple premise: that smaller Australian businesses should be encouraged to develop an export culture and seek out export markets, and that they need some help to get started. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme operated effectively from the start, and it was refined by the Hawke and Keating governments. I am pleased to have had a role in that process, having overseen the scheme as minister in 1993-94 and having become well aware of its effectiveness while also serving as industry minister in the Keating government.
The bill represents the Howard government's response to the latest review of the EMDG conducted by the Austrade board last year. Before talking about the government's weak response to the review, I would like to say something about the Austrade board's findings. The board confirmed that the EMDG is a highly successful program. It is worth noting some of the conclusions of Professor Ron Bewley of the University of New South Wales, who conducted an econometric analysis for the review. Professor Bewley found, amongst other things, that during 1997-98 each grant dollar from the scheme resulted in approximately $12 in additional exports. He further estimates the additional tax return from these additional exports as being between $25 million and $29 million. Beyond the scope of Professor Bewley's analysis, of course, is the flow-on to employment and the other positive effects of this economic activity.
While one should always view the results of that sort of economic analysis with some caution, there is no disputing the central conclusion: the investment made by the taxpayer through the EMDG Scheme is returned many times over in the form of increased economic activity, export and tax revenue, and jobs. The public benefit of government programs is sometimes not as clear as it might be. But the EMDG Scheme has clearly been a success by any measure. 
As I have noted, Professor Bewley's work was part of a broader review of the EMDG. The review found that the EMDG was generally meeting its core objective: encouraging the creation, development and expansion of foreign markets for Australian goods, services, intellectual property and know-how. The review also found that business is investing the full value of grants back into export promotion activities. Before approaching the government's response to the board's specific findings, we need to address some core issues about the Howard government's mishandling of the EMDG and its lack of support for small business, the constituency that the government likes to regard as its own.
The fact is that the EMDG has been put through the wringer by the Howard government. The scheme got caught up in the wholesale slashing of government services in 1996-97 when the Howard government took a blunt axe to all government programs, irrespective of their effectiveness. We are still seeing the results of the mess created by the 1996-97 budget, from public services withdrawn only to be subsequently restored in a response to the electoral backlash to government assets privatised and outsourced and their value to the community diluted or lost.
In my shadow portfolio area, resources were slashed from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, diminishing our international influence in a host of ways, including our capacity to support Australian businesses internationally. The EMDG was another baby thrown out with a few drops of bathwater. Despite its success, it was slashed too, giving us an early signal of the impotence in the government of the foreign minister and successive trade ministers, although at least we saw Tim Fischer doing some trade policy work, not just issuing endless press releases congratulating exporters.
It is worth taking a moment to calculate the damage that this government has done to the EMDG. With the funding cap applied in 1997 and extended by this bill until 2006, real funding in 2001-02 will be 37 per cent lower than it was in 1996-97, the last year that Labor's EMDG Scheme operated. Recipients in 1996-97 totalled 3,851. In 2000-01, only 2,956 businesses received funding under the scheme, a decline of nearly 25 per cent. Worse still, the funding cap until 2006 means that, by then, funding in real terms will be barely half of what it was under Labor. To illustrate the point in stark terms, if real funding in 2001-02 had been retained at the 1996-97 level, $234 million would have been available as grants for Australian exporters next year. Using Professor Bewley's analysis as the basis, this amounts to $1.1 billion in additional exports forgone, along with approximately $16 million in additional tax revenue. This is a strange response from a government that still trumpets its support for exporters and small business.
The truth about this government's commitment to this country's small business lies in its performance. The recent budget had absolutely nothing for Australia's small business community. They were entitled to think that they would get some relief. After all, Mr Howard promised before the 1998 election that red tape would be cut by 50 per cent and that the GST would improve small business cash flow and profitability. Of all Mr Howard's broken promises, surely this is the one that rings most hollow to Australian small business today.
The reality is that small business now has the massive, costly and time-consuming burden of the GST, with no help in sight. The budget has no compensation, no simplification, no extension of the write-off period for investment in GST related plant and equipment, and no changes to the many and different thresholds that determine eligibility for the simplified tax system and the simplified accounting method.
Now this bill compounds the disappointment for small business. At a time when the export climate has rarely been better, driven by an ultracompetitive Australian dollar and an improvement in Australia's terms of trade, the bill does nothing to lower the hurdle confronting Australian small business. The favourable exchange rate is, of course, good for exporters although it is not good for all parts of the economy, as shown by the precipitate recent decline in imports of capital goods. But small and medium sized businesses can only benefit from the low Australian dollar if they can get themselves established in export markets, and they can only do that if they have the capital to commit to the necessary promotion and marketing. However, small businesses do not have that ready cash because they have been mugged by the GST—mugged in terms of the capital forgone as a result of GST payments, and mugged in terms of the drain on their financial and human resources from the compliance burden.
This is the context in which we should see this bill: a small business sector in Australia that continues to suffer under the impost of an unfair and regressive tax. And now, as businesses grapple with the GST-BAS nightmare, we have this half-hearted effort. We should be under no misapprehension: it is not an easy thing to step into exporting, especially for small companies which are perhaps relatively new businesses. Governments can help not just by reimbursing a proportion of marketing costs, as the Export Market Development Grants Scheme does, but also through the technical advice provided by Austrade and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. But this assistance amounts to very little in the face of the incessant GST compliance nightmare.
I have discussed the EMDG funding situation. It is clearly inadequate. It is also a matter of concern that Austrade's administration of the EMDG seems more focused on compliance than on export promotion. Close to 20 per cent of reimbursement claims are rejected by Austrade. This suggests that businesses are not being well enough informed about their entitlements under the scheme. It also raises the question of whether the cap, $150 million less $7.5 million in absorbed administrative costs, is dictating decision making under the EMDG. If this is the case, the scheme is meeting the needs of bureaucratic bean counters rather than the needs of small businesses seeking to make their way in the world.
However, there are other concerns about the way the scheme operates identified in the Austrade board review. It is clear, for instance, that smaller businesses have little incentive to claim small grants under the scheme as it is currently constituted. In contrast, larger enterprises with more flexibility to commit to export promotion in the first place stand to benefit from the scheme more directly. This seems to run counter to the rationale of the EMDG, which is to encourage an export outlook amongst businesses that might not otherwise be attracted to the often uncertain export market.
The Export Market Development Grants Scheme needs to focus clearly on the needs of smaller Australian companies. It does not need to provide long-term assistance to companies that are already globally engaged or which already have the capacity to sustain significant export marketing budgets. We are seeing fewer and fewer small businesses accessing the scheme and we are hearing more and more stories bemoaning the difficulties of accessing the scheme. Yet this bill is complacent. It does not address those concerns and it is clear that the government, having shut the policy shop up until the election, is content to pay lip service to the export needs of our smaller businesses. This bill also continues the Howard government's snub of the Australian tourism sector. For this important sector, too, there is nothing in the budget except, of course, for a hike in the passenger movement charge, one of Mr Howard's non-core taxes which, like his non-core promises, he prefers not to count.
This bill belatedly makes the meetings industry eligible for EMDG grants, something that Labor had agreed to in 1995. Unfortunately, it was another casualty of the 1996-97 budget. Such is their embarrassment about their neglect of the tourism sector, we now have the government making misleading statements about the timing of that sector's inclusion in the EMDG scheme. Two weeks ago we had the member for Cook, who should know better, say that tourism first became eligible for the EMDG under the Howard government. It did not. Inbound tour operators were brought into the scheme in 1990 by the Hawke Labor government. Later, the Keating Labor government expanded the scheme to cover tourism suppliers. It does the government no credit to be compounding their negligent approach to this important industry by seeking to fudge the public record on tourism's access to the EMDG.
Labor will support this bill. Australia's small and medium sized exporters need this scheme to help them get started in the global market. But this bill has been a long time coming—the Austrade board review of the EMDG was completed a year ago—and it represents a tepid and inadequate response to that review. It leaves the EMDG significantly underfunded, and it misses the opportunity to calibrate the scheme more effectively for small businesses. Unfortunately, this is not surprising. It continues the Howard government's sorry record on export promotion and support for small and medium sized Australian companies. Those businesses are entitled to feel disappointed that their needs are not being addressed by a government that has run out of ideas on trade and that takes Australian small businesses for granted.
When Labor return to office, we will clean up the mess the Howard government has made of export promotion and its wider neglect of Australian small and medium sized businesses. We will do it promptly and in a way that will enable small business to play a much stronger role in the export market. With the dollar at these levels, we should be creaming them everywhere. But if small business cannot get access to the market because of other compliance costs and the GST, it does not matter what the exchange rate is; it will still not succeed.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-06-18,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2001. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme has been in operation since 1974, in various forms, providing funds to small and medium sized businesses in order to assist them with the cost of promoting and developing export markets. By most accounts, the program has been a success. Recent reviews indicate that the scheme has developed an export culture, has assisted businesses to establish products and reputations and has resulted in an increase in export earnings.
A broad range of industries has accessed these funds: the tourism industry, the IT industry and many others. Submissions to the recent review of the scheme indicated a broad level of support for the scheme from businesses. Those submissions also made a number of proposed changes to the scheme, many of which have been incorporated in this bill. Whilst it is positive to see the government supporting investment in small export businesses as a long-term investment in a healthy economy, it is unfortunate they are not more willing or able to take the same long-term view in relation to education, health and the environment.
With one exception, this scheme provides blanket opportunity for people from various industries to access the scheme and, therefore, makes no attempt to articulate social policy. It is purely economic, dollars and cents, driven. The one exception is the prohibition contained in the bill in relation to X-rated material. The government is saying that it does not want to use taxpayers' funds to subsidise the expansion of an export industry in X-rated material. That is not something the Australian Democrats are expressing any opposition to. It does indicate that there are clearly circumstances where the government is prepared to exclude particular industries—in this case, for social policy reasons—being able to access subsidies under this scheme, even though those industries are not illegal in Australia. Any illegal industry is not able to access this scheme either. That single exemption does not constitute policy, but it does indicate the possibility of achieving policy objectives through financial and market mechanisms.
The Democrats believe the scheme presents an opportunity to represent a comprehensive collection of community values. We are moving a few amendments to the bill which would allow the scheme to reflect more broadly legitimate community concerns and concerns of the Democrats. These amendments do not pretend to be a comprehensive expression of Democrats policy but would serve as the beginning of a framework in which good investments can also be good policy.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2001-06-18,"—When in Toronto recently, meeting with World Bank and political representatives interested in tightening the financial laws giving enhanced credibility to developing countries, my attention was drawn to news of some proposed new Canadian securities regulations guidelines directing when corporate information should be made public and to whom it should be made public. In Australia, the larger investment managers have an advantage over John Citizen the investor in that some fund managers, given their size and investment strength, are able to secure advanced private briefings and, in the process, are presented with inside information and other data that can be useful in their giving advice whether to buy, hold or sell certain stock. This information is supplied ahead of information in official company circulars to shareholders.
The Canadian securities regulators have recently recommended tighter disclosure guidelines for companies in order to provide a smoother playing field for all investors. In the past, analysts and other investment professionals have had the upper hand over the average man-in-the-street investor, with better access to key executives at publicly traded companies. This has meant that important information has been filtered through these specialists. That filter has now been removed. This means that everybody in the marketplace, both professional analysts and small private investors, will have the same information at the same time.
Canadian security regulators two weeks ago issued draft disclosure guidelines that will raise the bar on how companies disseminate information, including information on their performance and their future plans. Their recommendations include: adopting a policy that opens analyst conference calls to anybody interested in listening via telephone or the Internet; tighter policies regarding company comment on draft analyst reports to guard against any direct or indirect earnings guidance slipping out; observing a quiet period near the end of the year or the end of the quarter before the publication of earnings; and, lastly, keeping company web sites updated and accurate.
If the policy is officially adopted later in the year, it will be good news for all investors—both people who research their own stock and those who are thinking about becoming more active. The guidelines would not be compulsory, but most firms would be hard-pressed to ignore them. The first and last recommendations regarding conference calls and the Internet are particularly important in the way they provide the prospective investor with a great deal of necessary information when making decisions about their money. Prospective investors would be encouraged to listen in on the conference calls when executives are available to analysts and the media to account for company performance.
The key executives open up with presentations about the company performance over the past quarter and where the company is headed, followed by a question and answer session. These conference calls will give the investor an insight into the company and a feel for the capability of the management team. Traditionally, only analysts—the people who evaluate the stocks and make the recommendations on their purchases—were allowed to sit in on the conference calls. Opening these conference calls to all interested parties means that investors can make their own judgment on all aspects of their investments. Investors need to pay attention to the questions asked by the experts, which in the past would have been asked behind closed doors.
The recommendation to use the Internet has a great deal of merit as it is now one of the best tools for investors. The Internet enables people to examine a variety of analysts' reports and then compare the information. Investors should also be encouraged to attend annual general meetings and to visit the corporate web sites or one of several independent Internet sites, such as www.globe.investor.com or www.sedar.com.
With the new guidelines proposed by the Canadian securities regulators, one-to-one meetings will be a thing of the past, and all questions will be asked in a public forum. Through these methods investors can gather data on companies' track records and their earnings history. Armed with this material, they can plan their own future with a lot more assurance. Perhaps now is the time for the Australian Stock Exchange and the Australian regulator ASIC to follow the Canadian example.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Investor Protection: Corporate Disclosure</title>,Adjournment,25,1
