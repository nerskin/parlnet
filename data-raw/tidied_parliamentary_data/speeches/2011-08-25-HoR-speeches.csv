Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (09:03):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Although it is one of the harshest environments on the planet, Antarctica is also one of the most vulnerable.


Australia continues to take a leading role to secure protection of this fragile environment including through participation in Antarctic Treaty consultative meetings, which are the annual meetings of countries which have an interest in Antarctica.


The 2005 Antarctic Treaty consultative meeting requested the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to examine ways to restrict the use of heavy grade oils in Antarctic waters.


Consequently, the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee adopted, on 26 March 2010, amendments to Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) to ban the use or carriage of heavy grade oils in the Antarctic area except where it is necessary to secure the safety of a ship or in a search and rescue operation.


The amendments to Annex I of MARPOL entered into force internationally on 1 August 2011.


The purpose of the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment (Oils in the Antarctic Area) Bill 2011 is to amend the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 to implement these amendments.


This bill will apply the ban on the carriage or use of heavy grade oils to all ships in the Australian Antarctic Territory and to Australian ships elsewhere in the Antarctic area.


The possibility of an oil spill in the Antarctic area is relatively high.


Ships navigating in these waters face a number of risks including icebergs, sea ice and uncharted waters.


The rationale for banning the use and carriage of heavy grade oils in the Antarctic area is that they are more environmentally hazardous than other marine oils because they are slow to break down in the marine environment, particularly in cold polar waters.


It is likely that a spill of heavy grade oils in Antarctic waters would persist for many years and could have a major impact on any wildlife populations in the vicinity, particularly on penguins and other seabirds.


The bill imposes a maximum penalty of $220,000 on both the master and owner of a ship in the event of a breach of this ban.


As a government, we are committed to preventing and reducing marine pollution where possible.


This bill will help to ensure that the Antarctic area remains free of significant pollution damage.


I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (11:10):  The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011 does recognise that there should be a transfer of certain functions from the Australian Taxation Office and APRA to Medicare Australia, and following on from what the Minister of State at the table just talked about with the redesign of Human Services, I can say to you that nothing would be more emblematic of the redesign of Human Services than the fact that Medicare Australia is now providing back office superannuation processing. When I was the first Minister for Human Services back in 2004 and when I created the department, I would not have thought that it would ever have these sorts of functions or that it would totally incorporate Centrelink and Medicare. I must admit that I am agnostic at best about the thought that that integration should have occurred, but it is what it is and my colleagues have explained their position on it.


I would like to state at the outset that the coalition will not be opposing this bill. As with many bills that come into this place, we work together, contrary to some perceptions. This bill amends the law relating to superannuation. It transfers responsibility, as I said, from administration of early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds from APRA and the Australian Taxation Office to the chief executive of Medicare. This change will be of assistance to Australians who have already been granted early release of superannuation on medical grounds. These people would already be in regular contact with Medicare and it will reduce the number of government agencies with which they will have to deal. This change makes sense as Medicare Australia already undertakes the general administration associated with processing of early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds. It is expected by the government that there will be little additional cost associated with this change.


Amendments to the regulations under a number of acts will be required to enable the chief executive of Medicare to administer the early release of superannuation. Firstly, it is APRA which currently administers the regulations under the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 which make the determinations on whether an amount of benefits in retirement savings accounts may be released on compassionate grounds. This responsibility will now be handed to the chief executive of Medicare, and I just reflect on the fact that it was the coalition that established retirement savings accounts back in 1997 to provide some level of comfort to people who had had multiple jobs at the time and wanted to have a single, consistent superannuation account. That was the background, in a sense, to the retirement savings accounts.


Secondly, APRA currently administers regulations under the SIS Act, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. These apply to APRA regulated entities where funds may be released on compassionate grounds. Responsibility for administration of this will now be handed, again, to the chief executive of Medicare. Finally, the Commissioner of Taxation currently administers regulations made under part 3 of the SIS Act and determinations about whether benefits paid in self-managed superannuation funds will also be transferred to the chief executive of Medicare.


In providing support for this bill, I would emphasise that the coalition does not support any changes to the rules which determine whether superannuation can be released early on compassionate grounds. This is a very important point, because essentially there has been bipartisan agreement on having very strict rules about the early release of superannuation. It is often the case, as members of parliament, that people come to us and ask, if not beg, to have early access to their superannuation on the grounds that they have temporary financial troubles or due to an event that has occurred.


Accessing superannuation must be the absolute last resort, because that money is meant to get you through the days when you are essentially unable to work full time and fund your quality of life, and a dollar saved in superannuation today can represent multiple dollars in the future. The coalition supports the government's call that the limited circumstances for early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds be preserved and the criteria for early release not be changed. Superannuation must remain the savings for retirement, and it should only be in extreme circumstances that the funds can be withdrawn.


This week in the House the Assistant Treasurer ran through the government's proposal to increase the compulsory superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent and criticised the opposition's lack of support for this initiative. His criticism was misplaced and obviously rather political. The coalition strongly supports superannuation. Compulsory superannuation is a key pillar of a system which, along with the age pension and the incentives and voluntary savings, helps all Australians to prepare for a reasonable quality of life in retirement. The coalition will continue to support changes that make our superannuation system more efficient, transparent and internally competitive and that deliver better value to superannuants across Australia. In particular, sensible changes to streamline super fund operations and to strengthen corporate governance arrangements should be progressed by the government as a matter of priority. My colleague Senator Mathias Cormann, in the other place, has said that on numerous occasions.


Having said that, we do not support the proposed increase in compulsory superannuation as it stands as part of the government's offset to the mining tax. That is because it will be funded by the increase in the mining tax and the coalition is opposed to the mining tax. We have said before that, as it stands, we will rescind it in government and we will unwind the expenditure linked to it. Rather than increase compulsory superannuation, our preference is to look at other areas of voluntary savings to complement the nine per cent in compulsory super. We have been very concerned about the lack of trade-off. Although the former minister for finance was more willing than the current minister to state that the increase from nine to 12 per cent would come out of business rather than out of the net salary of workers, the fact is that the government has not been clear on where the extra three per cent is meant to come from. Is it meant to be a trade-off for increased wages? Will employees have less money to take home? Is it going to mean a greater cost burden on small business in particular?


This is a very important point, and I suspect what heavily influences it is employment pressures. If the unemployment rate is around 4½ to five per cent then of course there is greater pressure on employers to stump up the extra three per cent. But, should there be rising unemployment, this may well represent a further incentive for employers to reduce their workforce, because this increases the cost of employing people. Alternatively, and perhaps even more realistically, increasing compulsory super with a rising unemployment rate may well mean that people will have less money to take home. Given that the government are introducing a carbon tax and have in place a flood levy, and given that they will not pay for the $4.2 billion black hole associated with the carbon tax—a $2.9 billion hole this year alone—I would say that the Australian people know, and they are instinctively right, that when the government cannot make their sums add up they inevitably go back to the Australian people to try and make up the money.


Instead of forcing workers to defer extra wages, the government should be focusing on improving the performance of the super industry, although competitive pressures themselves should do that. It should not be up to the government to improve the performance of the industry; the industry should be competitive enough to do it itself.


We are looking at, and considering carefully, a number of different areas of superannuation in the lead-up to the next election. For example, the coalition will make sure that the process of selecting default workplace superannuation funds under modern awards is open, transparent and competitive—something that the government promised to do but failed to deliver. The Henry report identified that nine per cent superannuation was a sufficient level for compulsory super guarantee contributions but recommended a series of changes to the taxation of superannuation. Dr Henry made the point in the report that increasing the superannuation guarantee beyond nine per cent would most heavily impact on low- and middle-income earners. The additional burden of the payment would not be borne by business but would, rather, be funded by reducing the growth in take-home pay. So more of a worker's income would be put aside in superannuation rather than be paid today. Effectively that means that there would be a reduction in the take-home pay of the lowest paid workers if they had this increased contribution. That was Dr Henry's take on it. He is now a special and rather privileged adviser to the Prime Minister.


Out of all that, where are we? Before the 2007 election the Labor Party promised not to change superannuation laws. It, of course, broke that promise by changing the rules regarding concessional super contribution caps over the last three budgets. Labor halved the concessional contribution cap from $50,000 to $25,000 for Australians under the age of 50. Australians under 50 can no longer save over $25,000 in superannuation each year without being charged excessive tax rates. Labor also halved the concessional contribution cap from $100,000 to $50,000 for Australians over 50 years of age. The changes for over-50s have particularly concerned older workers nearing retirement. The changes have discouraged them from making sufficient contributions late in their working lives. These changes were simply made as a revenue measure; they were not made for any other reason. This government is a big-tax, big-spend government. Wherever it can get money and then go and spend it to control people's lives it will do so.


One initiative the coalition will support is the Cooper review recommendations for improving the administrative efficiency of the super industry. These initiatives are collectively called SuperStream. SuperStream is a package of measures designed to improve the back office of superannuation. It proposes the increased use of technology, uniform data standards and the tax file number as a key identifier of member accounts. That is a good thing. The coalition's support of SuperStream is consistent with our commitment to facilitate improvements in industry efficiency.


Another area where the government action is welcome, although overdue, is in changes to excess contributions tax penalties. ATO figures reveal that more than 65,000 Australians will be hit with penalty tax after inadvertent breaches of the concessional super contribution caps during the 2009-10 financial year. The problem obviously has escalated during 2010-11. Since 2007, Labor has collected $180 million in excess contributions tax at an estimated administrative cost of $60 million to the Australian Taxation Office.


In the 2011-12 budget the government announced that it will provide eligible individuals with the option to have excess concessional contributions taken out of their super fund and assessed as income at their marginal tax rate rather than incurring the tax penalties. Well done. The measure will apply where an individual has made concessional contributions of up to $10,000 in a particular year. It is only available for breaches in respect of 2011-12 or later years, and only for the first year in which a breach occurs. The coalition says this is common sense. However, I do recognise the efforts of my colleagues Senator Mathias Cormann and the member for Casey, who have been prosecuting the arguments.


Returning to the bill before the House, the transfer of administration responsibilities for the early release of super on compassionate grounds from APRA and the ATO to the Chief Executive of Medicare is a reasonable change. The coalition will not be opposing this bill.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2011-08-25,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (11:26):  I speak in support of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011. About 20 years ago, the Keating Labor government introduced one of the most significant economic reforms in the history of this country, the superannuation guarantee, which started at three per cent. It increased progressively to the current level of nine per cent, where it has stayed since 2003.


I was listening to the member for North Sydney's contribution in relation to this bill. It took me back. His forebears used the same arguments opposing Labor's reforms with respect to superannuation. In fact, all the way through, the idea of compulsory superannuation was denounced by the coalition as a job-destroying, antibusiness measure and a damaging, economy-destroying measure. Compulsory superannuation was opposed fiercely even though it would create financial security and dignity for older Australians. These are the same sorts of arguments that we hear today: 'We're all ruined,' is what they say—constant fear and smear.


That is all wrong, of course—wrong, wrong, wrong. In fact, in the year the nine per cent superannuation was introduced and in the years since, unemployment fell, productivity was higher and small businesses were started and prospered. The truth is that we have a superannuation sector worth about $1.4 trillion in retirement savings, which means that Australians will be able to enjoy income security in their retirement.





(Quorum formed)

The coalition are truculent, obstinate and belligerent with respect to superannuation. All they do is oppose every reform. They took no policy into the last federal election campaign to increase superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. The shadow Treasurer comes in here today and says that they will find it through savings. They could not find the savings to rebuild Queensland. It took them weeks to do that. Then they ended up with the One Nation playbook in relation to foreign aid to find it, which would have left a black hole of $1 billion in the budget if their policies on the flood levy had been adopted. That $1 billion black hole would have been on top of the $11 billion black hole they took to the last election. They reckon they will find the savings for it. They will not find the savings for it. They should be supporting Australians in their retirement. They have opposed every superannuation reform we could possibly have.


The shadow Treasurer does not even know why we are doing this. The review of this matter undertaken by the Treasury, by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and by the Department of Human Services found Medicare Australia to be the agency best placed to carry out this function. He does not even know that. He has not even looked at the review. He says, 'We are not opposed to it.' We know that some opposite are in support of an increase in superannuation for Australian workers. Federal politicians get 15.4 per cent. Why shouldn't the Australian public get an increase? Some 43,500 people in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland would get an increase in superannuation. They would get more money when they retire. This is important.


This reform comes as a result of a review. We are undertaking significant reviews in relation to these matters. This is a two-stage process. Since 3 February 2011 Medicare Australia has been performing this function under delegation from APRA. That was the first stage. The second stage will take place when this bill is given effect to and formally transfers the functions from APRA to Medicare Australia. This is an important reform because there are efficiencies here and we have customer service obligations. It will assist in better managing electronic business transactions.


Over $122 million was released on compassionate grounds in the year 2010-11, with an average of $11,316 being released on compassionate grounds. The circumstances in relation to compassionate grounds include: medical treatment, medical transport, modifications necessary for the family home or a motor vehicle due to severe disability, palliative care and funeral expenses. Funds can also be released to prevent the foreclosure of a mortgage or exercise the power of sale over the member's principal place of residence.


In relation to self-managed funds, the Commissioner of Taxation is the appropriate person. What is happening here is that, in relation to other superannuation, the general administration of superannuation funds on compassionate grounds that currently resides with APRA will be transferred to Medicare Australia. I think that is an appropriate reform because we have seen the benefit of Medicare Australia and the Department of Human Services in my electorate of Blair. When Australian people go through hard times they need to access some of the funds in their superannuation. In January 2011, when my electorate was devastated by the floodwaters from the Wivenhoe Dam, the Lockyer Creek, the Brisbane River and the Bremer River, my electorate office had numerous requests from residents to get access to their superannuation to assist them to move back into their homes and to help them to rebuild their homes. I had dozens of calls and requests from residents who wanted assistance through their superannuation funds. There were families and individuals who lost their homes in the floods—there were 3,000 homes in Ipswich and about 600 in the Somerset—and 279 agribusinesses were also damaged. They had been fighting insurance companies for months and had often been rejected. They needed a bit of a helping hand.


When dealing with the emotional trauma of evacuating their families and wondering how they could rebuild and move on they had to deal with myriad bureaucracies with various requests for information and different conditions of assistance and support. It was traumatic and it traumatised those people yet again. I know the benefit of the Department of Human Services. The Green Army was so important. The flood recovery people who wore dark green T-shirts and the people from Centrelink were symbols of hope for people. They were giving a helping hand and providing financial assistance. Most of those who turned to their superannuation funds for assistance either were declined or simply gave up because the process of applying on compassionate grounds was anything but compassionate. I need to stress that those residents in flood affected Blair would not necessarily have been able to access their funds courtesy of these amendments. The criteria for assessing early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds will remain the same. But putting this responsibility into Medicare Australia in the Department of Human Services I think creates a compassionate response. These are people who know how to deliver services and whom people who have been flood affected and are in hardship can identify as the people who provide help to them every day, every week, every month and every year.


This is not to say that APRA has not been an effective prudential regulator. But it does not have the support platform that Medicare Australia does to deal with clients—the shopfronts, call centres, customer support professionals and the like. And Medicare is more effective at dealing with people. This is why on 1 July 2011 we formed a new Department of Human Services—and it really is a new entity in many ways—to integrate Medicare, Centrelink and child support services. This is a key component of the federal Labor government's commitment to and focus on delivering services efficiently and effectively and making the whole service more client focused. I think that is good for people in my electorate. In Ipswich we are very fortunate to have a one-stop human services shop, effectively combining Medicare and Centrelink with the Local Connections to Work. I have seen firsthand the benefit to individuals and families as a result of this focus on clients rather than bureaucracy.


As a function of the Department of Human Services, it is my hope, and it is certainly my expectation, that Medicare will take a more benign and charitable approach to those wishing to access their superannuation early on compassionate grounds. Medicare personnel are already dealing with Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink personnel. They have better access to information to assess the needs of people. There are structures, systems and personnel in place to deal with them. Medicare has the experience, as I said, in electronic business transactions, and there is considerable technological infrastructure to process claims, and I saw that firsthand in January with the floods. There is significant potential to streamline this procedure, with the ultimate beneficiaries being people across the country, and certainly people in cyclone and flood affected Queensland.


Superannuation has been a concern of the Labor Party for 20 years. We have been strongly committed to compulsory superannuation. Those opposite mouth the words, but we have seen the history of the coalition parties: they have been opposed to superannuation reform, from their forebears in the 1990s all the way through. The key reform to increase superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent will make a very big difference. With an ageing population it is vital to ensure that Australians have enough money to retire on in the future. And, given that life expectancy is increasing and retirement is more an experience of decades rather than of just a few years, nine per cent is simply not enough and we need to go to 12 per cent. This is especially the case for women, who often have child-rearing breaks in their careers and have a longer life expectancy than men.


It is simply a shame and a disgrace that the coalition had no policy in the last election with respect to increasing superannuation and have steadfastly opposed, for 20 years, increases in superannuation. They have put the retirements of millions of Australians at risk and forced taxpayers to pay more for the aged pension.


We believe that this is an important reform. This amendment is just one of the steps that we are taking to make sure that superannuation continues to meet the needs of Australians in the future. It should be welcomed across the country and will certainly be welcomed in my community.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2011-08-25,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (11:41):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011. As speakers before me have said, this is really only a shifting of the deckchairs on something of a Titanic. In reality, the move of the administration of superannuation early release from APRA to Medicare may claim to have some streamlining benefits, but it does not address part of the key issue for people who are applying for early release and delays in having that approved. In the Bills Digestfor the bill, it says that in 2009-10 there were 16,331 applications and 10,539 approvals, the total amount being just over $111 million, or about $10,544 per account.


That is not the issue. On the criteria for early release of superannuation, which are not addressed by this bill, the Bills Digest says that superannuation benefits generally cannot be accessed before 55 years of age, and I think that that is good in general terms. It goes on to say:


In some specific circumstances, persons are able to apply to their superannuation fund/retirement saving account provider for the early release of superannuation benefits, including financial hardship, permanent incapacity (permanent and total disability), terminal illness, where the preserved benefit balance is $200 or less, and in cases of permanent departure from Australia.


It also goes on to say:


Superannuation benefits may also be released early on 'compassionate' grounds by application to APRA for superannuation and retirement savings accounts or by application to the Commissioner of Taxation for Self Managed Superannuation Funds. The changes proposed by the Bill relate only to the administrative arrangements for applications about early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds.


It does not address the key issue. It further says:


The circumstances under which an application for the early release on compassionate grounds can be granted are specified in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994 and Retirement Savings Accounts Regulations 1997 and include:


to pay for medical treatment or medical transport for the person or a dependant—


and I want to emphasise that because I will come to it in a minute—


to enable the person to make a payment on a loan, to prevent:


   foreclosure of a mortgage on the person’s principal place of residence


and it is important that I also highlight that—


or


   exercise by the mortgagee of an express or statutory, power of sale over the person’s principal place of residence


to modify the person’s principal place of residence, or vehicle, to accommodate the special needs of the person, or a dependant, arising from severe disability


to pay for expenses associated with the person’s palliative care, in the case of impending death, and


to pay for expenses associated with a dependant’s palliative care, in the case of impending death, funeral or burial.


I wanted to speak on this bill due to a number of representations that I have made on behalf of constituents on concerns raised by them. I will not go into individuals' names. The minister is aware of these, because I have had responses back from Minister Shorten. One was a person in Woodbury who struck severe personal and financial hardship. Her house burned down and her granddaughter was killed. She was unable to access money to repair the house as, I understand, it was not insured. She wanted to be able to access her superannuation so that she could at least keep the property and undertake some repairs to it. As I understand it, an application was put in last year. In February representations were made to the minister because she was not having any joy. I received the response from the minister on 5 July. By the way, that person has now lost her house.


These conditions by which people can supposedly access their superannuation in times of financial hardship are an absolute farce. The lady is not my constituent, by the way—she is the member for Newcastle's constituent but found no joy there. Here is a case where a lady has lost her granddaughter and her house in a fire. Subsequently, because of her economic situation and not being insured, she has lost the property on which that house stood because she could not meet the payments. Had she been able to access the amount that she had in superannuation, it may have been different. This bill does not address part of the core issues.


I received a massive number of representations arising out of the global financial crisis when the Labor government sought to protect the deposits in the four major banks. The flow-on effect of that was that businesses such as Colonial First State Investment and AMP Capital Enhanced Yield Fund froze the finances they had. People who had their money invested in those and other funds found their funds were frozen because of the rush on those funds arising out of the government's ill considered bill and an absolute refusal to think through the process and the ramifications of their actions. People had no income coming to them by which to live, they were denied social security because they had the money held in these funds and they were not sure whether these funds would collapse. We are not talking about huge amounts of money. For most of these people it was a small amount. This has led to situations where people who are applying for relief are starting to lose their homes because banks are foreclosing.


The response from the minister on the various submissions that we made to him on behalf of these people who were applying under financial hardship was basically, 'This is a problem of the global financial crisis.' In his letter he referred to all the reasons for which a person can access their superannuation and then turned around and said that it was a problem created by the global financial crisis and that it was just tough luck. I say this to the minister: the problem was not created by the global financial crisis; it was created by your decision to provide an unlimited guarantee on bank deposits. The coalition put forward a bill limiting that guarantee to $100,000. The unlimited guarantee saw a rush from investors in these funds withdrawing their money to put it into the banks. What you did was cause a collapse in that financial market. Whether it is APRA or Medicare, because of your integrity as a minister and your lack of action and understanding of these situations, you placed these individuals into financial hardship. You placed them into situations whereby their houses were in jeopardy. In fact, in one of those cases—and I will read from this person from Forster's letter without mentioning their name—they had $19,304 in one account with Colonial First State and $34,179 in another and they needed to access it. I will read from their letter:


After I retired aged 60 in Dec. 2009 Colonial advised us that these accounts were frozen due to the G.F.C. However as my husband was diagnosed in February this year with advanced renal cell cancer & bone cancer and is no longer able to work we will again attempted to close these accounts as they return only approximately 2%.


But they could not get access to their capital. Did they meet the over-55 criterion? Yes. What about financial hardship because of medical condition or life-threatening illness? I would say that if you have advanced renal cell cancer and bone cancer the long-term prospect for you is not as good as it could be. This government and APRA failed those people in this situation and that is disgraceful.


So it is not a matter of who will administer this, whether it is the head of Medicare or in part the Taxation Office or in part APRA; it is about having people that act and respond to avert the crisis that is occurring by these people not being able to access their money. At the end of the day it is those individuals' money. I know we need in superannuation to protect their investment as much as we can and we need to make sure that it provides for their retirement, but the actions of this government cost people the ability to access that money, even though they complied on a number of counts. I have another letter, this time from a person in Raymond Terrace. This and the other letter I read out are just a couple that I grabbed, instead of grabbing a huge ream of them, on the way out of the office to make this speech. This letter is about superannuation funds held by the AMP capital enhanced yield fund . This person needed to get access to the $25,000 of his superannuation that he had invested in the fund. The letter reads:




I have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and during the past five years have been having treatment for this terrible disease. These funds would assist and be vital for the medical expenses etc. which will be ongoing.



As I said at the very start of my speech when I talked about the criteria in the legislation, if money is to be used for life-threatening medical expenses, its withdrawal should be approved. But the responses from this minister have been absolutely appalling—letters written in May and responses received in August. In a letter to me of 9 August about the representation by the person whose letter I just read out, the minister said:




Frozen accounts stem from the ongoing turmoil in international financial markets. While Australia has weathered the financial storm better than any other developed nation in the world, the global financial crisis is still having a significant impact. As a result, some investment funds are still having difficulty attracting fresh investment inflows.





Because of this, many funds have not had sufficient liquid assets or cash to be able to pay out redemption requests and those funds have chosen to put a freeze on redemptions as allowed under law, until the liquidity position of the fund improves. The decision to freeze redemptions is one taken by each individual fund and is not a decision taken by Government.



Minister, the decision to freeze the fund came about directly because of your unlimited guarantees of deposits with the four majors. This caused the flow of cash from these investment houses to the major banks as people naturally went to protect their financial returns. Minister, you have not only failed this nation economically but also failed these individuals, who, in their hour of absolute need, needed access to their money either to save their life through payment for proper and expedient medical assistance or to save their property threatened by circumstances beyond their control. Withdrawal of funds to do either of these things is completely within the guidelines listed in the legislation. Minister, you have failed those people, and for that you should be condemned. It is a good idea to control the money in question by moving it to a single house such as Medicare, but we need to see fast and responsive action to genuine claims so that people can access their money as per all the criteria stated in the legislation and avert long-term situations which always end up negative.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (11:55):  I am pleased to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011. I have already made some comments on this bill, but I made them in another form: a report made in my role as Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. This is a non-controversial bill—it is about acknowledging a practice that currently exists and tidying up the legislation.


The bill proposes to move the responsibility for the administration of the early release on compassionate grounds of benefits in a retirement savings account or of superannuation benefits in an entity regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority from APRA to the Chief Executive Officer of Medicare. Similarly, the bill proposes to transfer the general administration of the early release of superannuation funds on compassionate grounds from the Commissioner of Taxation to the Chief Executive Officer of Medicare. The bill formalises an arrangement that has been in place since 3 February this year, when APRA and Medicare Australia entered into a service delivery agreement for Medicare Australia to carry out the day-to-day functions of the administration of the early release of superannuation in APRA-regulated superannuation entities under delegation from APRA. At the same time, the day-to-day functions of the administration of the early release of superannuation and superannuation funds under delegation from the Commissioner of Taxation was transferred from APRA to Medicare Australia.


There is no extra cost associated with this bill. Part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill amends the APRA Act 1998 so that the industry levy associated with the administration of the early release of superannuation benefits currently paid to APRA can be properly transferred to Medicare Australia to meet administrative costs. To support this arrangement, APRA officers were transferred to Medicare Australia in February this year to undertake the administration of the early release function.


The bill was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services for consideration. The committee supports and endorses moves to formalise the interim arrangements that have been in place for over six months now, and after consideration of the evidence the committee agreed not to inquire further into this bill and recommended that the House pass the bill—it is non-controversial. This bill is simply a formalisation of arrangements that are currently in place, and I recommend it.





(Quorum formed) In respect for my colleagues, rather than give them the full 15 minutes I had left of my speech, can I just say that this is a good amendment, it is a good bill. It actually is supported by the other side. As to why they would want to interrupt the debate, I am not sure. I recommend the bill to the House.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2011-08-25,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (12:01):  The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011 will transfer the responsibility for administration of the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds from APRA and the ATO to the Chief Executive of Medicare. This is a bill that the coalition does not oppose and, given that the bill also effectively transfers the relevant component of fees currently collected by APRA from APRA regulated funds to cover the cost of administering the early release of superannuation to Medicare, there should be no budget or financial impact on Medicare.


As noted, the bill transfers the responsibility for administration of the early release of superannuation. The administration of the early release of superannuation may not have sat well with APRA's role as the prudential regulator. Certainly, as the member for Paterson very rightly pointed out earlier, the time taken to process applications and get payments made—I know, from my previous experience as a financial adviser—has taken significant periods and has created additional financial burdens for the people involved. In view of that, it is probably quite appropriate that this function is administered by an agency that has other elements of income support and an efficient customer support infrastructure.


The circumstances under which superannuation can be released prior to age 55 is clearly defined in the SIS Act and allows, in specific circumstances as defined, people to apply to their superannuation funds or retirement savings account provider for the early release of their superannuation benefits. Early release of superannuation benefits may be applicable for people facing financial hardship, permanent incapacity, terminal illness, where the preserved balance is $200 or less and in cases of permanent departure from Australia. The provision where the balance is $200 or less was used a number of times in my practice, because it is one less thing that people had to worry about and it saves a lot of administration costs for superannuation funds for those small account balances, which frequently get lost or misplaced. 


Superannuation benefits may also be released early on compassionate grounds by application to APRA for superannuation and retirement savings accounts or by application to the Commissioner of Taxation for self-managed super funds. This bill will not change that. The changes proposed by the bill relate only to the administrative arrangements. Some of the things that superannuation can be released for under compassionate grounds include payment for medical treatment and transport for a person or a dependant; enabling a person to make a payment on a loan in the event of possible foreclosure of a mortgage on a person's principal place of residence, or exercise by the mortgagee of an express or statutory power of sale; or to modify a person's principal place of residence or vehicle to accommodate the special needs of the person or a dependent arising from severe disability. It can also be released to pay for expenses associated with palliative care in the case of impending death and to pay for expenses associated with dependants with palliative care needs in the case of impending death, funeral or burial.


The member for Paterson very rightly pointed out some of the issues with these regulations. It is important to note that, while individuals may apply to APRA for the early release of superannuation benefits on the compassionate grounds that I have just listed, a superannuation fund trustee or retirement savings account provider ultimately decides what benefits they will or will not release, subject to the governing rules of the fund. As the member for Paterson also pointed out, in the global financial crisis there were a number of people, even those who had passed age 55, who had extreme difficulty in having funds released from their superannuation accounts because funds were frozen.


In assessing applications for the early release of superannuation, APRA is required to adhere to specific assessment criteria, and it is important that that process is properly followed. That is where we find that a lot of the time is taken up in getting the process completed. The applicant does have the ability to appeal a decision and, if they are not satisfied, they may request an internal review by an independent APRA delegate or an external review of the process by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. But, at the end of the day, if the superannuation fund trustee or the retirement savings account provider decides that the funds are frozen, people seeking access to those funds will still not be able to get those funds.


A concern with respect to the proposals in this bill is that there does not appear to have been any great public announcement prior to the introduction of the bill. Certainly, the financial planners that I still deal with and speak to inform me that they did not have any idea that this had been proposed or was on the drawing board. That is a major issue of concern: the lack of information in an industry that would be primarily responsible for dealing with clients in this situation.


As the member for Oxley pointed out, it appears that Medicare Australia has been managing these claims since February 2011 under delegation from APRA. I have not been able to find where the details of this delegation have been made public, including the amount of funding transferred to Medicare Australia to enable it to perform this task. Given that this is a government that apparently prides itself on openness and accountability, that is a serious issue of concern. There is no information in APRA's annual reports, or in other public resources, on the value of the revenue raised by the levy that APRA currently charges on superannuation funds under its regulation, so we cannot verify that the amount of money being transferred to Medicare to provide these additional services is in reality sufficient for what they require. It is important, given the increasing range of non-health related programs that Medicare Australia is now administering, that it is adequately resourced financially to meet this increasing workload. An example of other increased services provided by Medicare Australia is its assumption of responsibility, since July 2010, as the small business clearinghouse for superannuation—again, a service that the majority of small businesses that I have spoken to did not even know about. It is shown in the figures that less than one per cent of small business have taken up the service.


Given the stringent guidelines surrounding the early release of superannuation benefits, it is important that Medicare Australia is properly resourced and staff are properly trained, as many people who are seeking early release of superannuation funds are facing stressful circumstances and require compassion and understanding when dealing with this difficult issue.


As I noted at the outset, the coalition does not oppose the bill, but we trust that this transfer of responsibilities is implemented smoothly and in an efficient manner to minimise any impact on people who may be seeking to access their superannuation benefits. Given the track record of this government over the past four years, we have some serious concerns, and the issues that the member for Paterson raised earlier in terms of responses from the relevant minister also raise concerns.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (12:10):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011. In the current economic times, the value of people's superannuation is a constant conversation in workplaces, around dinner tables and at social gatherings throughout Australia. People are very concerned. For many people the only exposure they have to the share market is through their superannuation fund, while others have both private investment and superannuation in stocks and bonds. That is part of the reason the current market volatility is being watched—specifically by those who are close to or at the point of retirement—so closely around the country and why the calculators are out, with people trying to work out the impact on individual accounts and the amount they have available to them. In fact, Australians are extremely concerned about exactly what their superannuation will be worth when they need it.


In the past few years, all forms of financial advisers and accountants have constantly dealt with concerned clients and new clients—people who, for the first time, are taking a direct interest in their superannuation. It is in this environment we find ourselves discussing superannuation legislation in the bill before the House. As we know, the bill amends the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to facilitate the transfer of the administration of the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to the Chief Executive of Medicare. Generally, as we know, superannuation cannot be accessed before you are at least 55 years old. That is so that Australians can fund themselves in retirement. However, in some very specific circumstances, the law allows the early release of benefits that are held in a retirement savings account or superannuation benefits in an APRA regulated entity.


Also, the bill transfers the general administration of the early release of superannuation benefits in self-managed super funds on compassionate grounds from the Commissioner of Taxation to the Chief Executive of Medicare. In most circumstances, these benefits are taxed. Even though the government gives permission to access superannuation early, the super fund trustee does not have to release those benefits to the individual concerned. The superannuation fund trustee or RSA provider decides what benefits they will and will not release and may charge fees for the early release of the funds. This is a concern to some of my constituents. Several of my constituents have needed to access part or all of their preserved benefits and savings prior to actual retirement for a range of compassionate reasons covered by this bill. It is never an easy decision. It is often a decision of last resort, according to the circumstances that people find themselves in. Generally, a constituent and their spouse, partner or dependent children are in extreme distress and under a great deal of personal as well as financial pressure when they have to make this decision. They may be suffering from a medical problem. It may be a life-threatening illness or an injury. They may be desperate for the funds to alleviate acute or chronic physical pain or be suffering from acute or chronic mental conditions, and that makes this process quite difficult. They may need it to pay for medical transport, which is really a major issue in regional and rural areas such as those in my electorate. It is a critical issue, made worse for people who live in very small communities, in isolated areas or on isolated properties. They might live in a very small community or on an isolated rural lot, and they will have to deal with this issue of medical transport. Increasingly we are finding that there are people who may not have relatives or friends to assist them at that time, so the issue of medical transport in regional areas is a very important one to the people affected.


Most of these circumstances, for people who find themselves in this position, are totally unexpected. It is a real shock for the person affected and for their whole family. It is always extremely difficult to manage and, of course, you do not really plan for this—you do not expect it to happen. It depends entirely on each person's individual circumstances as to what they are facing and what their financial situation is. It is for these sorts of reasons that some people need to access their retirement savings to prevent mortgagees from selling their homes, for example, because of overdue loan repayments, something I have certainly seen an increase of in recent years.


The early release of superannuation funds and retirement savings can also occur on compassionate grounds to fund the funeral expenses or palliative care that often follow the instances I mentioned previously. If a person or one of their dependants is severely disabled, he or she can apply to access their superannuation or retirement funds if this disability requires their home or car to be modified because of the disability. For those who have lost their jobs or who are in extremely difficult financial situations—and I would think many members in this House would, like me, have dealt with people who have found themselves in that position in recent times—it can be a difficult situation and they may also be able to access a portion of their benefits, subject to certain conditions. This can be that they have been receiving Commonwealth income support, such as unemployment benefits, for at least 26 continuous weeks and the trustee of their super fund is satisfied that the person cannot meet their immediate family expenses. This adds to the pressure that the individual finds themselves under. A payment is for the purposes of meeting everyday living expenses and can be one payment of no more than $10,000, including tax, in any 12-month period. The other condition is that when the person has reached their preservation age they may be able to receive their entire superannuation benefit, provided that they have received government income support for at least 39 weeks.


It is reasonable to suggest that a body that understands income support, such as Medicare, would be able to judge the compassionate needs of superannuants in the situations that I have mentioned throughout my speech. As such, the move to make the Chief Executive Officer of Medicare responsible for the administration of the early release of superannuation is understandable. Given that this has been in effect under a delegation agreement since February this year, this bill will simply formalise existing functions. The transfer of fees collected as a levy to manage this administration will be progressed, but again, as the member for Forde and the member for Paterson said, we do not have information as to whether these fees will be sufficient to allow the administration that is required to be conducted efficiently by Medicare in this instance.


Many members will, like me, have been approached by constituents who have only limited superannuation as they approach retirement. We know that over the last 10 years the top-performing superannuation products are returning on average around five per cent. Many people who are now close to retirement are focusing particularly on the amount that is in their superannuation funds. There are those who have seen the value of those superannuation funds diminish. It has caused a number of people to investigate how they could make these funds more secure, because the volatility of the market has seen the value of those superannuation funds erode.


My office would be similar to many others, with a number of constituents looking at where their funds are currently invested, how they are invested, what they are worth, what the changes to them are and how those changes are going to impact those people. It is a particularly relevant issue for people who are facing retirement in the immediate sense. The value of these superannuation funds is particularly critical to them. On that basis, Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your time.

Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (12:21):  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011 because, like many members who have spoken on this bill, it has particular relevance to operations within my electorate and impacts a number of people. Let me say at the outset that superannuation is a very valuable tool for people's retirement. There is much debate on whether it should be nine per cent or 12 per cent et cetera, but it is obviously designed to provide retirement income for many Australians as compared to the pension, which is not a lifestyle remuneration but a safety net. That is why superannuation is so important. This bill does change the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds in two ways. It transfers the responsibility for administration of the early release of super on compassionate grounds from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA, and the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO, to Medicare and it transfers the relevant component of fees currently collected from APRA-regulated funds to cover the cost of administering the early release of super by Medicare without any financial impact. This bill does not affect the criteria for early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds. This is important to my electorate because Canning has 40 per cent of voters aged 55 or above. It is quite an interesting demographic. Fifty-five years is the general minimum age that the early release of superannuation payments can be applied for. As we know 55 is not old—I am 58, which is not old at all; in fact, I suspect it is the old 35—but it is the trigger point.


I do not oppose the release of superannuation on compassionate grounds and I do not necessarily oppose the restructuring of the channels through which these moneys are distributed. But there must always be a sense of caution. My office is quite often contacted by people within the electorate saying: 'Look, I am in dire straits. If I don't get access to my superannuation funds, I'm going to lose my house.' There is a whole range of issues such as health care: someone has contracted a terminal disease, they need the funds for medicines et cetera. They are all genuine cases, but the word of caution is: should the funds be released without a lot of scrutiny, which then leaves nothing left for retirement? I suspect if you are not going to be here then it is not going to be any use to you, but if you get an early release of funds and that is all you have then it does not say much for the quality of life you are going to have some years later.


Another reason why I am cautious about this bill, and we do not oppose it, is the impact it is going to have on Medicare services. This government obviously is giving more responsibility to Medicare. We know that is the mechanism that the flood levy was going to be collected through. We had Centrelink as a one-stop shop, now Medicare will be a one-stop shop. The problem with that is Medicare will continue to be under continued pressure.


I am sure that members of parliament in this House would agree that whenever somebody has a problem with a government department, because it is too difficult for the officer at the front desk to give them a straight answer or is not the answer they might be looking for, they come to us as their elected representatives. We always get the too-hard basket ones. You know they have often shopped around before they come to us as members of parliament.


In the coalition government, the member for North Sydney, Joe Hockey, was responsible for public administration. In the case of Centrelink, he appointed electorate liaison officers. It really was fantastic. When Labor came to power they got rid of them. However, if you had a problem with Centrelink—and this is what I suspect the government might want to look at in loading more responsibilities onto Medicare—you discussed it with an electorate liaison officer and this person had the authority to sign-off. It stopped a mountain of paperwork and a mountain of delays because we had an electorate liaison officer in the local Centrelink office that we could go to and have problems solved. How sensible was that? They did not spend their whole time on it, they were doing other duties, but we had a go-to person.


People say, 'Oh, yes, but there are government liaison people in Medicare you can go to.' No, these electorate liaison officers were specifically assigned to our electorates and they knew our electorates. They were quite often in Centrelink offices within our electorates, so they knew the turf, they knew the people and they knew the issues. As a result, we could get some very good results for people who did not want a paper war—a letter to the minister, a reply that came back, essentially written by the department in any case, which said, 'Computer says 'no'', which meant we then had to take the lobbying process even further. I want put on the record that, as a result of loading up Medicare, this could be an alternative if the government really wants to ease the burden.


We know that the areas of responsibility shifted to Medicare include the administration of the Home Insulation Program on behalf of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, and setting up the clearing house arrangements for small business—more extra duties for Medicare—yet the government's position on private health industry insurance is to limit the desire of people to have private health insurance. We know the government has tried several times to take away the private health insurance rebate. The effect of that will be to force more people onto the public health system. It will load up public health and the rebates and all that goes with it.


Yesterday, I stood in the courtyard here with other members and senators from Western Australia because the health insurer HBF had collected 32,000 signatures on a petition from their Western Australian members in a month saying that if the government, in conjunction with the Greens—we know the Greens have a particular view on this as well—were to remove the 30 per cent rebate, it is going to force many people off private health insurance and back onto the public health system. As a result, and we know anybody who goes to hospital or a doctor will be treated one way or another, it will load up the public system. In effect it is a cost-shifting mechanism. The effect of trying to do this is expected to cost an extra $3.8 billion to the public health system. In turn, this will put more pressure on these related services. For Labor to deny this is totally untrue. You cannot believe them. I will not use the three-letter word, but I can say it is not true. The health minister, Nicola Roxon, clearly stated in a media release dated 26 September 2007:


… on many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including … the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians


What have the government done? They have tried to change that three times at least. It is a bit like: 'There will be no carbon tax under this government I lead. I have my fingers crossed behind my back; please believe me.' Research by the Australian Health Industry shows that under Labor's proposed health insurance rebate changes, 175,000 Australians would drop private health cover—putting pressure on the public health system, and putting pressure on Medicare, which is the office meant to deal with this early release of superannuation. Minister Roxon was forced to admit on 16 October 2008: 


The projection of the number of people from Treasury that will drop out of health insurance is just under half a million—492,000 people.


And the Australian newspaper on 24 June 2011 reported:


MORE than 2.4 million Australians with private health insurance will be forced to find up to $935 extra a year for their premiums if the government can manoeuvre its means test for the 30 per cent rebate through parliament …


In fact, I have received correspondence from constituents who are very concerned about this issue as I speak today. Even they can see that Labor's proposed changes would increase private health insurance premiums, and put more pressure on the public health sector and systems like Medicare—but this is the agenda of the government.


I have a particular view on superannuation. As I said, I am very supportive of those who need a release of superannuation on compassionate grounds. Those who need early release for those reasons should be well heard, but with the caveats that I have put on it. But we have a massive amount of money tied up in superannuation funds throughout Australia. You have heard the dulcet tones of the former reserve bank governor, Bernie Fraser, 'Come to my industry fund and put the money in there so that we can purloin your money and help our organisation.' I say: use the money wisely. One of the ways I would like to see it used wisely, from a personal point of view and a policy point of view, would be for some of it to be released for first home buyers. Not young people necessarily; parents could get access to a deposit for their home through all this money tied up in superannuation. After all it is their money. If they can grow it by buying an asset like a house why should they not be given that sort of opportunity? That is my personal view, which is nothing to do with coalition policy, but there is a massive amount of money tied up, particularly in the hands of industry funds, which have a different agenda from some others, and it could well be used in a more effective way in the future.


In conclusion, the government does not have a competent record on administration. As I have said, what a farce the BER was. What has happened to the set-top boxes that were announced in the budget? Who is going to administer the set-top boxes? Is this going to end up in one of these departments as well? How many people are going to get a set-top box in one of the wackiest policies that this government has ever put out? Who is going to administer that? Is this going to go through Medicare as well? I have to say that in terms of public policy the people who thought that up were obviously the same people who thought up putting pink batts in your roof and how to burn down your house in a short while! At the end of the day I am not aware of anyone in my electorate who has come to me and said, 'I want a set-top box.' In fact, if you gave me a voucher for $300 or $400 I would probably go and buy a plasma TV or something at Harvey Norman but not a fancy set-top box.


As I have said, I agree with the need for early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds. Certainly, these payments are important and help people in often financially and emotionally tough situations. I do hope that the administrative changes will not cause any further costs or pressures to our healthcare system, as I have outlined, and Medicare services or any duress to administering payments to the people who need them most.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2011-08-25,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (12:34):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011, which the coalition does not oppose. This bill deals with the administration of the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds. I stress the point that it is the administration. In reading the bill I find that it does not speak of changing the wording or the intent. It does not speak of making the process for applying for early release of your superannuation any easier, it just shifts the administration from one body to another.


The bill transfers the responsibility for administration of early release of the superannuation on compassionate grounds from APRA—the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority—and the Australian Taxation Office, which I will refer to as the ATO, to the Chief Executive of Medicare and allows APRA to include the cost of administration of this early release by Medicare in the annual levy it charges for superannuation funds. The rationale for the transfer from APRA and the ATO to Medicare as given in the explanatory memorandum is that this scheme is best administered 'by an agency that has other elements of income support and an efficient customer support infrastructure'. Predominantly what that means is that Medicare has more outlets around the nation—there is more accessibility to frontline staff—as opposed to dealing with APRA, who I am sure are competent but their areas of expertise probably do not include the frontline specialist skills that we require.


Before I go on, let us look at some of the comments we have heard from previous speakers who took the opportunity to drift into the topic of increasing superannuation amounts from nine per cent to 15 per cent. One of the examples that they brought up was that as a government we should not deprive the Australian people of an increase to 15.4 per cent because that is what the politicians get—why should we get it and not let the general public share the same superannuation levy? That is economic ridiculousness. Why not go one step further and say that everyone should be on the same money that the Prime Minister is on? This is the same economic rationale that that argument brings to this House. 


The reason that these comments would be raised, in fairness, is that very few people from the other side of the House actually have any concept or fundamental understanding of how small business works, and this is where the cost would be borne in an increase from nine to 15 per cent superannuation. It would be borne by business. While the government says that there would be a one per cent decrease on their tax, from 30 per cent back to 29 per cent, I suggest that there is only so much money available in a business to try to make ends meet and when you have to trim costs, often one of your variable cost line items is your staff. So I fear that the silliness of the economic rationalism being used could potentially put Australian jobs at risk and I would encourage people to tread carefully when considering flippant increases to 15 per cent.


I also remind the government of the enormous pressures on small business and families at the moment with the basic cost-of-living pressures. One must consider the outrageous increases in energy costs since 2007. Don't shake your head, they have gone up. I have seen it at home—50 per cent they have gone up!




Mr Hartsuyker:
  Shame!




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  Shame! So do not shake your head, because you get energy bills as well!



Mr Shorten interjecting—




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  Mate, I love your work! So there are cost-of-living pressures—energy prices, gas prices—and these are all inhibitors on the Australian economy at the moment. Our fuel prices have gone through the roof.


And while we talk about economic vandalism and listen to some of the comments we have heard in the House with reference to the superannuation debate, I bring the attention to the flippancy with which this government refers to the 7.2 per cent of our GDP debt ratio as being relatively small in comparison with other nations. I suggest that the argument that it is relatively small compared to other nations begs the question: why is it that we cannot pay that back? Why is it that we are having so much trouble servicing—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! This is a bill on superannuation and I ask the member to return to the bill.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  Absolutely. It is strange to hear the words 'efficient' and 'infrastructure' used in conjunction with this government, because to date its record has been one of inefficiency almost across the board. From the pink batts debacle all the way through to the NBN, this government in all cases has managed to take the most inefficient approach possible.


While there are special circumstances in which superannuation can be accessed, including medical conditions and severe financial hardship, the Australian tax office has recently noted that a number of schemes are promising customers that they can help access super for reasons such as paying off credit card debt, paying bills, buying new cars or even going on holidays. Last year around 1,300 people were sprung by the Australian Taxation Office for participating in such schemes. I would like to remind anyone considering involving themselves in one of these dodgy schemes that not only are the schemes illegal, but they will also cost you a whole lot more than you expect and you could even potentially end up in jail.


In the current economic climate, while we remain vulnerable to the tremors and quakes currently disrupting global markets, while cost-of-living pressures are squeezing every last spare dollar out of ordinary hardworking families, while the government is planning on adding to the pain with the introduction of its illegitimate and pointless carbon tax—in times like this—it is no wonder that more and more people would be looking to get hold of their super. That is the point I was making earlier with reference to cost-of-living pressures. That was the point I was making about people wanting to get access to their superannuation just to make ends meet. I make the point that electricity prices are up 16 per cent, after going up another 10 per cent from the year before; gas is up 18 per cent, after a 13 per cent jump last year; and water is up 16 per cent, after another 13 per cent last year; and it just goes on and on.


In Queensland, power bills alone have increased by more than 60 per cent in less than five years. That is the point I was making earlier. What do you reckon will happen when the carbon tax kicks in? Is it any wonder that we are seeing more shonky operators out there trying to take advantage of people who are looking at the smashed remnants of their piggybanks and wondering what they are going to do next? Things are undoubtedly tough at the moment and when times are tough people want to know that their government is exercising the same sort of restraint and fiscal responsibility that they are having to undergo in their household budgets.


I also want to bring your attention to a case that we are dealing with in our electorate office at the moment that is relevant to the early release of superannuation. I am fearful that we will continue as a nation to see more and more examples like this as people try to get access to their savings funds. One of my constituents is a lady who has a small marketing business based in a regional part of the electorate. Regretfully, our constituent—and a wonderful woman she is—is suffering from cancer. Her illness takes her away from her business, and like most small businesses, as we on this side will understand, often you are the CEO as well as the truck driver, the sales team, the marketer, the accounting department and customer service. One- and two-man-band teams have huge pressures on them. Because of her illness, she has been unable to work, but the cost pressures still land at her feet. The cost pressures of the tenancy agreement that she has for her building, the cost pressure of leases on vehicles, and the cost pressures of the continuing commitment for photocopiers, fax machines and phones still exist. Often when these small businesses enter the market to try to contribute to the economy of the nation they also have to service a business loan. Often that business loan is secured by the family home, the very home which they have worked their entire lives for. So illness has grasped this lady, and she is struggling to get access to her superannuation.


As I alluded to in my opening comments, this bill does not inhibit this case because the loopholes in this legislation are not touched. The bill only speaks to the transfer of the administration. The point I make is that I am very fearful that there will be many more Australian small businesses—many more mums and dads—who, as cost-of-living pressures are put upon them, will be drawn to try to access their savings from their superannuation.


Under circumstances such as these, I believe it is worth while to reflect on the ways in which members of the public can gain early access to their superannuation. The circumstances under which benefits may be released are, quite rightly, extremely limited. The first of these, and one covered by this bill, is an early release on compassionate grounds. In most cases, compassionate grounds refer to an applicant who needs the money to pay for medical costs associated with life-threatening illnesses and/or acute chronic pain and/or acute or chronic mental illness. However, these grounds rely upon the necessary treatment not being readily available through the public health system and not being covered by any applicable private health insurance or workers compensation.


Compassionate grounds may also be considered to prevent the family home being sold by the lender with whom the applicant has a home mortgage. There are numerous further conditions, chief among which is that the applicant's mortgage must be sufficiently in arrears for the lending institution to have decided to sell.


In some circumstances provisions can also be made for assistance to meet palliative care costs and for the costs associated with funeral, burial or cremation. There are of course other circumstances under which people can apply for the early release of superannuation, including severe financial hardship. However, as they are not part of this bill, I will not go into them today.


Nevertheless, the rules and regulations surrounding the early release of superannuation are fiendishly complex and there is no guarantee of success. In fact, of the approximately 16,000 applications received in the 2009-10 financial year, only 10,000 were approved. Approval ratings over the past three financial years are somewhere around 65 per cent. That is why we on this side of the House are pleased that this bill will finally allow applicants to deal face to face with professional customer service staff who will, hopefully, make the process significantly less arduous and significantly less stressful than it previously has been. As I said in my opening comments, the coalition does not oppose the bill. The bill deals with the administration of the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds, and we support it.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (12:48):  I thank all members for their contributions to the debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011, and I would like to take this opportunity to remind members of the broader context of superannuation. The shadow Treasurer today confirmed in the House of Representatives debate on the bill that the coalition support superannuation. In fact, shortly after 11:10 am, the member for North Sydney told the House that the coalition strongly support superannuation. But if one wants to make the large, grandiose statement of intent then surely the time has come for the shadow Treasurer to answer some questions about what support by the coalition actually adds up to. 


If the coalition really support superannuation, what are their plans to increase every Australian worker's superannuation savings? For instance, do they support the Gillard government's plans to lift the universal superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent? Do they support an increase in concessional caps for people over 50 which allows people to boost retirement savings without incurring excess contributions tax? If they support superannuation, do they support providing 3½ million Australians on incomes under $37,000 more superannuation by refunding their contributions tax? Sixty per cent of the beneficiaries of this measure are women. Given the profits of Australia's biggest resources companies and the records that are being set—the most recent today reported by BHP—why is it that the coalition will not support an MRRT which would help fund an increase in retirement savings of 8.4 million Australians, including 55,300 in the shadow Treasurer's own electorate of North Sydney?


If the coalition mean what they say, if the coalition actually strongly support superannuation, then it is time for those questions I have just enumerated to the House to be answered. I am prepared to provide every member of the House details of how many people in their electorate are set to benefit from an increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. The coalition have promised time and time again that they would provide a response to the Henry review recommendations on superannuation and thereby release a retirement savings policy. It is now well over a year since the Henry review was released. There are many more questions about the coalition's retirement savings policy—or should I say lack of a retirement savings policy by the coalition—than there are in fact financial service businesses in the shadow Treasurer's own North Sydney electorate—and there are, of course, many of those in that electorate.


This past Saturday, 20 August, we celebrated the 20-year anniversary of one of the great economic reforms of the modern era in Australia: the announcement in parliament of the tabling of the bill to lift compulsory superannuation from three to nine per cent. Superannuation works. We do not mind the coalition supporting it; we do not even mind them owning some of the achievements. We just wish that whenever they had the opportunity to vote for improvements in superannuation they would actually do as they say. Superannuation works; it has proven to be an idea in the best interests of the nation. It is a policy that is in the best tradition of what Labor governments should do.


The economic history books record that the introduction of compulsory superannuation coincided with the rise of all the major economic indicators. I reassure the member for Wright about his concerns. Somehow he viewed this as a tax on business. Throughout the period of the increase of superannuation from three to nine per cent in each increment, it was shown that it did not increase business costs and that it was offset against real wages movements. For workers, it was not a tax on them either, because what it allowed was compulsory savings that they might not have otherwise been able to make and which would have an anti-inflationary offset on the other wage increases they were receiving at the time of the mandatory increases.


I believe that in 2011 it is time for us to improve the rewards of hard work and to allow Australians to reach out confidently for the goal of lifetime income security. I believe that people who work hard all their lives should be able to view the prospect of retirement with some degree of comfort and certainty about the adequacy of the income that they will have saved. Given that the great gift of the 20th century is increasing life expectancy for Australians in the 21st century, and given that retirement now is much more an experience of decades for Australians than the experience of a few years, nine per cent is simply not enough. This is especially the case for women, who may have breaks in their careers to raise families and who indeed have a longer life expectancy than men.


This is why the Gillard government is committed to raising compulsory superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. Lifting the rate means that an employee aged 30 today on average weekly earnings will retire with an additional $108,000 in superannuation. A female aged 30 today on average weekly earnings with an interrupted work pattern could retire with an additional $78,000 in superannuation. Why on earth would any political party in this place want to encourage the idea that Australians should work hard their whole lives and then face retirement in an income environment which does not provide for an adequate replacement rate? (Quorum formed)




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: under standing order 91, I point out to all members of the House that the decision to pull a quorum on a minister when they are closing on important legislation just demonstrates how reckless this opposition is and how determined it is to destroy the standards of this place for its own political purposes.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  Order! I note the Government Whip's comments. I call the Assistant Treasurer.




Mr SHORTEN:
  This is why the Gillard government is committed to lifting the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. The bills deal with the formal transfer of responsibility for the general administration of the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds. The responsibility currently resides with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The transfer is simply a change to the administrator of the function of determining eligibility for early release. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (11:10):  The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011 does recognise that there should be a transfer of certain functions from the Australian Taxation Office and APRA to Medicare Australia, and following on from what the Minister of State at the table just talked about with the redesign of Human Services, I can say to you that nothing would be more emblematic of the redesign of Human Services than the fact that Medicare Australia is now providing back office superannuation processing. When I was the first Minister for Human Services back in 2004 and when I created the department, I would not have thought that it would ever have these sorts of functions or that it would totally incorporate Centrelink and Medicare. I must admit that I am agnostic at best about the thought that that integration should have occurred, but it is what it is and my colleagues have explained their position on it.


I would like to state at the outset that the coalition will not be opposing this bill. As with many bills that come into this place, we work together, contrary to some perceptions. This bill amends the law relating to superannuation. It transfers responsibility, as I said, from administration of early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds from APRA and the Australian Taxation Office to the chief executive of Medicare. This change will be of assistance to Australians who have already been granted early release of superannuation on medical grounds. These people would already be in regular contact with Medicare and it will reduce the number of government agencies with which they will have to deal. This change makes sense as Medicare Australia already undertakes the general administration associated with processing of early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds. It is expected by the government that there will be little additional cost associated with this change.


Amendments to the regulations under a number of acts will be required to enable the chief executive of Medicare to administer the early release of superannuation. Firstly, it is APRA which currently administers the regulations under the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 which make the determinations on whether an amount of benefits in retirement savings accounts may be released on compassionate grounds. This responsibility will now be handed to the chief executive of Medicare, and I just reflect on the fact that it was the coalition that established retirement savings accounts back in 1997 to provide some level of comfort to people who had had multiple jobs at the time and wanted to have a single, consistent superannuation account. That was the background, in a sense, to the retirement savings accounts.


Secondly, APRA currently administers regulations under the SIS Act, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. These apply to APRA regulated entities where funds may be released on compassionate grounds. Responsibility for administration of this will now be handed, again, to the chief executive of Medicare. Finally, the Commissioner of Taxation currently administers regulations made under part 3 of the SIS Act and determinations about whether benefits paid in self-managed superannuation funds will also be transferred to the chief executive of Medicare.


In providing support for this bill, I would emphasise that the coalition does not support any changes to the rules which determine whether superannuation can be released early on compassionate grounds. This is a very important point, because essentially there has been bipartisan agreement on having very strict rules about the early release of superannuation. It is often the case, as members of parliament, that people come to us and ask, if not beg, to have early access to their superannuation on the grounds that they have temporary financial troubles or due to an event that has occurred.


Accessing superannuation must be the absolute last resort, because that money is meant to get you through the days when you are essentially unable to work full time and fund your quality of life, and a dollar saved in superannuation today can represent multiple dollars in the future. The coalition supports the government's call that the limited circumstances for early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds be preserved and the criteria for early release not be changed. Superannuation must remain the savings for retirement, and it should only be in extreme circumstances that the funds can be withdrawn.


This week in the House the Assistant Treasurer ran through the government's proposal to increase the compulsory superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent and criticised the opposition's lack of support for this initiative. His criticism was misplaced and obviously rather political. The coalition strongly supports superannuation. Compulsory superannuation is a key pillar of a system which, along with the age pension and the incentives and voluntary savings, helps all Australians to prepare for a reasonable quality of life in retirement. The coalition will continue to support changes that make our superannuation system more efficient, transparent and internally competitive and that deliver better value to superannuants across Australia. In particular, sensible changes to streamline super fund operations and to strengthen corporate governance arrangements should be progressed by the government as a matter of priority. My colleague Senator Mathias Cormann, in the other place, has said that on numerous occasions.


Having said that, we do not support the proposed increase in compulsory superannuation as it stands as part of the government's offset to the mining tax. That is because it will be funded by the increase in the mining tax and the coalition is opposed to the mining tax. We have said before that, as it stands, we will rescind it in government and we will unwind the expenditure linked to it. Rather than increase compulsory superannuation, our preference is to look at other areas of voluntary savings to complement the nine per cent in compulsory super. We have been very concerned about the lack of trade-off. Although the former minister for finance was more willing than the current minister to state that the increase from nine to 12 per cent would come out of business rather than out of the net salary of workers, the fact is that the government has not been clear on where the extra three per cent is meant to come from. Is it meant to be a trade-off for increased wages? Will employees have less money to take home? Is it going to mean a greater cost burden on small business in particular?


This is a very important point, and I suspect what heavily influences it is employment pressures. If the unemployment rate is around 4½ to five per cent then of course there is greater pressure on employers to stump up the extra three per cent. But, should there be rising unemployment, this may well represent a further incentive for employers to reduce their workforce, because this increases the cost of employing people. Alternatively, and perhaps even more realistically, increasing compulsory super with a rising unemployment rate may well mean that people will have less money to take home. Given that the government are introducing a carbon tax and have in place a flood levy, and given that they will not pay for the $4.2 billion black hole associated with the carbon tax—a $2.9 billion hole this year alone—I would say that the Australian people know, and they are instinctively right, that when the government cannot make their sums add up they inevitably go back to the Australian people to try and make up the money.


Instead of forcing workers to defer extra wages, the government should be focusing on improving the performance of the super industry, although competitive pressures themselves should do that. It should not be up to the government to improve the performance of the industry; the industry should be competitive enough to do it itself.


We are looking at, and considering carefully, a number of different areas of superannuation in the lead-up to the next election. For example, the coalition will make sure that the process of selecting default workplace superannuation funds under modern awards is open, transparent and competitive—something that the government promised to do but failed to deliver. The Henry report identified that nine per cent superannuation was a sufficient level for compulsory super guarantee contributions but recommended a series of changes to the taxation of superannuation. Dr Henry made the point in the report that increasing the superannuation guarantee beyond nine per cent would most heavily impact on low- and middle-income earners. The additional burden of the payment would not be borne by business but would, rather, be funded by reducing the growth in take-home pay. So more of a worker's income would be put aside in superannuation rather than be paid today. Effectively that means that there would be a reduction in the take-home pay of the lowest paid workers if they had this increased contribution. That was Dr Henry's take on it. He is now a special and rather privileged adviser to the Prime Minister.


Out of all that, where are we? Before the 2007 election the Labor Party promised not to change superannuation laws. It, of course, broke that promise by changing the rules regarding concessional super contribution caps over the last three budgets. Labor halved the concessional contribution cap from $50,000 to $25,000 for Australians under the age of 50. Australians under 50 can no longer save over $25,000 in superannuation each year without being charged excessive tax rates. Labor also halved the concessional contribution cap from $100,000 to $50,000 for Australians over 50 years of age. The changes for over-50s have particularly concerned older workers nearing retirement. The changes have discouraged them from making sufficient contributions late in their working lives. These changes were simply made as a revenue measure; they were not made for any other reason. This government is a big-tax, big-spend government. Wherever it can get money and then go and spend it to control people's lives it will do so.


One initiative the coalition will support is the Cooper review recommendations for improving the administrative efficiency of the super industry. These initiatives are collectively called SuperStream. SuperStream is a package of measures designed to improve the back office of superannuation. It proposes the increased use of technology, uniform data standards and the tax file number as a key identifier of member accounts. That is a good thing. The coalition's support of SuperStream is consistent with our commitment to facilitate improvements in industry efficiency.


Another area where the government action is welcome, although overdue, is in changes to excess contributions tax penalties. ATO figures reveal that more than 65,000 Australians will be hit with penalty tax after inadvertent breaches of the concessional super contribution caps during the 2009-10 financial year. The problem obviously has escalated during 2010-11. Since 2007, Labor has collected $180 million in excess contributions tax at an estimated administrative cost of $60 million to the Australian Taxation Office.


In the 2011-12 budget the government announced that it will provide eligible individuals with the option to have excess concessional contributions taken out of their super fund and assessed as income at their marginal tax rate rather than incurring the tax penalties. Well done. The measure will apply where an individual has made concessional contributions of up to $10,000 in a particular year. It is only available for breaches in respect of 2011-12 or later years, and only for the first year in which a breach occurs. The coalition says this is common sense. However, I do recognise the efforts of my colleagues Senator Mathias Cormann and the member for Casey, who have been prosecuting the arguments.


Returning to the bill before the House, the transfer of administration responsibilities for the early release of super on compassionate grounds from APRA and the ATO to the Chief Executive of Medicare is a reasonable change. The coalition will not be opposing this bill.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2011-08-25,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (11:26):  I speak in support of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011. About 20 years ago, the Keating Labor government introduced one of the most significant economic reforms in the history of this country, the superannuation guarantee, which started at three per cent. It increased progressively to the current level of nine per cent, where it has stayed since 2003.


I was listening to the member for North Sydney's contribution in relation to this bill. It took me back. His forebears used the same arguments opposing Labor's reforms with respect to superannuation. In fact, all the way through, the idea of compulsory superannuation was denounced by the coalition as a job-destroying, antibusiness measure and a damaging, economy-destroying measure. Compulsory superannuation was opposed fiercely even though it would create financial security and dignity for older Australians. These are the same sorts of arguments that we hear today: 'We're all ruined,' is what they say—constant fear and smear.


That is all wrong, of course—wrong, wrong, wrong. In fact, in the year the nine per cent superannuation was introduced and in the years since, unemployment fell, productivity was higher and small businesses were started and prospered. The truth is that we have a superannuation sector worth about $1.4 trillion in retirement savings, which means that Australians will be able to enjoy income security in their retirement.





(Quorum formed)

The coalition are truculent, obstinate and belligerent with respect to superannuation. All they do is oppose every reform. They took no policy into the last federal election campaign to increase superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. The shadow Treasurer comes in here today and says that they will find it through savings. They could not find the savings to rebuild Queensland. It took them weeks to do that. Then they ended up with the One Nation playbook in relation to foreign aid to find it, which would have left a black hole of $1 billion in the budget if their policies on the flood levy had been adopted. That $1 billion black hole would have been on top of the $11 billion black hole they took to the last election. They reckon they will find the savings for it. They will not find the savings for it. They should be supporting Australians in their retirement. They have opposed every superannuation reform we could possibly have.


The shadow Treasurer does not even know why we are doing this. The review of this matter undertaken by the Treasury, by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and by the Department of Human Services found Medicare Australia to be the agency best placed to carry out this function. He does not even know that. He has not even looked at the review. He says, 'We are not opposed to it.' We know that some opposite are in support of an increase in superannuation for Australian workers. Federal politicians get 15.4 per cent. Why shouldn't the Australian public get an increase? Some 43,500 people in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland would get an increase in superannuation. They would get more money when they retire. This is important.


This reform comes as a result of a review. We are undertaking significant reviews in relation to these matters. This is a two-stage process. Since 3 February 2011 Medicare Australia has been performing this function under delegation from APRA. That was the first stage. The second stage will take place when this bill is given effect to and formally transfers the functions from APRA to Medicare Australia. This is an important reform because there are efficiencies here and we have customer service obligations. It will assist in better managing electronic business transactions.


Over $122 million was released on compassionate grounds in the year 2010-11, with an average of $11,316 being released on compassionate grounds. The circumstances in relation to compassionate grounds include: medical treatment, medical transport, modifications necessary for the family home or a motor vehicle due to severe disability, palliative care and funeral expenses. Funds can also be released to prevent the foreclosure of a mortgage or exercise the power of sale over the member's principal place of residence.


In relation to self-managed funds, the Commissioner of Taxation is the appropriate person. What is happening here is that, in relation to other superannuation, the general administration of superannuation funds on compassionate grounds that currently resides with APRA will be transferred to Medicare Australia. I think that is an appropriate reform because we have seen the benefit of Medicare Australia and the Department of Human Services in my electorate of Blair. When Australian people go through hard times they need to access some of the funds in their superannuation. In January 2011, when my electorate was devastated by the floodwaters from the Wivenhoe Dam, the Lockyer Creek, the Brisbane River and the Bremer River, my electorate office had numerous requests from residents to get access to their superannuation to assist them to move back into their homes and to help them to rebuild their homes. I had dozens of calls and requests from residents who wanted assistance through their superannuation funds. There were families and individuals who lost their homes in the floods—there were 3,000 homes in Ipswich and about 600 in the Somerset—and 279 agribusinesses were also damaged. They had been fighting insurance companies for months and had often been rejected. They needed a bit of a helping hand.


When dealing with the emotional trauma of evacuating their families and wondering how they could rebuild and move on they had to deal with myriad bureaucracies with various requests for information and different conditions of assistance and support. It was traumatic and it traumatised those people yet again. I know the benefit of the Department of Human Services. The Green Army was so important. The flood recovery people who wore dark green T-shirts and the people from Centrelink were symbols of hope for people. They were giving a helping hand and providing financial assistance. Most of those who turned to their superannuation funds for assistance either were declined or simply gave up because the process of applying on compassionate grounds was anything but compassionate. I need to stress that those residents in flood affected Blair would not necessarily have been able to access their funds courtesy of these amendments. The criteria for assessing early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds will remain the same. But putting this responsibility into Medicare Australia in the Department of Human Services I think creates a compassionate response. These are people who know how to deliver services and whom people who have been flood affected and are in hardship can identify as the people who provide help to them every day, every week, every month and every year.


This is not to say that APRA has not been an effective prudential regulator. But it does not have the support platform that Medicare Australia does to deal with clients—the shopfronts, call centres, customer support professionals and the like. And Medicare is more effective at dealing with people. This is why on 1 July 2011 we formed a new Department of Human Services—and it really is a new entity in many ways—to integrate Medicare, Centrelink and child support services. This is a key component of the federal Labor government's commitment to and focus on delivering services efficiently and effectively and making the whole service more client focused. I think that is good for people in my electorate. In Ipswich we are very fortunate to have a one-stop human services shop, effectively combining Medicare and Centrelink with the Local Connections to Work. I have seen firsthand the benefit to individuals and families as a result of this focus on clients rather than bureaucracy.


As a function of the Department of Human Services, it is my hope, and it is certainly my expectation, that Medicare will take a more benign and charitable approach to those wishing to access their superannuation early on compassionate grounds. Medicare personnel are already dealing with Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink personnel. They have better access to information to assess the needs of people. There are structures, systems and personnel in place to deal with them. Medicare has the experience, as I said, in electronic business transactions, and there is considerable technological infrastructure to process claims, and I saw that firsthand in January with the floods. There is significant potential to streamline this procedure, with the ultimate beneficiaries being people across the country, and certainly people in cyclone and flood affected Queensland.


Superannuation has been a concern of the Labor Party for 20 years. We have been strongly committed to compulsory superannuation. Those opposite mouth the words, but we have seen the history of the coalition parties: they have been opposed to superannuation reform, from their forebears in the 1990s all the way through. The key reform to increase superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent will make a very big difference. With an ageing population it is vital to ensure that Australians have enough money to retire on in the future. And, given that life expectancy is increasing and retirement is more an experience of decades rather than of just a few years, nine per cent is simply not enough and we need to go to 12 per cent. This is especially the case for women, who often have child-rearing breaks in their careers and have a longer life expectancy than men.


It is simply a shame and a disgrace that the coalition had no policy in the last election with respect to increasing superannuation and have steadfastly opposed, for 20 years, increases in superannuation. They have put the retirements of millions of Australians at risk and forced taxpayers to pay more for the aged pension.


We believe that this is an important reform. This amendment is just one of the steps that we are taking to make sure that superannuation continues to meet the needs of Australians in the future. It should be welcomed across the country and will certainly be welcomed in my community.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2011-08-25,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (11:41):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011. As speakers before me have said, this is really only a shifting of the deckchairs on something of a Titanic. In reality, the move of the administration of superannuation early release from APRA to Medicare may claim to have some streamlining benefits, but it does not address part of the key issue for people who are applying for early release and delays in having that approved. In the Bills Digestfor the bill, it says that in 2009-10 there were 16,331 applications and 10,539 approvals, the total amount being just over $111 million, or about $10,544 per account.


That is not the issue. On the criteria for early release of superannuation, which are not addressed by this bill, the Bills Digest says that superannuation benefits generally cannot be accessed before 55 years of age, and I think that that is good in general terms. It goes on to say:


In some specific circumstances, persons are able to apply to their superannuation fund/retirement saving account provider for the early release of superannuation benefits, including financial hardship, permanent incapacity (permanent and total disability), terminal illness, where the preserved benefit balance is $200 or less, and in cases of permanent departure from Australia.


It also goes on to say:


Superannuation benefits may also be released early on 'compassionate' grounds by application to APRA for superannuation and retirement savings accounts or by application to the Commissioner of Taxation for Self Managed Superannuation Funds. The changes proposed by the Bill relate only to the administrative arrangements for applications about early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds.


It does not address the key issue. It further says:


The circumstances under which an application for the early release on compassionate grounds can be granted are specified in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994 and Retirement Savings Accounts Regulations 1997 and include:


to pay for medical treatment or medical transport for the person or a dependant—


and I want to emphasise that because I will come to it in a minute—


to enable the person to make a payment on a loan, to prevent:


   foreclosure of a mortgage on the person’s principal place of residence


and it is important that I also highlight that—


or


   exercise by the mortgagee of an express or statutory, power of sale over the person’s principal place of residence


to modify the person’s principal place of residence, or vehicle, to accommodate the special needs of the person, or a dependant, arising from severe disability


to pay for expenses associated with the person’s palliative care, in the case of impending death, and


to pay for expenses associated with a dependant’s palliative care, in the case of impending death, funeral or burial.


I wanted to speak on this bill due to a number of representations that I have made on behalf of constituents on concerns raised by them. I will not go into individuals' names. The minister is aware of these, because I have had responses back from Minister Shorten. One was a person in Woodbury who struck severe personal and financial hardship. Her house burned down and her granddaughter was killed. She was unable to access money to repair the house as, I understand, it was not insured. She wanted to be able to access her superannuation so that she could at least keep the property and undertake some repairs to it. As I understand it, an application was put in last year. In February representations were made to the minister because she was not having any joy. I received the response from the minister on 5 July. By the way, that person has now lost her house.


These conditions by which people can supposedly access their superannuation in times of financial hardship are an absolute farce. The lady is not my constituent, by the way—she is the member for Newcastle's constituent but found no joy there. Here is a case where a lady has lost her granddaughter and her house in a fire. Subsequently, because of her economic situation and not being insured, she has lost the property on which that house stood because she could not meet the payments. Had she been able to access the amount that she had in superannuation, it may have been different. This bill does not address part of the core issues.


I received a massive number of representations arising out of the global financial crisis when the Labor government sought to protect the deposits in the four major banks. The flow-on effect of that was that businesses such as Colonial First State Investment and AMP Capital Enhanced Yield Fund froze the finances they had. People who had their money invested in those and other funds found their funds were frozen because of the rush on those funds arising out of the government's ill considered bill and an absolute refusal to think through the process and the ramifications of their actions. People had no income coming to them by which to live, they were denied social security because they had the money held in these funds and they were not sure whether these funds would collapse. We are not talking about huge amounts of money. For most of these people it was a small amount. This has led to situations where people who are applying for relief are starting to lose their homes because banks are foreclosing.


The response from the minister on the various submissions that we made to him on behalf of these people who were applying under financial hardship was basically, 'This is a problem of the global financial crisis.' In his letter he referred to all the reasons for which a person can access their superannuation and then turned around and said that it was a problem created by the global financial crisis and that it was just tough luck. I say this to the minister: the problem was not created by the global financial crisis; it was created by your decision to provide an unlimited guarantee on bank deposits. The coalition put forward a bill limiting that guarantee to $100,000. The unlimited guarantee saw a rush from investors in these funds withdrawing their money to put it into the banks. What you did was cause a collapse in that financial market. Whether it is APRA or Medicare, because of your integrity as a minister and your lack of action and understanding of these situations, you placed these individuals into financial hardship. You placed them into situations whereby their houses were in jeopardy. In fact, in one of those cases—and I will read from this person from Forster's letter without mentioning their name—they had $19,304 in one account with Colonial First State and $34,179 in another and they needed to access it. I will read from their letter:


After I retired aged 60 in Dec. 2009 Colonial advised us that these accounts were frozen due to the G.F.C. However as my husband was diagnosed in February this year with advanced renal cell cancer & bone cancer and is no longer able to work we will again attempted to close these accounts as they return only approximately 2%.


But they could not get access to their capital. Did they meet the over-55 criterion? Yes. What about financial hardship because of medical condition or life-threatening illness? I would say that if you have advanced renal cell cancer and bone cancer the long-term prospect for you is not as good as it could be. This government and APRA failed those people in this situation and that is disgraceful.


So it is not a matter of who will administer this, whether it is the head of Medicare or in part the Taxation Office or in part APRA; it is about having people that act and respond to avert the crisis that is occurring by these people not being able to access their money. At the end of the day it is those individuals' money. I know we need in superannuation to protect their investment as much as we can and we need to make sure that it provides for their retirement, but the actions of this government cost people the ability to access that money, even though they complied on a number of counts. I have another letter, this time from a person in Raymond Terrace. This and the other letter I read out are just a couple that I grabbed, instead of grabbing a huge ream of them, on the way out of the office to make this speech. This letter is about superannuation funds held by the AMP capital enhanced yield fund . This person needed to get access to the $25,000 of his superannuation that he had invested in the fund. The letter reads:




I have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and during the past five years have been having treatment for this terrible disease. These funds would assist and be vital for the medical expenses etc. which will be ongoing.



As I said at the very start of my speech when I talked about the criteria in the legislation, if money is to be used for life-threatening medical expenses, its withdrawal should be approved. But the responses from this minister have been absolutely appalling—letters written in May and responses received in August. In a letter to me of 9 August about the representation by the person whose letter I just read out, the minister said:




Frozen accounts stem from the ongoing turmoil in international financial markets. While Australia has weathered the financial storm better than any other developed nation in the world, the global financial crisis is still having a significant impact. As a result, some investment funds are still having difficulty attracting fresh investment inflows.





Because of this, many funds have not had sufficient liquid assets or cash to be able to pay out redemption requests and those funds have chosen to put a freeze on redemptions as allowed under law, until the liquidity position of the fund improves. The decision to freeze redemptions is one taken by each individual fund and is not a decision taken by Government.



Minister, the decision to freeze the fund came about directly because of your unlimited guarantees of deposits with the four majors. This caused the flow of cash from these investment houses to the major banks as people naturally went to protect their financial returns. Minister, you have not only failed this nation economically but also failed these individuals, who, in their hour of absolute need, needed access to their money either to save their life through payment for proper and expedient medical assistance or to save their property threatened by circumstances beyond their control. Withdrawal of funds to do either of these things is completely within the guidelines listed in the legislation. Minister, you have failed those people, and for that you should be condemned. It is a good idea to control the money in question by moving it to a single house such as Medicare, but we need to see fast and responsive action to genuine claims so that people can access their money as per all the criteria stated in the legislation and avert long-term situations which always end up negative.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (11:55):  I am pleased to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011. I have already made some comments on this bill, but I made them in another form: a report made in my role as Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. This is a non-controversial bill—it is about acknowledging a practice that currently exists and tidying up the legislation.


The bill proposes to move the responsibility for the administration of the early release on compassionate grounds of benefits in a retirement savings account or of superannuation benefits in an entity regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority from APRA to the Chief Executive Officer of Medicare. Similarly, the bill proposes to transfer the general administration of the early release of superannuation funds on compassionate grounds from the Commissioner of Taxation to the Chief Executive Officer of Medicare. The bill formalises an arrangement that has been in place since 3 February this year, when APRA and Medicare Australia entered into a service delivery agreement for Medicare Australia to carry out the day-to-day functions of the administration of the early release of superannuation in APRA-regulated superannuation entities under delegation from APRA. At the same time, the day-to-day functions of the administration of the early release of superannuation and superannuation funds under delegation from the Commissioner of Taxation was transferred from APRA to Medicare Australia.


There is no extra cost associated with this bill. Part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill amends the APRA Act 1998 so that the industry levy associated with the administration of the early release of superannuation benefits currently paid to APRA can be properly transferred to Medicare Australia to meet administrative costs. To support this arrangement, APRA officers were transferred to Medicare Australia in February this year to undertake the administration of the early release function.


The bill was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services for consideration. The committee supports and endorses moves to formalise the interim arrangements that have been in place for over six months now, and after consideration of the evidence the committee agreed not to inquire further into this bill and recommended that the House pass the bill—it is non-controversial. This bill is simply a formalisation of arrangements that are currently in place, and I recommend it.





(Quorum formed) In respect for my colleagues, rather than give them the full 15 minutes I had left of my speech, can I just say that this is a good amendment, it is a good bill. It actually is supported by the other side. As to why they would want to interrupt the debate, I am not sure. I recommend the bill to the House.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2011-08-25,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (12:01):  The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011 will transfer the responsibility for administration of the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds from APRA and the ATO to the Chief Executive of Medicare. This is a bill that the coalition does not oppose and, given that the bill also effectively transfers the relevant component of fees currently collected by APRA from APRA regulated funds to cover the cost of administering the early release of superannuation to Medicare, there should be no budget or financial impact on Medicare.


As noted, the bill transfers the responsibility for administration of the early release of superannuation. The administration of the early release of superannuation may not have sat well with APRA's role as the prudential regulator. Certainly, as the member for Paterson very rightly pointed out earlier, the time taken to process applications and get payments made—I know, from my previous experience as a financial adviser—has taken significant periods and has created additional financial burdens for the people involved. In view of that, it is probably quite appropriate that this function is administered by an agency that has other elements of income support and an efficient customer support infrastructure.


The circumstances under which superannuation can be released prior to age 55 is clearly defined in the SIS Act and allows, in specific circumstances as defined, people to apply to their superannuation funds or retirement savings account provider for the early release of their superannuation benefits. Early release of superannuation benefits may be applicable for people facing financial hardship, permanent incapacity, terminal illness, where the preserved balance is $200 or less and in cases of permanent departure from Australia. The provision where the balance is $200 or less was used a number of times in my practice, because it is one less thing that people had to worry about and it saves a lot of administration costs for superannuation funds for those small account balances, which frequently get lost or misplaced. 


Superannuation benefits may also be released early on compassionate grounds by application to APRA for superannuation and retirement savings accounts or by application to the Commissioner of Taxation for self-managed super funds. This bill will not change that. The changes proposed by the bill relate only to the administrative arrangements. Some of the things that superannuation can be released for under compassionate grounds include payment for medical treatment and transport for a person or a dependant; enabling a person to make a payment on a loan in the event of possible foreclosure of a mortgage on a person's principal place of residence, or exercise by the mortgagee of an express or statutory power of sale; or to modify a person's principal place of residence or vehicle to accommodate the special needs of the person or a dependent arising from severe disability. It can also be released to pay for expenses associated with palliative care in the case of impending death and to pay for expenses associated with dependants with palliative care needs in the case of impending death, funeral or burial.


The member for Paterson very rightly pointed out some of the issues with these regulations. It is important to note that, while individuals may apply to APRA for the early release of superannuation benefits on the compassionate grounds that I have just listed, a superannuation fund trustee or retirement savings account provider ultimately decides what benefits they will or will not release, subject to the governing rules of the fund. As the member for Paterson also pointed out, in the global financial crisis there were a number of people, even those who had passed age 55, who had extreme difficulty in having funds released from their superannuation accounts because funds were frozen.


In assessing applications for the early release of superannuation, APRA is required to adhere to specific assessment criteria, and it is important that that process is properly followed. That is where we find that a lot of the time is taken up in getting the process completed. The applicant does have the ability to appeal a decision and, if they are not satisfied, they may request an internal review by an independent APRA delegate or an external review of the process by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. But, at the end of the day, if the superannuation fund trustee or the retirement savings account provider decides that the funds are frozen, people seeking access to those funds will still not be able to get those funds.


A concern with respect to the proposals in this bill is that there does not appear to have been any great public announcement prior to the introduction of the bill. Certainly, the financial planners that I still deal with and speak to inform me that they did not have any idea that this had been proposed or was on the drawing board. That is a major issue of concern: the lack of information in an industry that would be primarily responsible for dealing with clients in this situation.


As the member for Oxley pointed out, it appears that Medicare Australia has been managing these claims since February 2011 under delegation from APRA. I have not been able to find where the details of this delegation have been made public, including the amount of funding transferred to Medicare Australia to enable it to perform this task. Given that this is a government that apparently prides itself on openness and accountability, that is a serious issue of concern. There is no information in APRA's annual reports, or in other public resources, on the value of the revenue raised by the levy that APRA currently charges on superannuation funds under its regulation, so we cannot verify that the amount of money being transferred to Medicare to provide these additional services is in reality sufficient for what they require. It is important, given the increasing range of non-health related programs that Medicare Australia is now administering, that it is adequately resourced financially to meet this increasing workload. An example of other increased services provided by Medicare Australia is its assumption of responsibility, since July 2010, as the small business clearinghouse for superannuation—again, a service that the majority of small businesses that I have spoken to did not even know about. It is shown in the figures that less than one per cent of small business have taken up the service.


Given the stringent guidelines surrounding the early release of superannuation benefits, it is important that Medicare Australia is properly resourced and staff are properly trained, as many people who are seeking early release of superannuation funds are facing stressful circumstances and require compassion and understanding when dealing with this difficult issue.


As I noted at the outset, the coalition does not oppose the bill, but we trust that this transfer of responsibilities is implemented smoothly and in an efficient manner to minimise any impact on people who may be seeking to access their superannuation benefits. Given the track record of this government over the past four years, we have some serious concerns, and the issues that the member for Paterson raised earlier in terms of responses from the relevant minister also raise concerns.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2011-08-25,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (12:10):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011. In the current economic times, the value of people's superannuation is a constant conversation in workplaces, around dinner tables and at social gatherings throughout Australia. People are very concerned. For many people the only exposure they have to the share market is through their superannuation fund, while others have both private investment and superannuation in stocks and bonds. That is part of the reason the current market volatility is being watched—specifically by those who are close to or at the point of retirement—so closely around the country and why the calculators are out, with people trying to work out the impact on individual accounts and the amount they have available to them. In fact, Australians are extremely concerned about exactly what their superannuation will be worth when they need it.


In the past few years, all forms of financial advisers and accountants have constantly dealt with concerned clients and new clients—people who, for the first time, are taking a direct interest in their superannuation. It is in this environment we find ourselves discussing superannuation legislation in the bill before the House. As we know, the bill amends the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to facilitate the transfer of the administration of the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to the Chief Executive of Medicare. Generally, as we know, superannuation cannot be accessed before you are at least 55 years old. That is so that Australians can fund themselves in retirement. However, in some very specific circumstances, the law allows the early release of benefits that are held in a retirement savings account or superannuation benefits in an APRA regulated entity.


Also, the bill transfers the general administration of the early release of superannuation benefits in self-managed super funds on compassionate grounds from the Commissioner of Taxation to the Chief Executive of Medicare. In most circumstances, these benefits are taxed. Even though the government gives permission to access superannuation early, the super fund trustee does not have to release those benefits to the individual concerned. The superannuation fund trustee or RSA provider decides what benefits they will and will not release and may charge fees for the early release of the funds. This is a concern to some of my constituents. Several of my constituents have needed to access part or all of their preserved benefits and savings prior to actual retirement for a range of compassionate reasons covered by this bill. It is never an easy decision. It is often a decision of last resort, according to the circumstances that people find themselves in. Generally, a constituent and their spouse, partner or dependent children are in extreme distress and under a great deal of personal as well as financial pressure when they have to make this decision. They may be suffering from a medical problem. It may be a life-threatening illness or an injury. They may be desperate for the funds to alleviate acute or chronic physical pain or be suffering from acute or chronic mental conditions, and that makes this process quite difficult. They may need it to pay for medical transport, which is really a major issue in regional and rural areas such as those in my electorate. It is a critical issue, made worse for people who live in very small communities, in isolated areas or on isolated properties. They might live in a very small community or on an isolated rural lot, and they will have to deal with this issue of medical transport. Increasingly we are finding that there are people who may not have relatives or friends to assist them at that time, so the issue of medical transport in regional areas is a very important one to the people affected.


Most of these circumstances, for people who find themselves in this position, are totally unexpected. It is a real shock for the person affected and for their whole family. It is always extremely difficult to manage and, of course, you do not really plan for this—you do not expect it to happen. It depends entirely on each person's individual circumstances as to what they are facing and what their financial situation is. It is for these sorts of reasons that some people need to access their retirement savings to prevent mortgagees from selling their homes, for example, because of overdue loan repayments, something I have certainly seen an increase of in recent years.


The early release of superannuation funds and retirement savings can also occur on compassionate grounds to fund the funeral expenses or palliative care that often follow the instances I mentioned previously. If a person or one of their dependants is severely disabled, he or she can apply to access their superannuation or retirement funds if this disability requires their home or car to be modified because of the disability. For those who have lost their jobs or who are in extremely difficult financial situations—and I would think many members in this House would, like me, have dealt with people who have found themselves in that position in recent times—it can be a difficult situation and they may also be able to access a portion of their benefits, subject to certain conditions. This can be that they have been receiving Commonwealth income support, such as unemployment benefits, for at least 26 continuous weeks and the trustee of their super fund is satisfied that the person cannot meet their immediate family expenses. This adds to the pressure that the individual finds themselves under. A payment is for the purposes of meeting everyday living expenses and can be one payment of no more than $10,000, including tax, in any 12-month period. The other condition is that when the person has reached their preservation age they may be able to receive their entire superannuation benefit, provided that they have received government income support for at least 39 weeks.


It is reasonable to suggest that a body that understands income support, such as Medicare, would be able to judge the compassionate needs of superannuants in the situations that I have mentioned throughout my speech. As such, the move to make the Chief Executive Officer of Medicare responsible for the administration of the early release of superannuation is understandable. Given that this has been in effect under a delegation agreement since February this year, this bill will simply formalise existing functions. The transfer of fees collected as a levy to manage this administration will be progressed, but again, as the member for Forde and the member for Paterson said, we do not have information as to whether these fees will be sufficient to allow the administration that is required to be conducted efficiently by Medicare in this instance.


Many members will, like me, have been approached by constituents who have only limited superannuation as they approach retirement. We know that over the last 10 years the top-performing superannuation products are returning on average around five per cent. Many people who are now close to retirement are focusing particularly on the amount that is in their superannuation funds. There are those who have seen the value of those superannuation funds diminish. It has caused a number of people to investigate how they could make these funds more secure, because the volatility of the market has seen the value of those superannuation funds erode.


My office would be similar to many others, with a number of constituents looking at where their funds are currently invested, how they are invested, what they are worth, what the changes to them are and how those changes are going to impact those people. It is a particularly relevant issue for people who are facing retirement in the immediate sense. The value of these superannuation funds is particularly critical to them. On that basis, Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your time.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2011-08-25,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (12:21):  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011 because, like many members who have spoken on this bill, it has particular relevance to operations within my electorate and impacts a number of people. Let me say at the outset that superannuation is a very valuable tool for people's retirement. There is much debate on whether it should be nine per cent or 12 per cent et cetera, but it is obviously designed to provide retirement income for many Australians as compared to the pension, which is not a lifestyle remuneration but a safety net. That is why superannuation is so important. This bill does change the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds in two ways. It transfers the responsibility for administration of the early release of super on compassionate grounds from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA, and the Australian Taxation Office, or ATO, to Medicare and it transfers the relevant component of fees currently collected from APRA-regulated funds to cover the cost of administering the early release of super by Medicare without any financial impact. This bill does not affect the criteria for early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds. This is important to my electorate because Canning has 40 per cent of voters aged 55 or above. It is quite an interesting demographic. Fifty-five years is the general minimum age that the early release of superannuation payments can be applied for. As we know 55 is not old—I am 58, which is not old at all; in fact, I suspect it is the old 35—but it is the trigger point.


I do not oppose the release of superannuation on compassionate grounds and I do not necessarily oppose the restructuring of the channels through which these moneys are distributed. But there must always be a sense of caution. My office is quite often contacted by people within the electorate saying: 'Look, I am in dire straits. If I don't get access to my superannuation funds, I'm going to lose my house.' There is a whole range of issues such as health care: someone has contracted a terminal disease, they need the funds for medicines et cetera. They are all genuine cases, but the word of caution is: should the funds be released without a lot of scrutiny, which then leaves nothing left for retirement? I suspect if you are not going to be here then it is not going to be any use to you, but if you get an early release of funds and that is all you have then it does not say much for the quality of life you are going to have some years later.


Another reason why I am cautious about this bill, and we do not oppose it, is the impact it is going to have on Medicare services. This government obviously is giving more responsibility to Medicare. We know that is the mechanism that the flood levy was going to be collected through. We had Centrelink as a one-stop shop, now Medicare will be a one-stop shop. The problem with that is Medicare will continue to be under continued pressure.


I am sure that members of parliament in this House would agree that whenever somebody has a problem with a government department, because it is too difficult for the officer at the front desk to give them a straight answer or is not the answer they might be looking for, they come to us as their elected representatives. We always get the too-hard basket ones. You know they have often shopped around before they come to us as members of parliament.


In the coalition government, the member for North Sydney, Joe Hockey, was responsible for public administration. In the case of Centrelink, he appointed electorate liaison officers. It really was fantastic. When Labor came to power they got rid of them. However, if you had a problem with Centrelink—and this is what I suspect the government might want to look at in loading more responsibilities onto Medicare—you discussed it with an electorate liaison officer and this person had the authority to sign-off. It stopped a mountain of paperwork and a mountain of delays because we had an electorate liaison officer in the local Centrelink office that we could go to and have problems solved. How sensible was that? They did not spend their whole time on it, they were doing other duties, but we had a go-to person.


People say, 'Oh, yes, but there are government liaison people in Medicare you can go to.' No, these electorate liaison officers were specifically assigned to our electorates and they knew our electorates. They were quite often in Centrelink offices within our electorates, so they knew the turf, they knew the people and they knew the issues. As a result, we could get some very good results for people who did not want a paper war—a letter to the minister, a reply that came back, essentially written by the department in any case, which said, 'Computer says 'no'', which meant we then had to take the lobbying process even further. I want put on the record that, as a result of loading up Medicare, this could be an alternative if the government really wants to ease the burden.


We know that the areas of responsibility shifted to Medicare include the administration of the Home Insulation Program on behalf of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, and setting up the clearing house arrangements for small business—more extra duties for Medicare—yet the government's position on private health industry insurance is to limit the desire of people to have private health insurance. We know the government has tried several times to take away the private health insurance rebate. The effect of that will be to force more people onto the public health system. It will load up public health and the rebates and all that goes with it.


Yesterday, I stood in the courtyard here with other members and senators from Western Australia because the health insurer HBF had collected 32,000 signatures on a petition from their Western Australian members in a month saying that if the government, in conjunction with the Greens—we know the Greens have a particular view on this as well—were to remove the 30 per cent rebate, it is going to force many people off private health insurance and back onto the public health system. As a result, and we know anybody who goes to hospital or a doctor will be treated one way or another, it will load up the public system. In effect it is a cost-shifting mechanism. The effect of trying to do this is expected to cost an extra $3.8 billion to the public health system. In turn, this will put more pressure on these related services. For Labor to deny this is totally untrue. You cannot believe them. I will not use the three-letter word, but I can say it is not true. The health minister, Nicola Roxon, clearly stated in a media release dated 26 September 2007:


… on many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including … the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians


What have the government done? They have tried to change that three times at least. It is a bit like: 'There will be no carbon tax under this government I lead. I have my fingers crossed behind my back; please believe me.' Research by the Australian Health Industry shows that under Labor's proposed health insurance rebate changes, 175,000 Australians would drop private health cover—putting pressure on the public health system, and putting pressure on Medicare, which is the office meant to deal with this early release of superannuation. Minister Roxon was forced to admit on 16 October 2008: 


The projection of the number of people from Treasury that will drop out of health insurance is just under half a million—492,000 people.


And the Australian newspaper on 24 June 2011 reported:


MORE than 2.4 million Australians with private health insurance will be forced to find up to $935 extra a year for their premiums if the government can manoeuvre its means test for the 30 per cent rebate through parliament …


In fact, I have received correspondence from constituents who are very concerned about this issue as I speak today. Even they can see that Labor's proposed changes would increase private health insurance premiums, and put more pressure on the public health sector and systems like Medicare—but this is the agenda of the government.


I have a particular view on superannuation. As I said, I am very supportive of those who need a release of superannuation on compassionate grounds. Those who need early release for those reasons should be well heard, but with the caveats that I have put on it. But we have a massive amount of money tied up in superannuation funds throughout Australia. You have heard the dulcet tones of the former reserve bank governor, Bernie Fraser, 'Come to my industry fund and put the money in there so that we can purloin your money and help our organisation.' I say: use the money wisely. One of the ways I would like to see it used wisely, from a personal point of view and a policy point of view, would be for some of it to be released for first home buyers. Not young people necessarily; parents could get access to a deposit for their home through all this money tied up in superannuation. After all it is their money. If they can grow it by buying an asset like a house why should they not be given that sort of opportunity? That is my personal view, which is nothing to do with coalition policy, but there is a massive amount of money tied up, particularly in the hands of industry funds, which have a different agenda from some others, and it could well be used in a more effective way in the future.


In conclusion, the government does not have a competent record on administration. As I have said, what a farce the BER was. What has happened to the set-top boxes that were announced in the budget? Who is going to administer the set-top boxes? Is this going to end up in one of these departments as well? How many people are going to get a set-top box in one of the wackiest policies that this government has ever put out? Who is going to administer that? Is this going to go through Medicare as well? I have to say that in terms of public policy the people who thought that up were obviously the same people who thought up putting pink batts in your roof and how to burn down your house in a short while! At the end of the day I am not aware of anyone in my electorate who has come to me and said, 'I want a set-top box.' In fact, if you gave me a voucher for $300 or $400 I would probably go and buy a plasma TV or something at Harvey Norman but not a fancy set-top box.


As I have said, I agree with the need for early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds. Certainly, these payments are important and help people in often financially and emotionally tough situations. I do hope that the administrative changes will not cause any further costs or pressures to our healthcare system, as I have outlined, and Medicare services or any duress to administering payments to the people who need them most.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (12:34):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011, which the coalition does not oppose. This bill deals with the administration of the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds. I stress the point that it is the administration. In reading the bill I find that it does not speak of changing the wording or the intent. It does not speak of making the process for applying for early release of your superannuation any easier, it just shifts the administration from one body to another.


The bill transfers the responsibility for administration of early release of the superannuation on compassionate grounds from APRA—the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority—and the Australian Taxation Office, which I will refer to as the ATO, to the Chief Executive of Medicare and allows APRA to include the cost of administration of this early release by Medicare in the annual levy it charges for superannuation funds. The rationale for the transfer from APRA and the ATO to Medicare as given in the explanatory memorandum is that this scheme is best administered 'by an agency that has other elements of income support and an efficient customer support infrastructure'. Predominantly what that means is that Medicare has more outlets around the nation—there is more accessibility to frontline staff—as opposed to dealing with APRA, who I am sure are competent but their areas of expertise probably do not include the frontline specialist skills that we require.


Before I go on, let us look at some of the comments we have heard from previous speakers who took the opportunity to drift into the topic of increasing superannuation amounts from nine per cent to 15 per cent. One of the examples that they brought up was that as a government we should not deprive the Australian people of an increase to 15.4 per cent because that is what the politicians get—why should we get it and not let the general public share the same superannuation levy? That is economic ridiculousness. Why not go one step further and say that everyone should be on the same money that the Prime Minister is on? This is the same economic rationale that that argument brings to this House. 


The reason that these comments would be raised, in fairness, is that very few people from the other side of the House actually have any concept or fundamental understanding of how small business works, and this is where the cost would be borne in an increase from nine to 15 per cent superannuation. It would be borne by business. While the government says that there would be a one per cent decrease on their tax, from 30 per cent back to 29 per cent, I suggest that there is only so much money available in a business to try to make ends meet and when you have to trim costs, often one of your variable cost line items is your staff. So I fear that the silliness of the economic rationalism being used could potentially put Australian jobs at risk and I would encourage people to tread carefully when considering flippant increases to 15 per cent.


I also remind the government of the enormous pressures on small business and families at the moment with the basic cost-of-living pressures. One must consider the outrageous increases in energy costs since 2007. Don't shake your head, they have gone up. I have seen it at home—50 per cent they have gone up!




Mr Hartsuyker:
  Shame!




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  Shame! So do not shake your head, because you get energy bills as well!



Mr Shorten interjecting—




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  Mate, I love your work! So there are cost-of-living pressures—energy prices, gas prices—and these are all inhibitors on the Australian economy at the moment. Our fuel prices have gone through the roof.


And while we talk about economic vandalism and listen to some of the comments we have heard in the House with reference to the superannuation debate, I bring the attention to the flippancy with which this government refers to the 7.2 per cent of our GDP debt ratio as being relatively small in comparison with other nations. I suggest that the argument that it is relatively small compared to other nations begs the question: why is it that we cannot pay that back? Why is it that we are having so much trouble servicing—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! This is a bill on superannuation and I ask the member to return to the bill.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  Absolutely. It is strange to hear the words 'efficient' and 'infrastructure' used in conjunction with this government, because to date its record has been one of inefficiency almost across the board. From the pink batts debacle all the way through to the NBN, this government in all cases has managed to take the most inefficient approach possible.


While there are special circumstances in which superannuation can be accessed, including medical conditions and severe financial hardship, the Australian tax office has recently noted that a number of schemes are promising customers that they can help access super for reasons such as paying off credit card debt, paying bills, buying new cars or even going on holidays. Last year around 1,300 people were sprung by the Australian Taxation Office for participating in such schemes. I would like to remind anyone considering involving themselves in one of these dodgy schemes that not only are the schemes illegal, but they will also cost you a whole lot more than you expect and you could even potentially end up in jail.


In the current economic climate, while we remain vulnerable to the tremors and quakes currently disrupting global markets, while cost-of-living pressures are squeezing every last spare dollar out of ordinary hardworking families, while the government is planning on adding to the pain with the introduction of its illegitimate and pointless carbon tax—in times like this—it is no wonder that more and more people would be looking to get hold of their super. That is the point I was making earlier with reference to cost-of-living pressures. That was the point I was making about people wanting to get access to their superannuation just to make ends meet. I make the point that electricity prices are up 16 per cent, after going up another 10 per cent from the year before; gas is up 18 per cent, after a 13 per cent jump last year; and water is up 16 per cent, after another 13 per cent last year; and it just goes on and on.


In Queensland, power bills alone have increased by more than 60 per cent in less than five years. That is the point I was making earlier. What do you reckon will happen when the carbon tax kicks in? Is it any wonder that we are seeing more shonky operators out there trying to take advantage of people who are looking at the smashed remnants of their piggybanks and wondering what they are going to do next? Things are undoubtedly tough at the moment and when times are tough people want to know that their government is exercising the same sort of restraint and fiscal responsibility that they are having to undergo in their household budgets.


I also want to bring your attention to a case that we are dealing with in our electorate office at the moment that is relevant to the early release of superannuation. I am fearful that we will continue as a nation to see more and more examples like this as people try to get access to their savings funds. One of my constituents is a lady who has a small marketing business based in a regional part of the electorate. Regretfully, our constituent—and a wonderful woman she is—is suffering from cancer. Her illness takes her away from her business, and like most small businesses, as we on this side will understand, often you are the CEO as well as the truck driver, the sales team, the marketer, the accounting department and customer service. One- and two-man-band teams have huge pressures on them. Because of her illness, she has been unable to work, but the cost pressures still land at her feet. The cost pressures of the tenancy agreement that she has for her building, the cost pressure of leases on vehicles, and the cost pressures of the continuing commitment for photocopiers, fax machines and phones still exist. Often when these small businesses enter the market to try to contribute to the economy of the nation they also have to service a business loan. Often that business loan is secured by the family home, the very home which they have worked their entire lives for. So illness has grasped this lady, and she is struggling to get access to her superannuation.


As I alluded to in my opening comments, this bill does not inhibit this case because the loopholes in this legislation are not touched. The bill only speaks to the transfer of the administration. The point I make is that I am very fearful that there will be many more Australian small businesses—many more mums and dads—who, as cost-of-living pressures are put upon them, will be drawn to try to access their savings from their superannuation.


Under circumstances such as these, I believe it is worth while to reflect on the ways in which members of the public can gain early access to their superannuation. The circumstances under which benefits may be released are, quite rightly, extremely limited. The first of these, and one covered by this bill, is an early release on compassionate grounds. In most cases, compassionate grounds refer to an applicant who needs the money to pay for medical costs associated with life-threatening illnesses and/or acute chronic pain and/or acute or chronic mental illness. However, these grounds rely upon the necessary treatment not being readily available through the public health system and not being covered by any applicable private health insurance or workers compensation.


Compassionate grounds may also be considered to prevent the family home being sold by the lender with whom the applicant has a home mortgage. There are numerous further conditions, chief among which is that the applicant's mortgage must be sufficiently in arrears for the lending institution to have decided to sell.


In some circumstances provisions can also be made for assistance to meet palliative care costs and for the costs associated with funeral, burial or cremation. There are of course other circumstances under which people can apply for the early release of superannuation, including severe financial hardship. However, as they are not part of this bill, I will not go into them today.


Nevertheless, the rules and regulations surrounding the early release of superannuation are fiendishly complex and there is no guarantee of success. In fact, of the approximately 16,000 applications received in the 2009-10 financial year, only 10,000 were approved. Approval ratings over the past three financial years are somewhere around 65 per cent. That is why we on this side of the House are pleased that this bill will finally allow applicants to deal face to face with professional customer service staff who will, hopefully, make the process significantly less arduous and significantly less stressful than it previously has been. As I said in my opening comments, the coalition does not oppose the bill. The bill deals with the administration of the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds, and we support it.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2011-08-25,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (12:48):  I thank all members for their contributions to the debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Early Release of Superannuation) Bill 2011, and I would like to take this opportunity to remind members of the broader context of superannuation. The shadow Treasurer today confirmed in the House of Representatives debate on the bill that the coalition support superannuation. In fact, shortly after 11:10 am, the member for North Sydney told the House that the coalition strongly support superannuation. But if one wants to make the large, grandiose statement of intent then surely the time has come for the shadow Treasurer to answer some questions about what support by the coalition actually adds up to. 


If the coalition really support superannuation, what are their plans to increase every Australian worker's superannuation savings? For instance, do they support the Gillard government's plans to lift the universal superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent? Do they support an increase in concessional caps for people over 50 which allows people to boost retirement savings without incurring excess contributions tax? If they support superannuation, do they support providing 3½ million Australians on incomes under $37,000 more superannuation by refunding their contributions tax? Sixty per cent of the beneficiaries of this measure are women. Given the profits of Australia's biggest resources companies and the records that are being set—the most recent today reported by BHP—why is it that the coalition will not support an MRRT which would help fund an increase in retirement savings of 8.4 million Australians, including 55,300 in the shadow Treasurer's own electorate of North Sydney?


If the coalition mean what they say, if the coalition actually strongly support superannuation, then it is time for those questions I have just enumerated to the House to be answered. I am prepared to provide every member of the House details of how many people in their electorate are set to benefit from an increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. The coalition have promised time and time again that they would provide a response to the Henry review recommendations on superannuation and thereby release a retirement savings policy. It is now well over a year since the Henry review was released. There are many more questions about the coalition's retirement savings policy—or should I say lack of a retirement savings policy by the coalition—than there are in fact financial service businesses in the shadow Treasurer's own North Sydney electorate—and there are, of course, many of those in that electorate.


This past Saturday, 20 August, we celebrated the 20-year anniversary of one of the great economic reforms of the modern era in Australia: the announcement in parliament of the tabling of the bill to lift compulsory superannuation from three to nine per cent. Superannuation works. We do not mind the coalition supporting it; we do not even mind them owning some of the achievements. We just wish that whenever they had the opportunity to vote for improvements in superannuation they would actually do as they say. Superannuation works; it has proven to be an idea in the best interests of the nation. It is a policy that is in the best tradition of what Labor governments should do.


The economic history books record that the introduction of compulsory superannuation coincided with the rise of all the major economic indicators. I reassure the member for Wright about his concerns. Somehow he viewed this as a tax on business. Throughout the period of the increase of superannuation from three to nine per cent in each increment, it was shown that it did not increase business costs and that it was offset against real wages movements. For workers, it was not a tax on them either, because what it allowed was compulsory savings that they might not have otherwise been able to make and which would have an anti-inflationary offset on the other wage increases they were receiving at the time of the mandatory increases.


I believe that in 2011 it is time for us to improve the rewards of hard work and to allow Australians to reach out confidently for the goal of lifetime income security. I believe that people who work hard all their lives should be able to view the prospect of retirement with some degree of comfort and certainty about the adequacy of the income that they will have saved. Given that the great gift of the 20th century is increasing life expectancy for Australians in the 21st century, and given that retirement now is much more an experience of decades for Australians than the experience of a few years, nine per cent is simply not enough. This is especially the case for women, who may have breaks in their careers to raise families and who indeed have a longer life expectancy than men.


This is why the Gillard government is committed to raising compulsory superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. Lifting the rate means that an employee aged 30 today on average weekly earnings will retire with an additional $108,000 in superannuation. A female aged 30 today on average weekly earnings with an interrupted work pattern could retire with an additional $78,000 in superannuation. Why on earth would any political party in this place want to encourage the idea that Australians should work hard their whole lives and then face retirement in an income environment which does not provide for an adequate replacement rate? (Quorum formed)




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: under standing order 91, I point out to all members of the House that the decision to pull a quorum on a minister when they are closing on important legislation just demonstrates how reckless this opposition is and how determined it is to destroy the standards of this place for its own political purposes.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  Order! I note the Government Whip's comments. I call the Assistant Treasurer.




Mr SHORTEN:
  This is why the Gillard government is committed to lifting the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. The bills deal with the formal transfer of responsibility for the general administration of the early release of superannuation on compassionate grounds. The responsibility currently resides with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The transfer is simply a change to the administrator of the function of determining eligibility for early release. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (13:45):  Today I rise to speak about an amazing individual in my electorate who is passionate about finding a cure for a disease that affects approximately 100,000 Australians and over 6.3 million individuals worldwide—Parkinson's Disease. Kieran Donlon is pedalling for Parkinson's next month to raise money for research and will ride his bike 4,000 kilometres from Cairns to Warrnambool.


Kieran's wife, Julie, has been living with Parkinson's Disease for 15 years. Unfortunately, there is currently no cure and scientists do not even understand the cause. Kieran says he hopes to raise $20 million, with every cent raised going to the Florey Neuroscience Institutes, not towards administration costs. Kieran says, 'If every individual donates a dollar, it is achievable. I'm doing this for Julie, I'm doing this for people with Parkinson's and I'm doing this for people who have yet to be diagnosed.'


Today I would like to urge people to support Kieran and the fight to find a cure for Parkinson's, and to urge members of this House to assist with local media to raise awareness of Kieran's ride where possible. Kieran will pass through 24 electorates on his ride. People can support Kieran and research into Parkinson's by going into any Bendigo Bank branch or by donating online.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (13:59):  Briefly, earlier this week I advised the House that I had been asked by members of parliament as to whether or not we would do anything to offer our condolences to the people of Norway on their losses, and I said I would have something further to say about it during the course of the week. I can now advise the House that I have written to the Norwegian Prime Minister, Jens Stoltenberg, inviting him to visit Australia as an official guest of government. Mr Stoltenberg is intending to transit through Australia on way to the Norwegian Antarctic Territory. Given that Norway is a good friend and a good partner of our country, I thought it was appropriate to offer him the opportunity for a formal head of government visit. Australia and a Norway cooperate on a number of important global challenges, including arms control, peace building, peacekeeping and climate change, so I am delighted that he has accepted his invitation and he will be here a little later this year.


This week also marks one month since the brutal attacks which took place in Norway. In my letter to Prime Minister Stoltenberg I took the opportunity again to convey our deepest condolences to the victims, their families and the people of Norway. Their courage and strength is an inspiration and we will have an opportunity to reflect on that when the Prime Minister of Norway is with us.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:03):  Of course I am aware of statements made by Kathy Jackson. Kathy Jackson is a union official. Unions, are, of course, the organisations that the Leader of the Opposition wanted to put out of business as part of the Work Choices agenda.


On the issues that he has raised about the member for Dobell, can I say this to the Leader of the Opposition: another day and he digs himself deeper into the mud of hypocrisy on this question. Can I remind the Leader of the Opposition there is only one member of the federal parliament who has been charged with a criminal offence. That is a Liberal Party senator who has been charged with an offence against a person and an offence against property, and those charges are obviously coming to trial and going through appropriate criminal processes. It is not appropriate in respect of that Liberal senator for conclusions to be drawn about her innocence or guilt beforehand. The Leader of the Opposition said that. He said:


The matter is now before the courts where I understand it will be contested and she should be extended the presumption of innocence.


That is in relation to a criminal charge and I repeat again: the only member of this parliament facing criminal charges is a Liberal senator.


On the question of the matters involving the member for Dobell, as is well known, there is a Fair Work Australia investigation in progress and I believe it is appropriate to wait for the outcome of any such investigation.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister was asked a question about the member for Dobell, who has no case before the courts at this stage. The Prime Minister is answering on the basis of a Liberal senator who has been charged with an offence. That is obviously an entirely different case and she therefore can answer the question.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The point of order was not relevant to the question but, if the point of order is direct relevance, at the point in time that the Prime Minister was interrupted she was being directly relevant, and I highly encourage her to continue to conclude her answer in a directly relevant manner.




Ms GILLARD:
  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for confirming what I have said to the parliament—that there is only one member of parliament charged with a criminal offence. 


For the member for Dobell, people know there are Fair Work Australia investigations in process and the appropriate thing to do is to wait for the outcome of those investigations.


Can I also remind the Leader of the Opposition not only is he mired in the hypocrisy of applying a completely different standard to a Liberal senator than any standard he extends to the member for Dobell; he is mired in hypocrisy in that when in government he was the first one as Leader of Government Business to get to this dispatch box to defend Liberal members who were in various scrapes and to say that they should be extended the presumption of innocence and that people should not act or draw conclusions until investigations came to an end. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that at that time he sat behind Prime Minister Howard, who said—and I specifically adopt these words as my own:


… a lot of people who are under investigation end up having nothing to answer for.


He was talking about a police investigation dealing with three Liberal MPs. He went on to say:


It's a police investigation and the appropriate thing for me to do is to let the police investigation run its course and then if it is appropriate I will have something to say.


Prime Minister Howard was right then. I adopt those words now in relation to the member for Dobell and the Fair Work Australia investigation.

She was standing alongside me as we campaigned against his destruction of Medicare and bulk-billing. She was standing alongside me as we campaigned against his $1 billion worth of cutbacks to the public hospital system. She was standing alongside me as we campaigned against the disgraceful way that Australians—




Dr Stone:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I think you are aware of what it will be, Mr Speaker—it is on relevance. There is nothing in the question from the Leader of the Opposition which asks about the health portfolio or past history; it is about the issue of the day.




The SPEAKER:
  The Prime Minister is responding to the question.




Ms GILLARD:
  It is not my fault that they are badly drafted. On a question that specifically raised character issues in relation to Kathy Jackson, I am responding. In specifically responding to those character issues as raised, I remind the parliament about the campaign that she and others participated in because pensioners could not get the most basic dental care under the Leader of the Opposition when he was presiding as health minister. Let us remember all of the things that were happening as they sought to spread Work Choices to the public hospital system. Let us remember the real threats that there were to tie public hospital funding to the offering of Australian workplace agreements so that staff in public hospitals would have things like their penalty rates smashed away. That is what was happening when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for health.


I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that I understand that he has used Kathy Jackson's words; and he would understand—I am sure he does understand this—that the matter is now being assessed by the New South Wales police. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition would know that because his shadow minister, Senator Brandis, has been out in a deeply concerning fashion ringing the New South Wales police minister to get the New South Wales police minister to ring the police commissioner. Senator Brandis is ringing up his Liberal mate to ring up a police commissioner. Why would this be happening? Why would I be concerned about this? I am concerned about it because I remember the days when the Leader of the Opposition was running political protection for Wilson Tuckey after he tried to intimidate the police into withdrawing a speeding fine from his son.


So, when we look at the modern Liberal Party, what do they believe in? Saying no to everything—they believe in that; rejoicing when workers lose their jobs—they believe in that; creating a $70 billion black hole—they obviously believe in that; and from their past conduct we know they are not above putting pressure on police officers, because it has happened before, and now Senator Brandis has some explaining to do.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:15):  I thank the member for Greenway for her question and I also thank her along with a large number of other members for attending with me, the Minister for Health and Ageing and Minister Mark Butler a Medicare Locals event in this parliament this morning. This was the first 19 Medicare Locals who are out there now bringing together services so that they can better offer community members who live in their local area coordinated care.


Of course, this has been part of the rebuilding of the health system we have needed to do as a result of the way it was when we inherited it in 2007, where of course the Leader of the Opposition had left it short of money, short of doctors and short of nurses—indeed, short of everything that goes to making a health system. He certainly left it short of any reform vision. He was happy for it to just gently decline, with the Commonwealth's share of funding into hospitals going down and down and down, as the waiting time that Australians had for emergency department care and elective surgery care just went up and up and up.


So we have had a lot to do, and today we took some more steps forward. We have reached a historic health reform agreement—a big change to our health system; as big as what was achieved under Medicare—which has put our health system, and particularly our hospitals, on a proper path for funding. We will be there as an equal partner in growth in hospitals—a very important reform.


But we recognise that more needs to be done, and particularly that many Australians end up in hospitals when they did not need to be there. We have very high hospitalisation rates compared with many countries that are comparable to our own. In order to reduce those hospitalisation rates we need to get people better care in the community. That means that we need better coordination. The modern burden of disease is of chronic and complex conditions. People need their GP but they also need a range of other health practitioners. Medicare Locals are about assisting with that coordination and enabling local communities to identify where gaps and holes are there and what would best work for their local community to fill those gaps and holes.


Then, of course, the health system does require capital, and one of the things that we have been very concerned about is the differential health outcomes between people in metropolitan Australia and regional and rural Australia, where there is a traceable difference in life expectancy. In order to make a difference for health care in regional and rural Australia, we have been making sure that capital is provided to bring in new facilities and to bring old facilities up to better standards in regional areas. That is why this morning I was very pleased, with the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Regional Australia, to announce that we are opening a new round of the Health and Hospitals Fund—an amount of $475 million. Applications are open and will close in October. We will make the necessary provisions and announce the results as part of the budget preparation process in 2012.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:36):  After one of the most extraordinarily graceless prime ministerial performances in question time that this House has seen in many a long year, it is worth reminding the House of the words of the current Prime Minister just a few years earlier. Just a few years ago in 2006 the now Prime Minister, then a senior Labor frontbencher, said:


We have to remember that question time is supposed to be one of our key accountability mechanisms. If there is a big scandal or a corruption allegation, you are supposed to be able to get the matter in question time, and it is not serving that role now.


That was the statement by the member for Lawler—then a frontbencher, now a Prime Minister—and she should be judged and condemned by her own words. We have seen an extraordinary display today: a bristling, petulant performance from the Prime Minister, who is trying to insist that, of all people, George Brandis—the shadow Attorney-General—in some way has serious questions to answer and serious statements to make on the subject of improper behaviour and that the member for Dobell does not. Also, the claim was seriously advanced by the Prime Minster today that Senator Mary Jo Fisher, who suffers from depression and is facing her day in court, is somehow equivalent to the member for Dobell, who has run away from his day in court and got the Labor Party to pay his legal fees. It was an absolutely disgraceful performance by this Prime Minister in question time today.


This week marks the first anniversary of the election that nobody won, least of all the Australian people. In the 12 months since last year's election, thanks to the Greens and Independents, who put this government back into office, we Australians have been saddled with a bad government that is getting worse every day. The great economist Adam Smith said that 'there is a lot of ruin in a nation', and indeed a bad government eventually produces very bad outcomes for the Australian people. Increasingly in recent months we have seen the dividends of an incompetent government that has the Midas touch in reverse. We have seen out of control borders—I remind the House that over the last 12 months we have seen 99 boats with more than 5,600 illegal arrivals come to our shores. We also have a Prime Minister with out of control integrity—she said before the election that there would never be a Pacific solution from this government and that detaining illegal arrivals offshore was 'costly, unsustainable and wrong as a matter of principle'. Yet what is she doing now? As we learned today, she is proposing to send boat people who arrive in this country back to Malaysia, where, according to reports, they are subject to increasing brutality from Malaysian police and others.


We have had the surplus that will never happen, and $150 billion worth of deficits that have well and truly happened. We now have waste on an epic scale. We thought that the school hall waste could not possibly be repeated, but now we have the biggest white elephant of them all: the National Broadband Network. Not only did the infrastructure tender to collapse but also the Chief Financial Officer of the NBN Co. has today been forced to resign, which surely presages more waste and incompetence. Then, of course, there is that which most grieves the Australian people: increasing evidence of serious job losses to come in the manufacturing industry. There are the BlueScope job losses, the OneSteel job losses, the Qantas job losses and the Westpac job losses. What is this government doing about the steel industry? The steel industry advocate position has been unfilled for nine months, and the Steel Industry Innovation Council did not meet for six months. This government has a Prime Minister in hiding and a member in protection, and, increasingly, it is paralysed in the face of the problems which bedevil this country because of its own incompetence.


This government is lurching from crisis to crisis. It has a Prime Minister who lacks the courage or the integrity to force the member for Dobell to answer elementary questions—the questions which Kathy Jackson of the Health Services Union knows need to be answered. What did we see from the Prime Minister in question time today? Nothing but contempt—she has not the slightest shred of sympathy or the slightest skerrick of fellow feeling for a brave woman who wants to see the right thing done. What is the Prime Minister doing? Nothing but vituperation and stonewalling. It is graceless, unbecoming and demeaning of the high office which the Prime Minister holds.


The government is rapidly revealing all of the dysfunction and lack of principle which characterised the late New South Wales Labor government. So why should we be surprised when we see the Prime Minister and other senior members of the government lining up now to excuse the inexcusable and defend the indefensible that we have seen reported in connection with the member for Dobell? It is New South Wales sleaze which has now come into the heart of this government and which this Prime Minister and senior members of this government are so desperate to defend. This is a government which has no plan for our country. It has a plan to survive, not a plan to govern, and the Australian people deserve so much better.


Since December 2007, the cost of living pressures on the forgotten families of Australia have only got worse. Since December 2007, electricity prices around this country have gone up 49 per cent. Water prices have gone up 46 per cent. Education costs have gone up 24 per cent. Health costs have gone up 22 per cent. Rent has gone up 22 per cent and food has gone up 15 per cent. Mortgage repayments now cost $500 a month more for the average home loan than they did just a couple of years ago. It is no wonder that the Australian people look back to the time of the former government as a golden age of economic growth that has now been lost, because, since members opposite came into power, GDP-per-head growth has been less than one-half of one per cent a year compared to well over two per cent a year under the former government—and it is just going to get worse with the big new taxes that this government has in store for us. The carbon tax is going to go up and up and up. It is a bad tax based on a lie; yet this is at the heart of this government's plan for our country. Even on the government's own figures, the carbon tax is going to leave well over three million Australian households worse off—and these are not rich people, by any means; these are not people who are importing yachts and motor cruisers. Take, for example, a school teacher married to a shop assistant. They will be worse off under the government's carbon tax package, even on the government's own figures. A policeman married to a part-time nurse will be worse off under the government's carbon tax, even on the government's own figures.


But the worse thing about this carbon tax, which is going to wreak havoc with the way every single Australian lives and works, is that it is not actually going to do its job. The whole point of a carbon tax is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. What is the point of a carbon tax if it does not actually reduce carbon dioxide emissions? Yet here in black and white on page 18 of the government's own document, Strong growth, low pollution—modelling a carbon price, we are told that our emissions are 578 million tonnes now and in 2020, with a carbon price of $29 tonne, they are not going down; they are going up to 621 million tonne.


Members opposite like to boast—oh, don't they like to boast!—about their 'fantastic target'. Everything this government does is 'the best thing that has ever happened'—it is historic; it is magnificent; it is stupendous! Gough Whitlam never did anything, Bob Hawke never did anything and Paul Keating never did anything! Nothing happened until this mob came along—aren't they great! But do you know what we are going to get in 2050 with a carbon price of $131 a tonne? A carbon tax of $131 a tonne is going to reduce our emissions from 578 million tonne now to, wait for it, 545 million tonne. That is not an 80 per cent reduction.


I thought this had to be a misprint. I have been looking every day for erratum slips to start appearing in the government's own documents. But, no, this is what they are going to achieve. They are going to impose a $131 a tonne carbon tax—more than five times what it is proposed to be in the middle of next year—for what? For a reduction in our emissions of about six per cent. They want to turn the way we live and the way we work upside down—for what? A six per cent reduction in our emissions. How is that going to save the world? If people knew what this mob were planning, they would laugh them out of office this very instant.


But it just gets worse. The Prime Minister tells us that this carbon tax is going to create jobs left, right and centre and transform the steel industry into something magnificent. You can just imagine a steel mill run on solar power and a motor plant running on windmills. Aren't we going to have a great steel industry and a great car industry in this country? Look at the government's own figures. On the government's own figures, our gross national income per person will be nearly $5,000 less under a carbon tax than it would otherwise be. This is a carbon tax that is going to cost jobs big-time and wreak havoc with the standard of living of the Australian people. It is not going to reduce carbon emissions and it will, on the government's own figures, impoverish us. This is an act of economic lunacy; yet it is all this government has to offer.


But we know that in her heart of hearts not even this Prime Minister believes it. We know what she really believes, because during the break Geoff Kitney told us. What she really believes is that you can achieve a five per cent reduction in emissions through the coalition's direct action plan. That is what she really believes. That is the secret memo that she gave to other members of the inner cabinet just before she conspired to politically assassinate the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd.


This is a truly bad government. Members opposite like to say that everything they do is historic. Well, this is a historic government all right! It is historically the worst. It is historically the worst we have ever seen. Those people who merely say that it is the worst since Gough Whitlam are wrong. They are being totally unfair to Gough Whitlam—who did not lack idealism and who never sold his soul to the Greens and Senator Bob Brown. This is the worst government ever. It lacks integrity; it lacks ideals; it lacks honesty; and it should be gone—and, increasingly, that is what the Australian people want. Be gone!

Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide—Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (15:51):  Doesn't it just say it all that the Leader of the Opposition moves a matter of public importance on forgotten families and he forgets to mention families? This was supposed to be all about Australian families but, instead, the Leader of the Opposition talked about the member for Dobell; he talked about Senator Fisher; he talked about the Pacific Solution; and he continued his here, there and everywhere strategy on carbon dioxide. He forgot to talk about the very thing that he is pretending to care about here today, and that is Australian families. We have heard enough of the rhetoric, we have heard the negativity, we have heard the attacks—the easy opportunism—of the opposition leader, and now it is time that we inserted some reality into this discussion. It is time we actually—wait for it—talked about some policy, and it is time that we actually mentioned Australian families and what this government is doing to stand shoulder to shoulder with Australian families.


I must say that the fact that the Leader of the Opposition moved a Matter of Public Importance on forgotten families and then forgot to mention them is not the only element of irony that we have seen here today, because there is an intense irony when one considers the very last vote that this chamber undertook today. And then the Leader of the Opposition had the gall to talk about forgotten families. We know that there is a precedent for this. He failed to mention them today, but at least in his budget reply speech the Leader of the Opposition dropped a quick sound bite about forgotten families. But when it came to the vote he forgot them.


Today, the very last division that took place in this chamber was where the coalition voted against a measure which will allow an extra $59 million to be invested in delivering quality child care for some of Australia's most vulnerable children. Let's talk about the forgotten families now. That funding, which passed through this House, I am happy to say, with the support of all except those in the coalition, will be invested in 140 budget based childcare services across the country. These are the services which the government funds because they operate in communities where a commercial childcare centre may not be deemed viable. They are in communities where there is a need for us to step in and make sure that the neediest children in Australia do not miss out, but those opposite decided today that they wanted to vote against that. These services generally operate in rural, regional and remote areas. They often have an Indigenous focus and they service some of the most vulnerable children and those in the most disadvantaged families in this country. We are making sure that these families are not the forgotten families, and the Leader of the Opposition forgot to mention them today. We know that these are the very children who potentially have the most to gain from the critical early learning experiences that they receive whilst they are in child care.


Those who voted against this measure said today, just before question time, that it is more important to give the very small percentage of families across Australia—mostly on higher incomes and using large amounts of quality child care—more than $7,500 per child per year than it is to provide the most basic childcare services and infrastructure for the some of the most disadvantaged children in the community. These disadvantaged children are in families that this government will not forget. This government believes in supporting those families. We believe that they are entitled to early education and care for their children, and we have not forgotten them, unlike the forgetfulness those opposite displayed earlier today. Nor will we forget and ignore the almost 800,000 Australian families who place their kids in care each week, as the coalition did when in government—and as we heard about from the Prime Minister earlier in question time. So, far from forgetting families, this is why we increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses up to an annual cap of $7,500 per child per year. The opposition, when they were in government, were quite happy for this cap—the cap that they said today could not possibly stay at $7,500—to reach a maximum of just $4,354. Far from forgetting these families, we have made a 72 per cent increase in what is available in terms of government funding than what was available under the Howard government, and that is something that on this side of the House we stand proud of.


Those opposite go scaremongering about the costs of child care in the community. As a result of the investment, the proportion of family income that is being spent on child care has almost halved since 2004. We know that families making the family budget come together can often find it difficult when looking for the hard earned dollars to pay their bills, but we also know that in 2004 13 per cent of the average family income for families with one child in care was being spent on child care. That is for families on $55,000 a year. From 13 per cent in 2004, it now stands at seven per cent of their family income. It is a dramatic difference and something that we have done to ensure that these families are not forgotten.


We also promised to pay the childcare rebate quarterly, and we have delivered on our commitment. Then, further, we promised to pay the rebate fortnightly, and we have delivered on that commitment. This is making it easier for thousands of parents to balance the family budget, because they now receive their childcare assistance at the same time that the bills fall due. Overall, this government is investing a record $20 billion over the next four years for early childhood education and care. This includes some $16.4 billion to help Australian families meet the cost of their child care, through either the childcare benefit or, indeed, the childcare rebate. In contrast, this is more than double the funding amount offered under the previous government.


Beyond child care, this government is ensuring that we do not forget the Australian families who are out there doing it tough. We are committed to supporting Australian families to participate in society and we are committed to ensuring that they can balance their work with the important job of raising their children. That is why we will spend around $20 billion on family tax benefit, the baby bonus and paid parental leave. We are proud that the 2011-12 budget includes new cost-of-living support for families—families that the Leader of the Opposition deemed forgotten families and then forgot to even mention when he was meant to be talking about them. We are delivering on our election commitment to increase family tax benefit part A by up to $161 per fortnight for teenagers aged 16 to 19 who are in full-time secondary study from 1 January 2012. We are delivering. The families of around 650,000 children turning 16 over the next five years may be eligible for up to $4,200 in increased assistance if their children stay in school, because we know that is the best thing for Australian families.


From 1 July families have access to more flexible arrangements for advance payments of their family tax benefit to help with unexpected costs, such as the family car breaking down. On 1 January, we delivered Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme. Eligible working parents who adopt a baby on or after 1 January 2011 are now able to receive 18 weeks parental leave pay at the national minimum wage, currently around $590 a week. So while those opposite come in here, play politics, choose to talk about the member for Dobell, Senator Fisher or any of the other things that the Leader of the Opposition was rabbiting on about, we are getting on with the job of delivering to and supporting Australian families. We know that around 85,000 working parents have applied for paid parental leave so far and around 33,000 parents are receiving it right now. For families that are not eligible for paid parental leave we are continuing the baby bonus, currently $5,437 a year, to assist them with the extra costs associated with a new or adopted child. Also, from 1 July, the education tax refund has been extended to cover the costs of school uniforms, another measure that we have put in place to help Australian families balance their budgets.


This government is committed to assisting families who are experiencing disruption to their lives or who may need additional support or work to raise their children. We have the new Family Support Program, which offers greater support to the most vulnerable in our community and helps to build more resilient families and communities, with $335.2 million committed for family service providers in 2010-11. But we also know, when talking about forgotten families, that there are different experiences in different parts of Australia. Different families are coping with different circumstances. Some are doing quite well, but we also acknowledge that there are parts of Australia where families are particularly struggling. This government has stood up and said, 'These families will not be forgotten by this government.' We know that nothing is more important for dealing with household bills than having a secure job, a decent wage in a safe workplace, which is why we have worked hard to create over 750,000 jobs in Australia since coming to office.


Yet, sadly, we also know that there are still members of our community who have been unemployed for too long, and that is why this government has said: 'We will not walk away from you. We will ensure that you will not get left behind.' We want to give them a second chance, which is why we have put record levels of funding into our employment services. It is why, at priority employment areas right across Australia where we know that there are particularly tough circumstances, we have put in place additional measures, local employment coordinators and funds so that they can have jobs expos so that the government can stand shoulder to shoulder with the Australian families who are doing it toughest.


We know that the Australian economy needs more workers if it is going to successfully take advantage of the minerals boom and manage the challenges of our ageing population, which is why we have also announced measures to ensure that those Australians who join the ranks of the very long-term unemployed now have more assistance than ever before. We have put in place new wage subsidies in the most recent budget so that we can help move people back into employment. We are investing more into our disability employment providers by setting up new wage subsidies that they can offer and by working with employers to change the stigma. We will make sure that those who have been forgotten in the past will not be forgotten anymore. We can ensure that those who have been at risk of staying on the margins—the very long-term unemployed, mature age workers and the disabled—can step into employment and enjoy the comparatively favourable circumstances in the Australian economy.


We know that when we are talking about forgotten families that the Leader of the Opposition is a risk to every Australian family's future. He is a risk to jobs and he is a risk to workplace protections. He opposed the stimulus package; he would have thrown 200,000 Australians onto dole queues. We know, and we continually hear the rumbling from the opposition backbench, there is nothing that would bring the opposition more happiness than to bring back Work Choices.


Beyond that, the Leader of the Opposition is a risk to the budget. He went to the last election with an $11 billion black hole, which we now see has blown out to $70 billion. He is a risk to basic services that ordinary families rely upon in our community. He has promised cuts already to computers in schools, to trades training centres, to GP superclinics and the after-hours GP hotline, and to the National Broadband Network, which we know is so important to our economy and particularly to many of our regions. He is a risk to the cost of living. His fiscal recklessness would only add to price pressures in the economy. He would want to bring back bank exit fees. We know, and we heard in his contribution earlier, that under his climate change policy each household would have to pay an average of $720 more in taxes, and that he would give that money—money from Australian families and hardworking taxpayers—straight to the big polluters themselves. He will say anything he needs to in order to get the five-second sound grab on the television news, but when it comes to standing in this place and taking action or voting accordingly to make sure the interests of Australian families are considered or to anything beyond rhetoric, the Leader of the Opposition proves, and proved again today, that he is all spin and no substance.


Australian families, which he forgot to even mention in his matter of public importance contribution on forgotten families, deserve better. They deserve a government that is committed to supporting them with the costs of living. They deserve the delivery of quality services that they rely on. They deserve our assistance to help them into jobs and for us to continue to create jobs in the Australian economy, like the 750,000 that have been created since we came to government. This is exactly what the Gillard Labor government is doing. It is exactly what we intend to do, and we will ensure that we stand shoulder to shoulder with the Australian families that are at risk of being forgotten if the Leader of the Opposition ever made his way onto this side of the chamber.

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (16:06):  There is a deficit at the heart of this government. There is a deficit at the heart of the government that performed so shamefully in question time today. I am not talking about the national budget deficit, the accumulated $150 billion budget deficit delivered by a government that, when in opposition, promised the Australian people that they were committed to budget surpluses. I am talking about a deficit of leadership at the heart of this government. I am talking about a deficit of trust in this government amongst the Australian people. It is not surprising though that there is a deficit of trust because this government is based on a deliberate and duplicitous statement made by the Prime Minister prior to the last election on the issue of a carbon tax.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! The use of the term by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition 'deliberate and duplicitous' is outside the standing orders and I would ask her to withdraw.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  I will move on, Mr Deputy Speaker. She made a deliberate and calculated statement—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The deputy leader has to withdraw the disorderly statement.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  I withdraw. She made a deliberate and calculated statement designed to mislead the Australian people.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The deputy leader is not able to say that the Prime Minister made a statement 'designed to mislead'. That is disorderly and I would ask her to withdraw.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  I withdraw. Let me come to the Prime Minister's performance in question time today. This Prime Minister likes to talk about leadership principles. At the recent launch of former Victoria Police commissioner Christine Nixon's memoirs, the Prime Minister lauded Ms Nixon as:


… person of integrity who opposed corruption at every turn.


The Prime Minister said the book was 'a record of Christine's leadership'. These are traits that the Prime Minister clearly admires in others but has not adopted for herself.


We have heard repeatedly this week that the Prime Minister has full confidence in the member for Dobell. She accepts his explanation for the use of his union credit card to pay for escort services, cash advances and tens of thousands of dollars on his election campaign—reportedly undeclared to the Australian Electoral Commission. The Prime Minister apparently does not want the member for Dobell to provide that explanation to the people of Australia, let alone to the members of the Health Services Union.


This week the coalition has attempted to provide the member for Dobell with every opportunity to speak under parliamentary privilege to the Australian people and the tens of thousands of members of the Health Services Union about the explanation he gave the Prime Minister in relation to these allegations, the explanation upon which the Prime Minister bases her full confidence in the member for Dobell. Yes, last night the national secretary of the Health Services Union said:


Anyone in our organisation who misuses union money—be it for prostitution services or other unauthorised services—has committed a crime and in particular has defrauded the membership.


The Prime Minister should inform the Australian people whether she believes that such conduct would constitute fraudulent and criminal behaviour. We are unlikely to know. As Kathy Jackson said of the member for Dobell:


... he should go on the record and repeat those statements ... He owes it to the members of the Health Services Union.


The Prime Minister does not respect the wishes of the Health Services Union members, the tens of thousands of members of that union who Kathy Jackson described as:


... working-class people, they earn less than $20 an hour doing work that nobody else wants to do ... These people are salt of the earth. These people deserve answers ...


Yet the Prime Minister has gone to extraordinary lengths to protect the member for Dobell and to prevent him from giving a statement to this parliament under parliamentary privilege.


We are not talking about a few dollars here and a few dollars there; we are talking about the systematic and calculated defrauding of what the union claims to be over $100,000. Under this Prime Minister, Labor has made every effort to hide these allegations and protect the member for Dobell from scrutiny.




Mr McClelland:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order: with respect to the deputy leader, she is quite entitled to speak in general terms, but she is not entitled to make assertions if they are directed at an individual member without an appropriate notice of motion.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  That is correct. I will ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to observe the standing orders.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  As I was saying, under this Prime Minister's leadership, Labor has made every effort to hide these allegations.


After the defamation action collapsed, Labor stepped in to pay the member for Dobell's legal bills and presumably struck a deal with Fairfax to suppress further reporting of the matter. Yet the Prime Minister refuses to answer questions on this issue, but the Australian people are entitled to ask: who advised the Health Services Union to inexplicably refer the matter of the misuse of union credit cards to Fair Work Australia? It is inexplicable, as the Attorney-General would know, because it would appear that a matter of fraud should have been referred to the New South Wales Police. What jurisdictions does Fair Work Australia have over a fraud investigation? Perhaps it might make some sense when one realises the connection between officials in Fair Work Australia and the Labor Party.


According to the Health Services Union, this issue was referred to Fair Work Australia more than two years ago yet there has been no progress in terms of a finding. There are many questions that need to be answered about this slow-moving fraud investigation and the Prime Minister has failed to show any inclination to come clean about this matter. It goes to the very heart of the deficit of leadership and the deficit of trust that the Australian people have in this Prime Minister.


We know from Senate estimates that there has been contact between the government and Fair Work Australia about this matter, but the Prime Minister has refused to detail that contact. When asked about it today, she avoided answering the question, so it remains unanswered. These questions will continue to dog the Prime Minister beyond next week, beyond the week after and until parliament returns. Did anyone in the government advise the union to refer the matter to Fair Work Australia? If so, what was the legal basis for that advice? Why was the matter regarding the member for Dobell—this was two years after he was elected as member—referred to Fair Work Australia and not to the police? What has been the nature of discussions between members of the government and officers of Fair Work Australia? This investigation has been going on for two years. It has been reported that the general manager of Fair Work Australia is a factional ally of the Prime Minister and was appointed by this government in 2009 to be responsible for Fair Work Australia.




Mr McClelland:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, again imputations are being made against an officer of the Commonwealth and if those sorts of imputations are going to be made, that they have acted—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Attorney-General will resume his seat. There is no point of order.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  The National Secretary of the Health Services Union, Kathy Jackson, has said that the investigation of allegations against the member for Dobell by Fair Work Australia was far too slow. I asked the Prime Minister today to detail the contact between her as Prime Minister or in her former role as Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, or the contact of her staff or any minister and their staff with officials of Fair Work Australia. She not only avoided the question but the Prime Minister appeared slippery and shifty. She will not say what has gone on between Fair Work Australia and the Prime Minister's office over this investigation. But should we be surprised by this lack of principle on the part of the Prime Minister? We know how the Prime Minister came to office. She had promised faithfully as Deputy Prime Minister that she would never challenge the Prime Minister for the leadership of this country prior to the last election. She was specifically asked on radio on 10 May 2010:


So will you promise you will not be leader at the next federal election?


Julia Gillard:


I can, completely. … this is, you know, it makes good copy for newspapers but it is not within cooee of my day-to-day reality. You may as well ask me am I anticipating a trip to Mars. No I'm not...


So how can the Australian people believe anything this Prime Minister says? She misled her leader into believing she would never challenge him for the leadership, and challenge she did. She stood before the Australian people at the last election and said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' (Time expired)



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I would, before calling the honourable member for Fraser, just remind all honourable members that, while this is a wide-ranging matter of public importance debate, we are as a parliament debating the impact of the government's failures in policy and leadership in respect of Australia's forgotten families. Families, of course, are the subject of this particular matter of public importance.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:17):  The motion before the House today refers to Australia's forgotten families. It is clear where that reference from the Leader of the Opposition comes from. It is a hearkening back to the great Sir Robert Menzies, the founder of the Liberal Party. What the Liberal Party want to do today is to say that they have some of the policy credibility of Robert Menzies. The Leader of the Opposition is in fact the Sarah Palin of Australian politics. He is willing to say anything, to do anything, to wreck the economy.


I know a little bit about the Menzies government, and the Leader of the Opposition is no Robert Menzies. Robert Menzies opened up Australian trade with Japan. The Leader of the Opposition would start a trade war with New Zealand. Any chance he gets he will fearmonger about foreigners investing in Australian agriculture. Robert Menzies established the Colombo Plan to bring young Australians to help build a better region. The Leader of the Opposition would scrap aid to Indonesian schools. Robert Menzies began the initial steps of dismantling the White Australia policy. The Leader of the Opposition refers to 'boat people' and he wants to turn back boats to who knows where.


Robert Menzies was committed to Canberra, this fine city that I am proud to represent. The Leader of the Opposition would strip 12,000 jobs out of the Public Service, which the ACT government estimates would drop the employment rate in the ACT by six per cent once you factor in the flow-on effects. The Leader of the Opposition would happily send Canberra into recession. Robert Menzies believed in respect, believed in treating all people with decency. Any time he thinks he can get away with it the Leader of the Opposition will just slip in a reference using the Prime Minister's first name. He is always happy to use the Prime Minister's first name if he thinks he can slip it past whoever is in the chair.


Robert Menzies massively expanded the CSIRO and massively expanded the scientific research base in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition attacks scientists, describes climate change as 'absolute crap' and thinks CO2 is weightless. But there is, I suppose, some similarity. After all, Robert Menzies made a lot of his career on attacking communists but won the 1961 election on communist preferences. The opposition leader for a while bankrolled court cases against One Nation but now is quite happy to address extremist rallies with their signs about 'new world government' and misogyny.


But the motion before the House today goes to Australia's families and it is worth running through some of the achievements of the Gillard government to date in delivering for Australian families. In the global financial crisis we put in place timely, targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus that saved 200,000 jobs. Those opposite would have been happy to see young lives blighted by unemployment. Their view is that you would never take on any debt, so no stimulus because it would send the budget into debt. No matter that most of the debt is actually in revenue downgrades—that is what happens in a recession: you get less revenue. So those opposite would have taken the Herbert Hoover approach—they would have slashed government spending as the recession hit. That is right; as the private sector scaled back, their view was that the government should have scaled back as well. What a disaster that would have been. The Gillard government and the Rudd government have seen 750,000 jobs created since we came to office—three quarters of a million jobs with the pay packets and the dignity that goes with work. We put in place the largest increase to the pension since it was introduced: $128 a fortnight for single pensioners and $116 a fortnight for pensioner couples. It is a little bit more money for those who are doing it tough in Australia. We have got rid of Work Choices, to make sure Australians get a fair go at work and to make sure that Australians have the rights that they deserve. For Australians with children in care, and that includes me, we have increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, recognising that this is a rebate that helps families and boosts labour force participation by females.


We have put in place paid parental leave and we have launched My School 2.0 in an unprecedented wave of education reforms. We have trade training centres rolling out across the country, recognising that we have to start investing in trade skills for the next generation and that we can do so while children are at school. I am particularly proud of the trade training centre here in the ACT, which is a consortium of schools, including some on the north side. There is the national curriculum, which ensures that those thousands of Australians with children in school who move across state borders have the opportunity for those children to continue their education. And there is a new health deal that is, frankly, the biggest health reform since Medicare.


There are all of these achievements, and yet there is a major agenda for the future. We are putting a price on carbon because we know the scientists tell us that climate change is happening and the economists tell us that a price on dangerous carbon pollution is the most effective way of dealing with the problem.


We are putting in place a big health reform agenda: e-health and investment in hospitals. In immigration, we have a regional solution through the Bali process. It has two aims: firstly, to increase the number of humanitarian migrants that come to Australia, and boosting that intake by 1,000 a year; and, secondly, to ensure that we send the right disincentives to people smugglers and make sure that fewer kids die on the seas between Indonesia and Australia. No-one wants to see a repeat of the Christmas Island tragedy, and the Malaysian agreement is aimed at ensuring just that.


We have major reforms with the National Disability Insurance Scheme, aged care and mental health: issues that were long regarded as the third rail of Australian politics—too dangerous to touch. We have major reports on those issues and we are setting about the consultations with states and territories to make them happen. On superannuation: we are boosting retirement savings because we know that Australians need a little bit more in the bank when they get to retirement. Fifteen per cent superannuation is good enough for those opposite. They are happy to give themselves 15 per cent—I do not see them moving any motions, saying: 'No, no, no! Don't let us have 15 per cent. Let's drop parliamentarians' super back down to nine per cent.' But nine per cent is good enough for ordinary Australians in the view of those opposite. We do not believe that. Labor is the party that put in place superannuation in the early nineties over the objections of those opposite. And Labor is the party that is now boosting superannuation to 12 per cent.


As was highlighted in question time, those opposite are happy to turn out to openings of new school buildings. Senator Gary Humphries joins me from time to time when I am opening new school buildings in my electorate. I am sure he is proud to be there, opening those new school buildings. But those opposite attack the school hall program generally. They are happy to take a swipe at the whole program but are also delighted to turn up for the photo op when it is happening. We see exactly the same in trade training centres.


We see a clear contrast on the big issues in Australian politics. We want Australians to get a fair share of the minerals that are their birthright. The opposition thinks that miners pay too much tax. We are committed to global trade and committed to the notion that Australia has always prospered as a small, open economy engaged with the world. They want to start a trade war with New Zealand. We are committed to rapid fiscal consolidation and clear budget rules. They have a $70 billion black hole, which is going to look even blacker when we have a Parliamentary Budget Office and there really will be nowhere to hide on those costings—no way of going to an election with an $11 billion hidden black hole as they did at the last election. Of course that $11 billion black hole at the last election looks pretty modest set against the $70 billion black hole that the opposition now faces.


We want to put a price on carbon pollution because we know, as all sensible policy makers do, that going to the heart of the problem is the right way to solve it. They want to put in place a direct action scheme. Maybe it is because they do not actually understand this stuff. Of course, there was the classic interview in which the Leader of the Opposition asked:


If you want to put a price on carbon, why not just do it with a simple tax?


But the thing that surprised me most, as an economist, is the next bit:


Why not ask electricity consumers to pay more, then at the end of the year you can take your invoices to the tax office and get a rebate?


I am not sure what the Leader of the Opposition was thinking at that point, but if you did it that way it is actually true that the assistance would undo the price effects. But that is not what anyone is proposing. We are proposing generous household compensation, untied to your carbon tax bill.


We want to put in place world-beating health policy on cigarettes. Those opposite think that smoking is fun, and say things like, 'Well, life kills'. (Time expired)

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (16:27):  In the few very short minutes that I have, I want to reflect on the MPI and the proposition that in fact the government has failed in policy and leadership in respect of Australia's forgotten families.


Mr Speaker, as you know, in this place debate can be robust. In this place there is a contest of ideas but there is also a contest of values, and that is just as important as the contest of policy and ideas. The contest of values is based on the fact that the people who stand at this dispatch box and promulgate a view are in fact also the leaders of the nation. They are the people who are expected to set the benchmark for behaviour, for honesty, for integrity and for the enunciation of good principles.


What has been most disappointing to me this week is that the values of the Prime Minister and the government should have been so absent. They have been missing, and the great fallout from that behaviour is in fact Australia's forgotten families. Whether it be through the loss of jobs or, consistently, the loss of confidence, the loss of opportunity or the removal of reward for risk through higher taxes and more regulation, this is a government that is now consistently denying the best interests of the Australian people and focusing only on its own interest—that is, the protection of its power in this place.


Its own base is now walking away from it. For a major Australian union to walk away from the Labor Party as it did this week—for proper and fully understood reasons—is a significant event, because union leaders are putting the interests of their members—the working poor—ahead of the interests of Julia Gillard. If the Prime Minister does not realise that, by being bereft of values and principles, she is now reflecting poorly on the unions and the working poor then she, sadly, misunderstands her own country.

  Order! The time for this discussion has now expired.

Mr SLIPPER
 (Fisher—Deputy Speaker) (16:30):  I wish to speak on the latest developments in the case of missing Sunshine Coast teenager Daniel Morcombe and the incredible courage and strength of his parents, Denise and Bruce. Daniel's disappearance and believed murder has become a story of national and international focus. Most of the nation knows of his parents, who have demonstrated amazing tenacity since his disappearance in December 2003. They have never let the case go cold and they continually campaign to ensure that it has never been far from the thoughts of people across Australia. Their tenacity has paid off. The most recent developments in the case have been well publicised. A 41-year-old man was charged over the matter and faced court on 15 August. He is charged with murder, deprivation of liberty, child stealing, indecent treatment of a child under 16 and interfering with a corpse. I phoned Denise Morcombe soon after the news to offer my prayers, condolences and good wishes and to wish the Morcombes strength during the next phase of a case that will again test their strength. The former Prime Minister and current Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable member for Griffith, contacted me soon after the news of the arrest and asked me to pass on to the Morcombes the sympathy and support of him and his wife, Therese, and I did that. A search has subsequently been conducted by SES volunteers and police of a specific area of bushland not far from Beerwah in my electorate, and the search has located some shoes of a type worn by Daniel when he disappeared and also human bones, which are now being tested to determine if they do in fact belong to Daniel.


After Daniel's disappearance, Denise and Bruce launched the Daniel Morcombe Foundation as a vehicle to promote the child safety message and also highlight the ongoing investigation into their son's disappearance. These latest developments do not diminish the importance of the child safety message, and I applaud Bruce and Denise for the way they have worked since Daniel's disappearance to help ensure that other families do not experience the tragedy and loss that they have.


This year I am again encouraging all members and senators in the Australian parliament, and also members of other parliaments around Australia and across the Tasman, to help commemorate the Day for Daniel, which this year will be held on 3 November in the Australian parliament. The Day for Daniel is usually held on 28 October, but that is not a parliamentary sitting day, so after consultation with Bruce and Denise Morcombe the Day for Daniel in the Australian parliament will be held on 3 November. On the Sunshine Coast the Day for Daniel includes considerable events to highlight the cause, and I encourage all honourable members this year to participate in the Day for Daniel. Last year it was very successful, with the involvement of the Prime Minister; the Leader of the Opposition; you, Mr Speaker; the Treasurer; the Leader of the House; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; the Manager of Opposition Business; and many others. They wore either a black scarf or an item of red clothing. I will be contacting all members and senators shortly to ask them to put this event in their diaries and to remember to wear an item of red on that day to support this important cause. Members who would like to acquire scarves or ties can do so through my office and, by doing so, make a donation to the important work of the Daniel Morcombe Foundation.


Bruce and Denise have experienced the most terrible loss that any parent could experience. As a parent myself I have some understanding, although no-one can have a complete understanding of what they have gone through during the many years which have elapsed since 2003. I do, however, see them as role models and icons in our society because of the way that they have gone out of their way to ensure that other families do not experience similar loss. They are wonderful Australians and I applaud them.

Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (9:30):  I would like to speak about South Road. From the entrance of the Southern Expressway to Sturt Road is only a short distance. It would only be one kilometre of the 22-kilometre stretch of South Road from Darlington to Winfield which I would like to one day see as a non-stop expressway, and yet it is one of the major bottlenecks on South Road. Every commuter from the southern suburbs would use this stretch of road, even those who do not use the Southern Expressway but come from Happy Valley, Aberfoyle Park and Flagstaff Hill travel this road. For such a small part of the road it has attracted an enormous number of commitments, promises and announcements from the state and federal governments. I have tallied at least 10 commitments and announcements from state and federal governments going back to 2006 about planned work on this stretch of road, and after 5½ years nothing has happened. The Department of Transport, Energy and Infrastructure has an animation of light rail running up to the front door of Flinders Medical Centre and car park 1 of Flinders University. It looks great, but is totally unfunded and will not be delivered by the South Australian government.


The latest broken promise from the South Australian government involves switching a promised $75 million interchange with a pre-existing traffic light. What was to be a fully funded infrastructure development has now been cancelled. The excuses which have been offered by the state government and by their minister, Pat Conlan, are laughable. They hope for federal funding. Apparently it is due to the GFC, the floods in Queensland or the dog ate it, but here briefly are some facts. Firstly, the federal government has provided $500 million to the SA government for South Road, including this stretch of South Road. That money has been spent elsewhere. That was the state government's decision—it was Pat Conlan's decision—and they knew this when they promised this interchange 18 months ago.


Secondly, what the state government also would have known is that federal money comes in five-year cycles. The next major funding cycle will not arrive until after the 2014 state election, and Pat Conlan and the state government knew this 18 months ago as well.


Thirdly, what they said at the time was that the interchange between South Road and the Southern Expressway is fully funded by them and does not rely on Commonwealth funding. Pat Conlan and the state government are damned by their own words, and he has been caught out. After nine years of cynical spin the public now cannot believe any of their promises.

Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (10:01):  I rise to speak on the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment (Deer) Bill 2011. The bill amends the existing act to increase the cap on the national residue survey component of the deer slaughter levy from 4c to 10.5c. It is not proposed that 10.5c be levied at this stage. Governments, as we did and as this government is doing, always increase the amount by more than the requirement to save coming back to parliament every Pancake Day when more is needed. In this case, this whole thing is happening because the deer industry in Australia needs certain money to do MRL testing levels so that our clients overseas are comfortable with whatever is in the deer meat they are importing from Australia. This has to be paid for by the industry.


The industry is probably less than half what it was 20 years ago in terms of numbers, so there are fewer people paying it; they need the money to actually do the MRL testing. The Deer Industry Association of Australia has support from its members and we have the bipartisan support of the parliament to do what the industry is asking. I should mention here that 85 per cent of the product of the industry is exported to Europe and other places.


Deer farming has a 100-year long history in Australia. It is primarily located in regional areas across most states. It is based primarily on temperate deer species: 50 per cent fallow, which is the production base; red deer and elk, 40 per cent; and the remaining 10 per cent is made up of more tropical species, particularly rusa and chital deer.


There are over 500 producers involved in the deer industry. To be quite honest, I am a little surprised that the number is actually that high at this time. It is in one of its cycles, and at this present time it is not the biggest cycle it has been in. The bulk of the industry is concentrated in Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania, and some of the more tropical species are in Queensland and WA. The industry had a peak production of 30 tonnes with a value of almost $2.5 million. Fifty-five per cent of the production value comes from venison and venison products. The remaining 45 per cent is velvet and antler products.


The deer population in our country nine years ago was estimated at 200,000. However, with the long drought the numbers of the national herd and the fluctuations of the industry, that was probably less than 100,000 four years ago. The proposed changes occur at a time when the deer industry has suffered a significant decline in production, so they need the same money out of 100,000 that they got from 200,000. The deer monitoring program is critical for maintaining access to international markets, as I said earlier, particularly to the EU, where it is a very traditional meat. Industry requested these changes to ensure residue testing can be continued at a level to provide continued access to these markets.


In conclusion, the coalition supports the increase in the levy to 10.5c. Only 6c is what the industry proposes to have the government levy at this time.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-08-25,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:06):  I am pleased to rise to voice my support for the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment (Deer) Bill 2011 and I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I had to work very hard to get to the top of the speaking list for this topic, but thankfully I was able to push my way through the other members of the Labor Party and I am proud to be able to speak on it. I thank the member for Calare for his contribution.


Mr Deputy Speaker, it is my understanding that you used to have a deer farm, so you would be very, very interested in this topic. I see the member for Wentworth in the chamber and I understand that he has a very ‘dear’ farm, so he might be interested as well.


This bill will help ensure the viability and sustainability of the Australian deer industry. Deer were introduced into Australia more than 100 years ago. Today the deer industry is well established for breeding deer species for the production of velvet antler and, more importantly and more significantly I guess in terms of value, venison. The species that are farmed in Australia include about 50 per cent fallow, 40 per cent red deer and 10 per cent elk. Some of the tropical species are rusa and chital deer in Queensland and Western Australia. They are the deer more suited to tropical climates. And of course there is also the brief, migratory, annual visit of Santa Claus’s reindeer—at least that is what I am informed by my young children.


Back in 2002 there were 200,000 deer on Australian farms, particularly in Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania. But as I said, there are also some more tropical deer harvested in Queensland and Western Australia. The onset of drought halved the deer population and the farm gate value of venison dropped from $2.47 million to $1.24 million. Obviously this is a big hit to the producers and this bill is a response to some of their concerns.


More than 85 per cent of the venison produced in Australia is exported to Europe and South-East Asia. The deer industry pays a number of compulsory levies to support the industry. These levies include a deer export charge of $5 per animal, a deer velvet levy of two per cent of sale value and a deer velvet export levy of two per cent of sale value. Deer producers are also required to pay a compulsory slaughter levy of 8c per kilogram. Unfortunately the decline in deer production over the last 10 years has significantly reduced the amount of money raised through deer levies. The levy is defined in the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Act 1998. ‘Residue’ refers to the monitoring of the residue level of chemicals in the venison.


This bill will not increase the levy but it does change the way the levy is allocated. Presently 4c per kilogram goes to fund activities undertaken by the National Residue Survey and 4c per kilogram goes to research and development and is paid to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. This bill will increase the levy cap from 4c to 10.5c per kilogram. This will enable the portion of the levy that goes to the national residue survey to be increased to 6c per kilogram and the R&D component will be reduced to 2c per kilogram. As the member for Calare touched on, this is a normal rejigging to accommodate the concerns of the industry.


Residue monitoring is obviously important to ensure that consumer confidence in the meat product safety and quality remains and is also required for Australia’s meat to be sold to the European Union. Because Europe is such a significant market for Australian deer meat it is important that we have a viable residue monitoring program, and this bill will help to achieve that. Obviously our venison sales story is part of our clean and green foodstuffs message that I am sure the member for Eden-Monaro is very familiar with. The Australian products have a good brand overseas but we can only maintain that brand through vigilance.


Importantly, the reduction in the research and development rate of the deer slaughter levy is not expected to have an impact on deer related projects undertaken by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. I think it is also important that this bill does not impose an additional tax burden on the deer producers, who have suffered significant losses over the last decade. However, because this bill will increase the levy cap to 10.5c it will enable the industry to seek future levy increases without the need to further amend the act.


I speak here as a Queenslander, Mr Deputy Speaker, like you. Obviously, with your history as a deer farmer you would understand this industry more, and I thought with your long history in the House you might be able to shed some light on why the Queensland coat of arms—the oldest coat of arms in Australia—has a deer on it. The brolga is on one side; obviously that is a very Australian bird, probably for me one of the most graceful birds in the world. That sits there easily but on the other side of the coat of arms—the coat of arms that was granted in 1893 by Queen Victoria—is the red deer. I did a bit of research. Also on the coat of arms are a sheaf of wheat, the head of a bull, the head of a ram, a bit of sugar cane—reflecting the rural activities of Queensland—and even some gold.




Dr Mike Kelly:
  No Wally Lewis?




Mr PERRETT:
  No. He was not around in 1893, which is almost how long you have to go back for New South Wales to have won the State of Origin.



An honourable member:  Not quite.




Mr PERRETT:
  Obviously they were the rural industries of the time—but no coal, interestingly enough. Underneath the coat of arms it has the state motto, Audax et Fidelis, which means bold but faithful. That could be my motto, I suppose, or yours, Mr Deputy Speaker, perhaps. The coat of arms was changed in 1977, when the red deer and the brolga were put on the side—the supporters of the coat of arms—and apparently the thinking of that well-known Queenslander, or New Zealander, Joh Bjelke-Petersen was that the red deer was the link back to the royal herds near London, and the brolga is obviously Queensland’s distinctive bird. While we do not have as many deer producers as the other states, we do have a deer on our coat of arms, so I welcome the measures in this bill that will ensure a viable, quality deer industry continues and I commend the bill to the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his interesting if quirky contribution.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10:13):  I thank the honourable members for their contribution to this debate, and particularly the interesting contribution from the member for Moreton. Obviously Queensland is a state we hold dear and our thoughts will be turning to them this Saturday night as the Wallabies face the All Blacks at Suncorp stadium. 


The National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment (Deer) Bill 2011 has been sought, as has been pointed out by the shadow minister, by the deer industry itself. It amends the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Act 1998 to increase the maximum allowable levy rate cap on the national residue survey component of the deer slaughter levy from 4c to 10.5c per kilogram of carcass weight. The proposed change provides for changes to the relevant regulation so that the deer slaughter levy can be reapportioned. The research and development component of the levy will be decreased from 4c to 2c per kilogram and the NRS component of the levy will be increased from 4c to 6c per kilogram. 


Increasing the NRS rate to 6c per kilogram will support a viable residue monitoring program that underpins access to key export markets for the deer industry. As was pointed out by the shadow minister, it is very important that this is the underpinning for the industry because 85 per cent of their product is for export. Therefore this ensures and enables them to maintain that access to the key export markets for the deer industry. So, the increasing of the NRS rate to 6c per kilogram will support that viable residue monitoring program. The Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation does not expect the decrease in the R&D rate to have an impact on future deer-related projects. I know this is also of great interest to deer producers in my own region. There have been ups and downs in that industry in Eden-Monaro over recent years but we still have relevant activities, so it is principally New South Wales and Victoria that are affected, notwithstanding the comments by the member for Moreton.


Also, I would like to reflect on the comments of the member for Moreton of the importance of trust in our product labels and in our products. Increasingly so, as I have been involved in this portfolio of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, I have noticed the growing consumer dynamic in the entire world in relation to eco-labelling, health, trust and reliability in products, so this is a very important measure to underpin that level of trust in our product. I thank the honourable members for their contribution and commend the bill to the House.

The deer monitoring program is critical for maintaining access to international markets, as I said earlier, particularly to the EU, where it is a very traditional meat. Industry requested these changes to ensure residue testing can be continued at a level to provide continued access to these markets.


In conclusion, the coalition supports the increase in the levy to 10.5c. Only 6c is what the industry proposes to have the government levy at this time.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:06):  I am pleased to rise to voice my support for the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment (Deer) Bill 2011 and I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I had to work very hard to get to the top of the speaking list for this topic, but thankfully I was able to push my way through the other members of the Labor Party and I am proud to be able to speak on it. I thank the member for Calare for his contribution.


Mr Deputy Speaker, it is my understanding that you used to have a deer farm, so you would be very, very interested in this topic. I see the member for Wentworth in the chamber and I understand that he has a very ‘dear’ farm, so he might be interested as well.


This bill will help ensure the viability and sustainability of the Australian deer industry. Deer were introduced into Australia more than 100 years ago. Today the deer industry is well established for breeding deer species for the production of velvet antler and, more importantly and more significantly I guess in terms of value, venison. The species that are farmed in Australia include about 50 per cent fallow, 40 per cent red deer and 10 per cent elk. Some of the tropical species are rusa and chital deer in Queensland and Western Australia. They are the deer more suited to tropical climates. And of course there is also the brief, migratory, annual visit of Santa Claus’s reindeer—at least that is what I am informed by my young children.


Back in 2002 there were 200,000 deer on Australian farms, particularly in Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania. But as I said, there are also some more tropical deer harvested in Queensland and Western Australia. The onset of drought halved the deer population and the farm gate value of venison dropped from $2.47 million to $1.24 million. Obviously this is a big hit to the producers and this bill is a response to some of their concerns.


More than 85 per cent of the venison produced in Australia is exported to Europe and South-East Asia. The deer industry pays a number of compulsory levies to support the industry. These levies include a deer export charge of $5 per animal, a deer velvet levy of two per cent of sale value and a deer velvet export levy of two per cent of sale value. Deer producers are also required to pay a compulsory slaughter levy of 8c per kilogram. Unfortunately the decline in deer production over the last 10 years has significantly reduced the amount of money raised through deer levies. The levy is defined in the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Act 1998. ‘Residue’ refers to the monitoring of the residue level of chemicals in the venison.


This bill will not increase the levy but it does change the way the levy is allocated. Presently 4c per kilogram goes to fund activities undertaken by the National Residue Survey and 4c per kilogram goes to research and development and is paid to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. This bill will increase the levy cap from 4c to 10.5c per kilogram. This will enable the portion of the levy that goes to the national residue survey to be increased to 6c per kilogram and the R&D component will be reduced to 2c per kilogram. As the member for Calare touched on, this is a normal rejigging to accommodate the concerns of the industry.


Residue monitoring is obviously important to ensure that consumer confidence in the meat product safety and quality remains and is also required for Australia’s meat to be sold to the European Union. Because Europe is such a significant market for Australian deer meat it is important that we have a viable residue monitoring program, and this bill will help to achieve that. Obviously our venison sales story is part of our clean and green foodstuffs message that I am sure the member for Eden-Monaro is very familiar with. The Australian products have a good brand overseas but we can only maintain that brand through vigilance.


Importantly, the reduction in the research and development rate of the deer slaughter levy is not expected to have an impact on deer related projects undertaken by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. I think it is also important that this bill does not impose an additional tax burden on the deer producers, who have suffered significant losses over the last decade. However, because this bill will increase the levy cap to 10.5c it will enable the industry to seek future levy increases without the need to further amend the act.


I speak here as a Queenslander, Mr Deputy Speaker, like you. Obviously, with your history as a deer farmer you would understand this industry more, and I thought with your long history in the House you might be able to shed some light on why the Queensland coat of arms—the oldest coat of arms in Australia—has a deer on it. The brolga is on one side; obviously that is a very Australian bird, probably for me one of the most graceful birds in the world. That sits there easily but on the other side of the coat of arms—the coat of arms that was granted in 1893 by Queen Victoria—is the red deer. I did a bit of research. Also on the coat of arms are a sheaf of wheat, the head of a bull, the head of a ram, a bit of sugar cane—reflecting the rural activities of Queensland—and even some gold.




Dr Mike Kelly:
  No Wally Lewis?




Mr PERRETT:
  No. He was not around in 1893, which is almost how long you have to go back for New South Wales to have won the State of Origin.



An honourable member:  Not quite.




Mr PERRETT:
  Obviously they were the rural industries of the time—but no coal, interestingly enough. Underneath the coat of arms it has the state motto, Audax et Fidelis, which means bold but faithful. That could be my motto, I suppose, or yours, Mr Deputy Speaker, perhaps. The coat of arms was changed in 1977, when the red deer and the brolga were put on the side—the supporters of the coat of arms—and apparently the thinking of that well-known Queenslander, or New Zealander, Joh Bjelke-Petersen was that the red deer was the link back to the royal herds near London, and the brolga is obviously Queensland’s distinctive bird. While we do not have as many deer producers as the other states, we do have a deer on our coat of arms, so I welcome the measures in this bill that will ensure a viable, quality deer industry continues and I commend the bill to the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his interesting if quirky contribution.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10:13):  I thank the honourable members for their contribution to this debate, and particularly the interesting contribution from the member for Moreton. Obviously Queensland is a state we hold dear and our thoughts will be turning to them this Saturday night as the Wallabies face the All Blacks at Suncorp stadium. 


The National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment (Deer) Bill 2011 has been sought, as has been pointed out by the shadow minister, by the deer industry itself. It amends the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Act 1998 to increase the maximum allowable levy rate cap on the national residue survey component of the deer slaughter levy from 4c to 10.5c per kilogram of carcass weight. The proposed change provides for changes to the relevant regulation so that the deer slaughter levy can be reapportioned. The research and development component of the levy will be decreased from 4c to 2c per kilogram and the NRS component of the levy will be increased from 4c to 6c per kilogram. 


Increasing the NRS rate to 6c per kilogram will support a viable residue monitoring program that underpins access to key export markets for the deer industry. As was pointed out by the shadow minister, it is very important that this is the underpinning for the industry because 85 per cent of their product is for export. Therefore this ensures and enables them to maintain that access to the key export markets for the deer industry. So, the increasing of the NRS rate to 6c per kilogram will support that viable residue monitoring program. The Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation does not expect the decrease in the R&D rate to have an impact on future deer-related projects. I know this is also of great interest to deer producers in my own region. There have been ups and downs in that industry in Eden-Monaro over recent years but we still have relevant activities, so it is principally New South Wales and Victoria that are affected, notwithstanding the comments by the member for Moreton.


Also, I would like to reflect on the comments of the member for Moreton of the importance of trust in our product labels and in our products. Increasingly so, as I have been involved in this portfolio of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, I have noticed the growing consumer dynamic in the entire world in relation to eco-labelling, health, trust and reliability in products, so this is a very important measure to underpin that level of trust in our product. I thank the honourable members for their contribution and commend the bill to the House.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2011-08-25,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (10:17):  All members of this House and all Australians were horrified and deeply saddened to hear of the tragic helicopter accident which took the lives of three of the ABC’s most well-loved and most experienced employees—Gary Ticehurst, Paul Lockyer and John Bean. They died doing what they had done well for so long; bringing the vision of Australia—particularly the Australia that is beyond the cities where most of us live—those images and that life of the Australian bush to the rest of this nation. In doing that work over so many years they were part of the great mission of the ABC, which as a national public broadcaster is able to knit together this country and, in particular in the way it serves regional Australia and represents the views of regional Australia and the images of regional Australia, serves to remind all of us that there is a world elsewhere, that there is an Australia outside of the congestion and the busyness and the hustle and bustle of the city streets. While we may not be like the clerk in Banjo Paterson’s famous poem and wish that we were out of the city and out there with Clancy droving, nonetheless we can at least have some insight into that world courtesy of the ABC.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from 10:19 to 10:32





Mr TURNBULL:
  Before we adjourned to vote in the division I was observing that the three men who died in this tragic helicopter crash, Gary Ticehurst, Paul Lockyer and John Bean, had spent much of their lives—particularly Paul and Gary—in recording and documenting the life in rural Australia. I speculated as to whether, like the author of Clancy of the Overflow, Banjo Paterson, we, looking at the wonderful pictures they brought back of life outside the cities, whether we, like Banjo Paterson, fancied ourselves leaving the busyness of the city and going out for a more rural life, going out into the wide open spaces of Australia. As we were coming back from the division the member for Forrest reminded me of his extraordinary gift for reading and remembering poetry and so we turned up that poem, Clancy of the Overflow, which I have not memorised, but those last two stanzas really sum up the image of an urban country like Australia that for all of its life—and we have been one of the most urbanised countries in the world, despite our vast land mass—how, as a very urbanised country, we still seek to stay connected with and to understand regional Australia. Those last two stanzas Paterson writes: 


And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt me


As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste,


With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy,


For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.


And I somehow fancy that I’d like to change with Clancy,


Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,


While we faced the round eternal of the cashbook and the journal –


But I doubt he’d suit the office, Clancy, of ‘The Overflow’.


Gary Ticehurst, Paul Lockyer and John Bean did not suit the office and they died as they had lived. Gary Ticehurst had been the ABC’s lead helicopter pilot since the 1980s. He had logged more than 16,000 hours of flying time, most of those in his work for the ABC. He is remembered for many great stories that he enabled the ABC to cover, but probably the most spectacular was his consistent coverage of the Sydney to Hobart yacht races. Of course in 1998, in that tragic race, he played a very important role—much more important than just delivering us spectacular imagines of the yachts at sea—where he effected the rescue of 14 crew members of the yacht Business Post Naiad, which tragically lost its skipper and one of its crew. He was out there in that wild weather spotting the yachts and relaying their position to the search and rescue officials. He saved lives. He did not simply record the life of the sailors, he saved lives. He was loved by all of the people that he worked with at the ABC and, as I said, he represented the wings that enabled the writers and the cameramen to get out and record the life beyond the cities of this great country.


Paul Lockyer was one of the most distinguished journalists in the ABC and, indeed, in Australia. His career had spanned more than 40 years, which is remarkable because he looked so young. He was extremely well preserved. Clearly the life of being an ABC journalist is very good for one’s personal appearance. He always looked youthful and brought a vitality and an energy to all of his reporting. His jobs at the ABC have spanned just about every corner of its activities, but most recently his focus had been, as I said earlier, on regional issues. Very recently he was in Grantham when the floods hit in Queensland this year, as my colleague, Mr Buchholz has spoken very eloquently about. He was regarded as one of the people, one of their own, by the people of the Lockyer Valley—and appropriately, given they share a name—and the Mayor has said that every time he returned to Grantham, which he did many times after the floods, the locals embraced him as truly one of their own. He was a man of great compassion, great professionalism and embodied the very high standards of journalism. 


Of course, the most beautiful words are not nearly as persuasive or as compelling without the pictures, and John Bean, the cameraman who also died in this crash, had been working for the ABC as a cameraman for 20 years. He had worked on a whole range of Australian television programs: Australian Story: Catalyst, New Inventors, Gardening Australia, 7.30 and Landline. He, like Paul Lockyer and Gary Ticehurst, had a fascination with and a love of the landscape of Australia and his work on the documentaries Return to Lake Eyre and After the Deluge are great testimony to both his passion and his art.


These three men will be sorely missed by their families, by their colleagues and by all Australians. It was a tragic loss and, as I said, they died as they had lived, serving the people of Australia through that great public broadcaster, the ABC.


I would also like to take this opportunity to honour another great leader of the ABC, another great journalist, Ian Carroll, who many of us have known. He is the husband, of course, of Geraldine Doogue, another very distinguished journalist. Ian had a remarkable career with the ABC. He died of a very cruel disease, a very cruel cancer. He worked right up until the end of his life. He had contributed to so many programs over the years at the ABC. He was an interesting man; he was in his mid-sixties when he died. He rather belies the view of Gen-Y that only the people in their twenties can be great innovators. He is an encouragement to all of us because he was the founder, in large measure, of the ABC program Lateline, which of course has become one of the most significant current affairs programs in Australia and really is one of the handful of platforms on television where there is actually the scope for a reasonably informed, intelligent debate about public policy, which is an enormous part of the ABC’s role.


Also, over the last decade, Ian really pioneered the entry of the ABC into the digital world. In my view, the ABC does a better job on the digital platform—on the internet, with iview and its podcasts—than any other broadcaster in the world. If people want to correct me on that then I would be very interested to be proven wrong, but I think what they have done is extraordinary. You take the way in which the reach of so many outstanding programs and Radio National have been expanded exponentially with podcasts, the way that the reach of ABC television programs has been expanded dramatically with iview and, of course, the ABC’s many websites—whether it is opinions as in The Drum or so many other platforms—have really expanded the reach of the ABC. Far from being, as one might have expected, a rather stuffy old public broadcaster, it has become a real leader in digital innovation. This was done by Ian Carroll. He was the driving force. He was the one that more than a decade ago was pushing the ABC and saying, ‘This is the new frontier. Our world does not end at free-to-air television and radio. We have to drive into the digital arena’, and they have done it very well. Ian is also deeply missed. 


It was a very tragic week for the ABC to lose those four men. All of them made a great contribution the ABC—a remarkable one and unique contributions in each case. All of them are very sorely missed, so it is appropriate that this parliament records our sadness at their passing, our respect for them, conveys our condolences to their family, friends and colleagues at their work, and also in doing this, recognises the great work that the ABC does to bring our wonderful large nation together, and in particular to bring together the far-flung parts of Australia, out in the bush in regional Australia, to the clerks in the city, who in the midst of the bustle, without the ABC, would only be able to dream of the splendours that Clancy enjoyed.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2011-08-25,"



Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (10:43):  I, too, would like to rise in this condolence motion for the loss of three great reporters who told the regional story.


The ABC is the national broadcaster and whilst they have lost, in fact, four members of the ABC family last week that, in many ways, is part of the nation’s family, too, because of the stories they tell and the way they tell them. The cameraman, pilot and journalist who died in outback South Australia last week so tragically were doing what they did so well as a trio. They told the regional story, the Australian story, through the prism of the regions. They understood, better than most, the patchwork nature of our society—and that term has been used a lot lately, but each patch is different and the ability to explain those differences and present those differences is, indeed, an important work in its own right.


Paul Lockyer did this as the journalist, John Bean as the cameraman and Gary Ticehurst as the logistics operator, obviously getting them into remote areas, into difficult, otherwise inaccessible areas, certainly inaccessible for the purposes of a news cycle. They had been working together on news and feature projects in the Lake Eyre region. It was not the first time that they had been there because they had done a wonderful documentary on previous occasions in the Lake Eyre region. Like those who have had the privilege to see it with water and without water and to note the fascinating differences, to be able to record that and tell the story about it takes it to an audience that does not have the ability to access it but can nevertheless marvel at the wonderment of the change, the rehabilitation, the revival—everything that comes from the enrichment of water and flooding plains.


Paul Lockyer was one of the ABC’s most experienced journalists and he also had a great ability to tell the stories. He cut through and gave all Australians an unrivalled insight into the bush and to remote communities. He had a real passion not just for news, but a passion for the regions, and that is a great thing to see. It has been an essential ingredient of the great message that the ABC has been able to convey over the years through television and radio, but it is more than just the telling of the story, it is giving strength to the regional voice. It is believing in it, having the passion for it and articulating it in the most effective ways. All of his stories conveyed empathy, respect and a deep understanding of the issues that faced people who live and work in regional Australia. They do think differently than we do here in Canberra. They see issues through a completely different perspective and their challenge, always, is ‘how can we better our opportunities?’, rather than the hurly-burly that goes on here for so much of the time.


I mentioned before that they perished in the Lake Eyre region, but Paul had undertaken an outstanding series on Lake Eyre which he was in the process of filming. His compassion covering the recent floods also made him a household name because Paul was the voice, the only journalist effectively, to be able to get into Grantham after that devastating flood that took so many lives and changed forever the nature of that peaceful valley, a valley that carries the same name as Paul himself. But he was the voice. He was there and he was able to bring the story—the hurt, the pain, the understanding, that empathy I talked of before—he was able to bring it to the outside world, so as people were grieving he was able to demonstrate an understanding and awareness in the rest of the community of just what had happened in terms of a community that effectively had been washed off the map.


John Bean was an award winning cameraman who was with Paul at the time of the Lake Eyre series and the three were filming when the tragedy occurred. The filming, itself, will be a lasting legacy to them. It is just so tragic that they were taken in an area that they understood, that they loved and that they wanted to tell the story about.


They were experts in their field, extraordinary men who not only captured the spirit of regional Australians, but helped to tell their stories. As the ABC’s former head of international, John Tulloh, recently said of Paul Lockyer: 'He had in abundance the best virtues of humanity. So many that you would not know where to start. It’s no wonder that strangers who featured in his stories, especially in the bush, trusted him. They probably recognised the kindred country-boy spirit in him. They knew he would never exploit them and always would tell their stories faithfully and knowledgeably.'


I think that is important because the regions did trust him. He was from them and he returned to them. He never forgot them. He loved them and loved the regions in a way that he saw part of his life’s mission was to better tell their story, their challenges, their triumphs and, on a number of occasions, their miseries. John Tulloh went on to say, 'He felt for the despair and plight of farmers and their families in the dust bowls who were part of his stories.' 


As I mentioned at the outset, Paul was well known for his coverage of the devastation in Grantham and in the recent Queensland floods. In relation to that, Mart Warburton of the Grantham Recovery Council said this of him: 'One of few reporters who could balance his professionalism of the job and the compassion of the heart—a true gentleman. Since the first meeting in January until now Paul would ring from time to time just to see how I am going and how the community is recovering. When he was able to come back to Grantham he would make a huge effort to try and see as many residents as he could that he knew from the disaster. We all felt that we were more than a story to Paul. That’s why he was an honorary Grantham local, a friend, and always welcome in our community.' John Bean was also a man of immense capability and popularity. He was described by his friends and colleagues as incredibly humble, positive and warm, with an infectious laugh, and like Paul and Gary was a master in his field. It is terribly important with the stories of regional Australia that the visuals are there. The skill of the cameraman is essential to complement the editing, the text and the delivery of the reporter, and John Bean was an incredible part of this team that so sadly has perished. As John’s wife, ABC Landline reporter Pip Courtney, said, ‘I just hope lots of people have a Beannie in their lives like I’ve had.’ That infectiousness and that lovability were very much part of everything that those who spoke of John are reminded of. 


Gary Ticehurst was an extraordinary pilot. John Tulloh recalls this in relation to Gary Ticehurst:


In my time at the ABC there were many stirring deeds by reporters and crews, but for me there was none greater than during the disastrous 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. That is when Gary and cameraman, then Peter Sinclair, hovered in gale-force winds above stricken yachts and life rafts in tumultuous seas to coordinate their positions with rescuers, turning away only when in his calculation they had just enough fuel left to return to land. They made it with just a few litres in the tank and it was said his actions saved the lives of probably 25 crew members in that race.


It is the skills of these pilots that we rely on not only for the accessibility and the logistics work that made up the trio, in terms of the three that perished, but also the bravery, skill and precision and the ability to understand your capacity but also the task at hand and to have the determination to make the judgment, but most of all to put the saving of lives at the forefront of the determination as part of the job that he saw as his requirement to undertake.


Over the years I have had a lot to do with regional reporters and the professionals who cover regional stories. I have always found that the regional media are great to deal with. They are interested in you being there to understand their circumstances, to identify and hopefully to help. The regional reporters also call it how they see it. It does not always go our way, but that is the nature of journalism. They do know their stuff and they do know their regions and their audiences. In this tragedy Australia has lost three men who knew their audience, who knew their issues and who knew how to convey the stories of regional communities in a very powerful and compelling way. I know that they will be deeply missed and I extend my deepest condolences to their family, friends and colleagues. 


Whilst I am on my feet, could I also have the indulgence to place on record my condolences for the passing of Ian Carroll, another ABC journalist whose death I think happened around the same time but after the condolence motion was moved in the parliament by the Prime Minister. I met Ian Carroll over 40 years ago when I was making it in the industrial movement and he was a reporter for the ABC in those days. It was an exciting time because there were many industrial disputes in those days when we did not have something that came to emerge called the prices and incomes accord, which in its own way helped transform the nature of this country. 


I was involved in a trade union—the Storemen and Packers Union. I had just finished at university and Ian was on the round with a lot of other key journalists at the time—Ben Ainsworth, Barry Donovan, and Michael Gordon, who is still writing with the Age as National Editor. This was an exciting group to be involved in. But Ian, you knew at the time, was more than just a reporter and certainly more than just an industrial roundsman. He did have a creativity. He had big ideas about him. He went through the ABC in a number of guises but the two areas that he picked and was innovative with, and why the ABC are privileged to have these people work for them and why the nation is the better for it, were where the media was moving and the emergence of the moving media cycle. He understood that. And for that reason he pioneered the ABC Lateline program; he saw a niche. As the 6 o’clock news moved more to domestic tragedies and the like and less to political stories there was a market still there for strong political debate, and so Lateline developed and Lateline stands today. 


He also understood the technology and the importance technology could play in terms of enabling the message reach of the ABC; not just the media dimension, but the message, the storytelling and all that went with it. He was instrumental in driving the ABC in the direction of the embrace of the digital economy. It is fortuitous that we reflect on that in this condolence motion, because the government is undertaking at the moment the convergence review that is looking at this whole question of the convergence of technologies. So the circumstances in which his legacy will be remembered are terribly important. I place on the record my condolences for his passing and my very best to his surviving family, in particular Geraldine Doogue.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (10:58):  Over the years I have had the great fortune through my portfolio to engage with many members of the ABC regional news and current affairs world—sound recordists, cameramen and camerawomen, journalists and on occasions helicopter pilots. Having seen the work of that crew, I simply wanted briefly to record my sorrow at the loss of three of their number, all truly experienced and outstanding representatives—Gary Ticehurst, John Bean and Paul Lockyer. Each of the three had a distinguished career, but each of the three was well known more importantly still for their decency, humanity and professionalism. Gary Ticehurst, whilst a pilot of 25 years with the ABC, was rightly remembered most importantly for his courage during the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race in 1998. As other honourable members have recorded, he chose to put the safety of those in the water and in stricken boats ahead of himself and brought his helicopter perilously close to some very tight moments, but in so doing he guided a rescue crew in and was responsible—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms K Livermore
):  Order! A quorum is not present in the committee at the moment so the chamber will be suspended until the chair is resumed.



Sitting suspended from 
11:00 
to

Mr HUNT:
  As I noted before the suspension, Gary Ticehurst put his own safety a distant second during the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race of 1998. It is fair to say that there are many families that remain whole as a consequence of that decision.


John Bean, of course, was an awarded cameraman. His work took him right around the country and he had worked in rural Australia. I make this point because, having worked with many ABC journalists and camera crew across rural and regional Australia, I have a sense of the passion they have for their job. It is important to acknowledge that they are a fundamental glue—whether we agree or disagree with any particular story—to the ability of people in regional Australia to have a voice, to have access to an understanding of the broader things that are occurring within their region and to simply be in connection with the rest of the country.


Paul Lockyer, who was of course the best known of the three to have perished in the Lake Eyre helicopter tragedy a week ago, was a journalist who brought to life the drought. He then brought to life the rains and the magnificent spectacle of Central Australia in full bloom, both for its environmental benefits but also the human stories that went with it. Again, a tragedy which perhaps became the leitmotif of his work was his role and work in Grantham in the immediate aftermath of the tragic inland wall of water that tore through that town at the start of this year.


I simply wanted to record my sorrow at their passing in such circumstances. Like many in this House, it was my portfolio, not so much my electorate, that took me into many circumstances where I have worked with ABC regional crew. They do a tremendous job. To lose three of their principal leaders was a great loss for them and the community, but above all else a loss for the families of Gary Ticehurst, John Bean and Paul Lockyer.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (11:05):  Before entering parliament I had the great honour to be a union official, the National Secretary of the Community and Public Sector Union. One of the best groups of members I ever got to represent were the employees of the ABC. They were without doubt some of the most intelligent, committed and talented people I ever represented in my industrial capacity. It was with great sadness that I and my colleagues at the CPSU learnt that long-term ABC journalist Paul Lockyer, cameraman John Bean and pilot Gary Ticehurst had died in tragic circumstances. They were filming the flooding at Lake Eyre in Central Australia and the helicopter crashed in a remote location on the lake’s edge. Investigators from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau only reached the scene on Friday night. We had hoped that it would not end in tragedy in that 12 or 14 hours after learning about the accident, but regrettably that was not the case. 


Paul Lockyer was a distinguished international journalist who produced a truly remarkable body of work, and in statements in this place and elsewhere many people have paid tribute to that work. He had been a correspondent in Washington, Singapore and throughout Asia and had won a Logie award for best TV reporter. His work in recent years focused on regional and rural issues and his work on the Queensland floods this year won universal acclaim. I am quite certain that he will, tragically posthumously, receive further awards for that work. Not only that; it is clear from the outpouring of grief and regret from not only his colleagues at the ABC and in the Australian media community but also from the broader ABC family that Paul was highly valued as a good friend. The qualities that made him a good friend and a good mate shone through in his journalism and touched audiences everywhere across Australia. It is not easy to win trust let alone affection from people who are living in regional Australia, but it was clear from his reports from regional Australia that he was good with people and they in turn respected and trusted him with their stories.


At the time of the accident, Paul, John and Gary were filming for another acclaimed documentary for ABC Television on Lake Eyre. Paul Lockyer was one of the ABC’s most experienced journalists, with an award-winning career spanning more than 40 years locally and internationally. Many speakers in this condolence motion have spoken about Gary Ticehurst, who was by all accounts one of the best amongst the media pilots. I never met him personally, but I know of him by fame and reputation. On more than one occasion during that infamous Sydney to Hobart race he put his life at risk to ensure the safety of the crews on stricken yachts hit by storms. He was famous within the profession and it is fitting that his work is paid tribute in this debate.


Brisbane based cameraman John Bean worked for the ABC for 20 years across a diverse range of programs, in news and entertainment, including international assignments. In my time representing workers at the ABC we used to represent the people who were behind the camera and the people who did not generally get the fame that the journalists and others did. They were famous and well-respected amongst their colleagues but generally little known amongst the Australian public. It is tragic and perhaps ironic that it takes a tragedy such as this to make the Australian community stand up and recognise the wonderful value of their work; they come out from behind the camera and become visible to us.


These men were not only dedicated media professionals; they were also husbands, fathers, sons and uncles. I know this is a terribly difficult time for their families. I take this opportunity and join with all of my parliamentary colleagues to extend my personal sympathy to their families and friends and to the entire ABC community, who I know are missing them dearly.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:10):  I associate myself with the eloquent and moving remarks of the members for Wentworth, Flinders and Throsby and the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government this morning—and others too—in this condolence motion. My sincerest condolences are offered to the families and many friends of the three ABC news crew who died in a helicopter crash while filming near Lake Eyre in outback South Australia on Thursday, 18 August. We were sad to hear of the loss of award-winning journalist Paul Lockyer, experienced pilot Gary Ticehurst and gifted cameraman John Bean in such tragic circumstances.


The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has a long and proud history, with news crews working relentlessly and tirelessly to bring Australian news, world news and regional news to our living rooms. Paul and John, as news gatherers, did it marvellously well. The helicopter pilot was one of the best. Australia’s media has been dealt a harsh blow. They brought to our small screens the stories of the people, the outback, rural and regional Australia—what I like to call real Australia—and the colour, exuberance, vibrancy and vitality of the bush. The media has lost three of its finest. The nation is poorer as a result. They were fine men and fine Australians. May they rest in peace.

Mr WINDSOR
 (New England) (11:11):  I would like to join this condolence motion and offer my sympathy to the families of Paul Lockyer, Gary Ticehurst and John Bean. I knew Paul quite well and considered him a friend. I think he was a great friend of regional Australia; there is absolutely no doubt of that. His origins in Western Australia and in the country, I think, flowed through his capacity to tell the stories of regional Australia. 



We share the same age, so it also brings home one's own longevity in a sense. I used to speak with Paul on the phone a bit about some of the regional issues that are out there. He would ring from time to time just to see what I thought was happening, what was not happening or what should be happening. The last time I spoke to him was in relation to a story on a piece of legislation that I will actually be introducing into this parliament on the next sitting Monday to do with coal seam gas, coal activities and groundwater issues under the EPBC Act. 




Paul was one of those who are very, very astute. He was obviously a very professional journalist. I think there are a lot of journalists in Australia today who should actually look at how professional these people were—Gary as a professional helicopter pilot; John Bean as obviously one of the best in terms of his capacity to operate a camera and his ability to send the message back; and Paul as the journalist. They were a great team. But to send that message back you needed a great photographer.




The last time I spoke to Paul he actually said that he was looking forward to going back out there. We shared a common interest, I guess. We used to talk occasionally above the love of inland Australia, the deserts and the way in which water is so vital to this nation in a range of areas. I think he was particularly captivated by the way in which the Channel Country in Queensland related to that very dry area around Lake Eyre and how that region absolutely came to life when it rained in the Channel Country in Queensland. 




He was going back out to do a follow-up story on that when the tragedy occurred. His capacity to tell the real story of regional Australia—the country stories—as I said probably went back not only to his roots in regional Western Australia but also to the professional edge he put to it. Too often these days we see journalists who want to make themselves the story, be part of the story or present their interpretation of the story. I think the great attribute that all three of these people had was that they were able to relate to the people they were talking to. Paul Lockyer never looked down on country people, as some journalists who do not understand those real issues of country Australia tend to do. They do not mean to do it and I do not blame them, but it sends a body language message to many. I think we saw the way that they were accepted in Grantham as well. They were not in there like voyeurs looking at the damage and trying to pick up the story of damaged people; they were there in a sympathetic way to tell the tragedy of the story of the people actually on the ground.




My brother-in-law and good friend Andrew Pursehouse and his wife, Cynthia, spent about three hours with Gary on probably the last story that they did in New South Wales, at Breeza, looking at a similar issue, the impact of mining activities on water resources. I know they represent a whole group of people right across regional Australia who have engaged with Paul, Gary and John on various occasions and told their story. Tim Duddy, who has been a champion for regional Australia as well, also spent much time with Paul on that same story in my local region.




On the morning that we heard that there had been a tragedy in Lake Eyre I went to our local ABC radio station to offer my condolences, because they are a real family. There was no-one more respected than Paul Lockyer in terms of journalism. Everybody knew Gary Ticehurst and most people knew John Bean. The emotion in our local ABC—and I am sure it was right across the nation—was palpable. People were genuinely upset. Catherine Clifford, the news announcer, did an extraordinary job—she knew Paul very well—in being able to go to air at 6.30 and make those announcements.




I make my contribution today not just on behalf of myself, my family and obviously the community I represent, but very particularly for that ABC family that is out there right across Australia who have lost these extraordinary professionals. My eldest son, who is a farmer but is also a helicopter pilot, had contact with Gary Ticehurst on a number of occasions, particularly in the Kimberley area a few years back when the movie Australia was being filmed. Right across that network of professional pilots and helicopter people they all know each other and obviously they feel for the families as much as we all do.




I would just like, if I could, to mention a common friend of both Gary Ticehurst's and mine, a fellow called Ian Wiskin, who, with Gary, was instrumental in forming the Helicopter Association in New South Wales. They were also involved in the national association. Ian, as many would know in this House, has been here on a number of occasions to represent various issues. He was very close to Gary Ticehurst. I will be attending the funeral of Paul Lockyer tomorrow in the company of Ian Wiskin and we will convey some of the messages that I have heard from other members and other members of the community as well.




I extend  the sympathy of my family and that of the electorate of New England and regional people generally to the families of these people. Because of their absolute devotion to their task and their capacity to relay the stories as they really are,they will not be forgotten, particularly by country Australia. I think other members have spoken about that. We feel extreme sorrow for their families on this very sad occasion.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (11:20):  I rise on this condolence motion regarding Private Matthew Lambert, who, on 22 August 2011, became the 29th soldier to be killed on active service in Afghanistan. It was his first tour of Afghanistan with 2RAR and, sadly, his last. But it was not his first tour in the service of our country. Private Lambert served our country in East Timor, undertaking two tours of duty. An expert sniper, he has been recognised for his service and has been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal, the Afghanistan campaign medal, the Australian Service Medal, the Australian Defence Medal and the Timor-Leste Solidarity Medal. He also wore the Infantry Combat Badge in recognition of his special place—fighting for freedom, putting himself in danger to protect us.



Private Lambert was killed on night patrol on a mentoring mission with the Afghan National Army in the Khas Oruzgan region just north-east of Tarin Kowt. Private Lambert’s career in the Australian Army commenced in the Army Reserve in 2005 before he went full-time in his service of our country in 2007. As I understand it, his loss is the first loss that 2RAR have experienced since the Vietnam War—that is, the first loss of a military serviceman in action. We think now of Private Lambert’s wife, his family, his colleagues and his friends. We are devastated for them that they have lost a loved one and we are also devastated for our country that we have lost a great Australian who has served our country very dutifully and well. We will never forget him and will forever be grateful for his sacrifice.




I would also like to take the opportunity to recognise the other 28 Australian soldiers who have given their life during their service in our campaign in Afghanistan: Sergeant Andrew Russell, Trooper David Pearce, Sergeant Matthew Locke, Private Luke Worsley, Lance Corporal Jason Marks, Signaller Sean McCarthy, Lieutenant Michael Fussell, Private Gregory Sher, Corporal Mathew Hopkins, Sergeant Brett Till, Private Benjamin Ranaudo, Sapper Jacob Moerland, Sapper Darren Smith, Private Timothy Aplin, Private Scott Palmer, Private Benjamin Chuck, Private Nathan Bewes, Trooper Jason Brown, Private Tomas Dale, Private Grant Kirby, Lance Corporal Jared Mackinney, Corporal Richard Atkinson, Sapper Jamie Larcombe, Sergeant Brett Wood, Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, Lieutenant Marcus Case, Sapper Rowan Robinson and Sergeant Todd Langley. We thank you for your service to our country. We thank your families for their sacrifice. Lest we forget.




Finally, I would also like to record our gratitude to the 3,280 active service men and women who are serving our country overseas at this point in time in Afghanistan, East Timor, Egypt, Iraq, the Middle East, the Solomon Islands and also Sudan. We are thinking of you and we wish you to come home as speedily and safely as possible after your tour of duty.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:24):  Once again I rise in this place to honour an Australian soldier who has fallen in Afghanistan doing the vital work of restoring security, peace and prosperity to that country. Today I honour the life and service of Private Matthew Lambert. In doing so, I once again offer my condolences and the condolences of all Canberrans to his family and his friends. 



As I have said before, this is a town that is home to many members of the Defence Force. We are a community linked very closely with those men and women who come from around the country to serve their nation and their people. In my former roles in the Department of Defence I met many members of the Army and other services, so while I never met Private Lambert I know all too well the kind of man he was. I have no doubt at all he was dedicated, courageous, proud and honoured to serve.




I had reason the day before yesterday to join with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Veteran’s Affairs to launch the FamilySMART program, which is being developed by the Defence Community Organisation. The purpose of this program is to make sure that the families of defence personnel are looked after when their loves ones are deployed. At this event I spoke to many relatives, wives and children of members of the services who are or have recently been deployed overseas. I mention this program because I think it shows just how connected the defence forces are and just how much the death of Private Lambert will be hurting the entire defence community. It will cut deep, just as the deaths before him have done. These are tough, gritty and determined men and women and they know the risks they face when they are deployed to places like Afghanistan. However, this does not make the loss any easier. 




As I have mentioned before, I have been fortunate in my short time as a member of this place to travel to Afghanistan and to meet soldiers like Private Lambert. I was very, very impressed and deeply affected by their professionalism and their dedication to their duties and to their mission of bringing stability to Afghanistan. It is not just a very important mission for ensuring that the global environment is more secure and protected from terrorism and the brutality of the Taliban and al-Qaeda but a mission with direct consequence for the safety and security of Australians here and overseas. It is a mission that is making a difference.




While on my trip we met with a number of members of the Afghan parliament, one of them the internationally renowned Fawzia Koofi. Ms Koofi is the chairwoman of the defence and territorial affairs standing committee, has a masters in business and management and is a strong advocate of human rights, particularly of women’s and children’s rights. She is also from a political active family. In our meeting she was articulate and forthright. She praised the international presence in Afghanistan and wanted it to last as long as possible because it ensured women like her were safe.




In Oruzgan we met only with men from the provincial government, army and police in Tarin Kowt and local leaders in the Mirabad Valley. All of them praised the international community’s work in building vital infrastructure, including schools, waste management and food storage facilities and women’s and children’s health centres. They were at pains to point out the gains in stability and security in the last 12 months, particularly in the last six months.




My trip to Afghanistan left a permanent mark on me and put into sharp focus the reality of life on the ground for those deployed there. It is a place that is hot and dusty during the day and freezing at night. It is a hard place. But, as is so typical of the character of Australian defence personnel, they just got on with the job. Words cannot possibly do justice to the work and sacrifice of Private Lambert or to the extent of the grief of his family and friends. Once again, all I can offer is my eternal thanks and to say that the people of Canberra are grateful and we will not forget the sacrifice of Private Lambert and his efforts, and neither will the people of Afghanistan. His commitment will not be in vain and he will be remembered.

Mr SIMPKINS (

Cowan
) (
11:29):  I welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to Private Matthew Lambert. But this is without doubt another tragedy, a tragedy for our country and a tragedy for several Australian families. I pay tribute to Private Lambert, a dedicated soldier, a soldier who always wanted to serve his nation and serve the national interest, beginning with the reserve forces in Brisbane and moving on to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment based in Townsville. Although having served two tours of duty in Timor, he had recently joined the third Mentoring Task Force in Afghanistan. It was on this deployment that he lost his life for a very good cause.



When you look at what we are trying to achieve in Afghanistan, it is often open to criticism that we should not be there, that it cannot be won or that we are there for the wrong reasons. There are myriad excuses why this is not the right thing to do. However, when you look at the sort of place Afghanistan was before the war began, when you look at the evil that the Taliban and their allies represent, when you look at the very negative outcomes that the Taliban had imposed upon that country, something had to be done. As is usual in these cases, somebody needs to make a decision to do something about these problems in the world, these evils in the world. I pay tribute to those prepared to do what needed to be done. But of course the political determination is at one level. Ultimately to back up that political determination people need to be there on the ground. People need to pick up a rifle and they need to go to these places and take the action that needs to be taken. Evil needs to be opposed, bad people need to be stopped, and the women and children of Afghanistan need to be protected.


We cannot look at these people like the Taliban or al-Qaeda and say that they are representatives of the mainstream within Afghanistan, because they are not. As usual with these sorts of elites, oligarchies or dominant forces, they rule for themselves with no regard for the people. The keeping of children, particularly girls, out of education is not an element of a progressive society. It is not an element of an organisation, a government, that has any legitimacy in the world anywhere. It fell to certain countries in the past to stand up and be counted and be prepared to send in the troops to deal with these people. So many of our soldiers have served with honour and great distinction in Afghanistan. As we know, 29 have now died for the cause. It has been a cause of honour, for good in the world, and we should never walk away from that. We should never count so much the cost that our determination should ever waiver. For those who have died, it is a great tragedy and it is a tragedy that their families will always have to live with, but if we were to walk away at any point before this job is done, then so much of what they have died for would be in vain.


The trouble is that there are still evil people out there—the Taliban. As I said before, they do not rule for the people; they rule for themselves. They rule with a view of the world in a very skewed and negative manner that will never be in the best interests of the people in Afghanistan. In the future it may well be that more Australians may die, and that will never be acceptable. We should always strive to make sure that the chance of that is as limited as possible, but in the end the decisions that we make in this place and that the government makes in this place can have the ultimate impact on a family. Australians may die for a cause, and that tragedy may be repeated on many occasions yet. However, as I said before, we should never waiver from the commitment we have to doing the right thing in the world and to making the world a better place for not only people in this country but people in other countries around the world. The cause of democracy sometimes has to be fought for and sometimes Australians will have to pick up weapons and do what needs to be done.


I pay tribute to the Australians who serve today and who have served the national interest and the cause of decency, good and democracy in the world. Many have done so. They have all done so with distinction. It is certainly my view that Private Matthew Lambert, a distinguished soldier from the 2nd Battalion, did not die in vain. He died for this good cause. I pay tribute to him, a great soldier, a great Australia, and I offer my sincerest condolences to his family and his spouse. I wish her all the best and I know that this parliament, with bipartisan support, will always see these soldiers and their families are looked after.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (11:36):  Today I rise to follow previous members in paying my respects over the loss of another soldier in Afghanistan and another soldier from Townsville. A member of Townsville’s 2RAR, since transferring to the regular army in 2007, Private Matthew Lambert was a sniper and part of the Mentoring Task Force. Having served in East Timor in 2009, this was his first mission to Afghanistan, and he had been looking forward to again serving his country abroad.


Those who knew Private Matthew Lambert have spoken of the respect that his fellow soldiers had for him and the skill he displayed in completing any task given to him. Private Lambert is the first member of 2RAR to be killed in action since the Vietnam War, and I know how tough the other day must have been for the soldiers in that battalion. 2RAR are indeed second to none. My thoughts are with them, though, at this difficult time. I also recognise the impact that this tragedy will have on the wider Townsville community. We are a tight community and the men and women of the ADF are a significant and valued part of that very tight and reserved community.  There will be many in Townsville mourning the loss of Private Lambert this week, and his service and sacrifice for his nation will never be forgotten. Private Lambert was described by his mates as a loyal friend. His partner moved to Townsville two years ago to be with him during his post. I offer my deepest condolences to her and to Private Lambert’s family as they grieve his terrible loss.


This is the 29th casualty our country has suffered in Afghanistan and the task of mourning the men we have lost is never easy for the Defence Force, the Australian community and this parliament. However, as other members and I have said in the past, we must never get away from what is our collective determination to finish the good work that Australia’s Defence Force men and women are doing here and in Afghanistan.


Private Lambert was extremely proud to serve his battalion, his regiment and his country. It could be seen as cold comfort, but his family and friends can be proud of the job that he and his fellow servicemen have done and are continuing to do in Afghanistan. Substantial progress has been made as a result of Australia’s involvement, and we are on track to achieve our goals and our mission. This includes making the transition to Afghan-led security in the Oruzgan Province, a role that Private Lambert was strongly involved with as a part of the Mentoring Task Force. Enabling the Afghan people to independently keep their country secure is an extremely important job. It is vital for them and for international security that we stay the distance and see this mission fulfilled.


I would like to offer my full support to 2RAR, to all Defence personnel in Afghanistan, and in fact other theatres abroad—anyone serving overseas—and those who will soon deploy there. I thank them for the job that they are going to be doing and are doing. Australia has lost another brave soldier, a battalion another mate, another family a son. As Private Lambert’s partner and family enter this incredibly difficult period, I offer them my deepest condolences and I hope that in some small way the knowledge of the high regard and admiration with which he was held by all who knew him and worked with him offers some level of comfort.


I was at the pass-out parade for 2RAR, and Major General Gillespie spoke very highly of the job they were about to do. I know that Lieutenant Colonel Smith and his team were very proud of the job that they were doing. They were very eager to get across and do their work. The men and women of 3rd Brigade work very hard. They train and they are battle ready. He was at the point. To me, bravery is only a concept. Never in my life have I had to put my life on the line. To have the intestinal fortitude to take the point and lead the way for others bears noting. Private Matthew Lambert was brave, as are his colleagues. His bravery and his sacrifice has not gone unnoticed and will not be forgotten. Matthew Lambert, your deeds will live forever. You did what very few could do. You made a difference. Lest we forget.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (11:41):  I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Defence Minister and all members who have so respectfully made a contribution to this motion, and in doing so of course have risen to pay their respects to and to honour Private Matthew Lambert.


As others before me have indicated, Private Lambert was a sniper with the Townsville based 2RAR. He was of course very much part of an important campaign we have embarked upon in Afghanistan. I did not know Private Lambert, but as a former Defence Minister I know many people like him. All of our soldiers are individuals and each and every one of them is different in some way, but there is something common to them all, and that is their courage, their high level of fitness and training, their very high level of competence and expertise, and in addition to that their commitment to their service and their thorough belief in what we are doing in Afghanistan. I am sure that Private Lambert is no exception to that rule. Nor do I know Private Lambert’s family and friends, but having spoken to so many family members of those who have fallen before Private Lambert I would be very surprised if Private Lambert’s family were not fully supportive of what he was doing, were not fully aware that he believed in what he was doing, both the cause and the way he was pursuing that cause, and that he really wanted to be doing what he was doing.


All members of the Australian Defence Force are volunteers. They undertake their task for the right reasons. I have not found an exception. All of them do it for the right reasons and because they believe in what they are doing. I also believe that both our soldiers and their parents fully appreciate the risks involved. Parents in particular are not happy about their sons taking those risks but are fully supportive of their decision to do so. We not only thank Private Lambert for his service today; we also thank his family, friends and spouse, who I should have included in my earlier comments about parents. We also thank them for lending their support to him in terms of what he had decided to do with his life. I say ‘life’, because in many senses this can be a lifetime commitment.


This is No. 29, which is 29 lives too many. One life is too many. As I have said many times in this place, both as minister and as a private member, the longer we are in Afghanistan, the more people we lose, the more difficult it will be to take a majority of the Australian people with us, or in other words to persuade the majority of Australian people that we should be there.


Again, like others, I take this opportunity to explain why we are there. We are there as part of an international force playing our role, an important role, in maintaining stability and safety in a global sense. We are also there to protect Australians, whether they be Australians here in Australia or indeed Australians travelling elsewhere in the world, including other countries in our neighbourhood.


We have seen two very significant events both in Bali and in Jakarta, very close to home. Many Australians travel to that part of the world. This is about ensuring that these acts of terror do not again proliferate and come so close to our doorstep. Can we win? That is always the question. It is a reasonable question. There is not much point in being there given the expense both in human life and fiscal terms if we cannot win. I always say that it depends on what your definition is of ‘winning’. For me, winning is the international forces withdrawing from Afghanistan safe and secure in the knowledge that the Afghan national security forces, both police and armed forces, have the capacity to maintain their own security. Of course, that only comes if collectively we play a significant role in building an economy, in building governance and in building a justice system.


I go back to the question, based on that definition, can we win in Afghanistan? I believe the answer is yes. It will not be easy. We as a country have now reconfigured our operations—I was minister at the time—to focus on the training of the Afghan National Army in particular but also the Afghan National Police, and we are still playing a role in those other areas—governance building, aid and building an economy. But our key focus now is to lift the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army to a level in which not just we are confident but the international community is confident. The test is applied by NATO and not by us. It is not for us to determine when they are ready. 4th Brigade needs to reach a point where we are all collectively confident and satisfied that they are capable of maintaining their own security. 


All the reports that I receive are that we are making very good progress in that regard. I do not know the detail, but no doubt Matthew Lambert was patrolling with members of the Afghan National Army at the time of his tragic loss. We are making good progress. We are getting there. It is an achievable objective and we will get there. When we get there we can leave Afghanistan with the rest of our international partners and allies safe in the knowledge that Afghanistan will not again descend into chaos and will not again descend into a breeding ground and launching pad for those extremists determined to perpetrate their acts of terror indiscriminately not only in Afghanistan but around the globe, including potentially Australia. We have been very lucky on Australian soil— touch wood—thanks largely to our very competent intelligence and security bodies. We have been very lucky not to have an event here, but we know from those we have averted that it is very possible. Afghanistan and all of its consequences for the border region with Pakistan is very important in terms of maintaining our success in avoiding such attacks.


Private Matthew Lambert, with his colleagues, was playing a very important role in that mission and achieving that objective. On that basis we say thank you to him for his huge sacrifice, we say thank you to his spouse and his family for their huge sacrifice, and we send the message to them that we shall not forget his deeds and we will maintain the course in his honour and finish this job.

WYATT ROY (

Longman
) (11:49):  I rise to honour the memory of Private Matthew Lambert, who was tragically killed while serving with Mentoring Task Force 3 in Oruzgan Province in Afghanistan. Today, in this parliament, we offer our deepest sympathy to his family, to his friends and to his mates. I make particular reference to the member for Herbert, who spoke very eloquently earlier. Our thoughts are very much with the Townsville community in this difficult time and I am sure the member is providing excellent support for a community in mourning.


Private Matthew Lambert’s colleagues described him as a man who excelled at any task he was assigned to and a soldier who proudly served his country. Only a few short weeks ago I returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was privileged to spend time with countless service men and women of the ADF, but I was particularly fortunate to spend a day with Mentoring Task Force 3. The men and women of MTF3 are proudly upholding the Anzac legend, a legend that has seeped into our national consciousness. They are upholding courage; they are particularly upholding compassion, often in the face of significant adversity; and they are upholding the value of having a go and that eternal Australian spirit of mateship.


The men and women of MTF3 are doing an incredibly good job in the face of difficult challenges. They are providing the essential framework for civil society to be born in Afghanistan. In doing so, in providing security and in enabling the Afghan people and particularly the Afghan National Army to provide their own security, they are providing that essential ingredient that will see this nation change eternally for the better. It is now more viable—and it will continue to be more viable due to the work of MTF3 and the ANA—for locals to be part of a proactive, prosperous and peaceful civil society. It will be more viable for them to be part of that than to pick up a weapon and continue to do what they have done for generations. This would not be possible without the work of MTF3 and soldiers like Private Lambert.


It is incredibly encouraging to see on the ground the changes that are taking place in this country. These are changes that will not easily be eroded. When I was talking to members of MTF3 I said to them, ‘If we don’t get this right, is this like putting our hand into a bucket of water, only to withdraw our hand and see these changes go away?’ They assured me and then showed me some of the tangible gains that we are making. Because we have a safe security environment or a better security environment due to the work that MTF3 has done with the ANA, we have seen the opportunity for economic development to take place. A perfect example that they showed me was a short bitumen road that had been laid between two towns, providing the ability for economic development. They said that in the town at the end of the road the cost of an average commodity dropped by seven times when it was connected by this bitumen road. One of the great assets of a bitumen road is that you cannot lay IEDs underneath it. It continues this cycle of further security and further economic development.


The Afghan locals I met are forever grateful for the work that MTF3 has done and the work that soldiers like Private Lambert have done. As a nation we mourn his loss, but we should be rightly proud of what he and the Australian soldiers are achieving in Oruzgan Province. Today we rightly honour Private Matthew Lambert, a man who proudly upheld everything his battalion stands for—duty first.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Defence Materiel) (11:54):  This is a terrible time for the family and friends of Private Matthew Lambert. It is also a difficult time for the Australian Army and the wider Australian community. Matthew joined the Australian Army as a reservist in 2005 at 20 years of age. When he first enlisted he joined the 9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, the Fighting 9th. After 18 months he transferred into the Regular Army and was posted to Townsville with the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, in February 2007. He deployed to East Timor in the second half of 2009. He deployed to Afghanistan just two months ago as part of Mentoring Task Force 3.


The Mentoring Task Force’s role is to train the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army to protect the people of Afghanistan. It is an important job. It is what ensures that the Taliban cannot just wait out coalition forces. When we leave Afghanistan we will leave an Afghan army and a police force able to protect the Afghan people. We are obviously now in the middle of what is a very deadly fighting season, and moments like this bear very heavily on the Australian people. It is important, at moments like this, to remember why we are in Afghanistan and the progress that we are making. 


As I have said in debates like this before, we are in Afghanistan because it is in our national interest to be there. It is in our national interest to be there because of the threat posed by an unstable Afghanistan. An unstable Afghanistan poses a threat that reaches far beyond its own borders. It affects its neighbours and it affects us. September 11 and the Bali bombings are proof of that. We are not in Afghanistan alone. We are one of 48 countries that are contributing to the same effort under the mandate of the United Nations. We are all there for the same reason. The threat posed to all countries by an Afghanistan where malign forces take root again is a significant one. We cannot pretend that what happens in Afghanistan does not affect us here in Australia. It does, and because it does it is right that we are there.


I visited Afghanistan last month. Our soldiers told me of the progress that they are making. Our soldiers told me that where a few years ago they were at the head of a patrol, Afghan soldiers are now leading many patrols with Australian assistance. The work that we are doing in mentoring and training the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army is bearing fruit. Areas where fighting was taking place a couple of years ago are now relatively stable and we are expanding our footprint into new areas of the province. Khas Oruzgan is a good example of that. The district where Matthew sustained the injuries that killed him is a very bloody, very dangerous part of the Oruzgan Province where in the past insurgents have intimidated and murdered members of the local population. That the Mentoring Task Force and our Afghan partners are now patrolling in more districts like this is proof of the progress that is being made in Afghanistan. There is much more work to do, but the strategy that has now been adopted is the right one and we are on track to transfer responsibility for security in Oruzgan to Afghan authorities in 2014. We are making progress, but if we hand over responsibility to the Afghan army before they are ready to take over we will not leave a stable and secure Afghanistan. That is why the work of Matthew and his mates is so important.


I visited the team that Matthew was part of three times in the last few months, first in Townsville in March to make sure the kitting system at Lavarack Barracks was working and that they have the equipment they need. I met with them for a second time in May this year at High Range in the Townsville Field Training Area to see their final training activity before they deployed to Afghanistan and I talked to them about the preparations they had made. The third time I met them was four weeks ago in Afghanistan. They are a dedicated and professional group of men. They are led by a good man in Lieutenant Colonel Chris Smith and they have lost a very good soldier. Matthew is the first member of 2RAR to be killed in action since the Vietnam War. I know his loss will be a huge blow to Lavarack Barracks and to the wider Townsville community. 


Brigadier Stuart Smith, the commander of 3rd Brigade, which includes 2RAR, said on Tuesday that Matthew was widely respected for his professionalism and commitment to duty and ‘his death has been felt deeply within our Army family’. In addition, he said that 'a family has lost a son and a young woman has lost a partner'. Like many young couples, Matthew and his partner, Ellesse, had just bought their first home and they had planned to live a life together. None of us in this place can ever properly imagine the grief that must be consuming her at this time or his parents, Chris and Vicki, or his sister Jess, but what we can do is honour him.


Private Matthew Lambert is the 29th ADF member to lose his life in Afghanistan since 2001, the eighth since the beginning of this year. His CO, Lieutenant Colonel Chris Smith, said that he was a great Australian soldier, an Anzac. He is a sniper, which says it all. He is an elite marksman. His soldiering skills are above all others and probably pound for pound one of the toughest and best soldiers in the battalion.


Our responsibility is to be worthy of Private Matthew Lambert and the sacrifice that he has made. His father, Chris, said in a statement earlier today: 


He was an extraordinary young man with everything, including incredible physical and mental agility. Matt had a great enthusiasm for living life, generously sharing his time, thoughts and ideas and inspiring us all by walking the talk. 


It is our job to do just that, to walk the talk, to honour his memory with deeds not just words, and ensure that the job he went to Afghanistan to do is completed. Lest we forget.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (12:01):  It was the happiest yet saddest of photographs. Two fresh-faced young adults joyfully posing for a social picture published in the Age newspaper yesterday. Her arm was around his shoulder and both had broad smiles. The photo portrayed just how much they enjoyed each other’s company. Ellesse Stronach, sadly, lost the love of her life when Matthew Lambert died on Monday. Matthew was a private in the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. He was the 29th Australian soldier killed in Afghanistan. Severely injured by a roadside bomb in Khas Oruzgan district of Oruzgan Province, the 26-year-old sniper was flown to the Australian base at Tarin Kowt but succumbed to his wounds shortly afterwards. 2RAR lost its first member of the war. Australia lost one of its finest, the bravest of the brave. Ellesse and Matthew’s family and wide circle of friends lost someone they cherished, someone they will never again be with or laugh with. Matthew gave up his life for the greater good of this world. 


Until recently Australian soldiers were rarely seen in the Khas Oruzgan Province, the farthest flung part of the province from Tarin Kowt. This is an area where the American Special Forces Base Anaconda is established. Khas Oruzgan was a violent place with tribal disputes. It has been the scene for appalling Taliban atrocities. In 2004, the Taliban killed 16 locals who were on their way to vote in national elections. In June last year Afghan police discovered the bodies of 11 Hazara, an ethnic minority persecuted by the Taliban, who had been beheaded. In November, the Taliban murdered seven Afghan police at a checkpoint in the district. However, in the past six months Australian troops have pushed east into the district alongside the Afghan National Army troops they are mentoring. According to sources, the fact regular troops as opposed to special forces are in the district is proof they and their Afghan allies are taking a tighter grip on the province.


Private Matthew Lambert was patrolling in Oruzgan Province with Afghan soldiers at 2.30 am when what is believed to be an improvised explosive device went off. It is dangerous work that he and his colleagues were doing. The insurgents have learnt to reduce the amount of metal in the bombs to a minimum, making traditional mine-searching devices useless. An elite sniper, Private Lambert is originally from Kogarah in New South Wales and he would have been at the head of the Australian, US and Afghan troops out on foot patrol in those early hours of the morning. 


Private Lambert, sadly, tragically, is the 29th Australian soldier to die in the war on terror and the eighth soldier to die this year. Private Lambert was a member of Mentoring Task Force 3 from 2RAR based in Townsville. He joined the Army in southern Queensland, enlisting in the 9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, in August 2005, transferring to 2nd Battalion RAR in February 2007 and being posted to Townsville. It was there at 2RAR where Private Lambert was enlisted as a sniper, and he is the first member of 2RAR to be killed in action since the Vietnam War. Private Lambert did two tours of duty in East Timor in 2009 and was awarded the Australian Active Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Australian Service Medal, Australian Defence Medal and Timor Solidarity Medal. Private Lambert was on his first mission in Afghanistan and had been deployed in June 2011.


The men and women who serve so bravely for us in Afghanistan are people of whom we can be immensely proud. They are working to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan and to the world. Australia is there to help them because we are not immune from the terrorist acts planned from Afghanistan for so long. Australians have been killed at the hands of terrorist activity, and our soldiers are directly protecting our freedom to move unencumbered by the threats of terrorist activity. Their work is of great importance and the sacrifice of Private Lambert is such that, whilst we mourn his death, we should also be very proud of his colleagues’ and his efforts both now and into the future. Our thoughts are with his partner, Ellesse, parents, family and the brave Australian men and women who are carrying on the work Matthew did so well in Afghanistan. They will miss their loved one dearly. 


It is during these sad times that we are reminded of the sacrifice these men and women make in order to bring peace and stability to a country so they may live a life as good and as democratic as ours. We must count the cost of staying in Afghanistan, but we must also recognise the great cost of what would happen if we withdrew. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition’s sentiment that we best honour the dead by remaining true to the cause. Private Lambert was a well-respected soldier who excelled at any task assigned and was looking forward to serving his country further in Afghanistan. Serving in rough areas barely accessible by vehicle, he patrolled the valleys by foot, manned the battlements and mentored the Afghan soldiers he loved and fought with. 


In the words of the Defence chief, General David Hurley: ‘They are fathers, husbands, sons, brothers and mates. They are soldiers and Australians. We will not forget their selfless sacrifice.’ As the member for Riverina, where Wagga Wagga or, more specifically, the Army recruit training centre at Kapooka is known as the 'home of the soldier', may I say: lest we forget.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (12:07):  I rise to express my deepest condolences to the family of Private Matthew Lambert. Tragically, Private Lambert was the 29th Australian to die in Afghanistan and the eighth this year. He was only 26 and on his first tour of Afghanistan. A New South Welshman by birth, he enlisted in the 9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment, in August 2005 and was later posted to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, in Townsville. He had served with distinction in East Timor and together with the Timor-Leste Solidarity Medal had also been awarded the Australian Active Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and the Australian Defence Medal. 


He will be sadly missed by his colleagues in uniform who had a great deal of respect for this very fine soldier. The Chief of the Defence Force, General Hurley, said, ‘His colleagues describe him as a man who excelled at any task he was assigned and a soldier who was proud to serve his country.’


Despite this tragic loss, Australia must continue with its important mission in Afghanistan. Having visited Oruzgan Province and Kandahar earlier this year, I saw firsthand the real progress that our military is making in Afghanistan. Training the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police is the first priority, for they will be the future protectors of their country from the insidious influence that is the Taliban. In addition to the military angle, local development projects are also critical to Afghanistan’s future. Australia’s involvement in building a school, a mosque, trade training facilities and other important initiatives are all making lives better for the ordinary Afghani.


Our deployment in Afghanistan is not getting any easier, but this should come as no surprise for the stakes are high. Stability on the Afghan-Pakistan border and progress in the global war on terrorism is what is in play. Were Australia to leave Afghanistan precipitantly, hard-fought gains would be compromised and the objective of our mission set back. 



Today our nation mourns the loss of Private Matthew Lambert, a family man and a soldier of the highest order. Our country will never forget his sacrifice, and our thoughts and our prayers are with his family at this difficult time. Lest we forget.

Private Matthew Lambert, tragically struck down at the age of 26 while serving his country in a theatre of war in Oruzgan Province in Afghanistan, is the 29th Australian to have died in that campaign and, as has been said, the eighth this year. The loss of any life in our armed forces is an absolute tragedy and one that is proper that we mark here in this place.


Private Lambert was a highly decorated and highly regarded soldier who had served abroad on numerous occasions. He will be sorely missed by his comrades in arms and by his family. I would like to associate myself with the words that have been said by members on all sides of the House.

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (12:11): I am delighted to join with others congratulating Australian cyclist Cadel Evans for his very significant achievement in winning the Tour de France. I do so as a member of the Riders on the Hill group, who ride up hills a lot slower than Cadel does. Thankfully he rides a lot faster.



In July 2006 I was standing in a queue at Charles de Gaulle with my wife and daughter when I heard a slightly high-pitched Australian voice behind me. Looking around, we recognised that it was the man whom we had watched finish fifth in the Tour de France on the Champs Elysees the day before. He was later elevated to fourth in that first post-Lance tour after the winner, Floyd Landis, was disqualified for drug use. It was the best result ever for an Australian at that stage, eclipsing Phil Anderson’s two fifth placings in La Grand Boucle, as the French call the famous tour.




For the next few minutes we chatted to Cadel and his Italian wife, Chiara. He was looking forward at that stage to returning to his European home, having spent the previous 21 days riding more than 3,500 kilometres around France at an average speed, including going up mountains like Alpe D’Huez and Galibier, of some 40 kilometres an hour. Although he was obviously tired, he was relaxed and happy to talk to a few Aussies at the airport. Indeed, he enthused about returning to Barwon Heads over the Christmas and summer break. Before he left, Chiara offered to take a photograph of us, a photograph which I treasure even more since he has won the Tour de France. 




It was the first time that most Australians had heard of him. If an Australian cyclist was known it was more likely to be Robbie McEwen, who had stood on the podium in Paris as wearer of the green sprint jersey on three occasions, or Stuart O’Grady, the prolific winner of track and road races, including Olympic medals. Many people even had difficulty in pronouncing his Christian name when they first heard it. But in the next two years he would come tantalisingly close to winning the tour. Somehow his Belgium based Lotto team did not seem to have the right support riders. Other teams seemed to protect their climbing stars, helping them over the high passes in the Alps and the Pyrenees. Cadel often seemed alone fighting odds beyond his control. But it did not affect his easygoing personality. At the following year’s Jayco series in Victoria, he participated in Amy’s Ride with thousands of recreational cyclists. Amy’s Ride, of course, commemorates the life of Amy Gillett, who was tragically killed in a training accident in Germany. The Amy’s Foundation works towards doing two things, addressing safety on our roads, particularly for cyclists, and assisting up-and-coming female cyclists.




On that day, after assisting legendary commentator Phil Liggett, Cadel chatted with fans, signing autographs and having his photo taken with many of them for an hour or more. I remember another occasion when we were fortunate to meet him and how he chatted away for about 10 minutes encouraging my youngest son, who had just taken up racing.




The high hopes of an Australian winner crashed the following year when Cadel finished 30th. Something clearly troubled him in that tour, but apart from some cryptic comments he kept it to himself. He also had bad luck in Vuelta a Espana, the Tour of Spain, losing valuable time with a puncture at the foot of a steep climb, yet he fought back to finish third in a tour he thought he could have won. Interestingly, at that stage many critics wrote off Cadel and said he could not win the Tour de France—he could only ride at one pace, he did not have the brilliance of Lance Armstrong or Alberto Contador and he had not won a major one-day classic. Indeed, prior to the 2009 World Championships, the Swiss champion Fabian Cancellara dismissed Evans’s chances in the road race. 




Much of that criticism was put to rest in five kilometres at Mendrisio, Switzerland, in September 2009. Approaching the last hill in the 262-kilometre World Championship road race, Cadel simply rode away from some of the best cyclists on the globe and in doing so he became the first Australian winner of that prestigious world championship event. Michael Rogers had won the time trial three times and Stephen Hodge, who rides with us here in Canberra, had twice won the amateur race which was regarded previously as the unofficial world championship for time trialling, the Grand Prix de Nations. Then, of course, we had Robbie McEwen’s second placing, which was the closest otherwise in coming to wear the rainbow jersey in the road race for any Australian. It was a very fitting outcome for an understated champion who conducts himself with modesty and humility. 


In 2010 Cadel had more bad luck. He crashed, he had a hairline fracture in his elbow and he finished a disappointing 26th in the event. All that turned around this year. He won one of the first races of the season, the Tirreno-Adriatico. He then followed that up by winning the Tour de Romandie. He finished second in the Criterium-du-Dauphine. Of course, as we all know now, he came out and won the Tour de France. 


Australians have dreamt of winning the Tour de France for a century. Of all the world’s great individual sporting contests, it has remained outside our grasp. Edwin Flack claimed gold on the track of the first modern Olympics. Our swimmers regularly beat the best in the pool and our track cyclists have often dominated on the velodrome. But cycling’s greatest challenge has escaped us. Ever since Don Kirkham and Snowy Munro contested the 12th running of the Tour de France in 1914 Australians have returned to France in search of victory. This year they have found it, and I am sure that Cadel’s victory will encourage the many hundreds and thousands of young cyclists in Australia to seek to emulate him in coming years. I am sure that the Australian victory and that great occasion when he was on the podium on the Champs Elysees with the Australian Tina Arena singing the national anthem will not be the last occasion that we see an Australian win the Tour de France. Congratulations, Cadel.

Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (12:18):  I congratulate Cadel Evans on his wonderful achievement. I am not a bike rider, which is obvious to everybody here, but my alter ego is a fit person and I am an Australian who is inspired by the efforts of people like Cadel Evans. I congratulate him as well as his team, BMC, who were all active contributors to Cadel’s win. I congratulate also SBS on its wonderful coverage on the Tour de France each year. 


Cadel does epitomise the Australian story. Born in Katherine in the Northern Territory, he spent his first four years growing up in the Indigenous community of Barunga, 80 kilometres outside Katherine. I am sure that when he began at the age of two riding a 16-inch BMX bike he never imagined the heights he would achieve in the cycling field. To go from that little boy of two in Katherine to the man standing on that podium on the Champs Elysees is a dream that again says Australians can achieve whatever they want with the right courage, conviction and support.


The Tour de France this year covered more than 3,430 kilometres in 21 stages. I confess I only watched 11 nights of it continuously. It was arduous for the riders and a little arduous for federal members of parliament as well, who were quite addicted to it. It is the world’s most competitive cycling race and Cadel Evans is the first Australian to win the Tour de France. He is also the oldest first-time winner at the age of 34.


Starting that last full day of the tour almost one minute behind the leader, Cadel finished second in the time trial and secured his victory in the tour overall. I think we also feel very proud that Cadel was very gracious in victory. Not only did he pay tribute to his team and to the other competitors; he dedicated his win to his late mentor, Aldo Sassi, who died of cancer in 2010. His career has been a most interesting one. Going from 1998-99, the first overall in the Mountain Bike World Cup, second in 1997 and 1999 in the under-23 World Championships, and he won the young riders competition of Australia’s very own Tour Down Under in the Adelaide Hills before converting to road racing full time in the summer of 2000.


But then, of course, he made that wonderful transition to Tour de France-type events, going away from mountain bike riding. He achieved high placings in the Tour de France in 2005, coming eighth; in 2006, fourth; in 2007 and 2008 he came second; and in 2007 he was named Australian Cyclist of the Year. In 2009 he won the World Championship road race in Mendrisio, Switzerland. All of us wanted him to win. He has come so close so many times. To watch him make that additional effort this time was quite amazing.


The ABC termed Cadel the thinking man’s champion after he wore a T-shirt in support of Tibet and the Tibetan people’s struggle with mainland China during the 2008 Tour de France. It was a gutsy thing to do. At the time Cadel commented that trying to bring awareness of the Tibet movement is something someone in his position can do. It is good to know that he is also associated with causes that he believes in and has the courage to be a well-rounded person rather than just a single-interest cyclist. Cadel is currently competing in the US Pro Cycling challenge. Cadel finished the first stage in fourth place, 17 seconds behind the leader, Levi Leipheimer. We wish him well in this ongoing event. 


I would also say to Cadel Evans, thank you on behalf of all Australians, cyclists and non-cyclists for the pleasure you gave us, and to SBS. The viewing is a pleasure. As a member of parliament, I am sorry but I can see such parallels in the clever tactics that have to be used to win such races. It is not always about speed and skill. It is a tactical game. I get a  bit hooked on that sometimes too. We would like to see more of that perhaps here in this place.


I would also not so much thank Cadel Evans but acknowledge that because of him and a little contribution from the coverage of the News of the World investigations and the committees in England, in the UK parliament, I did suffer jetlag for at least a week after going to sleep at 2 o’clock for 10 days. I agree with some of the things that have been said and published about Cadel. An editorial published in the Age said that his victory in the 2011 Tour de France entitles him to a place alongside the world’s leading cricketer Donald Bradman; billiards wizard Walter Lindrum, swimming legend Dawn Fraser and the crew of the America’s Cup winning yacht Australia II on the list of Australian sporting heroes who have taken on the world’s best in their field and prevailed. An editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald likewise described it as one of the greatest wins in Australia’s illustrious sporting history. 


Congratulations, Cadel. May your career deliver to you the satisfaction and success that you have achieved so far, and may you continue to bring great pride to the Australia people.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (12:12):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on behalf of my electorate of Flinders in relation to the victory of Cadel Evans in this year’s Tour de France. It was Alfred Lord Tennyson in his poem Ulysses who said, ‘To strive, to seek, to find but not to yield’, and that is the story of Cadel Evans’s career as well as his victory in this year’s Tour de France. 


The lessons are very simple for Australians. It is that sense of the joy of participation, the commitment to the long term, determination and then graciousness in defeat and graciousness in victory. All of these are qualities that have been embodied by Cadel Evans’s career and Cadel Evans’s victory in this year’s Tour de France. 


I am delighted that, if not a Victorian by birth, he is certainly a Victorian now. Indeed, he comes from the Bellarine Peninsula, which is opposite the Mornington Peninsula. We can almost claim him as one of our own. The most significant thing to come out of it is that sense of participation, joy and purpose from pure activity and pure commitment. That is a lesson which hopefully will inspire young people to pursue their dreams, to seek that which they aspire to. It is something that I have seen talked about in primary schools.  I visited primary schools in the week after the Evans victory and the kids were very excited. I think that was a great thing for an Australian but a greater thing still for young Australians.


There will be debate in coming decades, and it will be joyful debate, whether Evans, Bradman, Lindrum or Fraser is the greatest of our athletes. But I think one thing that will probably emerge is that in terms of individual sporting achievements, as great as the America’s Cup was, as great as other events, Phar Lap’s victories, as great as Bradman’s 1930 tour of England was, this will probably rank as the single greatest sporting achievement of the period up until now. Careers will be defined and it will be hard to go past Bradman’s career. But in terms of individual sporting achievements I think I would probably put my money on this one. That is for tragic sports historians, such as most of the members of parliament, to debate in years to come. 


Returning to Tennyson and Ulysses, it really is the case that the lessons we learn from this will be used to inspire and to elevate Australian schoolchildren in decades to come and we will remember that the lesson of Ulysses is the same lesson of Evans—to strive, to seek, to find but not to yield.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:28):  I believe that it is important that we in this place acknowledge extraordinary efforts by Australians. When one looks at the Tour de France it is notable that success requires a remarkable combination of fitness, skill, tactics, ability and just a dash of luck. There are so many things that can go wrong, often through no fault of your own. The task of a true champion is not only to master the physical and mental challenges that come with such a long event but also to take every step to minimise the chances of an accident.


Cadel Evans has done that and so much more. In a sport that has been beset by scandal in recent years, Cadel has stood out as a rider who has achieved his results on merit. He has demonstrated a commitment and tenacity that has allowed him to overcome adversity and to take his losses and turn them into victory.


Like most Australians, I do not know Cadel. I have observed his achievements through the media. As I watched, I saw him fall short of outright victory on so many occasions. But he never gave up. His result in the Tour de France this year was a remarkable achievement. That result provides inspiration for so many others, particularly in Australia. Why? Because Australians share the ride with our sporting heroes. We share the pain of their defeats and the joy of their victories. That is the stuff of being Australian. Indeed, a friend of mine, Mr Phil Kesby not only shares those sporting successes with Cadel Evans but he fixes his bike in front of the TV and he actually rides his bike during the length of the Tour de France. This year because of Cadel’s success he even rode during the replays, so you can imagine he was probably just as exhausted as Cadel by the end of it.


In Cadel’s case, sharing his Tour de France victory is so much sweeter because he had to work so hard, so much sweeter because he had lost before but had never given up. It is a comment on sport that coming second is seen to be a loss, but there is nothing like victory. This great victory will resonate throughout Australia. It will put more people on bicycles. My local retailers are telling me that this is the case. Bicycles continue to outsell cars as they have done since the year 2000 in Australia.  Importantly, the more people we see on bicycles the better the health outcomes for our community. A bit of fitness reduces the risk of heart attack; we all know that. This is what Cadel has done, because his inspiration puts more people on bikes. In Ryan and in Brisbane there has been a concerted effort by the Brisbane City Council to build the infrastructure for safe cycling. With the leadership of then Lord Mayor Campbell Newman and the current Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Cr Graham Quirk, they are committed to helping ordinary people get on bicycles. 


As the then Chairman of Public and Active Transport, I was responsible for planning and constructing $100 million-plus worth of bikeways and enhancements throughout the city. The great achievement that we were able successfully to deliver was invariably the difficult missing links that had been left undone by previous administrations so that we have a connected network throughout the city. 


The other great advantage we have is that Cadel Evans is an outspoken supporter of cyclists wearing helmets. On his website Cadel made the point: 


Physically I am completely unsuitable for almost all Australian school sports. Nearly all Australian school sports require speed and/or size. 


Whilst I am sure that things have changed since Cadel was at school, it is important that we bear in mind that sport is not just for a small group of physically advantaged children.


Finally, let me say a simple well done to an ordinary bloke but in part because of that a genuinely great Australian. The image of Cadel Evans on top of the podium in front of the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs Elysees draped in the Australian flag will forever be etched in Australia’s history.

 (Gilmore) (12:33):  Much has been said about the tragedy of job losses at BlueScope Steel in the Illawarra. Many of the workers live in the Shellharbour area of the Gilmore electorate and I would like to read a letter sent to me yesterday to show how a steelworker views the situation. Mr Michael Grogan of Shellharbour writes:


I am writing this letter to you all as a lifelong resident of the South Coast and Illawarra. I am married with 2 children that I have great hope for. I have been employed at the Port Kembla Steelworks since leaving school in 1983. In that time I have seen a vast number of changes take place both inside the works and in our community in general. Until now, I have not seen one that has had the potential to be as devastating to the community as the one announced yesterday regarding the removal of 800 plus jobs.


As a citizen of this community I am calling on you to change the way you think. As our elected representatives the time has come for change. Rescue packages, bailout packages, relocation packages are all after the fact results. When I watch the news and hear the Prime Minister and Industry Minister address what happened yesterday with political spin and rhetoric I wonder what the future is for my country as a whole.


Growing up and being educated as a child and young man, I was regaled with stories of the growth of this country. The Snowy Hydro scheme, the irrigation of the Riverina, even the building of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. All symbols of the growth and prosperity of our great nation. Perhaps I was naive and idealistic to believe it could continue. But why shouldn’t it?


We need to look beyond the ends of our noses. Bureaucracy needs to disappear. Like our forefathers, as a nation we need to start to make things happen. In our area alone a number of initiatives could go ahead that could create employment and long term growth opportunities. The raw material that we are digging out of the ground and sending to China is doing just that. They are building solid infrastructure. We should be doing the same.


What is stopping a second airport being built near Goulburn with a fast train that services Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne? A percentage of the material involved could be sourced from Australian suppliers such as BlueScope. It would certainly be a faster journey than catching the train from Sydney Airport to Oak Flats. We built the SeaCliff bridge, why don't we have a fast train that services Sydney from the Illawarra? It would drastically reduce road traffic, while again creating local jobs.


The Shellharbour Marina must occur. Why spend $100 million relocating displaced steel workers? Spend it building something that will employ them in their local area. Whether or not the residents of Shellharbour oppose it based on their own personal wants is no longer valid, it is a growth opportunity for our area. Housing estates are not long term employment options. Long term decisions need to be made


We have a fantastic port that is under utilised. The Illawarra region is a prime candidate for processing plants that are being sent overseas, provided transport infrastructure is up to scratch. Again, an opportunity for BlueScope, local fabricators and the people of the Illawarra. Business will be encouraged to invest in the area if the correct facilities are in place. Getting these facilities is going to take bi partisan support and some extra attention being focused on our region. You all need to remember that the Illawarra doesn't have the same sized coal and viticulture industry to fall back on that the Hunter region had.


The floods in Queensland and Victoria are another example of the potential for infrastructure and growth. I understand the need for environmental conservation as much as anyone, but a lot of the natural flora and fauna of these areas is no longer there. Building dams and causeways, trapping water so that we do not have periods and extreme between drought and flood, piping water to regional Australia can only benefit us all in the long run. It will also allow our native flora and fauna to flourish. There is even a tourism potential in these areas with houseboats, introduced fishing etc. The list is endless.


Lastly, the level of youth unemployment in our region has been too high for too long. Current events aren't going to help that. The Steelworks once trained hundreds of apprentices who have since gone on to all sorts of vocations. That opportunity hasn't existed for a long time. The disaffected youth of Great Britain have shown what can happen when people don't have a reason to get out of bed in the morning. What is to stop any school leaver that is unemployed for more than 6 months spending time in the armed services to learn either a trade or a job specific skill such as driving heavy equipment? They would then be able to go and work in these regional and mining areas that have a shortage of skills. They don't have to go to war, they just need to enhance their skill set. If they find employment whilst training they should be free to leave so they can take up the offer.


Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope it has provided some food for thought with some of my ideas. Being a government in surplus due to holes being dug in the ground shouldn't be our sole focus. I urge you to look to the visionaries of the past. Seize upon their ideals and beliefs so that we can make this country grow once more. We are the envy of the world in so many ways, and we have the opportunity to remain that way through your leadership. I await your non politicised replies.


I could not agree more with Mr Grogan, and I ask that my colleagues—and I note the member for Throsby is in the chamber—to take heed and lobby the RDA for some of those projects to take place, especially the marina at Shellharbour, which would create 1,000 jobs. I thank Mr Grogan for his views and respect the fact that he is asking for bipartisan support. I assure him that this side of the politics will not make matters any worse by the introduction of a carbon tax.

Mr Robert
  asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, in writing, on 4 July 2011:


In respect of rent payable over the last ten years for personnel living in (a) married quarters, and (b) all other living quarters: how many times has the amount payable changed; in what years; and by what proportion (as a percentage).

",HoR,<title>QUESTIONS IN WRITING</title>,<title>Australian Defence Force: Housing Assistance (Question No. 447)</title>,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,28,1,question
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2011-08-25,"



Mr Snowdon:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


The Group Rent Scheme (GRS) (including rent allowance, Service residence and living-in accommodation) member contributions are reviewed annually and adjusted in line with the increase in the cost of Defence housing assistance. It is a long standing policy that Defence should subsidise 50 per cent of the national cost of housing for Australian Defence Force members and their families with members meeting the remaining 50 per cent.


In past years the level of subsidy provided by Defence has increased due to greater than expected fluctuations in the Australian housing market and in 2009 the Defence subsidy was at 56.53 per cent. In the same year, the CDF and Secretary committed to a subsidy correction program to return the Defence subsidy to 50 per cent. In 2010, Rent Bands 4 and 51 were adjusted to achieve the 50 per cent subsidy and in 2011 Rent Bands 2 and 3 achieved 50 per cent subsidy. It is anticipated that the final subsidisation for Rent Band 1 (currently at 53.32 per cent) will be corrected in 2012. 


The GRS updates broadly reflect the annual market rent cost changes faced by the wider Australian community.


(a) The amount payable for Service residences (married quarters) has changed once every year since 2001. The proportion of change as a percentage for specified contributions for:


(i) Service Residences for Members with Dependants;


(ii) Service Residences for Members without Dependants 'not sharing'; and


(iii) Service Residences for Members without Dependants 'sharing'


are provided in the table at Attachment A can be obtain from the House of Representatives Table Office.


(b) The amount payable for rent allowance has changed once every year since 2001. The proportion of change as a percentage for specified contribution for rent allowance for:


(i) Members with Dependants; and


(ii) Members without Dependants


are provided in the table at Attachment B can be obtain from the House of Representatives Table Office.


The amount payable for Living-in Accommodation has changed 12 times since 2001. The contribution is based on rank, sharing arrangements and the level of accommodation. The proportion of change for these figures are set out in the table at Attachment C can be obtain from the House of Representatives Table Office.
