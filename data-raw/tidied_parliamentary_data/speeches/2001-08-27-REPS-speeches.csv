"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the committee's report entitled The law enforcement implications of new technology, together with evidence received by the committee
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The report I am tabling today is the outcome of some 12 months of careful examination by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority of the issue of the law enforcement implications of new technology, with particular reference to the use of technology in the types of cross-jurisdictional investigations in which the NCA is primarily engaged. The inquiry was commenced in June 2000 under the chairmanship of the former member for Aston, Mr Peter Nugent, who was known for his background in the computing and information technologies industries. I regret to say that, having been the committee's chairman only since May, I may not have made the same contribution to the committee's inquiry that he would have. The committee received 28 submissions to its inquiry and held five public hearings with a range of expert witnesses. On the committee's behalf, I wish to express our sincere appreciation to all parties for their cooperation with and their valuable contributions to this important inquiry.
The inquiry arose from the committee's recognition that emerging technology was proving to be a double-edged sword for law enforcement in Australia. Not only are criminals the beneficiaries of the enhanced range of opportunities that our high-tech world is increasingly delivering; that same technology may equally represent an opportunity for a more effective policing effort. While there is nothing particularly new about this concept, the rate of development of new technology over the past few years has been exponential, with the growth of the Internet in particular raising numerous challenges.
Fingerprinting is one notable example. Exactly 100 years ago, English criminologist Edward Henry was credited with creating the first set of fingerprint records. We all know how valuable fingerprinting is to the law enforcement armoury. Until very recently, the fingerprinting process involved printers ink, a roller and a slab. Matching a fingerprint taken from a suspect to one taken from a crime scene was a slow and uncertain exercise. Now, through the wonders of the latest live scan technology, a clear and undistorted record of fingerprints and palm prints can be electronically transmitted to a central database for instant matching. When the suspect is already in custody, such speed of response may be crucial.
While criminals will happily grab with both hands every opportunity that new technology presents, policing has not always been given an equal chance to match their efforts. Some of this constraint may be financial—which is largely inevitable, when one considers the demands made on the budget, whether at the Commonwealth level in relation to agencies such as the NCA or at the state and territory level in relation to their police services. Of more interest to the committee's inquiry, however, were legislative constraints that act to unnecessarily stifle the NCA's capacity to match the resources of the highly organised crime groups that it is pursuing. I placed stress on the word `unnecessarily' for good reason: the committee is well aware that it cannot be assumed that new technologies of crime control will necessarily be used responsibly by law enforcement agencies. In particular, the committee was mindful that some of the emerging technologies, particularly in the field of electronic surveillance, carry downside risks, not least from human rights and privacy perspectives.
The committee's report is in three distinct parts. These can be conveniently styled as examining the new technology issue in the following hierarchy: policing within Australia, policing across national borders and the global policing debate. Taking the latter two aspects first, it was clear to the committee that considerable attention is being paid around the globe, at the national level and at multilateral forums, to the borderless nature of the Internet. Electronic commerce is rapidly becoming an entrenched part of normal commercial operations and, not unexpectedly, whole new techniques of what is termed `e-crime', or `cybercrime', have developed. 
The committee found that the global law enforcement community has made a start in debating how best the e-crime threat should be addressed. While it applauds such endeavours, the committee is not so naive as to suggest that international agreement is just around the corner, if the precedent of tax havens is any guide. The committee found that Australia is actively involved in these debates and, while its contribution is clearly respected, it seems likely that the big players of Europe and America will determine the policy parameters which smaller countries such as Australia will be expected to follow.
It is a different story with the use of technologies by law enforcement agencies within Australia. While the operations of agencies such as CrimTrac and the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence suggest that meaningful cooperation can be achieved within our federal system, it was with some disappointment that the committee found that Australian policing, and the NCA in particular, is hamstrung by an inability by Australian governments to agree to a nationally consistent approach to multijurisdictional investigations. The criminals will, of course, exploit any such loopholes to their advantage.
I commend the report to the House. In conclusion, I would like to add a personal vote of thanks to my colleagues on the committee for their contribution to this important inquiry and to the staff of the committee's secretariat, Mick McLean and Barbara Allen, for their invaluable assistance.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—I move:
That this House notes:
(1)		14 June 2001 marked the sixtieth anniversary of the start of the Soviet Union's mass deportations of Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians from their homes, to Siberia and other foreign destinations;
(2)		during the night of 13 to 14 June 1941, thousands of Baltic residents of all ages were arrested by armed men, taken to railway stations, loaded into cattle-wagons and deported, and these mass deportations continued, on and off, until 1953;
(3)		precise numbers of the Baltic deportees are difficult to determine, with conservative evidence showing that all together, over half a million local residents of all ethnic origins were deported from the three Baltic States by 1953;
(4)		these innocent people had committed no offences, were arrested and imprisoned as “political prisoners” and as “enemies of the people” and less than half survived deportation;
(5)		Baltic immigrants to Australia have contributed significantly to our country, its culture and its diversity; and
(6)		the sad events that are solemnly commemorated on 14 June by Baltic people across Australia, and across the world, stand in stark contrast to the robust democracy that all Australians enjoy and that we commemorate in this, our Centenary of Federation Year.
This motion is important for several reasons. First of all, it is a side of Australian history which most Australians would be dimly aware of but would be unaware of the exact details, the question being put: how did the Baltic communities arrive in Australia? Secondly, it is important because it goes back to the very first days of Australia's policy with regard to refugees. When looking back at that period, I do not think it is drawing too long a bow to say that the support within the Australian community for accepting refugees goes back to the forties and fifties when Australia accepted refugees from Eastern Europe.
It is worth going back to that period and finding that, under Arthur Calwell, we did accept refugees but we also retained control over the selection of who came and control over the numbers. I feel that, in part, is responsible for the current debate we are having about illegal immigrants in detention centres: there is, in the minds of some in the community, confusion about those who are illegal immigrants as opposed to refugees. People just do not accept that someone can go through two review tribunals and two different levels of appellate court and still not be found to be a refugee; they still think that they are refugees.
The census statistics from 1996 show that there are 2,830 Estonian-born Australians, 8,023 Latvian-born Australians and 4,223 Lithuanian-born Australians. On average, they are about 70 years of age. That fact reflects that many of them would have come out to Australia when they were in their 20s or younger. Relative to their proportion, the Baltic communities have produced four times as many graduates as has the Australian population. They include many famous Australians. Sir Arvi Parbo, the former chairman of Western Mining Corporation, came out from Estonia in his 20s. He arrived in Australia in 1949 from a displaced persons camp in Germany. He graduated from the University of Adelaide with a first class honours degree in engineering. Professor Janis Priedkalns came from Latvia. He graduated from the University of Sydney in veterinary science. He was actually my professor of anatomy at the University of Adelaide. Bruno Krumins, the former head of the Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs Council in South Australia and currently the Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia, also came from Latvia. Teisutis Zikaras is from Lithuania, a famous sculptor whose sculptures can be seen around Melbourne and Sydney. 
The motion reflects the suffering that the Baltic states experienced under the communists. They also suffered under the Nazi occupation. When the Red Army retook the Baltic States at the close of the war, many Estonian and Latvians fled to Sweden or to Germany. After World War II, many of these refugees included professional and educated people. In 1947, Australia agreed to accept 12,000 to 20,000 displaced persons but did insist on the right to select the migrants. The first ship of 843 migrants from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania arrived in Fremantle on 28 November 1947. They were accommodated in a former military camp at Bonegilla, near Wodonga, and did two years labour at the government's direction. Why did they do that? They did it to be free. It is worth reflecting now, 50 years on, that some of this echoes our current experiences as well.
This motion is about crimes committed against humanity, crimes that were committed in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by the communists and also by the Nazis. When negotiations between the Western states and the Soviet Union broke down in 1939, the communists sought an agreement with the Nazis. Hitler and Stalin agreed on a nonaggression treaty and a secret additional protocol. The secret protocol divided Finland, the Baltic States and Poland between Germany and the Soviets. From September 1939, Stalin forced the Baltic governments to accept pacts of mutual assistance. The pacts involved Soviet forces on sovereign soil. The pacts emphasised the independence of the Baltic States. A month later, the Russian communists attacked Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and installed puppet governments. This was the start of their cruel and barbaric regimes.
What followed was a travesty. Elections were held with the results announced before polls were closed. The new governments applied for admission to the Soviet Union. On 21 July 1940, all three capitals' parliaments were placed under heavy Soviet military guard. The parliaments adopted a Soviet style constitution and requested to join the Soviet Union. At the end of 1940, arrests and deportations numbered about 200 to 300 per month. The great wave of deportation came on 13 and 14 June 1941, barely a week before the German invasion. Anti-Soviet elements were sent to Soviet camps. This included members of non-communist parties, persons expelled from the communist organisation, police officers, members of the military, high government officials and capitalists.
About 38,000 people were deported within 24 hours from the three Baltic states. Families were separated, and it often took days before transport on the boxcars and cattle trucks to Siberian camps began. The transport often lasted a month. Most infants, the sick and the elderly died during the transport to the Soviet gulag. The survival rate for those deported was 39 per cent. A considerable number returned from Siberia after Stalin's death, but many were shot by the secret police, the NKVD, either immediately after arrest or as the Germans advanced. The discovery of the bodies, many with torture marks, was made in 1941. The mass deportations were carried out by the Blue Caps of the NKVD, described so well by Solzhenitsyn in Gulag Archipelago. Armed NKVD, militia and communist party cadres raided towns, flats and farms. I quote here a description of what would happen: `A knock on the door, a harsh command: “Police here”; reading of warrants of deportation.' Then families were given half an hour to an hour to pack their belongings and leave their homes.
This occurred just before the German invasion of 27 June 1941. It is hard to be precise as to the exact numbers. The President of Latvia recently talked of tens of thousands. I think it is easier if we talk about the order of magnitude. Certainly when the Germans arrived in the Baltic states there were 11,000 names in Estonia, 16,000 names in Latvia and 21,000 names in Lithuania which had been prepared for the deportations. Some, rather than being deported, were murdered by the secret police—it is estimated the numbers were some 2,185 in Estonia, 1,355 in Latvia and 1,400 in Lithuania. Overall, the estimated total number executed, deported and conscripted during 1940-41 is 124,467. As I have said, the President of Latvia said in a speech that tens of thousands of Latvian citizens died, including 3,000 Jews. 
So the real experience of the Soviet regime was one of violence, restriction of democratic freedoms and brutality against class enemies. All three republics were depopulated during and after World War II. An accurate assessment of the numbers is difficult. Preliminary estimates are that the three Baltic states lost about 20 per cent of their populations from executions, killings in war, deaths in Siberia and flights to the West under Soviet, German and then Soviet rule. The postwar years were also a time of enormous population loss, more deportations, executions and guerrilla warfare. It is also difficult to determine the total numbers incarcerated and sent to gulags during the entire course of Soviet occupations or sent to administrative settlements in distant parts of the Soviet Union. An estimate for the number of Latvians mass deported in 1949 is 43,000. Well over 10 per cent—200,000—of the pre-war population of Latvia were victims of Soviet repression, which included the gulag camps, forced resettlement and other forms of political persecution.
I am moving this motion because the people who came here as refugees and displaced persons from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have made a terrific contribution to the Australian community. The history of these states is a sad one. They are now independent countries, and have been for 10 years, but the people who came from those countries to Australia were seeking freedom. Australia has a tremendous tradition as one of the longest continuous democracies in the world, a country which can trace uninterrupted self-government back to the 1840s and 1850s. I welcome the contribution that the Baltic communities have made to Australia. As I have said, their numbers are small, but their contribution has been immense.

"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—Laba diena ponas Kalbeti! As esu linksmas kad mano familia turi lietuviska istorija! Good day, Mr Deputy Speaker! I am happy that my family has a Lithuanian history and background! That is what I just said in my poor Lithuanian. I would like to thank the member for Boothby for raising this issue, which is one we also spoke on on 24 November 1997. The wonderful thing about this great country of ours is the way that multiculturalism has affected so many of our families. Like so many in this place, I was brought up as an Anglo-Saxon youngster, brainwashed into believing that our sanitised view of history was the one and only point of view. Attending school in the forties and fifties, watching newsreels at the Saturday matinee, my life as a youngster was scripted along the lines of `the good versus the bad'.
It was not until the 1950s, when I was living in Port Augusta and attending the local high school, that I first came across kids from families from the first wave of Europeans escaping the many war-torn countries, the names of which we studied religiously in our geography lessons. I well remember learning the names and the order of the Baltic states from top to bottom: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. But it was not until 1974 that part of all this actually had some meaning for me. I happened to meet a young Lithuanian lass and subsequently married her and was invited up to Sydney in 1974. About that time, the Labor Party was in power and Gough Whitlam made a decision which I thought was rather stupid at the time and which had an enormous impact on those from the Baltic countries. That was Labor's recognition of the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states. I can remember listening to the discussions and I could understand a few words, because when you become enmeshed in another civilisation you realise that you need to learn some words and phrases so that you can take part in discussions.
The history of these countries is fascinating reading. I had the pleasure in 1994 of spending three days in Estonia, three days in Latvia and three days in Lithuania. That was when the Russians had finally left after 50 years, and I was able to walk in these countries and see parts of them, along with Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians who were also seeing for the first time huge expanses of their countries. They had never seen these areas before because they had been locked away in military bases. The estimates were that there were well over 400 military bases in each of these countries. The lakes, mountains and strategic areas of their countries had been locked away since 1944. I saw the tears in the people's eyes and experienced with them the joys of freedom and democracy. 
In Lithuania I went to the Hill of Crosses, a place I think every person in the world should go and see. It is a hill where literally millions of crucifixes were planted and, despite numerous instances of Russians coming in and taking the whole lot away, the next morning they would be back there again, day in and day out, year in and year out. It is an absolutely amazing place to see the faith of the Lithuanian Catholics. I went to the television station at Vilnius and saw 12 or 13 crosses in memory of young people who had lain down in front of Soviet tanks to try to delay the Soviet occupation of that television station when, in the early 1990s, Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union.
I went to those countries and realised that they had a life-and-death choice. To talk to my mother-in-law and her family, they had a choice—pro-Soviet or pro-German. There was no other choice; you had to choose one or the other. With the annexation of the Baltic states in the Hitler and Stalin pact, if you were pro-German, you disappeared into Russia. When Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, if you were pro-Soviet, you disappeared into Germany. If you managed to survive those two, when the Russians came back in again and you were pro-German, you either had to flee into Germany or you were captured and taken into the gulags in the Soviet Union. It was a life-and-death choice. For us, in our sanitised version of the 1940s, as I was growing up and watching television, it all seemed very simplistic. We supported Stalin and we were against Hitler. The Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians—they are wonderful people—faced a dilemma that most of us will never experience, thank God. As the honourable member for Boothby said, they are small in number but they have contributed amazingly to our culture, our way of life and our environment. In 1997, I spoke of Olegas Truchanas, the wonderful environmentalist. He was probably the first environmentalist in Australia. The fact that the south-west of Tasmania is a world heritage area is a tribute to his photos and endeavours back in the sixties and seventies. As for mining, the honourable member for Boothby mentioned Sir Arvi Parbo.
As the member for Boothby said, it is a part of history that most of us never seem to get involved in unless, as part of our electoral life, we are invited to a Lithuanian, Estonian or Latvian festival. As I have said, I was privileged to go on a delegation to those countries. As you probably realise, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I can understand more Lithuanian than I can speak. I have mentioned in another place that one thing that worries me is that my wife speaks fluent Lithuanian. When we go around to the mother-in-law's place here in Canberra, nothing but Lithuanian is spoken, and I am expected to try and understand it. The shame is that my two daughters, Sarah and Hannah, can understand Lithuanian, but the links are being broken. The third generation do not take up the language, and that is a disappointment to me. Bearing in mind our multiculturalism, very few third-generation children from mixed marriages, in the best sense of the word, are carrying on this heritage. Membership of the Lithuanian clubs in Sydney and Canberra is declining. My mother-in-law came out with her husband and her family in 1949. She is approaching her 80th year. She is lucky to have been back to Lithuania a couple of times, but the links are being broken. Opportunities to bring out her family are diminishing. Her grand-nieces and grand-nephews find it difficult to come out to Australia, for a variety of reasons.
In summary, I thank the honourable member for Boothby for raising this issue. Sixty years is a long time. All that happened two weeks before my birth. I was born on 28 June; it happened on 13 and 14 June. As a member of a Lithuanian family here in Australia and also with a Lithuanian family back in Lithuania, I look forward to going back again. It is a beautiful country with a wonderful language and an amazing history. It was a very powerful country until the Polish people intermarried with the Lithuanians, Catholicism came in, and the place was put into turmoil. One disadvantage of being an Estonian, Latvian or a Lithuanian is that you are squeezed between two great power blocs: the Russians on one side and the Germans on the other. It is a bit like the people in the Middle East: if you are between the Assyrians and the Egyptians, wave after wave, one way or the other, comes through. I urge all members of this place to read the history of those wonderful countries and to delve into what happened in 1941, but to see both sides—the Russian and the German sides—because both were as bad as each other. Last year, I visited Auschwitz, the concentration camps and all that that entails. It is part of history, not of our country, but of the world, and we should be well aware of it.

"Pearce, Christopher, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—I rise today to speak to this motion due to its relevance to the Aston electorate. The motion outlines the fact that 14 June 2001 marked the 60th anniversary of the start of the mass deportation of the Baltic peoples from their homes to Siberia and other foreign destinations. It was during June 1941 that many thousands of Baltic residents from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were removed under duress and taken to various locations in readiness for deportation. Whilst the precise number of Baltic people affected by this action is unclear, I learnt through my research on this matter in a publication titled The Baltic Dilemma by Edgars Dunsdorfs that it is estimated that, on a single night, over 25,000 people from both Estonia and Latvia were removed, with the number of people from Lithuania not known.
I referred to the relevance of this matter to the electorate of Aston. In fact, two major local government areas, the City of Knox and the City of Whitehorse, both of which fall within the Aston electorate, represent respectively the second and third highest proportion of Latvians living in Victoria. In the case of the City of Knox, we have the Latvian Retirement Village situated right in the heart of Aston in Wantirna South. It is my understanding that this village is the only Latvian retirement village in Australia which provides retired Latvians with a safe and secure place to live. Over the years, and in particular as my role as a councillor in the City of Knox, I have visited this facility and I have had the pleasure of meeting several of the residents who are most active in our local community.
The motion talks about how the Baltic immigrants to Australia have contributed significantly to our country in terms of our culture and diversity. I could not agree more with this point. In November 1947, the first of the Baltic peoples arrived in Australia. Since that time, these people have become an integral part of the Australian community and have played a very important part in our postwar development. As an example, as the honourable members for Franklin and Boothby highlighted, Aston is proud to have as one of its residents Sir Arvi Parbo. Sir Arvi was born in Estonia in 1926 and settled in Australia in 1949, having come from a displaced persons camp in Germany at the age of 23. Across the last 52 years, Sir Arvi has made an outstanding contribution to the cultural and business community in this country. He has risen to hold some of the highest levels of office in many of Australia's largest corporate organisations, including being chairman of Western Mining Corporation Ltd.
Combined with his great contribution to the business world, Sir Arvi has contributed in a very significant way in supporting many charity and community groups throughout the years. For example, he is currently patron of the Strathdon Community Redevelopment Fundraising Committee which is raising funds for this great retirement village and nursing home which is again located in my electorate of Aston. Whilst I have referred to Sir Arvi as a well-known example, a great many other people from the Baltic nations who have come to join us here in Australia have contributed in many diverse areas over the years, including working in hospitals, the building industry and the agricultural and transport industries. There is no doubt that the peoples of the Baltic nations have indeed contributed much to Australia's maturity and, as I understand that there are members of the Baltic community in the House today, I want to thank them and their fellow peoples for everything that they have done. I commend this motion to the House. ",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Baltic Deportees</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—I am pleased to second this motion moved by Dr Southcott and also supported by the members for Franklin and Aston. I consider it an honour to speak in the memory of the Baltic victims of Stalin. The murders of thousands of people under that other form of totalitarianism, Nazism, is well known. There was a very moving program about that on SBS recently prepared by the family of another very successful immigrant to Australia, Mr Sherman of Equitilink, whose very ancient uncle Chatzchiel still lives in Lithuania, only surviving because of his skill as a lexicographer.
This is a remarkable year for a number of anniversaries. While we are very aware of those anniversaries that affect us as Australians directly, such as the Centenary of Federation and the 50th anniversary of the ANZUS Treaty, there are many other major anniversaries of significant historical events of which we are completely oblivious. One such anniversary is the 60th anniversary of the round-up, deportation and, in many cases, deaths of some two million women and children in 1941 from the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia at the hands of Stalin's goons, then in league with Nazi Germany. 
As the member for Boothby outlined, in the secret clause of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, the generalissimo of the Soviet Union, Stalin, showed he was determined to get control of the three Baltic states. For almost half a century, it could be said that the history and suffering of the people in these countries somehow slipped down the democratic world's memory hole. For most of the time, small groups of anti-communists who referred to their homelands as captive nations were regularly mocked and generally dismissed as quaint defenders of a lost cause. This was especially the case among some members of the Left both in Australia and in the Western world. This is a sad fact. People like me in the opposition honestly believe that it is never too late to say sorry for a profound injustice. I believe that it is proper for those who denigrated our fellow citizens from the Baltic nations to acknowledge that injustice. It was very moving to hear the personal experience of my colleague the member for Franklin about his involvement with the Baltic communities through his family, and his heartfelt comments about his experiences of being there as they were liberated as communism disintegrated.
The subjugation of the people of the three captured Baltic states was close to Stalin's heart. He took personal interest in seizing the Baltic republics. It is notable that when the British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, was there at the height of the Soviet leader's weakness in December 1941, he even pressed the British leader then. The people of these Baltic states were part of the Russian Empire from the 1700s to 1919, but they had little in common with Russia either in language or history. Estonia and Latvia are principally Lutheran and Lithuania principally Catholic. Like most cities of the Baltic, Riga was founded by German merchants in the 12th century. From 1919 to the beginning of World War II, these states enjoyed a brief interlude of independence and democracy. From 1939, Stalin instigated one subterfuge after another and extended Soviet control. With the defeat of Finland and the signing of the Nazi-Soviet pact, Stalin accused the Baltic states of being pro-Allied. From June 1940 he moved in Soviet troops in stages and under threats. Then in June 1941, the mass deportations to Siberia began and the horrors multiplied.
The persecution of the Baltic people by Stalin and his NKVD ought to be remembered. One of my most moving experiences was to meet the great sovietologist Robert Conquest, who also wrote about the Ukrainian terror and famine of the early 1930s. He wrote a masterful book, The Harvest of Sorrow. We should know about the victims of the deportations from the Baltic countries 60 years ago, just as we know about the Ukrainian terror. Our fellow citizens who came to Australia and whose families came to Australia from the horrors of Stalinist captivity to freedom in this great country deserve our understanding and respect.

"Kernot, Cheryl, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—Some months ago I came into contact with the members of the Hercules Road State School P&C Association that is based in the electorate of Petrie. They told me that they had given a petition to their local member, Ms Teresa Gambaro. She said that the petition could not be tabled in parliament because of its format. I asked them to give me a copy of it and that I would seek to have it tabled on their behalf—they say in the hope that it can be used and was not a waste of time. The petition, signed by 141 people, is concerned with the school funding legislation being considered by the federal government. It says:
We call for the federal government to provide a fair and equitable distribution of Commonwealth funding and to withdraw the proposed state grants bill 2000 legislation. We believe that it is the primary role of governments to provide the highest quality public education system. This will only happen if public education receives a fair and equitable share of federal government funds. We believe that the proposed federal legislation will severely disadvantage public education and will increase education inequities. In 2003 state schools will receive 35 per cent and private school 65 per cent of federal funding. We believe this gives private schools massive funding increases at the expense of state schools.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is it not the case that the tax audit of the Queensland Liberal Party which you have requested will not be able to examine the following matters: whether your ministers misled the parliament; whether the Treasurer failed in his duty to alert the Australian Taxation Office to this GST scam; whether Minister Macfarlane failed in his duty to do the same or to act to shut down the GST scam; whether any Liberal Party officers, federal or state, have acted improperly or possibly unlawfully in advising on and arranging the GST scam; and whether this GST scam arrangement has spread beyond Queensland to other Liberal state divisions?
—The Leader of the Opposition will come to his question.
—Is it not also a fact that the outcome of this audit will become public only if the Queensland Liberal Party allows it? Prime Minister, will you undertake to ensure that your referral of this matter to the tax office will not inhibit full parliamentary scrutiny of the conduct of your ministers and officials?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Queensland Liberal Party: Tax Audit</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—It is open to the parliament to question and scrutinise the conduct of any minister; that is the role of parliament. I want to make it clear that my referring this matter to the tax office was not designed in any way to prevent questions being asked of me, questions being asked of the Minister for Small Business or questions being asked of the Treasurer. I want to assure the Leader of the Opposition that in no way is this some device to close down discussion on this issue; rather it is an earnest of our desire to get to the bottom of this matter if there is anything untoward. It is our belief that the audit is a very good thing. It is our belief that the audit will enable the tax office to examine all of the activities of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party since the commencement of the GST legislation on 1 July.  
I take the view that branches of all political parties must comply with the GST legislation, and I would invite the Leader of the Opposition to allow an audit of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party. I ask the Leader of the Opposition: why don't you put Bracks in the dock? Why don't you allow a tax audit? Bear in mind that this question was asked of me by a man who last week deliberately misled the Australian people about the hospital system in Western Australia. This is a man who is up on his hind legs attacking the reputation of my minister, when he himself quite deliberately and shamelessly misled the Australian people last week.
The tax audit has been requested by me as an earnest of my willingness to have every aspect of the GST tax affairs of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party examined. I have nothing to hide. The division tells me it has nothing to hide. The tax audit will be conducted.
—That is why you ordered an audit.
—I have called the audit. They can interject as much as they like. We have called the audit. He refuses to have an audit of Bracks.
—No wonder!
—No wonder, indeed, as the Treasurer interjects. If you are really so interested in transparency, why don't you have an audit of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party? May I make one other point, Mr Speaker? I was asked yesterday, by one of the media outlets through my press secretary, whether I would make the results of the audit by the tax office available. My response was that that would be a matter for the tax office and the Queensland branch.
Opposition members interjecting—
—Don't get too excited: I know you think you are on the verge of something big here, but I would not get too excited.

—My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and follows the answer that he gave to my last one. In the light of your reference to an ALP fundraising function, isn't it a fact that your fifth anniversary function held in March this year in Melbourne had a split charge of $200 for the dinner and $800 for the donation? Has the Liberal Party instructed its divisions to cease these practices, as we have instructed ours? In view of your call yesterday for this practice to be investigated, will you be forwarding the tax details of your fifth anniversary dinner to the tax office?

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—First of all, by way of indulgence, could I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his expression of support for the action that the government has taken regarding the motor vessel Tampa. I express the hope that the opposition will now withdraw its objections to legislation in the Senate so that we can send yet a further signal—a very clear signal—to those who would seek to trample on our sovereign right in this area that that is not acceptable to either side of Australian politics.
In relation to the function, I do remember that function. It was a magnificent celebration of five years of coalition government. Of course I do not know the arrangements but, Mr Speaker, I will tell you what I will do: I will do a deal.
Opposition members interjecting—
—The same courtesy as should fundamentally have been extended to the Leader of the Opposition obviously belongs to the Prime Minister.
—I will do a deal with the Leader of the Opposition.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—by leave—I move:
That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition from moving forthwith—
That this House censures the Minister for Small Business for:
(1)	misleading the House generally on Thursday 23 August with inaccurate and deceptive answers regarding his knowledge of, and involvement in, the Queensland Liberal Party GST scam;
(2)	misleading the House, in particular on Thursday 23 August, with regard to when he first became aware of this GST scam and what he did about it;
(3)	not correcting the record at the first available opportunity as required by the minimum standards contained even in the Prime Minister's discredited Ministerial Code of Conduct;
(4)	not acting in accordance with his duties and responsibilities as a Member of Parliament and a Minister when first advised of this scam in December last year—and instead participating in the cover-up of this GST scam; and
(5)	not imposing on the tax affairs of the Queensland Liberal Party the same rigorous scrutiny which he and his government are demanding of Australia's small businesses, which he is charged to represent in the government.
The charges are threefold today against this minister: one, that he has misled the parliament; two, that he has failed to act when information was drawn to his attention; and three, that he is prepared to condone double standards.
The double standards so far as the business community is concerned are these: we have a simple new tax system—everyone else pays it except the Liberal Party. The simple new tax system is that everyone pays it except the Liberal Party. The second bit is that the minister himself will not help small business but he will help himself. He will be involved in a scam for his own FEC fundraising that is not available to small businesses around the country. This minister goes around the country saying, `The GST will close down the black economy,' but not within the Liberal Party. In fact, he is complicit in not only understanding and condoning but also covering up the growth of a black economy in his own party. That is what this government stands accused of in terms of its double standards.
But let us go to the question of the `nothing untoward', which was supposed to be his great defence today. He would not even table the document, having read from it copiously, but we think we have got the gist of it. There is only one bit of new evidence that appears in it, and that is some subsequent advice that came from Mr Jaeschke. I will come to that in a minute.
On the issue of misleading, the minister said last Thursday in the parliament that he was not aware of anything untoward in relation to the affairs of the Groom FEC. This is despite the fact that he was rung on 18 December by his branch treasurer, who told him of her concerns. Didn't you think there was something untoward then, Minister? The very next day, the minister attended a meeting—it was held at his home—where the issue was discussed and approved. Didn't you think, Minister—from the discussions at that meeting—that there was something untoward that required you to do something? The minister attended another meeting on 20 March where the matter was again discussed. He told us in the parliament today that he knew of the scam arrangements whereby a cheque to the caterer for the Costello function was repaid so that head office could claim the GST input tax credits. He was aware that his own fundraiser was going to be better off to the tune of $826. Didn't you think, Minister, that there was something untoward about a nice little arrangement that said to the Groom FEC, `You cannot claim the input tax credits'—which is effectively what you have done—`unless you pay the GST'? There is something untoward about that, Minister. 
The minister was also aware of accounting advice, because he referred to it in his statement today, that said that the scam contravened the tax act. There is no point hiding behind his explanation about what internal auditors might have done. The FEC sought and paid for accounting advice. This was so serious that the FEC had to pay something like $250 for the accounting advice. This was no small item of expenditure—it was almost a third of what the rort was supposed to be producing by way of a benefit for the FEC. But the executive were so concerned that they actually commissioned accounting advice. They thought it was untoward. They were trying to get you to focus on it, Minister, but you told the House that, from all of the information available to you, you thought that there was nothing untoward. 
You also knew that Mrs Watts was so incensed that your own party was taking her concerns seriously that she resigned. Don't you think that shows that she thought there was something untoward? It is true that not every one of us who is a member of a branch is expected to know the fine details of all the accounts. But I will tell you what: everyone on our side would know if their treasurer had resigned in protest about your inaction; and that is what she did. Don't tell me that you had no understanding of what the problem was and that you did not think there was anything untoward. But that is what you told the parliament: you had no knowledge of anything untoward in relation to it. 
You have admitted that you knew that this same person, Mrs Watts, wrote to the federal Treasurer and that the matter was taken up with you. You have since admitted that. A person not only resigned but also wrote to the Treasurer, and the Treasurer's office raised the matter with you—and you still do not think there is anything untoward? This beggars belief, Minister. That is why you have misled the House. What you have been involved in is a complete understanding not only of the scam but also of concerns within your party about the scam. We read in one of the newspapers on the weekend that you said you thought this issue would go away because some journalist had raised it with you but had indicated they were not going to pursue it. So concerned are you for probity and responsibility in discharging your duties that your attitude is: if it doesn't get out in the media, we can cover it up. The problem for you is that there are decent members of your branch, and these are no Johnny-come-latelies; these are people who have been members of your branch for many years. One of them has been a member for 52 years—and it is no small matter when someone resigns after 52 years. That person's wife, who is the treasurer of the branch, resigned because you would not do anything. You go around the country saying, `The GST is a simple new tax;' you go around the country saying that it is going to close off the black economy; you go around the country saying, `If you have any examples of people rorting it, let me know and I will follow them up.' And yet you do nothing. 
You also knew, Minister—to add to this `no knowledge of anything untoward'—that the matter had been referred to the federal secretary of the Liberal Party. We know that because the minutes of February tell us that Mr Jaeschke was claiming to rely on advice from the federal secretariat. But when it was pointed out to him that the accountants' advice directly contradicted the advice he said he was relying on, including from the federal secretariat, he found a convenient excuse to leave the meeting very quickly, so embarrassed was he by the advice that your branch had commissioned and paid for. That is why you have misled the House, Minister. There is a litany of evidence now, including from your own mouth, that shows that you had full knowledge of this. You cannot come into this place and say that you cannot be expected to be across the technical details and that that absolves you. You knew of the scam, you condoned the scam, you failed to act when the scam was drawn to your attention, and then you hoped that you could cover it up. It is on those grounds that you should be sacked: you misled this parliament last Thursday when you said you knew nothing about it. 
The second issue goes to the failure to act, and this is terribly important in this case. We have a minister and a Treasurer saying by way of taunt to us, `If the member for Hotham has any advice, let him come forward and I can guarantee that we'll follow it up.' But the Treasurer has not only information coming through their member of parliament who is a member of the ministry but also direct advice from the person in question—the person who resigned—advising the Treasurer, `Something is wrong here.' She did the right thing in response to the Treasurer's call to arms, so to speak. We know how the Treasurer likes to get up from time to time in this place and say that he is against tax rorters. Well, he might be against tax rorters, but he is not against tax rorters in the Liberal Party—not the Treasurer. This is a Treasurer who has one rule for the Liberal Party and one rule for everyone else. That is what is so dishonest about this whole exercise, apart from the misleading.
The other claim that the minister makes—a claim he continued to repeat over the weekend—and for which he needs to be censured, is that everything was done by the Groom FEC in accordance with advice from the Brisbane branch. That is correct, is it not, Minister? Isn't that your assertion—that everything was done in accordance with advice from the Brisbane branch of the FEC? The trouble is that on 14 June 2000 a letter was sent from Mr Jaeschke, the director of the Liberal Party in Queensland, who now happens to be the director in South Australia. I notice that the Prime Minister's little inquiry into the Queensland branch does not extend to where Mr Jaeschke has now taken up camp, which it should if he has been into this rort and this scam in relation to not only Groom but also, as we understand it, other electorates. Despite the fact that the federal director of the Liberal Party as recently as Friday said that this was a one-off for Groom, the minutes do not say that, and no doubt the Prime Minister has now found out that it is more widespread. But we will have the opportunity to pursue that at another stage in this parliament. 
But why would the Prime Minister order an investigation when the director of the Liberal Party was saying as recently as Friday and, as I understand it, Saturday, that this was a one-off? It is not one-off, as far as we are aware. I tell you who has to come clean: the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party. Do not come in here with diversions about what else needs to be made available. They should come clean on the information that they have been advising their branches. Let the Queensland branch be put on display in terms of all of its records and, while we are at it, let us try to find out what is going on in the South Australian branch, where the perpetrator of this scheme, on the face of things, is now in residence. The memo of 14 June from Mr Jaeschke says:
Branches will not be required to charge the GST. Conversely, there will be no opportunity for them to claim back the GST.
It is absolutely clear-cut. But we are talking about not only the memo of 14 June but also what the legislation itself explained when the tax system was brought in. I refer to the explanatory memorandum which was introduced by the Treasurer. Paragraph 3.15 of that document says:
If a non-profit sub-entity with an annual turnover below the turnover threshold decides not to register—
that is, the Groom FEC—
it will not be liable for GST and will not be able to claim input tax credits.
It is absolutely clear, and that is what Mr Jaeschke's announcement states. The explanatory memorandum goes on to say:
Equally, the core entity—
that is, the Liberal Party Queensland division—
will not be liable for the GST and will not be entitled to claim the input tax credits of the unregistered non-profit sub-entity.
That is what the explanatory memorandum says. There is no confusion or misunderstanding about this. We had the Prime Minister, the director of the Liberal Party, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation and the Minister for Defence on TV saying that this was a misunderstanding. There is no misunderstanding—it is clear-cut.  
So when the Treasurer comes into this place in future and says to small businesses around the country, `The legislation is clear. The detail is clear. It is spelt out. There can be no misunderstanding,' he has to explain how he expects small businesses to understand it if he and his people cannot understand it. This is not just a rort, a mislead and a set of double standards; this exposes the complexity of this tax system. It is only the smarties who will get their way around it. Only people who are looking for the rorts will get around this. And we are exposing them in the Liberal Party through this exercise. 
When the Minister for Small Business gets up to speak there is something I want to know. We know that the advice sent out by Mr Jaeschke on 14 June 2000—not this year, but last year—said, `You can't do it.' Whatever the scheme is that has been whipped up, the formal advice to Liberal Party branches was, `You can't do it.' What I want to know from the minister is what additional advice they got that said that they could do it—because that is his defence. The minister's defence was that everything done by his FEC which he was aware of was done in accordance with advice from the federal Liberal Party in Queensland. We know what that advice was—it is in the memo dated 14 June 2000.
So, Minister, the challenge to you, amongst others, today is to tell us what additional advice there was. You have referred to verbal advice from Mr Stewart in advance of your discussions with Mrs Watts. I think that is the only new piece of information that has actually appeared in what I understand the minister's statement to be today. The minister has to tell us what that advice is and where it is written down and he has to produce it. If his defence is that he is relying on the advice of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party, then he has to table that advice. So far the only advice that the Liberal Party in Queensland has given is what we have tabled, what we have brought out in the open.
The other point that is terribly important in this is that the minister will try and say that the GST was paid. We know that $751.29 was paid. They are trying to claim that this was only a $75 shortfall. The problem for the minister is that the legislation says you cannot claim the input tax credits—and the Liberal Party secretariat on 24 August has admitted it has claimed a GST credit of $826—unless you pay one-eleventh of the total proceeds. You cannot claim one-eleventh of the $9,000 bill unless you have paid one-eleventh of the proceeds of the function, and the proceeds of the function were $18,350. What I want to know, Minister, is: has the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party paid more than $1,600 in GST to the tax office? If it has not, it cannot claim the $826. That is how the tax works.
If you are going to tell small businesses around this country that you have one rule for them and another for yourselves, get up and say it. But on the evidence that we have produced you have been a disgrace in this place, you have ignored advice, you should be censured, but most of all you should resign. If the Prime Minister does not see your resignation, he should have the courage of his convictions to sack you because you have ignored all advice that has come your way, you have tried to pretend it is not a problem and you have covered up—you are caught out and you must go.

"Macfarlane, Ian, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—No minister takes a censure motion in any way but very seriously. In terms of the issues raised— 
—Get off your feet, Costello.
—I noted that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was heard with the sort of courtesy one expects in the parliament, without interruption, and I expect the same sort of courtesy to be offered to the Minister for Small Business.
—He needs a lot of it, because he's got nothing to say.
—The Chief Opposition Whip is warned!
—I am not sure where I was up to due to the series of interjections, but let me just go back to the start. The shadow Treasurer has made a number of assertions in this House in regard to what I have said and done. He made an assertion that I have been going around the country saying that this is a simple new tax, or words to that effect. I am repeatedly on the record on a number of occasions saying how much I admire small business for what they have done in participating in the transition to a new tax. Small business know that we need this new tax system which has been put in place; they know that the tax system needs reform. They knew that it was going to be difficult process. 
I have repeatedly acknowledged that it has been a difficult time for small business, but I have thanked and congratulated small business for their participation in taking Australia into a modern era and a modern tax system. I acknowledged that it has been difficult for small business; I acknowledged right from the start of my ministry that some small businesses had greater difficulty with the transition than others. The shadow Treasurer is saying that I went around the country saying to small business that this is a simple new tax. Any transition to a new tax system is always going to take time for people to adjust to. As I said, small business is working through that process. I do not believe that that transition process has finished. Our government has on a number of occasions taken steps to make that transition easier. On 22 February we announced alternatives to the method of submitting a BAS—and the list of implementations of easier processes has gone on.
I note that the shadow Treasurer also is relying heavily on a memo that was issued by Graham Jaeschke, from memory in the middle of June 2000. I addressed this issue in an interview yesterday when I arrived at Canberra airport. From memory it was raised by a group of journalists, some of whom are in the gallery right now. I recall that in my response I said that, yes, the Jaeschke memo of mid-June did exist, that in fact that memo in my opinion had been superseded by a memo signed by Margaret Watts, which I understood was tabled in this House last week. I have not been through those documents—
—What?
—I have not been through those documents for a few days and my memory in the House is—
—You had better be careful, you have misled enough already.
—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will exercise the same courtesies which were extended to him.
—As I said, it is my understanding that this memo was tabled in the House last Thursday. On the off-chance that it was not, I am going to table it. I am happy to table this memo. Unfortunately, Mrs Watts has used such small type that my eyesight is going to let me down if I do not put my glasses on. In this memo to members of the Groom FECE—
Opposition members interjecting—
—Mr Speaker, I am having trouble hearing over the interjections.
—The minister has the call.
—The memo to members of the Groom FECE is entitled `Re: Our financial position with regard to registering for the GST'. Let me again remind the House that this memo is signed `Yours faithfully, Margaret R. Watts, Honourable Treasurer, FEC'. This memo is dated 13 December, and I understand that it was presented to the Groom FEC at the meeting at my house on the day that I was announced a minister. It is dated 13 December 2000. Let me just read a few parts of it. This paragraph states that Graham Jaeschke: 
... has advised me that if we have any accounts over $2,000 that have a GST component, we are to send a cheque to them—
I assume, Mr Speaker, that `them' is Mr Jaeschke—
for the account less the GST and they will pay the whole account and recoup the GST component.
She goes on to say:
There is nothing in writing from him.
—In writing? There is something in writing.
—I was quoting from the memo. The memo says quite clearly that there is nothing in writing from him. Mr Speaker, with your permission, I table the document. Assertions have been made that the GST on the caterers' account has not been paid in full. That is complete nonsense. It concerns me that a man who aspires to be the Treasurer of this country—assuming that is the position they would give him if the Labor Party were to ever win an election—said that the GST to the restaurant was not paid in full. The restaurant issues accounts, as do all businesses, which are inclusive of the GST.
—I did not say that!
—I would have to check the Hansard on that. I can assure this House that the restaurant bill was paid fully inclusive of GST. I have obviously spoken to the proprietor of that restaurant. I have to say as an aside that it is an extraordinarily fine restaurant, that it has spectacular views from Toowoomba of the Brisbane Valley and that it was with pleasure and with pride that the FEC of Toowoomba and I hosted the Peter Costello dinner at that function.
Government members interjecting—
—I do remember that the Treasurer gave a good speech, but on with the issue. The proprietor of that restaurant has assured me that the bill was paid in full, inclusive of GST. In terms of the other issues raised by the shadow Treasurer, I have quoted extensively from a document today—
—She said it was cheating!
—I warn the Deputy Leader of the Opposition!
—If `she' is Heather Gardner, the proprietor of Picnic Point, I am not aware of that comment. There are a lot of things said in this House whose origins I am not aware of. Earlier today, in answer to a question, I quoted extensively from a document that outlines the sequence of events relating to this matter. I said that my attention had since been drawn to minutes of a meeting of the FEC on 21 November, a copy of which I did table. In those minutes it was noted:
The Chairperson notified the Treasurer—
that is, Mrs Watts—
that C. Galtos and G. Jaeschke—
the state president and state director—
request that tax invoices for the dinner be forwarded to them.
As I tabled that during the answer to an earlier question, obviously it supersedes the memo to which the shadow Treasurer referred and, as I say, I earlier submitted a document signed by Mrs Watts which also supersedes even that statement—that is, it is dated later. It is my understanding that David Watts said on the ABC yesterday—and it is certainly my belief—that I did not have an intimate understanding of this process. I was aware that the state office had raised an issue in terms of how accounts over $2,000 were to be handled. That method was first raised with me by Neville Stewart. It was then raised with me by Margaret Watts in a telephone conversation, and it was then raised in an FEC meeting at my house the day after the phone conversation with Mrs Watts. To my understanding, there was a debate, there were arguments put from both sides and the method was adopted after that vote.
As I said in my statement, at that meeting and at the meeting in January the FEC sought further advice on that process, in the initial stage from head office and then from an independent accountancy firm in Toowoomba. The FEC also asked the head office in Brisbane for an explanation in writing of the process. The Groom FEC did that for one reason, as far as I understand it: because of their strong desire to conform with tax law and the requirements of them as an FEC, a not-for-profit organisation. Although I was absent from the January meeting, and from the part of the meeting where this was discussed, I urged them to at all times ensure they met their tax obligations. To the best of my knowledge, and from these requests for letters, they did just that. 
I did not come into parliament to be involved in muckraking. I did not come into parliament to waste hours and hours of time trying to defame people's characters. The Hansard record would show that I do not attack people's character. In the past two sitting days of parliament, we have seen a series of attacks addressed at me and some have been directed at the Treasurer. To the people outside this chamber, and to the people in this gallery, this sort of process makes no sense at all. The taxpayers—which I assume most of these people are—pay for this place to produce good policy, and that is what the government have done. The government have addressed the issue of taxation reform, which we always knew would have a difficult transition. We always knew that. I am grateful that the Prime Minister gave me the opportunity to be part of this ministry to assist in that transition.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—The government certainly addressed an issue of taxation: special treatment for the Liberal Party—one rule for the government and another for struggling small businesses.
—The member for Longman interjects. The member for Longman might get up and tell us what arrangements he had in respect of his own FEC funds. I noticed that the Minister for Small Business read a number of documents with his glasses on, but he certainly turned a blind eye to what has happened with this transaction since 18 December. How sincere can the minister be when he said that he received from the Queensland branch a detailed memorandum with attached official documentation regarding the GST liabilities of non-entities— and I think it is fair to say that the minister acceded that he received that advice—and he then said that that was superseded by a memorandum he received from Margaret Watts, which was a one paragraph citation saying that there was nothing in writing from the Queensland branch regarding these changed arrangements?
That memorandum was dated 13 December. What the minister did not say was when he received that memorandum. I would surmise it was at the 19 December meeting of the FEC. In the meantime, on 18 December he received the phone call from Margaret Watts, saying that she thought this arrangement was cheating. She specifically said, before he saw this document, that she thought that the arrangement was cheating. The minister was asked specifically in question time, and he had a chance to clarify this then, about the `method' he used in his earlier question—a revised method of calculating the GST by the Queensland branch. What was the method? He said it related to instructions about sending in accounts over $2,000, but he did not say what the effect of those instructions was. Surely any halfway competent member of parliament—let alone someone who was to become a minister—would say, `Hold on. This instruction departs from the official advice you gave us earlier, attaching formal documentation.' Of course he knew it was a scam. That will come to how he has misled the parliament big time and offensively. As members of parliament, we should all be offended by his treatment of the fundamental institution of our democracy, which is democracy based on the principle of responsible government. Ministers of the Crown are responsible to the parliament elected by the people. This minister has deliberately misled the parliament, it is an affront to our democratic principles and he should resign. If he does not resign, he should be sacked.
Someone breaking into a house and knocking off a television set does not become any less criminal, any less dishonest, because when they are found out they go and knock on the front door and take it back. That did not even happen here. The advice that the accountant provided—
—You don't understand tax law. 
—The minister says I do not understand it. All right, Minister. Let us have a look at part 165 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act, shall we? It says that the object of the part is to set aside schemes. Minister, this may be something that you might want to listen to when you say that I do not understand it. Division 165-1 says:
The object of this Division is to deter schemes to give entities benefits by reducing GST, increasing refunds or altering the timing of payments of GST or refunds.
You have a couple there, Minister. Surely you would agree with that. Surely you have had altered the timing of the refund and/or the timing of the GST payment. But in terms of comprehending this issue, you have paid $751.29 when the shadow Treasurer has shown that the GST payable on the proceeds of the function—which earned, I understand, about $18,350—was something like $1,600. So that is a pretty handy little procedure for small businesses to follow if they follow your example, isn't it? They pay a portion of the GST in respect of services that they obtain from suppliers—
—The GST was paid.
—You say the GST was paid?
—The minister will not respond, and the member for Barton will address his remarks through the chair.
—The GST was paid at the restaurant to the caterer, Minister, but that transaction was voided. The GST ultimately paid to the caterer does not equate to the GST owed to the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. The taxpayers of the Commonwealth are owed a total of $1,600, less what you paid when were you caught out, $751. Minister, in terms of not understanding the scheme, part 165-80 says that there is a mandatory penalty in respect of these non-payments: The avoider mentioned in section 165-5 must pay the Commonwealth a penalty, which is double what is owed. So the taxpayers are still out of pocket by a considerable amount. And here you are, advising small businesses on how they should comply with the new tax scheme.
In the last quarter of the last financial year, we saw a 177 per cent increase in bankruptcies. All commentators say that that increase was substantially caused by the credit squeeze imposed by the GST. How many of those business bankruptcies could have been avoided, Minister, if these businesses could have done exactly what the Liberal Party did—that is, receive their input tax credit in one quarter and subsequently decide, at their leisure, to pay only a portion of the GST payable to the Australian Taxation Office? How many small businesses would have been able to survive, I ask you, Minister, through the chair? You have clearly one standard for small business, literally battling to stay afloat under the burden of the GST, and you have another standard for yourselves.
The substance of the motion of censure is that the minister has misled the parliament. I noticed that last Thursday he was essentially pleading the fifth—that is, a colloquialism for the fifth amendment of the United States constitution where you plead the right to silence: `I say nothing; you prove your case against me.' He said, for instance, in the substantive motion itself:
They have no proof that the tax system has been defrauded. They have no proof that anyone has cheated the tax system on this particular issue.
No proof in terms of the knowledge that he has? At the meeting of his own FEC on 23 January, one of the members, a Mr Robert Redden, said that `due to the delicate nature of the inquiry' the accountants— that is, the accountants from whom the advice was sought—`are not to keep any records'. Here is a situation where the minister's FEC is voting on a conspiracy and, indeed, conspiring to destroy documents after official advice is sought. This is indeed a conspiracy to defraud the Australian people. The minister has misled the Australian people about his knowledge of that scheme. Again, Minister, it is an affront to all decent members here that you have not resigned already, and you should be sacked. Look at the minister's answers last week:
I am not aware of anything untoward that has been done in the FEC. 
At another time, he said:
There is nothing untoward happening in the books of the FEC.
If there was nothing untoward happening in the books of the FEC, why were they audited up until the date that the FECE treasurer resigned, 23 January? That is an abnormal period. Why were the books of the Queensland branch itself audited up to 31 March? It was because it had hit the fan, and you were trying to cover your tracks.
The facts of the matter are, Minister, that you clearly knew what was going on. You knew on 18 December. You knew on 19 December, when Margaret Watts specifically expressed her disagreement with the scheme proposed and said it was cheating on the government. You knew at the meeting on 20 March, when you chastised Margaret Watts for even raising the issue, about the potential for bringing down the government. But first of all, Minister, it is going to bring down you. It is only a matter of time. Political commentators have said that, if we were not so close to an election, you would have gone by now. You should go, not because we are facing an election but because the Australian people are owed some decency. Our Australian democracy depends on responsible government. Minister, you have most grievously offended that principle, and you should resign.
Among that whole history of transactions, we have a conversation that you had with the Treasurer's office. There was some prevarication in your stance in this regard, but I do not think you are denying that, in or about late February, you had a conversation with the Treasurer's office. I have to say that it beggars belief. If one of my shadow ministry colleagues got their staff member to ring me about a matter such as this, I would be deeply offended. It beggars belief that the Treasurer himself did not pick up the phone to another minister and say, `We've got a problem here, brother. I've got a letter from someone who says that they were the former treasurer of your branch, expressing concern about a tax cheating arrangement.' It beggars belief that that could be the case. The Treasurer himself clearly misled parliament when he said in his answer on this matter:
I have had no discussion with the Minister for Small Business about any scam involving the Groom electorate or any other electorate—none whatsoever.
He said later:
But, if the Groom FEC want any advice from me, my advice to them would be to pay their due and just taxation liabilities. That would certainly be my advice to them if they sought it.
Of course they sought it. He got a letter from Margaret Watts on 20 February. The Treasurer himself has misled parliament. 
In terms of standards, I recall that Gough Whitlam required Jim Cairns, his Treasurer and deputy leader, to resign for misleading parliament. The same standards should be applied to this minister. Other examples include: John Brown was required to resign in 1987; Alexander Downer apologised in 1996 about misleading statements he had made in respect of the DIFF scheme; also in 1996 the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Brian Gibson, resigned from the ministry and apologised for inadvertently misleading parliament—and, Minister, you have deliberately deceived parliament and the people of Australia; in 1997 Senator Amanda Vanstone admitted to inadvertently misleading parliament and apologised; and in 1999 Senator Nick Minchin also admitted to inadvertently misleading parliament and apologised.
Minister, we have no apology from you. We have no apology whatsoever. You are trying to tough it out in circumstances where you clearly knew that a fraud had been perpetrated—a fraud being defined as an unlawful attempt to extract a benefit from the Commonwealth to which you were not entitled. Indeed, as we have indicated, that fraud still has not been rectified. Despite the involvement of the office of the Minister for Small Business and the office of the Treasurer, the fraud still remains, the public are still out of purse because of the fraud and the people who have perpetrated it are still sitting as ministers of the Crown. That is an outrage, and our democracy has been offended by it. It strikes at the heart of the concept of responsible government, where ministers of the Crown are responsible to the people's elected representatives. 
In Great Britain, it constitutes a matter of contempt. In New South Wales, the Privileges Committee specifically required a member to apologise for what had occurred. Minister, you have gone beyond your opportunity to apologise. You had that opportunity before question time today, or at least during question time. You have not even given us the dignity of an apology. Minister, you should resign, and the Treasurer should resign shortly after you, because you have both offended the fundamentals of our democratic principles and you have offended small businesses who are out there struggling to keep afloat. You are basically members of the born to rule class who consider that there is one rule for you and another for struggling small businesses who are suffering under the load of the GST. (Time expired)
—I would remind the member for Barton and members of the House that I chose not to interrupt him, but his latter remarks were in fact anything but directed through the chair.",REPS,<title>MINISTER FOR SMALL BUSINESS</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,7,1,speech
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—To have the member for Barton accusing members on this side of the House of being part of a born to rule brigade when the member for Barton is a third generation hereditary peer of the Labor Party comes very rich indeed. As the member for Barton demonstrated in his rather anxious struggle to fill his 15 minutes of time in this censure motion of the Minister for Small Business, this is a scalp hunt which has run out of puff. The member for Barton may well be a good barrister, but when it comes to parliamentary oratory, he should at the very least take lessons from the three ACTU presidents in his ranks who at least know what it is like to address a meeting and to get a bit of fire into it.
I am very happy to stand here at this dispatch box to defend the member for Groom, the Minister for Small Business. He is a fine minister, he is an honest man and he has the total support of the government and members on this side of the House. The Minister for Small Business has said in this House that he was not aware of anything untoward going on. Yes, of course he was aware of a squabble between some people in his conference about what was and what was not appropriate in reference to the way certain moneys were handled. Yes, he had had a call from a conference treasurer saying that there was an issue; but a call from a conference treasurer does not constitute a problem; it does not constitute a scam. The treasurers of Liberal Party branches are not the general secretaries of trade unions, they are not presidents of the ACTU, and they do not need to threaten members of the Liberal Party in the same way as presidents of the ACTU obviously threaten members on the other side of the House. 
What was the response of the Minister for Small Business? Quite properly he said, `The FEC'—the federal electorate conference—`can sort this matter out. Let the FEC and the divisions sort these things out because it is entirely appropriate that the lay party handle administrative matters of this type.' That is exactly what the member for Groom, the Minister for Small Business, did.
What has really been happening here? This particular organisation had some confusion about who could charge GST and who could claim input tax credits. I wish the Liberal Party were different from every other volunteer organisation in this country, but, as the Minister for Small Business has said, we have had at times a difficult transition from one tax system to another, and branches of the Liberal Party are no different from any other volunteer organisations. They are no different from branches of the Labor Party when it comes to sometimes struggling with changes to the tax system.
The important thing is that these matters were considered, they were dealt with and they were cleared up. There was a misunderstanding and it was fixed, and that is precisely how things should happen. The GST was paid. That is the bedrock of what has happened—the GST was paid. In fact, nothing untoward has happened here. But, even if something untoward had happened here, under the way the Liberal Party works, it is not the responsibility of members of parliament to sort out the administration of their branc-hes. Under the way the Liberal Party works, all financial matters are handled by the lay party. Financial matters are dealt with by conferences or by divisions. 
—The member for Rankin is just simply abusing the tolerance exercised by the chair.
—So what is happening here is that almost a week of this parliament's time has been wasted on a matter which is not properly the responsibility of any member of this parliament; it is certainly not the responsibility of the Minister for Small Business. In the end, what is the quantum of this enormous scandal that the Labor Party thinks should dominate the debate of the national parliament? It is $75. Members opposite have wasted the time of this House for two days running over $75. That indicates an opposition that is completely bereft of ideas and completely bankrupt of any policy of its own. Therefore, it is trying to bung on this smokescreen to try to distract the attention of the Australian people from the fact that members opposite, if they ever do get into government, through their policy of roll-back, will inflict nothing but pain and suffering on the millions of small businesses in this country.
As I said, why is this happening? It is happening because members opposite woke to some pretty horrendous newspaper headlines last Thursday that called into question the honesty and the integrity of the Leader of the Opposition. Members opposite were desperate for a distraction. They were desperate for something to take the nation's attention away from the terrible hole that the Leader of the Opposition had got into through his prolixity, through his indecision and through his inability to stick to a story.
What was the Leader of the Opposition's story that ultimately has given rise to the last two days of distraction? The Leader of the Opposition's story was that his daughter had been refused treatment at a number of Perth hospitals and had been driven from accident and emergency to accident and emergency to accident and emergency, and eventually had only got her acute appendicitis treated because she went to a private hospital. This `story', this `fib', this lie was repeated by three Labor spokespeople in the course of last week. We now know that it was not true. It certainly was not true. Nothing had happened in quite the way that the Leader of the Opposition said it had.
What we saw last week was a Leader of the Opposition caught in the headlights of public attention and revealed at last in his true colours as a person who embellishes the bad news, who fibs about the facts and, when caught, blusters to try to cover up, and blames other people, including even his own family, to try to get out of the problem he is facing. First of all, he said that his daughter was refused admission to a hospital; that was the first lie. Then he said that his daughter had had to wait five hours for treatment; that was the second lie. Then he said that he had never raised this issue publicly anywhere until it was raised with him on AM radio last week; and that was the third lie. As the Leader of the Opposition blundered and blustered away in the parliament last Wednesday, me thinks a cock crowed.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister may have run out of things to say in order to defend the Minister for Small Business, but he is clearly not relevant to the terms of the censure motion moved.
—The member for Wills will resume his seat. This has been a debate conducted largely without unnecessary interruption, to the credit of all members of the House. A censure motion does not have the sorts of constraints that the member for Wills implies.
—What has given rise to debates in this House last Thursday and again today—
—The member for Braddon is warned!
—is the embarrassment and the humiliation suffered by the Leader of the Opposition, who was caught out in what can only be described as a lie. That is why we are having this debate. What a desperate defence we have seen from members opposite. First of all, we have a statement from the Leader of the Opposition, which completely destroyed his credibility. Then, in order to try to justify this, members opposite ran around saying, `At least people are now focusing on health as an issue.' Then, having made that defence, they came into parliament the next day and focused on anything but health; they are focusing on the terrible $75 scandal that allegedly happened in the FEC of Groom. If the Leader of the Opposition was so happy with what he had done last week, if the Leader of the Opposition was so satisfied with the result of his charming little story to the Labor caucus, why did he come into this House on Thursday and grab at affairs in the federal electorate conference of Groom with all the enthusiasm of a drowning man clutching at straws, if I might mix my metaphors? 
Do you know what we have been seeing over the last few weeks? We have been seeing a Leader of the Opposition who looks less and less like the Kim Beazley of old and more and more like the Paul Keating of old. We all know that the Leader of the Opposition has been told by the hard men around him that he needs to show a bit more mongrel. That is what he has been told: that he needs to show a bit more mongrel. That is why we are seeing the Leader of the Opposition come into this House day after day not to talk about policy, not to talk about ideas, not to talk about vision for the future of Australia, but to rake over the most extraordinary trivia and to try to impugn the integrity and the decency of an honest man and a good minister.
If there was one pathetic thing in this House last week, it was the sight of the Leader of the Opposition resembling nothing so much as that American comedian John Candy—you will remember him, Mr Speaker—trying to imitate Clint Eastwood. There was the Leader of the Opposition looking like John Candy trying to do a Clint Eastwood impersonation. It was just not convincing. That is why we have now got the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, gleefully going into the fray. I suppose it is easer for him to come on the mongrel because he is so used to it from his days as a union heavy. Of course, the member for Hotham announced, `I'm back.' Yes, I am sure that the Australian people have noticed over the last couple of days that he is back all right—ranting and raving at them like the union heavy he was for so many years, snarling and sneering and spitting at them as if he were addressing the brothers and the comrades at a union meeting, as he did for so many years.
This is a government of great integrity. This is a government which is quite prepared to subject its own political foundation to a tax audit. Members opposite have said that there has been some kind of special treatment for the Liberal Party. A tax audit: that is special treatment, is it? Gee whiz! That is the kind of special treatment that not too many members opposite would like. This is a party of integrity. It is a party which has free and frank internal debate. It is not a party which is controlled with an iron fist from head office. It is not a party which is bought by the union movement, as members opposite have been. This is a government which is quite prepared to have a tax audit into the affairs of the Queensland Liberal Party. It is a government which expects that audit to be made public, because it believes in integrity and is quite happy to be judged by its standards.
I am very happy to defend the Minister for Small Business, the junior minister in my portfolio. He has been remarkably hardworking. He is remarkably knowledgeable of small business matters. The Minister for Small Business has masterminded a whole series of changes which have helped the small businesses of Australia. He was the champion of the business activity statement simplification. He led arguments to see entity taxation proposals withdrawn. He led the debate on a better treatment for contractors. This is a man who has done his best for the small businesses of Australia. I know that the small businesses of Australia want someone like the member for Groom as their minister, not someone like the Leader of the Opposition, who has been shown up over the last few days by smokescreen Crean. The Leader of the Opposition was in desperate trouble. He had dug a hole and could not get himself out. He asked the member for Hotham to do so and, in so doing, the member for Hotham has shown up the terrible weaknesses of the Leader of the Opposition.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)		notes that 24 311 Social Security recipients have their compensation preclusion period spanning the introduction of the GST;
(2)		notes that the average length of preclusion periods is 291 weeks;
(3)		notes that the income cut-out rate has increased by $115.23 per week to compensate for price rises caused by the GST;
(4)		notes that if the post GST cut-out rate of $543.63 was applied to the post GST portion of the preclusion period it would result in a significant reduction in the preclusion period; and
(5)		condemns the Government's failure to introduce legislation to extend GST compensation to people whose compensation preclusion period spans the introduction of the GST.
When the government introduced the GST, against the wishes of the vast majority of Australian people, they put in place a number of compensation measures. These measures have proved to be completely inadequate, but at least the government acknowledged that the GST would hurt and tried to do something to offset that. This motion is about a group of people who were forgotten about: a group who missed out on the GST related compensation and who are doing it very tough as a result.
If you are injured in an accident, whether on our roads, at work or at somewhere like a restaurant or shopping centre, you are entitled to claim compensation. Any compensation payout is usually made up of two components. The first is for pain and suffering and the second is for loss of income if you are unable to work as a consequence of your injury. If you are granted compensation, a consequence is that you are precluded from obtaining Centrelink benefits for a certain period of time. What Centrelink does to determine the length of the preclusion period is to take the economic loss component of the payout and divide it by a figure determined from time to time which reflects living expenses. The resultant number is the number of weeks for which a person is precluded from claiming benefits. Prior to 1 July last year, when the GST was introduced, that figure was $428.40.
I will give hypothetical examples to illustrate what is wrong with the current arrangement. Take worker A—we will call him John—as an example. If John had an accident on 1 January 2000 and, as a result, was unable to continue working, he would have received a compensation payout. Let us say he received a payment where the economic loss component was $100,000. John would then have been precluded from claiming Centrelink benefits for just over 233 weeks—that is, nearly 4½ years. He would be expected to live on that figure until around the middle of June 2004.
Let us now compare that worker with worker B— we will call her Betty. If Betty had a similar accident six months later, on 1 July 2000, and received the same compensation payout for economic loss of $100,000, then the story would be very different. As part of the government's recognition that the GST would hurt many people, as I have said, they have implemented some compensation measures. One of the measures introduced was to raise that preclusion period cut-out figure from $428.40 to $543.63. So Betty received the same $100,000 economic loss component as John, but her preclusion period under the new figure would have been 184 weeks, or just over 3½ years. Betty would be entitled to claim Centrelink benefits in January 2004, almost six months before John. Of course, John had already been laid up and unable to work for six months before Betty was even injured. 
Does that sound fair? Is it fair that the first injured worker, John, would have to live almost a full year, 49 weeks, longer than Betty on the same amount of money? Is it fair that John was injured six months before Betty and yet cannot claim benefits until six months after she is able to? I do not think it is fair at all, and that is why I put this motion on the Notice Paper. If the GST compensation that the government recognised was necessary had been extended to John, we would see a bit more fairness in the scheme. If the new income cut-out figure of $543.63 was applied to that portion of the compensation payment left after 1 July, John would not be facing 49 weeks longer than Betty at all; the figure would be closer to only five weeks longer.
I will stop using hypothetical examples—they were simply to illustrate the unfairness of the system and the lack of adequate compensation to those already in the system. How many were in the system; how many accident victims had their preclusion period span the introduction of the GST? How many real people are in the same situation as the hypothetical examples? I asked the minister this in question No. 2370, the answer to which was given on 2 April this year. There were 24,311 people whose preclusion period spanned the introduction of the GST—that is, 24,311 people in the same boat as our hypothetical worker A: laid up, unable to work and facing a long time before benefits can be claimed.
A number of these 24,000 people are constituents of mine. I first raised this issue in a grievance debate in October last year when I spoke about a constituent, David Lambert. Mr Lambert was injured in a car accident and received a court settlement of $90,000, with an economic loss component estimated at $45,000. This meant he was precluded from Centrelink payments for 106 weeks, from 27 October 1999 until 6 November 2001—a period spanning the introduction of the GST. So almost nine months or 35 per cent of this constituent's preclusion period fell before the introduction of the GST and 23 months or 65 per cent fell post GST. But his preclusion period is based entirely on the lower, pre-GST income cut-out rate. If we were able to take the post-GST proportion of Mr Lambert's payout and apply the post-GST cut-out figure of $543.63—in other words, if we were to extend to him the compensation that the government thought necessary for everybody else—Mr Lambert would not have to wait until November to claim Centrelink benefits again. He could have done so on 26 July, some 15 weeks before his current date.
Another constituent of mine has a preclusion period that goes until the end of June 2014. He is expected to live for the next 13 years on that figure of $428.40 per week because he has not been compensated for the GST. This means he is effectively living on $115 less per week than somebody who is injured today and who would be living on $543 per week. If the GST compensation were extended to my constituent, he would be able to claim benefits again around June 2011, some three years earlier. I urge the minister to think about these three years that my constituent has to live without access to benefits that he would have been entitled to had he been properly compensated for the GST.
In part (7) of that question, I asked the minister why he would not introduce legislation to extend the GST compensation to people who were caught up in that situation, having their preclusion period spanning the introduction of the GST. His answer was, `No, for the reasons given above,' which I took to mean his answer to parts (3) and (6). In his answer to part (3), he said:
The Social Security Act 1991 does not provide for a compensation preclusion period to be divided into pre and post GST portions.
Obviously not. That is the reason for this private member's motion, and that is why we want legislation introduced to take account of the GST's impact. The minister seems to have missed the point on that one. He may also have been referring to his answer in part (6), in which he said: 
It would require an exhaustive, manual examination of more than 24,000 files with a significant resource impost on Centrelink and cannot be justified.
That is not the case, however. A simple formula on an Excel spreadsheet would tell him exactly what he needs to know. My office created such a spreadsheet in about 10 minutes. I seek leave to table that spreadsheet. 
Leave granted.
—I have clearly said that people who were injured prior to the introduction of the GST and those whose injuries spanned the introduction of the GST are clearly at a disadvantage compared with those who were injured after the introduction of the GST.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—I listened carefully to my friend the member for Greenway, who has great concern for people's wellbeing and is notoriously compassionate and thoughtful. He is no soft touch, however; he does his homework carefully when he looks at people's needs. I thank him for moving the motion and for giving us an opportunity to explore some ideas that he has gleaned from his experience with his constituents in regard to the impact of the GST on lump sum compensation recipients. The member is breaking new ground, as he is no doubt aware, because traditionally it has never been the process of the welfare system in Australia to fluctuate with regard to things such as compensation. Welfare payments are designed to underpin people's income and circumstances no matter what the fluctuations of other benefits or entitlements may be. A change in compensation payments, a change in the tax system or an adjustment by the government according to average male weekly earnings are other factors that impact on the calculations that the member has described. Half-yearly changes in welfare payments also impact on the extent to which a compensation package will last a recipient.
I do not know that the member went as far as proposing that every time there is a variation of that type the Commonwealth should recalculate its welfare payments for compensation recipients, but implicit in what he said is that there should be an adjustment when there are any changes. One of the most significant changes introduced by this government has been the introduction of legislation to ensure that pensions do not fall below 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. That is seldom acknowledged by the other side of the House, but it is a significant increase to all welfare recipients that should have produce an element of change when people calculate the duration of their workers compensation payments. 
Legislative amendments result in different treatment for compensation recipients, which is dependent upon the date they receive their compensation payment or the type of social security payment they have claimed. The complexity of what the member proposes is very significant, but I understand the thoughtful basis of it. If people who receive a compensation lump sum feel they are experiencing hardship or special circumstances, they can ask for a review of their situation under the hardship clause. I am sure that the honourable member is aware of those provisions. There is an underpinning or a propping-up under section 1184 of the Social Security Act. People can ask for such a review by contacting their Centrelink office or working through members of parliament. A process is in place to claim benefits if a person falls on hardship or says that they are experiencing harsh times. When I looked at that provision, I wondered what other provisions the government has made that will affect people who may be on compensation or on welfare payments. The extension of the Commonwealth seniors health card to 270,000 older Australians will pick up people who are on compensation payments or who have access to part pensions.
Some $146 million is going to a fair go for mature workers. That will give people aged 50 and over encouragement to participate in the work force. That is an encouragement for some people who have had an accident and been damaged and who feel that they do not know how they are ever going to manage. However, gradually they make some recovery or find, in these days of computers, that there is a role for them to fill and that they can play a very significant part in society. The government is supporting that process, even to the extent of $177 million over four years for a better deal for people with disabilities. That also impacts on people who may be partly disabled because of an accident and who are on compensation payments. 
Getting the right people to help is another program, involving $144 million over four years to provide the right help for disadvantaged people through better assessment, providing significant assistance in their homes and appropriate help for those with severe or multiple non-vocational barriers to participating. These are all most significant changes that complement and supplement the underpinning of the not less than 25 per cent of average male weekly earnings. That is part of what the government has done to assist those people who may have suffered an accident.
There are also provisions for accident victims or those on compensation payments to provide more child-care places. There will be $15 million over four years for that covering outside of school hour places. That is an excellent program to provide assistance to parents in need, who need that additional relief from their household responsibilities. Helping parents to return to work is another assistance program designed specifically for people who may be suffering a disability or some impediment to working. Helping people to find jobs involves $296 million over four years, better employment services, new training credits and helping people to participate. There is a community and business engagement program and $521 million to help people to generate a working credit. 
All of that is very significant. At the same time, they all ensure that people are not ripping off the system. Since we have been in office—and I have not heard any complaints about this—this government has saved taxpayers $1 billion by careful application of guidelines and rules so that people must live within the circumstances of the benefits that the Commonwealth is paying. This is a process of a safety net and support; it is not a hammock for people to rest in and take life easy. It is support for people who are really in need. This government has done that. It has also implemented a program of a waiting period before migrants can receive social welfare. Most migrants will have to wait up to two years before they become eligible for a welfare assessment.
When I look at the total picture of what the honourable member has raised in the House today, I consider it very thoughtful, and very helpful for us to consider. It is a process which could easily escape the attention of the House. I think that it is a program of adjustment that he wants to see introduced which is complex and difficult to make assessments on because of the before and after factors of the GST. I will take some interest in the spreadsheet, which I would have liked to have seen before the debate, but I will look at it after the debate and see how simple the member's claims are because he said that it is a simple process. I believe him and I will look at it.
Finally, the complexities worry me. A broad range of programs has been instigated recently to assist people with disabilities and who are suffering disablement in the workplace. That is the action of a government which is determined to make sure that people do not fall through the cracks, that they are properly attended to and that their needs are well looked after. Underpinning all that, of course, if that fails there is the hardship claim that people can make through Centrelink to prevent them from being completely destitute.

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—I congratulate the member for Greenway on bringing this most important motion to the House. The goods and services tax which came into operation in July last year has sent a shock wave through the Australian community. Some impacts of the GST were expected and some allowances were made. In the last budget, we saw more changes to taxation and social security arrangements in an attempt to restore equity. One measure in the original GST package was seen to benefit some people receiving social security benefits. This was an increase in the income cut out amount that allowed for some benefit to be paid up to that amount. Before the introduction of the GST in July 2000, this cut out figure was $428.40 per week. Because it was necessary to compensate pensioners for the loss of the purchasing power of their benefit, the income cut out amount was raised to $543.63. That is a big increase—in fact, nearly 27 per cent. It should give some idea of the impact of the GST on pensioners. 
While this helped some pensioners, one group in the community can quite rightly claim to have missed out as a result of that increase. People who received a lump sum settlement as compensation for injuries which have resulted in the loss of work opportunities are now treated differently depending on the date of their injury. Anyone suffering an injury before the introduction of the GST is much worse off than someone injured after that date because the income cut out amount is used to calculate the length of time that someone who has received a lump sum must wait before they can access a benefit. The difference in amounts leads to different periods which people must wait. 
This is unfair. It is an unintended consequence of the goods and services tax compensation arrangements, but one which this government has refused to set right. As a result, some 24,000 people are forced to wait much longer before they can access social security benefits simply because they were injured before 1 July 2000. This is most unfair, but to show just how unfair it is let me give the House an example of the difference the increased income cut-out amount makes to an individual.
Let me take someone on the average preclusion period of 291 weeks. Using the pre-GST divisor, 291 weeks, or about 5½ years, would result from a lump sum of just under $125,000. Using the post-GST divisor, a person receiving a lump sum of $125,000 would have a preclusion period of only 229 weeks—that is, less than 4½ years. That is a difference of 62 weeks or well over one year. If you took two people, one injured on 30 June 2000 and the other injured on 1 July 2000, and both received $125,000, the one injured on 1 July would be able to access a benefit more than one year earlier than the person injured the day before.
This is grossly unfair, and this government refuses to make the relatively minor changes to the Social Security Act to make it fair for all. We are dealing here with people who have suffered serious injury—people whose lives have been shattered as a result of those injuries. There are of course hardship provisions in the Social Security Act, but would it not be easier to recalculate the preclusion period in a fairer way? We are dealing with around 24,000 cases, but that is, after all, just about 160 people in each federal electorate. I know that many people in this position are poorly advised and do not fully understand how their lump sum settlement will affect their future entitlements, but I am sure they expect to be treated fairly. I doubt that the courts have taken into consideration the different treatment of post-GST accident victims.

"St Clair, Stuart, MP",NP,2001-08-27,"—I, too, rise to speak on the motion that has been moved by the member for Greenway and again congratulate him. Over the last three years in particular I have gained a great deal of respect for him in this place. The motion opens up a whole range of issues with regard to compensation, and I particularly want to have a look at workers compensation. I will look at it a little bit from the other end of things. It has obviously been the view of Commonwealth governments that the primary responsibility for the support of people who have suffered from compensable illness or injury rests with the relevant state or territory compensation schemes and not with the taxpayer funded social security system. I think that needs to be said up front: state or territory compensation schemes generally provide more long-term earnings related payments than the social security system would be able to provide.
Coming out of small business as I do, the dramatic increases in the costs of the provision of workers compensation have been of great concern to me and to colleagues of mine in small business, particularly when you compare what is happening in New South Wales with Queensland, for example, and as they relate to rural and agricultural businesses based in country Australia. I want to give some comparisons of the rates applicable in New South Wales with the rates that are being paid in Queensland and give some of the percentages of difference. I have just picked a number of the workers compensation rates off the New South Wales farmers web site that I found when I was looking into this issue. 
One of the issues that affects my area of New England in particular is grain growing. In New South Wales the workers compensation rate for 2001-02 is 11.13 per cent—up six per cent—compared with Queensland, which has a rate of 2.26 per cent. The cost to insure in New South Wales is nearly 500 per cent greater than in Queensland. If you compare the combined grain growing, sheep farming and beef cattle farming rate, in New South Wales it is 12.1 per cent, which is up 15 per cent, and in Queensland it is 3.86 per cent. It is a significant difference; in fact, the cost in New South Wales is nearly three times the cost in Queensland.
Getting closer to the higher country, for sheep farming the rate is 12.1 per cent—that again is an increase of 15 per cent. In Queensland for sheep farming it is 4.26 per cent. The New South Wales rate is 284 per cent more than the Queensland rate. These are all things that are adding to the costs for small business. The compensation rate for beef cattle farming in New South Wales is 10.19 per cent as against 5.43 per cent in Queensland—again, nearly double. For beef feedlots—and I am fortunate enough have a couple in my electorate which provide tremendous employment opportunities—the compensation rate in New South Wales is 10.19 per cent and in Queensland it is 5.43 per cent. Again, you can see the significant increases that workers compensation costs businesses in New South Wales when compared with Queensland. In poultry and meat farming, the rate is now 7.2 per cent. It is also up 15 per cent, which is 238 per cent higher than it is in Queensland, where the rate is only 3.02 per cent. When we look at reforms that were going to be done in New South Wales for workers compensation, we know that the Carr Labor government has failed. (Time expired)

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—I rise in the grievance debate to place on record the total incompetence this government has shown in managing the Natural Heritage Trust, and the complete lack of adequate funding that Labor electorates, such as mine, have received from the trust. Recently, I asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage a question on notice, to list all of the approved project applications and their full costings for the Sydney electorates of Prospect, Chifley, Fowler, Reid, Blaxland, Macarthur, Werriwa, Parramatta, Lindsay, Greenway, Mitchell and Macquarie. The minister has recently supplied me with the answer, which I will convey to the House later in this debate.
However, first I would like to bring to the House's attention the urgent need for my electorate to receive funding from the Natural Heritage Trust, and from other sources of federal funding, for very badly needed environmental projects. Within the local government area of Fairfield—a city which has a population of some 200,000 and which, of course, makes up nearly two-thirds of my electorate—is a vital network of creeks, which are subcatchments of the Georges River and the Botany Bay catchments. These two catchments contain the five major urban creeks: Prospect Creek, Orphan School Creek, Clear Paddock Creek, Green Valley Creek and Cabramatta Creek. One of the largest of these creeks, Prospect Creek, runs right through my electorate and joins Orphan School Creek, which is also within my electorate.
Since the 1960s, this valuable creek system has suffered from stormwater pollution, unsewered residential development and industrial pollution. The natural beauty of these creeks has been spoiled by development and continual flooding over many years, which has turned what was once a recreational, natural landscape that families could enjoy into a place which has needed urgent upgrading and, as yet, has not received funding from the federal government. Fairfield council have had to fund their entire five creeks strategy from local government rates. Earlier this year, I raised this issue of the five creeks in an appropriation debate with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Sharman Stone. These were her remarks in reply:
We—
meaning the government—
have been very conscious of urban environments and the degradation of water supplies, air quality and noise abatement. There is a whole range of urban environmental issues that the Natural Heritage Trust specifically identified and addressed.
I say to the parliamentary secretary that the minister's reply to my question on notice has clearly shown where the Natural Heritage Trust has specified and addressed the urban environmental issues, and that is in the marginal Liberal held electorates. Here are the figures to prove that statement. I asked the minister for the total sum of Commonwealth funding to projects which were successful in receiving Natural Heritage Trust funding in 1999-2000 and 2000-01 for the electorates which neighbour or which are close to my electorate. I would like to read those figures to the House. My electorate of Prospect received nothing in 1999-2000 but received a small amount of $17,500 for a wetlands strategy in Abbotsbury. I would like to go through the other Labor-held seats: Chifley received $15,000 in 1999-2000 and nothing in 2000-01; Fowler, $13,770 in 1999-2000 and $24,225 in 2001; Greenway, $4,408 in 1999-2000 and then nothing in 2000-01; Reid, $42,627 combined in the two years; and Blaxland, $18,866 in 1999-2000 and $11,576 in 2000-01. I am sure most members will agree that these funding measures range from a pittance to something that was probably just adequate for minor natural heritage projects. 
But now I would like to go through the coalition seats—and remember that the above electorates share common boundaries with all these seats. The seat of Lindsay received $83,713 over the two years; Mitchell received $128,305 over the two years; Macquarie received $380,423 over the two years; Macarthur received $366,548 over the two years; and Parramatta, one of the most marginal government-held seats in Sydney, received a total of $636,419 over the two years. I repeat for the members in the House: Parramatta received the total sum of $636,419 in Natural Heritage Trust funding over two years. Compare this with the funding in my electorate, which came to a total of $17,500. By the way, for the information of those in the House, Parramatta and my electorate of Prospect share a common road; yet this is the type of funding we received.
The list provided by the minister shows that large amounts of this Commonwealth money have funded in Parramatta local government projects which are very similar to the projects which Fairfield City Council is proposing through its five creeks program. I believe that this shows the utter arrogance of the government in picking and choosing which electorates are worthy of receiving Natural Heritage Trust funding and which are not. The money that has funded the Natural Heritage Trust Fund came from the government's decision to partially sell off Telstra, which was a publicly owned and nationally important telecommunications carrier. The proceeds of the sale should benefit all parts of Australia, including urban areas and electorates like mine and neighbouring Labor electorates. When I raised the matter of the Fairfield Council's five creek program in that appropriation debate, the parliamentary secretary said:
Please come and knock on my door as well because, as parliamentary secretary, I am able to help people just like your five-creek plan group on very many occasions.
Later, she said:
Again, it just might be that the councils in the member for Prospect's electorate are not fully aware of those opportunities—
Not much! I say now to the parliamentary secretary and to the minister: the council in my electorate have knocked on your door. They have put in their submissions, which I sent to your office personally with a letter dated 3 August 2001, and they are still awaiting a response. I can only hope that it will be a positive one.
I would also like to mention the lack of full explanation of some of the funding arrangements mentioned in the minister's reply, especially in regard to the projects for which no application for funding was received, and for what the minister calls `education and awareness programs'. When the minister claims that $274.7 million of Commonwealth funds has been appropriated to the Natural Heritage Trust, while my electorate has received only a pittance of this money, it is a matter of accountability that these projects be explained in more detail. Also needed to be asked is: how much of the money has been used for the promotion and advertisement of the Natural Heritage Trust that has saturated Australian newspapers and television, while the marginal electorates receive the most amount of money and electorates like mine do not?
Questions also need to be asked of this government as to why the electorate of Parramatta—an urban electorate which, as I explained, is very similar to mine—received $636,419 while mine received $17,400; and also why neighbouring electorates, such as Chifley, received only $15,000 over two years. The minister cannot possibly claim that more applications were received from areas within Parramatta or Lindsay and that that was the reason for the significant difference in the figures between the electorates.
According to the minister's answer, there were 8,014 applications received in 1999-2000, while there were only 3,915 approved. In 2000-01 there were 7,084 applications received, and 3,416 were approved. It would be very interesting to learn the electorates from which unsuccessful applications came. However, as the minister told me in his answer to my question, there are no location based data for the unsuccessful applications. How interesting is that! The government have collected information on submissions and funding, but we have no location based data for the unsuccessful applications. 
It is vital for urban areas and electorates such as mine to receive federal funding from the Natural Heritage Trust. Important environmental projects which will have several benefits for the people in my electorate and for Sydney's urban waterway system need to be completed. The Natural Heritage Trust was funded, I repeat, by the sale of Telstra, a public asset, so this government has the responsibility to use the money to benefit all Australians, not just those who live in the marginal government held electorates.
It is also very interesting when one looks at some of the programs—and I took myself physically around some of the areas to see what is being achieved by the natural heritage funding—and sees the similarity in programs that have already been applied from those surrounding neighbourhood electorates. Again, I would understand and appreciate if the electorates that I am talking about were in different states—if I was taking examples from the state of New South Wales, the state of Victoria and the state of Western Australia. I am talking about a collection of federal electorates that encompass what I say is Sydney's greater west. I am talking about electorates that go cheek by jowl with a neighbouring electorate; they have the same environmental concerns and problems. In fact, some of the creek systems and the waterway systems run from one electorate to another. We do not have a border which stops the water coming out of one electorate and going into the other, yet we do have a border when we have the allocation of public funds which have resulted from the sale of a public asset such as Telstra being distributed in electorates in a most uneven and underhanded way.
I believe that the minister and the parliamentary secretary have to look more closely at what has happened here. I do not believe that it is an issue that is going to be kept quiet, because the councils in the electorates now know how the distribution of funds has been made over these last two years, why it has been made and to whom it has been made. I believe what has to be questioned and continue to be questioned by us in opposition, and particularly by the government members who make up this parliament, is: why are funding allocations being done in a way that shows such a gross inadequacy between one area and the area next door which is on a very similar plane?
I believe that there are a lot more answers that the minister needs to provide to the question on notice. I do not think it is something that is going to go away. More particularly, we need to have a far greater explanation than just, `We don't have the locations of those applications that have missed out.' Perhaps the ones that missed out have come from areas that I have mentioned that received no funding or very little funding; maybe they did, maybe they didn't. But when you do not have an answer to that question, it leaves the question outstanding: where has the money gone?

"Jull, David, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on the Intelligence Services, I have pleasure in presenting the committee's advisory report on the Intelligence Services Bill 2001, the Intelligence Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 and certain parts of the Cybercrime Bill 2001.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The Intelligence Services Bill 2001 makes a historic contribution to the development of the Australian intelligence community. For the first time, the functions of both the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate are provided for in legislation. The findings of the 1995 commission of inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service provide the basis for the IS Bill. One of the key recommendations of the commission of inquiry was the need for a legislative base for ASIS. The key features of the IS Bill include the provision of immunities for both ASIS and DSD, the provision of rules to protect the privacy of Australians and the creation of a Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO and ASIS—the PJCAA. 
The focus of the review was the accountability mechanisms applying to the use of the immunity provisions under clause 14 of the bill. The examination of the IS Bill identified a number of unintended consequences. The committee's recommendations, however, will eliminate these concerns and ensure that the accountability framework is effective. I shall discuss individually the key clauses of the IS Bill which require amendment. 
Clause 6—The functions of ASIS
Paragraph 6(1)(e) provides a degree of flexibility for the government in its tasking of ASIS by allowing ASIS `to undertake such other activities as the responsible minister directs'. The accountability provisions applying to 6(1)(e) include the need for the responsible minister to consult with other ministers and make the direction in writing, which would be made available to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. In addition to this, the committee recommended that, if the minister gives a direction under paragraph 6(1)(e), he or she must, as soon as practicable after the direction is given to the head of ASIS, advise the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO and ASIS of the nature of the other activity to be carried out.
Clauses 8 and 9—Ministerial directions and authorisation
The privacy of Australians is paramount. Recommendations 2 and 7 will enhance accountability of the operation of the agencies. Recommendation 7 seeks to amend clauses 8 and 9 of the bill to require authorisation by the responsible minister for any activity specifically directed towards obtaining intelligence concerning Australian persons or Australian organisations overseas. In addition, the minister, in giving such an authorisation, must be satisfied that the Australian person or organisation overseas is engaged in, or is reasonably suspected of being engaged in or of being likely to engage in, activities prejudicial to Australia's national security. An authorisation of this nature will have effect for six months, whereupon it will lapse unless renewed by the minister. Recommendation 2 makes a similar requirement in relation to the operation of ministerial directions made under paragraph 6(1)(e).
Clause 11—Limit on agencies functions
Paragraph 11(2)(c) of the bill provides for ASIS or DSD, in carrying out their functions, to communicate to the appropriate law enforcement agencies any intelligence that is relevant to serious crime. There were some concerns about the accountability mechanisms applying to this provision. Under the nationality rules which apply to ASIS and DSD, both agencies are required to record instances of collection and reporting on Australians, and provide records to the IGIS. Recommendation 4 will strengthen this accountability mechanism by requiring the responsible minister in relation to ASIS and the responsible minister in relation to DSD to consult with the Attorney-General before making the rules relating to the communication and retention of information concerning Australian persons. 
Clause 14—Liability for certain acts
Clause 14, relating to immunities for both ASIS and DSD, proved to be the most contentious provision in the bill. The committee's scrutiny of this clause was rigorous and thorough. The examination revealed an unintended consequence of clause 14 which would have permitted ASIS to conduct certain activities beyond its requirements. The implementation of recommendation 6 will remove this possibility and provide a framework which ensures that immunities are only granted in cases where an activity is done in the proper performance of a function of the agency. In addition, recommendation 5 requires the development of protocols to guide the operations of clause 14. In particular, recommendation 5 states that clause 14 should not come into effect until the protocols are provided in writing to the IGIS.
Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO and ASIS
I conclude by focusing on the role and the functions of the proposed Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO and ASIS. The history of parliamentary oversight of the Australian intelligence community is a chequered one. The IS Bill, together with the committee's amendments, will herald a new era of parliamentary oversight of Australia's key intelligence agencies. The PJCAA will replace the existing Parliamentary Joint Committee on the ASIO. The PJCAA will examine the administration and expenditure of ASIO and ASIS, and will be required to provide the parliament with an annual report of its activities. In addition, the committee has proposed a range of amendments which enhance parliamentary scrutiny through expanding the powers of the PJCAA. These additional powers include:
the requirement that the Minister advise the Committee of the nature of any direction made under paragraph 6(1)(e) regarding ASIS undertaking such other activities as the responsible Minister directs;
the requirement to be briefed by the IGIS on the protocols relating to clause 14, and the privacy rules made under clause 15; and
the requirement that DSD be subject to scrutiny by the Committee.
The committee's recommendations will enhance the Intelligence Services Bill 2001 by providing an effective accountability framework which will provide confidence for the parliament and the Australian public.
In conclusion, I would like to express the committee's appreciation for the efforts of those who gave evidence to our inquiry. I would especially like to acknowledge the excellent advice and guidance provided by Hilary Penfold, head of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, in the latter stages of the inquiry. I would also like to thank the members of the committee for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry. Finally, I thank the secretarial staff who were involved in the inquiry: Grant Harrison, Katie Hobson and our inquiry secretary, Stephen Boyd. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Intelligence Services Committee</title>,Committees,13,1,speech
"Brereton, Laurie, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"— by leave—I am pleased to speak this evening on the report of the Joint Select Committee on Intelligence Services on the Intelligence Services Bill 2001. At the outset can I say that the legislation under review is long overdue. The government has been very slow to implement the 1995 Samuels commission recommendations to put ASIS on a statutory basis and subject to a degree of parliamentary oversight. Foreign Minister Downer has taken more than five years to produce the bill that he eventually introduced into this parliament on 27 June this year.
The Joint Select Committee on Intelligence Services has produced what I think is a valuable bipartisan report. I would like to join with the chairman in thanking all my colleagues on the committee for the constructive approach that they adopted to the work of the committee. Our task was greatly assisted by the chairmanship of the honourable member for Fadden, the excellent work of the committee secretariat and the valuable contributions from the First Parliamentary Counsel, Hilary Penfold QC and from Nathan Hancock of the Parliamentary Library. Labor members of the committee urged the adoption of 11 major recommendations designed to improve the bill and ensure appropriate protection for the privacy and rights of Australians at home and overseas. All our recommendations have been adopted in this report. My remarks tonight will highlight a number of these recommendations which, if adopted by the government, will make the bill much more acceptable than at present. 
The legislation under review is intended to establish a framework for accountability and parliamentary oversight. It also serves in a legal sense to empower ASIS and the DSD to conduct activities in performance of their functions. Whatever the current practice and intentions, this will be a new legal reality within which future decisions about possible overseas intelligence operations will be made.
Sections 6 and 7 of the bill establish the primary functions of ASIS and DSD as obtaining intelligence about the `capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia'. ASIS may also undertake such `other activities' overseas as the responsible minister directs. Section 11(1) provides that the agencies' functions are to be performed `only in the interests of Australia's national security, Australia's foreign relations or Australia's national economic well-being'. These are concepts left undefined in the bill. 
ASIS and DSD will be legally empowered to collect intelligence on foreign persons and organisations overseas and on Australian persons and organisations overseas. The bill makes no distinction between persons or organisations on the basis of nationality other than in the provisions of section 15 relating to the privacy rules.
It needs to be understood that this is a different approach to that taken in the New Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau Bill introduced into the New Zealand parliament in May this year. That legislation authorises New Zealand's signals intelligence agency to collect `foreign intelligence' defined as `information about the capabilities, intentions or activities of a foreign organisation or foreign person'. The New Zealand bill largely, but not totally, excludes New Zealand citizens and organisations from the scope of the GCSB operations.
In evidence to the select committee, ASIS and DSD emphasised that in the normal course of operations neither agency targets Australian citizens overseas. Both agencies stated their purpose is `foreign intelligence' collection, though this is a term not used in the bill. The agencies emphasised the significance of the nationality rules that place constraints on the handling of information relating to Australian citizens that may be obtained incidentally in the course of foreign intelligence collection.
ASIS and DSD did acknowledge, however, that in certain limited circumstances it could be permissible under current practice to collect intelligence on Australian citizens. I put it to the House that very careful consideration needs to be given to the circumstances in which intelligence concerning Australian citizens overseas could be authorised. While it may not be current prac-tice, intelligence collection activities focused on Australian citizens overseas will be permitted under this bill, but the conditions under which this could happen are not properly identified or defined.
It is possible to envisage limited circumstances in which intelligence collection relating to an Australian citizen overseas could be in the national interest—for example, an Australian engaged in espionage or terrorism against Australia. However, reliance on the nationality rules appears to be an insufficient long-term safeguard for the privacy and interests of Australian citizens overseas. This is especially so when comparison is made to the stringent legislative controls on covert intelligence collection by ASIO within Australia for national security purposes.
Accordingly, the select committee recommends that the bill be redrafted to include a specific authorisation process comparable to the special powers provisions of the ASIO Act 1979 for any activities specifically directed towards obtaining intelligence concerning Australian persons or organisations overseas. Any such intelligence should relate to questions of national security and national security alone, and any authorisation should have effect for six months whereupon it would lapse unless renewed by the minister. These provisions would be an important safeguard for the rights and privacy of Australian citizens overseas. 
A definition of the key concept of national security is also required. `Security' is defined in section 4 of the ASIO Act 1979. Drawing upon this precedent and considering the need to cover issues such as people smuggling, `national security,' we believe, should include protecting Australia from espionage, sabotage, politically motivated violence, promotion of communal violence, attacks on Australia's defence system, acts of foreign interference and unauthorised movements of persons or objects across Australia's national borders.
The select committee gave careful consideration to the question of `other activities' which may be conducted by ASIS under section 6(1)(e). Section 6(4) provides that in performing its functions ASIS must not plan for or undertake paramilitary activities or activities involving violence against persons or the use of weapons. Paragraph 6(4) requires clarification through, we believe, the definition of `paramilitary activities.'
Given that section 6(1)(e) will allow the responsible minister to expand the function of ASIS without recourse to legislative change, the committee concludes that a measure of parliamentary scrutiny is appropriate. In addition to providing the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security with a copy of any direction made under section 6(1)(e), the minister should be required to advise the parliamentary committee of the general nature of the `other activity' to be performed by the agency and to do so as soon as practicable after the direction is given. The committee further recommends that any authorisation of `other activities' in relation to Australian citizens or organisations overseas should also be covered by a specific authorisation procedure and be limited to activities which directly enhance or protect Australia's national interest. 
The committee gave lengthy consideration to the immunity provisions contained in section 14 of the bill. Labor members of the committee spent considerable time exploring precisely what activity the immunity provisions could cover and how immunity might work in practice. While the establishment of immunities for actions inside and outside Australia is not without precedent, the controlled operations provisions of the Crimes Act being one example, any legislation of this nature must be approached with caution.
The report makes a number of important recommendations that will significantly narrow the potential scope of the immunities provided by the bill and establish safeguards and protocols for their operation. In this, the committee was assisted by the valuable drafting input from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Amongst other safeguards, the report recommends the bill be amended to make it clear that the immunity provisions do not permit any act inside Australia which ASIO could not do without proper authorisation under the ASIO Act 1979, the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 or the Telecommunications Act 1997. Such a measure will ensure that there is no back door for covert intelligence collection in Australia outside the established legal checks and balances.
The committee further recommends that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security should have the responsibility of certifying that an act has been done in proper performance of the agency's functions and may therefore be covered by the provisions of section 14. Other recommendations urged by Labor and adopted by the committee include provision for the Attorney-General to be consulted in respect of the privacy rules concerning Australian persons and protocols to govern the operation of section 14 immunities provision for the parliamentary committee to be briefed on the privacy rules and immunity protocols, and amendments to the bill to ensure the arrangements for briefing the Leader of the Opposition about ASIS are the same as those relating to ASIO. 
Finally, the committee has adopted our recommendation that the scope of the new Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIS and ASIO be expanded to include DSD. As the report notes, DSD is the most significant defence intelligence collection agency and it is highly desirable that it be subject to oversight by the parliamentary committee. 
The bill as drafted is quite unsatisfactory in its failure to provide adequate safeguards for the rights and privacy of Australian citizens at home and abroad. The bipartisan report of the joint select committee provides a way forward, and I hope that the government will agree to each of the committee's recommendations. The opposition shadow cabinet, our caucus committee on national security and trade and the full caucus will now consider the bill, this report of the select committee and any consequent amendments the government proposes to make. I anticipate that we will then be ready to deal with the bill when it is brought on for debate on Tuesday of the parliament's next sitting week.

"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—by leave—I am delighted to participate in this debate on the report of the Joint Select Committee on Intelligence Services. I commend the chairman and members of the committee, who deliberated long and hard on a number of the provisions and recommendations. I thank the secretariat for their excellent work in presenting the report.
As members would be aware, this report originates from the development of the Intelligence Services Bill 2001 to give statutory recognition to the ASIS operation and the ASIO operation. From having heard the various points of debate over two days, and from my time as a member of the ASIO committee, I have come to understand the fundamental problem facing this parliament in developing a statutory background for both of these organisations. This goes back to the original focus of the IS Bill, where the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, was established by executive direction on 13 May 1952. It was only in 1977 that the government publicly acknowledged the existence of ASIS as Australia's foreign intelligence agency.
The Samuels and Codd report, which was the basis of this legislation—which previous governments had not been prepared to bring to the parliament, but this government did—made some recommendations that the legislative basis for ASIS, which details the level of accountability and oversight, is the basis of this legislation. Other key elements of the IS Bill are the provision for immunities for ASIS and DSD in respect of the proper conduct of their functions, particularly in clause 14, which other members have alluded to; the provisions to protect the privacy of Australians; the creation of a Parliamentary Joint Committee of ASIS and ASIO; and the protection and indemnity of ASIS staff in their operations.
The report refers to the Hope royal commission. The first Hope recommendation is the fundamental aspect of the report:
The fundamental consideration favouring parliamentary sanction for ASIS is that the parliament is the instrument of democratic control of the government in this country, so a statute establishing ASIS is a statute authorising the minister to act to control the service on behalf of the parliament itself, speaking for the people and the ministers responsible to the parliament in a general way for ASIS.
That is the fundamental problem that the committee and the drafter of the legislation are facing. The Samuels and Codd report specifically addressed the problems of ASIS operational control, which has been a problem facing ASIO and the ASIS committee. I quote:
On the contrary, its operational management is well structured and its tactical decisions are thoroughly considered and in major instance subject to external approval. Its operational people are skilled and discreet, and the product it gathers is well regarded by its customers and professional assessors.
The committee looked at this fundamental dilemma. The committee thought that the section D notice in general had not been very effective since 1952. The committee looked fairly carefully at the issue of whether ASIS should include paramilitary activities. It was quite clear from the discussions that that was not included in the statute nor in the intent of the operation. 
As other members have alluded to the House, clause 14 was a major point of discussion by the committee as to how the definition of those persons should be considered. In my assessment, the Inspector-General Intelligence Services indicated that he was not alarmed about clause 14 and stated:
... given that my own office will, on a regular basis, be doing what it does: inspecting the operations of the agencies and ensuring that the capacity for the agencies to undertake these sorts of operations with that kind of immunity is not abused. I think it is fair to say that I have seen no instances of a desire on the part of the agencies to abuse their privileges in the past, and I have every reason to believe that they will not do so in the future. If I observed any instances of that, obviously I would take necessary action.
The problem of clause 14 is a very important aspect of the debate, which the committee deliberated on at great length. I am happy that the Inspector-General will consider these matters carefully. I will confine my remarks to those aspects of the report. I commend the report to the parliament. I commend all those members of the parliament, both House of Representatives and Senate, who participated in a genuine discussion to reach a conclusion on a very sensitive bit of legislation in the hope that these agencies would come under parliamentary control yet be effective in providing intelligence to the Australian community and be responsive and effective in their operational activities on the ground.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Intelligence Services Committee</title>,Committees,13,1,speech
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—I seek leave to make a statement.
Leave granted.
—I was about to make a short statement but my colleague the member for Chifley wants me to make a long statement. I could be tempted if that were necessary. The member for Kingsford-Smith pulls a face, so who knows. I enjoyed the work of this committee. I compliment, as did my colleague the member for Kingsford-Smith, the work of the committee chairman. It is rather unusual in this place to find that a committee that looked into the affairs of the security apparatuses of Australia could come down with a unanimous report albeit six years later than it probably should have. Five years into the term of this government is a bit of a long time after the recommendation of the royal commission and the follow-ups; nevertheless, better late than never.
Some credit needs to be given to the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on the Intelligence Services, Mr Jull, for his work on the committee. I would also, I think begrudgingly, give some credit to the people who represented the security services on the committee, because they tried to help the committee to achieve the aims that we wanted—which was to ensure that Australians would be given a reasonable satisfaction that their security services were not peering into their lives and that they were not using the immunities that were proposed in this bill that may have allowed them to do that through the back door.
The committee was very much helped in its work by the fact that we had open committee meetings. It is probably the first time in the history of the security services in this country that we have had sitting at one table in an open committee meeting the director of DSD, the director of ASIO and the director of ASIS. It was rather interesting to remember the paranoia in the press about the security services and look at who was sitting in the gallery for that meeting—not many of the lazy journalists who inhabit this building could be bothered to come down and see these people coming out into the light of day. If it had been Britain or Washington where these things take on a little bit of interest, at least one or three of them may have been there. But down here in Australia, they were probably more interested in something that someone could hand out to them to write. The fact that the three directors of those services turned up at a public meeting and argued their case was, for the aficionados, an interesting parliamentary event, but I did not see it in the paper so maybe it never happened. A lot of the credit for having the three directors there goes to the chairman of the committee and the government members were open minded for a change—and Mr Jull certainly was that.
The committee was helped very much by a very enlightening exposition we had from the First Parliamentary Counsel, Hilary Penfold, on one of those interesting afternoons where parliamentary committees come into their own. House of Representatives committees do not often examine legislation. We tend to get up and argue about it, but there is not much in-depth analysis. Maybe our Senate colleagues would tell us they do this all the time, but it proved to be an interesting afternoon for the members of the House of Representatives committee to have this interaction with Ms Penfold and the bureaucrats around the table with Ms Penfold. We saw people arguing for what might be the best approach—all this at a public committee meeting that none of the lazy journalists bothered to come along to. I think that crystallised in a lot of our minds where we should go with this legislation. 
I had a very significant problem with the original legislation that was before the House, in particular clause 14. I have been a member of the ASIO committee for this parliament, and I recall years ago how there was this absolute paranoia in Australia about ASIO—that they were tapping everybody's phone, they were under everybody's bed, they were sharing time with the reds and you never knew who was going to get out in the morning with you. But the Hawke government legislated for a committee to look at ASIO—admittedly, it had very finely drawn terms of reference, including that the Prime Minister had to nominate you and that the Deputy Speaker could not be a member of the committee, which we are fixing in this legislation—and that was progress. Since that time, there has been less criticism of ASIO. I would have been happier if this legislation mirrored the ASIO legislation. One of the exercises that we went through with Ms Penfold was that she gave us some guidance about how this legislation could and, in some areas, could not mirror the ASIO legislation. I went into this as a sceptic, but I am probably at the stage now where I think what she was saying was right.
At the outset, I was very concerned with clause 14 of this legislation, which provided indemnities for ASIS officers who committed crimes against Australian legislation both within Australia and overseas. I was most particularly concerned with paragraph 14 (c) of the proposed legislation which was about `Liabilities for certain acts'. Clause 14 said:
A person—
and that could be any person—
is not subject to any civil or criminal liability for any act done inside Australia if:
	(a)		the act is preparatory to, in support of, or otherwise directly connected with, overseas activities of the agency concerned; and
	(b) 	the act:
	(i) 	involves aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring or otherwise planning or attempting to carry out; or
	(ii)	is otherwise directly connected with;
	some other act outside Australia that would amount to an offence if that other act were committed in Australia; and
	(c)		the act is done in the proper performance of a function of the agency.
It struck me that paragraph (c) would have allowed ASIS people to burgle their way across this country in the same way that some of those famous people in that Spycatcher novel did across the UK without any limitation upon their activities provided that they were acting in accordance with some properly ticked off proposal for ASIS to work outside Australia. Quite frankly, I did not think that was good enough. I think if we passed legislation that would allow the security services to do that, we would be found very wanting by the Australian people for what we had done. Paragraph 2.84 of the report summarises what ASIS said, to their credit, and I hope their sincerity, in evidence to the committee. The report states:
ASIS indicated that the proposed amendments to clause 14 `will narrow the scope of the immunity by excluding acts which do not have such a close  connection as that required by subclause (b)(i).' In particular, ASIS emphasise that paragraphs 14(2) (a) and (c) `make it clear that any act which was outside the agencies' specific statutory functions would not be covered by the immunity.'
Both their assurances—and I am not taking their assurances at face value—and the proposals that were also put forward by the parliamentary counsel and are recommended in this committee's report show that, if the government does pick up the recommendations of the committee, we will be closing off the opportunity that people would have to use ASIS's legislation to pursue activities against Australian citizens here in Australia. I think the proposals in the current legislation in clause 14 are not good enough; but, if the government is willing to pick up the unanimous recommendations of the committee about changes to clause 14 and changes to the limits of the immunities that will be provided to ASIS agents, we are then at least trying to mirror, in some of the provisions of this act, the provisions that are in the ASIO Act. ASIS said to the committee that they themselves would not be carrying out these functions in Australia and, indeed, if they needed to carry out functions such as that, they would use ASIO and ASIO warrants to do it. They also said that they would enter into a protocol with the Inspector-General of Security that would bind them to do that. If ASIS do that, I think that is also progress. 
I commend the report to the House and I particularly commend the report to the government, because, as both the member for Kingsford-Smith and the member for Fadden have said, these are unanimous recommendations of the committee, recommendations which will move us on to a position where the rights of Australians will be protected and the proper obligations of the security services will be able to be taken into account and where we will have a parliamentary committee overseeing not just ASIO but also ASIS and DSD. If we do that, at least the people of this country can be sure that someone is keeping an eye on where these things are going. If we can lower the paranoia that there might be about the activities of the security services to the same extent that the changes we have made to the way ASIO works have lowered some of the paranoia there, then we have done some good work and have also protected the rights of Australian citizens. So I would commend the committee's report to the House and the government. I look forward to seeing whether the government has picked up the recommendations of the committee when we discuss the legislation shortly.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Intelligence Services Committee</title>,Committees,13,1,speech
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—by leave— At the outset of my remarks on the advisory report of the Joint Select Committee on the Intelligence Services on the Intelligence Services Bill 2001, the Intelligence Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 and certain parts of the Cybercrime Bill 2001, I endorse the comments made by the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Fadden, and the deputy chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, and also those made by the honourable member for Watson, which went to a lot of the details that are in the report. I will not go into the detail of the contents of the report. Suffice it to say that the report that has been presented to the parliament is a unanimous report with 18 recommendations, and I would strongly urge the government to pick up each and every one of those recommendations. The thing that I liked about the committee was that the committee looked at the legislation on its merits and did not break up along party political lines. We came to a unanimous conclusion in relation to each of these matters.
There is no doubt that we are entering new territory with these bills before the House. I must say that, from my point of view, the thing that guided me was the question: who guards the guard while the guard guards you? Each of these recommendations will, I believe, if picked up by the government, in effect be able to answer that question in such a way that the Australian community and the international community in general can say that we have in a delicate situation got the balance right. I must say that there is a bit of history and form here. There are a number of cases that have gone to the High Court, and it is pretty clear that the agencies have to operate within the law. In relation to these bills, there are certainly, in terms of the way the current bills are drafted, some unintended consequences that have been identified. The immunities are too broad. Everyone accepts that, and I do not think there is anyone on the committee that would support the bill in its current form.
What I think we do is establish with our recommendations an accountability regime that certainly allows the agencies to get on with their proper business and to follow, in effect, the policies that it is fair to say both sides of the House do agree with. We might not like it all, but it has to be done—that is the real world. But we do not abrogate our responsibilities. The committee's recommendations significantly provide some safeguards, in particular to the narrowing of clause 14. The recommendations also provide for parliamentary oversight, in particular of the Defence Services Directorate, and allow the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to play a key role in certifying whether acts have been done in the proper performance of the functions of the agencies. It is a very important step for DSD to be brought under a parliamentary committee, and obviously over time the committee will have a more substantial role than the current ASIO committee. 
I certainly commend this report to the parliament and to the government. I want to congratulate the chairman and the deputy chairman who between them, quite frankly, were the main driving force in relation to these recommendations. That is the way it is. We all played our roles as a committee. I congratulate the secretariat and the agencies for the way they conducted themselves. I also want to strongly commend to this House, again, the First Parliamentary Counsel, Hilary Penfold, whom we have had before the House of Representatives legal committee in the past. She did a brilliant job on short notice for the committee. The Parliamentary Library, Nathan Hancock in particular, again were outstanding. The parliament is well served by its servants.

"Jull, David, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on the Intelligence Services, I have pleasure in presenting the committee's advisory report on the Intelligence Services Bill 2001, the Intelligence Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 and certain parts of the Cybercrime Bill 2001.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The Intelligence Services Bill 2001 makes a historic contribution to the development of the Australian intelligence community. For the first time, the functions of both the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate are provided for in legislation. The findings of the 1995 commission of inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service provide the basis for the IS Bill. One of the key recommendations of the commission of inquiry was the need for a legislative base for ASIS. The key features of the IS Bill include the provision of immunities for both ASIS and DSD, the provision of rules to protect the privacy of Australians and the creation of a Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO and ASIS—the PJCAA. 
The focus of the review was the accountability mechanisms applying to the use of the immunity provisions under clause 14 of the bill. The examination of the IS Bill identified a number of unintended consequences. The committee's recommendations, however, will eliminate these concerns and ensure that the accountability framework is effective. I shall discuss individually the key clauses of the IS Bill which require amendment. 
Clause 6—The functions of ASIS
Paragraph 6(1)(e) provides a degree of flexibility for the government in its tasking of ASIS by allowing ASIS `to undertake such other activities as the responsible minister directs'. The accountability provisions applying to 6(1)(e) include the need for the responsible minister to consult with other ministers and make the direction in writing, which would be made available to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. In addition to this, the committee recommended that, if the minister gives a direction under paragraph 6(1)(e), he or she must, as soon as practicable after the direction is given to the head of ASIS, advise the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO and ASIS of the nature of the other activity to be carried out.
Clauses 8 and 9—Ministerial directions and authorisation
The privacy of Australians is paramount. Recommendations 2 and 7 will enhance accountability of the operation of the agencies. Recommendation 7 seeks to amend clauses 8 and 9 of the bill to require authorisation by the responsible minister for any activity specifically directed towards obtaining intelligence concerning Australian persons or Australian organisations overseas. In addition, the minister, in giving such an authorisation, must be satisfied that the Australian person or organisation overseas is engaged in, or is reasonably suspected of being engaged in or of being likely to engage in, activities prejudicial to Australia's national security. An authorisation of this nature will have effect for six months, whereupon it will lapse unless renewed by the minister. Recommendation 2 makes a similar requirement in relation to the operation of ministerial directions made under paragraph 6(1)(e).
Clause 11—Limit on agencies functions
Paragraph 11(2)(c) of the bill provides for ASIS or DSD, in carrying out their functions, to communicate to the appropriate law enforcement agencies any intelligence that is relevant to serious crime. There were some concerns about the accountability mechanisms applying to this provision. Under the nationality rules which apply to ASIS and DSD, both agencies are required to record instances of collection and reporting on Australians, and provide records to the IGIS. Recommendation 4 will strengthen this accountability mechanism by requiring the responsible minister in relation to ASIS and the responsible minister in relation to DSD to consult with the Attorney-General before making the rules relating to the communication and retention of information concerning Australian persons. 
Clause 14—Liability for certain acts
Clause 14, relating to immunities for both ASIS and DSD, proved to be the most contentious provision in the bill. The committee's scrutiny of this clause was rigorous and thorough. The examination revealed an unintended consequence of clause 14 which would have permitted ASIS to conduct certain activities beyond its requirements. The implementation of recommendation 6 will remove this possibility and provide a framework which ensures that immunities are only granted in cases where an activity is done in the proper performance of a function of the agency. In addition, recommendation 5 requires the development of protocols to guide the operations of clause 14. In particular, recommendation 5 states that clause 14 should not come into effect until the protocols are provided in writing to the IGIS.
Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO and ASIS
I conclude by focusing on the role and the functions of the proposed Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO and ASIS. The history of parliamentary oversight of the Australian intelligence community is a chequered one. The IS Bill, together with the committee's amendments, will herald a new era of parliamentary oversight of Australia's key intelligence agencies. The PJCAA will replace the existing Parliamentary Joint Committee on the ASIO. The PJCAA will examine the administration and expenditure of ASIO and ASIS, and will be required to provide the parliament with an annual report of its activities. In addition, the committee has proposed a range of amendments which enhance parliamentary scrutiny through expanding the powers of the PJCAA. These additional powers include:
the requirement that the Minister advise the Committee of the nature of any direction made under paragraph 6(1)(e) regarding ASIS undertaking such other activities as the responsible Minister directs;
the requirement to be briefed by the IGIS on the protocols relating to clause 14, and the privacy rules made under clause 15; and
the requirement that DSD be subject to scrutiny by the Committee.
The committee's recommendations will enhance the Intelligence Services Bill 2001 by providing an effective accountability framework which will provide confidence for the parliament and the Australian public.
In conclusion, I would like to express the committee's appreciation for the efforts of those who gave evidence to our inquiry. I would especially like to acknowledge the excellent advice and guidance provided by Hilary Penfold, head of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, in the latter stages of the inquiry. I would also like to thank the members of the committee for their time and dedication in conducting this inquiry. Finally, I thank the secretarial staff who were involved in the inquiry: Grant Harrison, Katie Hobson and our inquiry secretary, Stephen Boyd. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,13,2,speech
"Brereton, Laurie, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"— by leave—I am pleased to speak this evening on the report of the Joint Select Committee on Intelligence Services on the Intelligence Services Bill 2001. At the outset can I say that the legislation under review is long overdue. The government has been very slow to implement the 1995 Samuels commission recommendations to put ASIS on a statutory basis and subject to a degree of parliamentary oversight. Foreign Minister Downer has taken more than five years to produce the bill that he eventually introduced into this parliament on 27 June this year.
The Joint Select Committee on Intelligence Services has produced what I think is a valuable bipartisan report. I would like to join with the chairman in thanking all my colleagues on the committee for the constructive approach that they adopted to the work of the committee. Our task was greatly assisted by the chairmanship of the honourable member for Fadden, the excellent work of the committee secretariat and the valuable contributions from the First Parliamentary Counsel, Hilary Penfold QC and from Nathan Hancock of the Parliamentary Library. Labor members of the committee urged the adoption of 11 major recommendations designed to improve the bill and ensure appropriate protection for the privacy and rights of Australians at home and overseas. All our recommendations have been adopted in this report. My remarks tonight will highlight a number of these recommendations which, if adopted by the government, will make the bill much more acceptable than at present. 
The legislation under review is intended to establish a framework for accountability and parliamentary oversight. It also serves in a legal sense to empower ASIS and the DSD to conduct activities in performance of their functions. Whatever the current practice and intentions, this will be a new legal reality within which future decisions about possible overseas intelligence operations will be made.
Sections 6 and 7 of the bill establish the primary functions of ASIS and DSD as obtaining intelligence about the `capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia'. ASIS may also undertake such `other activities' overseas as the responsible minister directs. Section 11(1) provides that the agencies' functions are to be performed `only in the interests of Australia's national security, Australia's foreign relations or Australia's national economic well-being'. These are concepts left undefined in the bill. 
ASIS and DSD will be legally empowered to collect intelligence on foreign persons and organisations overseas and on Australian persons and organisations overseas. The bill makes no distinction between persons or organisations on the basis of nationality other than in the provisions of section 15 relating to the privacy rules.
It needs to be understood that this is a different approach to that taken in the New Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau Bill introduced into the New Zealand parliament in May this year. That legislation authorises New Zealand's signals intelligence agency to collect `foreign intelligence' defined as `information about the capabilities, intentions or activities of a foreign organisation or foreign person'. The New Zealand bill largely, but not totally, excludes New Zealand citizens and organisations from the scope of the GCSB operations.
In evidence to the select committee, ASIS and DSD emphasised that in the normal course of operations neither agency targets Australian citizens overseas. Both agencies stated their purpose is `foreign intelligence' collection, though this is a term not used in the bill. The agencies emphasised the significance of the nationality rules that place constraints on the handling of information relating to Australian citizens that may be obtained incidentally in the course of foreign intelligence collection.
ASIS and DSD did acknowledge, however, that in certain limited circumstances it could be permissible under current practice to collect intelligence on Australian citizens. I put it to the House that very careful consideration needs to be given to the circumstances in which intelligence concerning Australian citizens overseas could be authorised. While it may not be current prac-tice, intelligence collection activities focused on Australian citizens overseas will be permitted under this bill, but the conditions under which this could happen are not properly identified or defined.
It is possible to envisage limited circumstances in which intelligence collection relating to an Australian citizen overseas could be in the national interest—for example, an Australian engaged in espionage or terrorism against Australia. However, reliance on the nationality rules appears to be an insufficient long-term safeguard for the privacy and interests of Australian citizens overseas. This is especially so when comparison is made to the stringent legislative controls on covert intelligence collection by ASIO within Australia for national security purposes.
Accordingly, the select committee recommends that the bill be redrafted to include a specific authorisation process comparable to the special powers provisions of the ASIO Act 1979 for any activities specifically directed towards obtaining intelligence concerning Australian persons or organisations overseas. Any such intelligence should relate to questions of national security and national security alone, and any authorisation should have effect for six months whereupon it would lapse unless renewed by the minister. These provisions would be an important safeguard for the rights and privacy of Australian citizens overseas. 
A definition of the key concept of national security is also required. `Security' is defined in section 4 of the ASIO Act 1979. Drawing upon this precedent and considering the need to cover issues such as people smuggling, `national security,' we believe, should include protecting Australia from espionage, sabotage, politically motivated violence, promotion of communal violence, attacks on Australia's defence system, acts of foreign interference and unauthorised movements of persons or objects across Australia's national borders.
The select committee gave careful consideration to the question of `other activities' which may be conducted by ASIS under section 6(1)(e). Section 6(4) provides that in performing its functions ASIS must not plan for or undertake paramilitary activities or activities involving violence against persons or the use of weapons. Paragraph 6(4) requires clarification through, we believe, the definition of `paramilitary activities.'
Given that section 6(1)(e) will allow the responsible minister to expand the function of ASIS without recourse to legislative change, the committee concludes that a measure of parliamentary scrutiny is appropriate. In addition to providing the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security with a copy of any direction made under section 6(1)(e), the minister should be required to advise the parliamentary committee of the general nature of the `other activity' to be performed by the agency and to do so as soon as practicable after the direction is given. The committee further recommends that any authorisation of `other activities' in relation to Australian citizens or organisations overseas should also be covered by a specific authorisation procedure and be limited to activities which directly enhance or protect Australia's national interest. 
The committee gave lengthy consideration to the immunity provisions contained in section 14 of the bill. Labor members of the committee spent considerable time exploring precisely what activity the immunity provisions could cover and how immunity might work in practice. While the establishment of immunities for actions inside and outside Australia is not without precedent, the controlled operations provisions of the Crimes Act being one example, any legislation of this nature must be approached with caution.
The report makes a number of important recommendations that will significantly narrow the potential scope of the immunities provided by the bill and establish safeguards and protocols for their operation. In this, the committee was assisted by the valuable drafting input from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Amongst other safeguards, the report recommends the bill be amended to make it clear that the immunity provisions do not permit any act inside Australia which ASIO could not do without proper authorisation under the ASIO Act 1979, the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 or the Telecommunications Act 1997. Such a measure will ensure that there is no back door for covert intelligence collection in Australia outside the established legal checks and balances.
The committee further recommends that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security should have the responsibility of certifying that an act has been done in proper performance of the agency's functions and may therefore be covered by the provisions of section 14. Other recommendations urged by Labor and adopted by the committee include provision for the Attorney-General to be consulted in respect of the privacy rules concerning Australian persons and protocols to govern the operation of section 14 immunities provision for the parliamentary committee to be briefed on the privacy rules and immunity protocols, and amendments to the bill to ensure the arrangements for briefing the Leader of the Opposition about ASIS are the same as those relating to ASIO. 
Finally, the committee has adopted our recommendation that the scope of the new Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIS and ASIO be expanded to include DSD. As the report notes, DSD is the most significant defence intelligence collection agency and it is highly desirable that it be subject to oversight by the parliamentary committee. 
The bill as drafted is quite unsatisfactory in its failure to provide adequate safeguards for the rights and privacy of Australian citizens at home and abroad. The bipartisan report of the joint select committee provides a way forward, and I hope that the government will agree to each of the committee's recommendations. The opposition shadow cabinet, our caucus committee on national security and trade and the full caucus will now consider the bill, this report of the select committee and any consequent amendments the government proposes to make. I anticipate that we will then be ready to deal with the bill when it is brought on for debate on Tuesday of the parliament's next sitting week.

"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—by leave—I am delighted to participate in this debate on the report of the Joint Select Committee on Intelligence Services. I commend the chairman and members of the committee, who deliberated long and hard on a number of the provisions and recommendations. I thank the secretariat for their excellent work in presenting the report.
As members would be aware, this report originates from the development of the Intelligence Services Bill 2001 to give statutory recognition to the ASIS operation and the ASIO operation. From having heard the various points of debate over two days, and from my time as a member of the ASIO committee, I have come to understand the fundamental problem facing this parliament in developing a statutory background for both of these organisations. This goes back to the original focus of the IS Bill, where the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, was established by executive direction on 13 May 1952. It was only in 1977 that the government publicly acknowledged the existence of ASIS as Australia's foreign intelligence agency.
The Samuels and Codd report, which was the basis of this legislation—which previous governments had not been prepared to bring to the parliament, but this government did—made some recommendations that the legislative basis for ASIS, which details the level of accountability and oversight, is the basis of this legislation. Other key elements of the IS Bill are the provision for immunities for ASIS and DSD in respect of the proper conduct of their functions, particularly in clause 14, which other members have alluded to; the provisions to protect the privacy of Australians; the creation of a Parliamentary Joint Committee of ASIS and ASIO; and the protection and indemnity of ASIS staff in their operations.
The report refers to the Hope royal commission. The first Hope recommendation is the fundamental aspect of the report:
The fundamental consideration favouring parliamentary sanction for ASIS is that the parliament is the instrument of democratic control of the government in this country, so a statute establishing ASIS is a statute authorising the minister to act to control the service on behalf of the parliament itself, speaking for the people and the ministers responsible to the parliament in a general way for ASIS.
That is the fundamental problem that the committee and the drafter of the legislation are facing. The Samuels and Codd report specifically addressed the problems of ASIS operational control, which has been a problem facing ASIO and the ASIS committee. I quote:
On the contrary, its operational management is well structured and its tactical decisions are thoroughly considered and in major instance subject to external approval. Its operational people are skilled and discreet, and the product it gathers is well regarded by its customers and professional assessors.
The committee looked at this fundamental dilemma. The committee thought that the section D notice in general had not been very effective since 1952. The committee looked fairly carefully at the issue of whether ASIS should include paramilitary activities. It was quite clear from the discussions that that was not included in the statute nor in the intent of the operation. 
As other members have alluded to the House, clause 14 was a major point of discussion by the committee as to how the definition of those persons should be considered. In my assessment, the Inspector-General Intelligence Services indicated that he was not alarmed about clause 14 and stated:
... given that my own office will, on a regular basis, be doing what it does: inspecting the operations of the agencies and ensuring that the capacity for the agencies to undertake these sorts of operations with that kind of immunity is not abused. I think it is fair to say that I have seen no instances of a desire on the part of the agencies to abuse their privileges in the past, and I have every reason to believe that they will not do so in the future. If I observed any instances of that, obviously I would take necessary action.
The problem of clause 14 is a very important aspect of the debate, which the committee deliberated on at great length. I am happy that the Inspector-General will consider these matters carefully. I will confine my remarks to those aspects of the report. I commend the report to the parliament. I commend all those members of the parliament, both House of Representatives and Senate, who participated in a genuine discussion to reach a conclusion on a very sensitive bit of legislation in the hope that these agencies would come under parliamentary control yet be effective in providing intelligence to the Australian community and be responsive and effective in their operational activities on the ground.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,13,2,speech
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—I seek leave to make a statement.
Leave granted.
—I was about to make a short statement but my colleague the member for Chifley wants me to make a long statement. I could be tempted if that were necessary. The member for Kingsford-Smith pulls a face, so who knows. I enjoyed the work of this committee. I compliment, as did my colleague the member for Kingsford-Smith, the work of the committee chairman. It is rather unusual in this place to find that a committee that looked into the affairs of the security apparatuses of Australia could come down with a unanimous report albeit six years later than it probably should have. Five years into the term of this government is a bit of a long time after the recommendation of the royal commission and the follow-ups; nevertheless, better late than never.
Some credit needs to be given to the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on the Intelligence Services, Mr Jull, for his work on the committee. I would also, I think begrudgingly, give some credit to the people who represented the security services on the committee, because they tried to help the committee to achieve the aims that we wanted—which was to ensure that Australians would be given a reasonable satisfaction that their security services were not peering into their lives and that they were not using the immunities that were proposed in this bill that may have allowed them to do that through the back door.
The committee was very much helped in its work by the fact that we had open committee meetings. It is probably the first time in the history of the security services in this country that we have had sitting at one table in an open committee meeting the director of DSD, the director of ASIO and the director of ASIS. It was rather interesting to remember the paranoia in the press about the security services and look at who was sitting in the gallery for that meeting—not many of the lazy journalists who inhabit this building could be bothered to come down and see these people coming out into the light of day. If it had been Britain or Washington where these things take on a little bit of interest, at least one or three of them may have been there. But down here in Australia, they were probably more interested in something that someone could hand out to them to write. The fact that the three directors of those services turned up at a public meeting and argued their case was, for the aficionados, an interesting parliamentary event, but I did not see it in the paper so maybe it never happened. A lot of the credit for having the three directors there goes to the chairman of the committee and the government members were open minded for a change—and Mr Jull certainly was that.
The committee was helped very much by a very enlightening exposition we had from the First Parliamentary Counsel, Hilary Penfold, on one of those interesting afternoons where parliamentary committees come into their own. House of Representatives committees do not often examine legislation. We tend to get up and argue about it, but there is not much in-depth analysis. Maybe our Senate colleagues would tell us they do this all the time, but it proved to be an interesting afternoon for the members of the House of Representatives committee to have this interaction with Ms Penfold and the bureaucrats around the table with Ms Penfold. We saw people arguing for what might be the best approach—all this at a public committee meeting that none of the lazy journalists bothered to come along to. I think that crystallised in a lot of our minds where we should go with this legislation. 
I had a very significant problem with the original legislation that was before the House, in particular clause 14. I have been a member of the ASIO committee for this parliament, and I recall years ago how there was this absolute paranoia in Australia about ASIO—that they were tapping everybody's phone, they were under everybody's bed, they were sharing time with the reds and you never knew who was going to get out in the morning with you. But the Hawke government legislated for a committee to look at ASIO—admittedly, it had very finely drawn terms of reference, including that the Prime Minister had to nominate you and that the Deputy Speaker could not be a member of the committee, which we are fixing in this legislation—and that was progress. Since that time, there has been less criticism of ASIO. I would have been happier if this legislation mirrored the ASIO legislation. One of the exercises that we went through with Ms Penfold was that she gave us some guidance about how this legislation could and, in some areas, could not mirror the ASIO legislation. I went into this as a sceptic, but I am probably at the stage now where I think what she was saying was right.
At the outset, I was very concerned with clause 14 of this legislation, which provided indemnities for ASIS officers who committed crimes against Australian legislation both within Australia and overseas. I was most particularly concerned with paragraph 14 (c) of the proposed legislation which was about `Liabilities for certain acts'. Clause 14 said:
A person—
and that could be any person—
is not subject to any civil or criminal liability for any act done inside Australia if:
	(a)		the act is preparatory to, in support of, or otherwise directly connected with, overseas activities of the agency concerned; and
	(b) 	the act:
	(i) 	involves aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring or otherwise planning or attempting to carry out; or
	(ii)	is otherwise directly connected with;
	some other act outside Australia that would amount to an offence if that other act were committed in Australia; and
	(c)		the act is done in the proper performance of a function of the agency.
It struck me that paragraph (c) would have allowed ASIS people to burgle their way across this country in the same way that some of those famous people in that Spycatcher novel did across the UK without any limitation upon their activities provided that they were acting in accordance with some properly ticked off proposal for ASIS to work outside Australia. Quite frankly, I did not think that was good enough. I think if we passed legislation that would allow the security services to do that, we would be found very wanting by the Australian people for what we had done. Paragraph 2.84 of the report summarises what ASIS said, to their credit, and I hope their sincerity, in evidence to the committee. The report states:
ASIS indicated that the proposed amendments to clause 14 `will narrow the scope of the immunity by excluding acts which do not have such a close  connection as that required by subclause (b)(i).' In particular, ASIS emphasise that paragraphs 14(2) (a) and (c) `make it clear that any act which was outside the agencies' specific statutory functions would not be covered by the immunity.'
Both their assurances—and I am not taking their assurances at face value—and the proposals that were also put forward by the parliamentary counsel and are recommended in this committee's report show that, if the government does pick up the recommendations of the committee, we will be closing off the opportunity that people would have to use ASIS's legislation to pursue activities against Australian citizens here in Australia. I think the proposals in the current legislation in clause 14 are not good enough; but, if the government is willing to pick up the unanimous recommendations of the committee about changes to clause 14 and changes to the limits of the immunities that will be provided to ASIS agents, we are then at least trying to mirror, in some of the provisions of this act, the provisions that are in the ASIO Act. ASIS said to the committee that they themselves would not be carrying out these functions in Australia and, indeed, if they needed to carry out functions such as that, they would use ASIO and ASIO warrants to do it. They also said that they would enter into a protocol with the Inspector-General of Security that would bind them to do that. If ASIS do that, I think that is also progress. 
I commend the report to the House and I particularly commend the report to the government, because, as both the member for Kingsford-Smith and the member for Fadden have said, these are unanimous recommendations of the committee, recommendations which will move us on to a position where the rights of Australians will be protected and the proper obligations of the security services will be able to be taken into account and where we will have a parliamentary committee overseeing not just ASIO but also ASIS and DSD. If we do that, at least the people of this country can be sure that someone is keeping an eye on where these things are going. If we can lower the paranoia that there might be about the activities of the security services to the same extent that the changes we have made to the way ASIO works have lowered some of the paranoia there, then we have done some good work and have also protected the rights of Australian citizens. So I would commend the committee's report to the House and the government. I look forward to seeing whether the government has picked up the recommendations of the committee when we discuss the legislation shortly.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,13,2,speech
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—by leave— At the outset of my remarks on the advisory report of the Joint Select Committee on the Intelligence Services on the Intelligence Services Bill 2001, the Intelligence Services (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 and certain parts of the Cybercrime Bill 2001, I endorse the comments made by the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Fadden, and the deputy chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, and also those made by the honourable member for Watson, which went to a lot of the details that are in the report. I will not go into the detail of the contents of the report. Suffice it to say that the report that has been presented to the parliament is a unanimous report with 18 recommendations, and I would strongly urge the government to pick up each and every one of those recommendations. The thing that I liked about the committee was that the committee looked at the legislation on its merits and did not break up along party political lines. We came to a unanimous conclusion in relation to each of these matters.
There is no doubt that we are entering new territory with these bills before the House. I must say that, from my point of view, the thing that guided me was the question: who guards the guard while the guard guards you? Each of these recommendations will, I believe, if picked up by the government, in effect be able to answer that question in such a way that the Australian community and the international community in general can say that we have in a delicate situation got the balance right. I must say that there is a bit of history and form here. There are a number of cases that have gone to the High Court, and it is pretty clear that the agencies have to operate within the law. In relation to these bills, there are certainly, in terms of the way the current bills are drafted, some unintended consequences that have been identified. The immunities are too broad. Everyone accepts that, and I do not think there is anyone on the committee that would support the bill in its current form.
What I think we do is establish with our recommendations an accountability regime that certainly allows the agencies to get on with their proper business and to follow, in effect, the policies that it is fair to say both sides of the House do agree with. We might not like it all, but it has to be done—that is the real world. But we do not abrogate our responsibilities. The committee's recommendations significantly provide some safeguards, in particular to the narrowing of clause 14. The recommendations also provide for parliamentary oversight, in particular of the Defence Services Directorate, and allow the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to play a key role in certifying whether acts have been done in the proper performance of the functions of the agencies. It is a very important step for DSD to be brought under a parliamentary committee, and obviously over time the committee will have a more substantial role than the current ASIO committee. 
I certainly commend this report to the parliament and to the government. I want to congratulate the chairman and the deputy chairman who between them, quite frankly, were the main driving force in relation to these recommendations. That is the way it is. We all played our roles as a committee. I congratulate the secretariat and the agencies for the way they conducted themselves. I also want to strongly commend to this House, again, the First Parliamentary Counsel, Hilary Penfold, whom we have had before the House of Representatives legal committee in the past. She did a brilliant job on short notice for the committee. The Parliamentary Library, Nathan Hancock in particular, again were outstanding. The parliament is well served by its servants. I commend the advisory report to the House and to the government.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,13,2,speech
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2001-08-27,"—I move:
	Clause 29, page 33 (lines 3-4), omit paragraph (a).
This clause to the Workplace Relations (Registered Organisations) Bill 2001 seems fairly innocuous. I had discussions with the opposition spokesman and others concerning it. It is not a clause that has ever been used in the past, and it is not a clause that should be in issue. I was most taken aback some time ago when legislation was drafted to introduce the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, which was opposed by an awful lot of government members. 
Clause 29 allows arbitration tribunals to have discretion to use exactly the same powers which were overwhelmingly rejected by the joint party room, and I am sure that they would have been overwhelmingly objected to by the opposition in this place as well, and so they should be. Clause 29 dates back a long way, and it was agreed to under the influence of feelings about the free trade between the states. It also has the same free trade globalisation effect that many of us in this place object to strongly. Whilst it has not been an issue in the past, today many people who are associated with government in Australia, in the public service in the states as well as in this federal place, feel strongly about free trade, free markets and globalisation and they consider that clause 29 would give the courts powers that, frankly, I just would not like to see them have.
In days past in the United States, trade unions banned any goods from Cuba. The trade unions in the United States are very patriotic organisations—blue-collar patriots, if you like. In Australia, we had trade unions opposing goods coming in from Germany in the 1930s because the Germans were participating in the overthrow of the socialist government in Spain. When I was on 24-hour call-up to go to Indonesia and, later on, to Vietnam as one of those stand-by militia, Sweden, under the influence of the trade unions and to an extent as a result of direct action of the trade unions, banned the provision of Carl Gustaf anti-tank rockets to the Australian Army. 
This idea that trade unions can intervene and stop trade for some purpose in Australia and in New Zealand, where trade unions banned French goods for a time because of nuclear testing, has real teeth and it is clothed in reality. I have given a number of historical examples to illustrate that fact. In the current age where we have runaway best sellers such as Naomi Klein's No Logo: Taking aim at the brand bullies and John Ralston Saul's The Unconscious Civilisation, it is clear that the Canadians appreciate far more the relationship between the South American countries and the United States. I think that relationship was best defined with the United Fruit Packaging Company. Every time that a South American government tried to put up the price of its fruit, the United States government would suddenly decide that that South American government were communists and they would send in the marines and overthrow that state's duly elected government.
We are moving into a period in our history where more and more the Australian economy will be dominated by the big American corporations, whether it is the United Fruit Packaging Company, now known as Jaquita, or ConAgra in meat processing, or in relation to the oft-mooted takeover of Woolworths by Wal-Mart from the United States. We will be moving into a situation where it becomes very real to us. I have said on many occasions that I am very worried that if we go any further than we have gone in industrial relations in Australia, there will be a very definite undermining of the workers' right to collectively bargain. That is not something that people on either side of this House would agree to.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—I do not wish to speak at length on this matter, but out of respect for the member for Kennedy I should indicate that the government does not support his amendment. The particular provision has been in legislation since the 1970s. It has been the view of governments of both political persuasions that industrial action which seriously interferes with Australia's international trade should potentially at least be a ground for union deregistration. As the member says, this is not something that has ever been pursued; nevertheless, it should be there in case because Australia lives by trade. Trade is in our national interest. None of us would enjoy our prosperity were it not for the international trade which is the foundation of our economy. This is true for people in all parts of Australia. Whether we are directly dependent on international trade or whether we are indirectly dependent on it, this nation relies on it. Whether we be living in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Mount Isa, Townsville or Mareeba, we depend upon international trade and it would be quite wrong to allow our international trade to be jeopardised in the way the member for Kennedy suggests. So, with great respect to the member and with sympathy for his feelings for some of his constituents who he feels, I think on the whole misguidedly, have been damaged by international trade, the government opposes this amendment.

I do not think that there will be a need for exhaustive debate on these matters, given the position that I now understand the government has adopted in relation to the amendments. However, I should refer to a couple of the key points associated with these amendments.
Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6 deal principally with the bill's intention of creating new unions and making it easier to create new unions, and also making it easier to disamalgamate from organisations which are part of an amalgamated organisation. It seems very strange that the government has sought in the bill to include in the principal objects of the act to:
Facilitate the registration of a diverse range of organisations of employers and of employees that are representative of their members that are able to operate effectively in the workplace relations system.
Anybody with any knowledge of the history of industrial relations would know how destructive of the industrial relations system it is to have demarcation disputes. Nothing would generate more demarcation disputes than encouraging a wide diversity of unions that would inevitably present that problem. It seemed odd to me at the time that the government would want to go down that path. Irrespective of whether they sought the counsel of unions or the counsel of employers on that point, both would give a pretty clear answer. We were concerned about that and therefore moved the amendments, some of which I have just referred to. I am pleased that it seems that the government is of a mind to support them.
The removal of the object of encouraging members to participate in the organisation's affairs was also a peculiar provision of the bill. I do not understand why the government would not want members of a union to be encouraged to actually participate in the democratic processes of the union. I can understand why the government may say for philosophical reasons that they do not want people to be in a union at all. However, when people have actually joined a union, it just does not make sense that the legislation should change things, as was proposed in the bill, so that people would not be encouraged by the industrial relations system to participate more fully in it. Labor does not support the proliferation of enterprise unions, and we do not support promoting easier access to disamalgamations. We viewed those new objects with a great deal of concern—hence our amendments Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6 that have been moved in my name. 
Amendment No. 2 is a straightforward enough issue that deals with the operation of union ballots. The government sought to rely upon recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, but in doing so it selectively chose which parts of the recommendations of that committee to adopt. We have in this amendment fully and fairly reflected the wishes of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Instead of endeavouring to skew the outcome, as I believe the bill originally did, the amendments proposed by us ensure that the recommendations from the joint standing committee are properly dealt with, as they should be. It did strike me as odd that the government would take that view in regard to a parliamentary committee on which it has a majority. This is a government controlled committee, and it was not even willing to include the recommendations of its own government controlled committee in the bill. I am pleased that it now seems willing to accept that by way of the amendments that have been moved in my name.
There is a series of amendments that deal with the bill's proposal to make it easy to deregister unions and also to attack unions. They are amendments Nos 4, 14 and 12. I just quickly want to refer to a couple of aspects of those; I will not take up too much more time of the House. Our amendment No. 4 deals with the removal of the new provisions relating to the cancellation of registration. We reinsert in the legislation the existing provisions. (Extension of time granted) In this case, as with nearly all of the other amendments that we are moving, we have taken the view that the parliament should retain in the legislation the existing provisions of the 1996 act—that is, our amendments in many of these cases seek to reinsert what is already there. That is not Labor's law. This is not the provision that we would introduce were we in government, but we took a fairly pragmatic view of the situation confronting the parliament, not to mention the realistic appraisal of the resources available to an opposition in seeking to draft a complex bill of this kind. In doing that, we have put before the parliament amendments that maintain the status quo. From that perspective, it is not asking the government to go a long way, frankly. It is simply asking the government to accept what is already in the legislation, rather than pursuing a further agenda down the path which they set with their first wave, then their failed second wave and, as this bill in its earlier draft form would have engendered, a quite dramatic further leap down the road to undermining the rights of workers to collectively organise.
The bill as it stands seeks to extend the grounds for cancellation of registration to include noncompliance with any court order, an order made under section 298U of the Workplace Relations Act, and a range of other provisions—an order made under section 21 and subsection 128. It also includes an order of the Federal Court under subsection 315(5). These provisions are deliberately widely cast to maximise the opportunities to deregister unions. They go well beyond the existing provisions and, in our view, are designed frankly to create a whole series of traps for organisations to unwittingly walk into at a later time.
Our amendment No. 12 refers to clause 277 of the bill, which creates a criminal offence for breaches of a duty of good faith or the use of a position or information in relation to the financial management of a registered organisation. One of the things that the government has misunderstood in the operations of industrial relations is that officers of unions by definition include people who are members of a union conference or council and are therefore honorary people—that is, they spend most of their time as policemen or as electricians or as teachers or whatever, but for a day or two a year they come along as elected representatives to a union conference as members of that union conference. They are treated here as if they were company directors and, effectively, the obligations that are applied to company directors were being applied to those individuals. That is a very excessive application of the law to people who are simply undertaking what amounts to a useful community role on behalf of the people in their workplace. Clause 277 we think extended the reach unreasonably to those people.  
Our amendment 14 removes clause 303 and reinserts the current provisions relating to the granting of financial assistance. That was an interesting provision because, for reasons best known to itself, the government wanted to make it easier—more readily available—for people to get legal aid in order to take actions on internal union matters. At a time when legal aid is hard to come by for those in the general community who are in need of legal aid to deal with criminal matters, family matters or personal litigation, it does seem strange that the government would want to extend the availability of legal aid to those involved in internal union arguments. But that is in fact what the government's bill was proposing to do. I am glad that the government has now taken a different attitude to that or at least is willing to accept a different outcome from that.
The final reference that I might make is in relation to union dues and arrears, which is the subject of our amendments 9 and 10. The government has proposed to insert a provision which to us is totally superfluous. There is already a prohibition on unions claiming more than one year's arrears. (Extension of time granted) I was rather taken aback by the comments of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business in his second reading speech, I think it was, where he referred to a case where, allegedly, a union sought to recover union dues ranging back through a number of years. I am sure, as his advisers would tell him, that is beyond the scope of the act and any rule in a union that purported to give it that power would of course not stand up under any challenge. I am not quite sure why the government wanted to pursue this particular amendment, but in any event I have moved our amendments that would remove those provisions from the bill, and again I am pleased that the government has indicated a willingness to accept those amendments.
In all, I have moved 14 amendments to the bill during this consideration in detail. There was a second reading amendment which the government is not in a position, I believe, at this stage to accept. That second reading amendment was, as I said in my address on the second reading, a threshold issue for us. We do not believe it is desirable that there be two acts of parliament established to deal with these matters: industrial relations should not be decimated or fragmented. Organisations are an integral part of the industrial relations system and they should be covered in the same piece of legislation. I am very pleased that the government has seen its way clear to accept the amendments in detail. I would hope that the minister and his advisers may be able to look again at the prospect of whether or not these new provisions could be contained within the one piece of legislation. We would then find ourselves in complete agreement, which would be a very odd event in this place in recent years on industrial relations. But I understand that there are some complexities in that task and that is obviously a matter for some further consideration.
But we have endeavoured to be realistic in the way in which we have approached this bill. I acknowledge that the government have amended their exposure draft enormously between last year and when the bill appeared in the parliament, and I appreciate that, since this bill appeared, the government have been willing to accept virtually all of our amendments in detail. For that, I thank them.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS (REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—I rise to support the 14 amendments moved by the shadow minister, which I am pleased to see have got the agreement of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, the member for Warringah. It is appropriate perhaps to take the opportunity in debating a bill which is about trade unions, the Workplace Relations (Registered Organisations) Bill 2001, to place on record the important role played by trade unions in Australia. I want to particularly refer to workers in the biggest factory in my electorate, a factory that is now very well known. It is called Tristar and it is in the industrial area of Marrickville, an area that I am proud to represent and I am proud to indeed call my home. 
Today, I tabled a petition in the House signed by 197 employees of Tristar which said that it:
... draws to the attention of the House our strongest objection to comments made by Tony Abbott, Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business during the recent industrial dispute, in particular, that we were `guilty of treason' and `traitors' for exercising our right to take lawful industrial action to protect our accrued employee entitlements.
We believe that the comments by the Minister were unfair to workers at Tri Star who are legitimately concerned about the protection of their accrued entitlements and who were lawfully pursuing the protection of those entitlements under the Workplace Relations legislation established by the Coalition Government. We also believe that his comments were an attempt to escalate and prolong the industrial dispute in order for the Federal Government to use it in their attacks against the Australian Union movement.
Your petitioners therefore request that the House call upon the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business to withdraw the statements he made about the workers at Tri Star and offer a public apology to the workers at Tri Star and their families.
I think what that petition draws to our attention is that as politicians all of us are involved in the cut and thrust of political debate. What those of us who might be critical of leaders of trade unions or leaders of employer organisations or political parties should be very careful about is that we do not brand people who are working-class Australians and who are merely defending what are their entitlements.
Just down the road, also in Marrickville, there was a company called Champion Printing. I attended the picket line twice there. It was a company which employed some 45 people, represented by the AMWU like the workers at Tristar. They arrived at work one day and were told that they no longer had jobs, and they were marched off the site by a security firm. They were owed two weeks pay and all their entitlements, totalling over half a million dollars. Those workers received nothing. Those workers were in a position where they were concerned about where their next meal was coming from.
We hear a lot of rhetoric about the importance of the family and keeping families together. I would suggest that, as the minister has stated, having a job is very important for the structure of our society and for social structures including the family. Those workers, whether they be at Champion Printing— after the event, on a picket line trying to stop the problem of losing their entitlements—or at Tristar, deserve our respect, and we need to be very careful about the language we use and to ensure that workers are not used as political footballs. I believe that the AMWU and Doug Cameron provided enormous leadership in representing the workers at Tristar. A few years ago, I sat down and worked out a plan to give Tristar, when it was TRW, 24-hour operations in consultation with Marrickville Council, to make sure that the company stayed onshore in Australia. I commend the amendments to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS (REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2001-08-27,"—In addressing the amendments before the House on the Workplace Relations (Registered Organisations) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001, the opposition spokesman spoke about the proliferation and formation of smaller unions. These can be very destabilising in the industrial environment and, whilst there is no doubt that the remarks he made are correct, it must be realised that a lot of union members—including the ones that I represent—are very remote geographically and, I might add, tribally and organisationally, from the people who lead and control these unions who are based in Brisbane or even in Sydney. In some unions you have shearers—a very tough, rough and ready lot at the best of times and men who are used to hardship—and you have a lot of people who are virtually computer operators. If you have groups that are so completely different and one group controls that union, the interests of the smaller group are going to be very subservient to the interests of the larger group. Anyone who has had any experience with trade unions would realise the sort of problem I am talking about. 
Today this is exacerbated dramatically by the fact that the trade unions, with a shrinking membership, are desperately seeking site coverage. To secure site coverage, they enter into very close relationships with big corporations. The classic case that is quoted in the mining fields of Australia is fly-in mining, which of course is enormously destructive of family life, enormously destructive of Christian values, and, quite frankly, enormously destructive of mining operations. The huge increase in fatalities and mining accidents came in the four years after the introduction of fly-in mining. 
Whilst I fully agree with the remarks made by the opposition spokesman, it must be realised by the opposition and by the government that we have potentially very serious situations arising. A really big employer in my electorate, Colonial Sugar Refining, is up for sale and could at any time be bought by foreign bidders—and there is at least one big foreign company interested in buying them up. Most of our cooperative mills have been taken over by a foreign company, Finasucre, and of course probably the bulk of our mining jobs at the present are in foreign hands. 
If the trade unionists take action to improve their lot or to protect themselves, and suddenly they are heavied by a foreign corporation, and the foreign corporation is able to use section 29 as their argument, then I feel that we could have an awful lot of problems arising from that particular section. If it is so superfluous and has not been needed in the past, one would ask why it is needed now.
We have trade unions in my electorate, and there is a good case for saying that sometimes we would be better served by a locally based trade union grouping with a number of industries. But of course the free trade policies have simply closed down whole industries. The tobacco industry has closed down, dairying has had dreadful damage done to it, and the maize board is now in the hands of the receiver in my area. With the beef industry, we are allowed 7,000 tonnes into Europe and people talk about free trade. With sugar, when the world price of sugar drops clean in half and the Europeans simply double the price, people must realise when they make these statements that people are laughing at them. I would plead with them not to make those sorts of statements out where we produce the export dollars, because there may be a very angry reaction.
Whilst I accept the arguments of both the government and the opposition about smaller, more natural, more localised trade unions, I ask both sides of the House to realise that there are occasions when our interests are totally subservient to a huge union that is totally unreactive to the local people.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—As has been said on previous occasions in the course of debating the Workplace Relations (Registered Organisations) Bill 2001, the government's intention all along was not to introduce a bill on contentious matters but to introduce a bill which is, as far as is humanly possible, an expression of the consensus of all the people with an interest in the regulation of registered organisations. For that reason, the government has been prepared at every step in this process to consider and, as far as is humanly possible, to take into account all the various concerns that have been put to us by trade unions and others and, most recently, by members opposite. 
I am disappointed that the opposition has not been prepared to accept the government's proposals to provide for further disamalgamations of unions and the government's proposals to provide legal aid to those who take on the might and power of large trade unions. Nevertheless, in the interests of having a bill which is an improvement in the governance of these organisations, I am prepared to cooperate in this matter. I am not sure that the opposition's amendments improve the bill, but they certainly do not destroy it. As the member for Brisbane has pointed out, where the opposition has disagreed with the government, it has simply restored the status quo. On that basis, it is right that the government should allow this bill to be amended along these lines on the principle that a small step forward is better than no progress at all and on the principle that it is better to have something rather than nothing. 
The member for Brisbane has indicated that he would like the government to look further at the question of rebundling the act. I do not promise that we will do that, because it is a complex piece of drafting that is required and time is very limited. Nevertheless, if it can be done, we will certainly have a look at it because, having gone down the path of trying where possible to do things by as near to consensus as we can, I do not want to depart from that path. I also want to maximise the chance of getting this bill passed—a bill that will advance the governance of these organisations—this side of an election.
In conclusion, I thank the member for Brisbane for the constructive approach that he has taken. I am delighted that we have been able to agree, if not on everything, at least on some significant changes to improve the way these organisations operate. I commend the bill to the House and present the supplementary explanatory memorandum.

These amendments are highly technical amendments and cover a number of subjects. These amendments are designed to clarify that the government does, in fact, bear the cost of any disamalgamation ballot that takes place, will insert reasonable excuse defences in relation to strict liability offence provisions and will clarify the intended operation of the relevant part of the act to provide for access by members to the financial records of reporting units.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to. 
Again, it is just a very short process. I know that we are very short of time. The passage of the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001 and its related bills marks the implementation of the final major part of the 1997 Wallis report. It completes the major reform of the financial services industry in Australia that now represents more than seven per cent of the Australian economy and employs more than 330,000 people. The bill proposes three key reforms: a harmonised licensing disclosure and conduct framework for all financial service providers, a consistent and comparable framework for financial product disclosure, and a streamlined regulatory regime for financial markets and clearing and settlement systems. It will introduce a consistent framework of consumer protection across the financial services industry and, at the same time, it will cut compliance costs and remove regulatory barriers to the introduction of technological innovations. 
This bill has been subject to widespread consultation processes over the past three years. The government is very grateful to everyone who has taken the time and the trouble to provide feedback on the provisions of the bill. The process is continuing with a current round of consultation on the draft regulations to be made under the bill. In addition, these provisions have twice been considered by the Parliament Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities. I would like to thank all the members of that committee, including the chairman, Senator Chapman, and the secretariat, for their work on the FSR Bill. 
There were a number of amendments made in the Senate. Many of the amendments made by the government in the Senate were of a minor and technical nature and were intended to clarify the operation of the proposed new arrangements. A number of the amendments which were moved were the product of continued consultation between the government and stakeholders that has taken place since the introduction of the bill. The government amendments address a number of areas of concern and there are a number of issues to be dealt with. They cover the concerns of the PJC about the impact of the bill on insurance agents. The amendments made in the Senate will allow insurance agents more time to set in place arrangements for a transition into the new regime and will provide more flexibility in establishing arrangements with licensees. The amendments will clarify that contractual entitlements for remuneration will continue after the commencement of the bill. A media exemption has been inserted in the bill to ensure that media organisations will not require a licence to publish or broadcast information that falls within the definition of general financial product advice.
Finally, provisions of the bill that relate to telephone monitoring in the context of takeover bids will be narrowed so that they apply only to calls made to retail investors. This amendment will ensure that these provisions provide protection for retail investors while not impeding the activities of institutional and professional investors in the wholesale market.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2001-08-27,"—I wish to bring to this House's attention tonight a matter concerning the display of a large billboard advertisement on Parramatta Road near the intersection of Mosely Street, Strathfield during the months of July and August. The advertisement was for a product called Four Seasons(R) Condoms and depicted pictures of three sizes of condoms that are within that trade marked product range. I say `trade marked' by virtue of the existence of the symbol R with a circle being one of the symbols depicting a registered trademark.
What is significant about this advertisement is the location of the billboard—that is, it is directly adjacent to St Andrew's Anglican Church, Strathfield. The proximity of the advertisement to the church raised immediate concerns from the parish secretary, Mrs Yvonne Coorey, the parish rector, Reverend John Woo, and many parishioners. Reverend John Woo first raised the objection to the existence of the billboard with the Advertising Standards Board. I quote from the ASB's letter to Reverend Woo, dated 23 July 2001. The letter says in part:
I should mention that it is not the role of the ASB to determine the issue of whether outdoor advertisements for condoms should or should not be permitted in this country. This is a matter for the Parliaments of Australia. You may wish to express your concerns in this regard to your local Member of Parliament.
The situation is such that the board showed its true colours by exhibiting a definite moral standard in choosing not to answer the question of whether advertisements for condoms should or should not be permitted in this location. With respect, that is not the question. There are in fact two questions: firstly, what moral code does the Commonwealth government bring to play in the enforcement of standards in any kind in civic society; secondly, was the advertisement sensitive to public morality? 
I refer to a letter on this issue from the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, Professor Peter Sheehan, dated 21 August 2001, addressed to me. Professor Sheehan is a person with some 20 years professional experience in censorship in Australia. He notes:
There is a tension between prevailing public morality and the perspectives of those who are offended. I think the advertisement for condoms next to a church illustrates that tension well. To my mind, guidelines should be sensitive to such tension. The billboard shown in your material may not be explicit, but it should not have been placed there. It is an example, I am afraid, of holding legitimate moral perspectives up to public ridicule.
I refer to the advertisement holding out that the product is a registered trademark. The ASB's letter says:
Thank you for your letter dated 20 July 2001 complaining about an advertisement for Australian Therapeutic Supplies Pty Ltd's Four Seasons condoms.
A reasonable person would therefore assume that Australian Therapeutic Supplies Pty Ltd was the owner of the product called Four Seasons Condoms and that this corporation was the registered trademark holder of this product. Not so, Mr Speaker. A recent search with IP Australia through a trademark examiner revealed that the words `Four Seasons' in the context of the word `condom' is actually the registered trademark of a Mr Graham William Porter.
I refer to the Australian Association of National Advertisers Code of Ethics, which has as its first code, numbered 1.1:
Advertisements shall comply with Commonwealth law and the law of the relevant State or Territory.
We have here a situation where the advertiser differs from the registered trademark holder of the product name. Further, the ASB is a self-regulator acting under the auspices of state government jurisdiction on the matter of advertising. The simple truth here is that there is effectively no regulation of advertising.
Following the ASB's puerile response to Reverend Woo, I tabled question on notice No. 2866 in this House on 20 August 2001. The question goes to the operation of enforcement of Commonwealth law, in this case the Trade Marks Act 1995. On the substantive issue of whether it was proper to exhibit a condom ad next to a church, the ASB morally predetermined the matter by saying all at once that the advertisement was moral, therefore licit to be exhibited. Too bad for those churchgoers or other people offended by the advertisement and/or its location. Instead, the ASB saw fit to recommend that a complainant should express their concerns in this regard to their local member of parliament—a true cop-out, a triumph for obfuscation. In this instance, the ASB is truly holding the public to ridicule. The ASB is merely pandering to those sectional interests that would deny the existence of any regulation. They are anarcho-capitalists that would advocate no regulation at all, owing no moral obligation and no obligation at all other than to their own profit.
In this billboard case, the ASB breached its own AANA advertising standards by misleading Reverend Woo and his parishioners by implying that the advertiser and the registered trademark holder were one and the same person. Further, the ASB failed to accommodate prevailing public morality, failed to demonstrate due diligence in ensuring the said advertisement complied with Commonwealth and state law and further disparaged an alternative moral perspective.
I condemn the ASB for their obfuscation. The ASB's letter was misleading in that it implied that the registered trademark was of a person other than Australian Therapeutic Supplies Pty Ltd. In this case, I support the observations of Professor Sheehan in calling for regulations that accommodate public sensitivity in relation to the positioning of billboard advertisements.

(1)	Did he receive the necessary supporting documentation from the NSW Government in August 1999 for the provision of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner for Liverpool Hospital under the Federal Adjustment and Relocation Scheme.
(2)	Did he state in a press release dated 23 December 1998 that subject to the supporting documentation, he expected the hospital to have an MRI as soon as possible.
(3)	Has he delayed the approval of funding for an MRI scanner for Liverpool Hospital under the Scheme; if so, why.

"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,2001-08-27,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
(1)	No. An application was provided to the Department, however it did not meet the full eligibility criteria.
(2)	Yes.
(3)	No. Despite the issue of the MRI Adjustment and Relocation Scheme being put on hold pending the outcome of the Blandford Review of MRI, the funding would not have been approved, as the application did not meet the necessary eligibility criteria.
(4)	I have recently appointed the MRI Monitoring and Evaluation Group. Part of their charter is to revise the original Adjustment and Relocation Scheme in order to provide incentives for eligible MRI units to be relocated to tertiary referral hospitals without one. The Blandford MRI Review also recommended that up to seven additional units be recognised for eligibility. These are to be located in areas that are comparatively under-serviced and a tendering process will be used to determine these locations. While the specific criteria have not yet been established, Liverpool Hospital may well qualify under one or both of the schemes outlined above.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: MRI Machines</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,22,1,answer
